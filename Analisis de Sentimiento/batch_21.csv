908.Titanfall,"Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!. Really interesting mechanics with the Titans, which were fun to use. Good, not amazing.. Awesome gameplay, one of my favorite fps to play online.10 out of 10 . Can't wait for titanfall 3. So the core gameplay is generally fun and all the maps are fairly well designed but it does not have too much to offer. The sequel was for sure way better but still was fun at the time. The titan gameplay was a bit clunky.. Good game. Unmatched gameplay and combat mechanics in the industry. It just needed a campaign, which the second game gave us. Love Titanfall!. Even without a story, Titanfall introduces great lore to keep the player interested in its environment.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 7 Music: 5 Story: 5 Total: 6.83. one of a kind for it's release period, currently there are better titles out there. The gaming market is flooded with mediocre online FPS. But Titanfall does a great job. It has many fresh ideas and did set standards for future shooter games. Although the gameplay quickly becomes a bit repetitive, the game is great fun!. It was a great new IP for the time. Even lacking the single-player campaign, the game was fun to play.. Great game, great developers. I would say this is the greatest FPS game I played on the console. Every single game is challenging. Challenging gameplay, good graphics. Playing with friends makes it so cool. Poor servers. AI makes the experience a little bit **** campaign.. Titanfall's gameplay holds up as one of the best found in the FPS genre within the last decade, with plenty of inspiration and creativity thrown into the mix. Respawn are clearly very talented game developers and know what it takes to make a game actually fun, however the game is held back by its lack of variety and customisation.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. great game and one of my favorites when I played on my xbox one. Great FPS and not a big fan of FPS games.. this game is good even if it really lake a solo compaigne but still its multiplayer is really quick and awessome i spent more than 1k hours on it thinjk that it was one of the best 2014 games. What a massive disappointment this one was.. No campaign and barely anything in the multiplayer bring this one down big time. Whats there is good and fun, but that doesn't last too long.. Developed by the ex-Infinity Ward developers who crafted some of the best Call of Duty titles, Titanfall had the potential to put it's foot down and establish a new genre that could outdo the major FPS franchises that roam the industry today. But it failed to do that. Don't get me wrong, I think this game was solidly crafted, the gun-play is fast, smooth, and responsive. The parkour mechanics are great, and fun to maneuver with. The Titans are a blast to control, and the game is balanced, like a good shooter SHOULD be. But.... The campaign is lackluster, quite bad frankly, and there are barely any game-modes to choose from. Titanfall has good potential, but didn't quite make the leap it needed to put a new, challenging franchise on the map.. Great game with a bunch of fun multiplayer modes! I was addicted the first time I played this! The game is so fun, and the titans really enhance the experience, in a positive way for me. You can obviously customize your loadout, and there are 3 different titans to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Overall, I highly recommend this game.. This is the best online multiplayer FPS I've ever played and personally am not bothered by the lack of a campaign. The Online maps are EXTREMELY well designed, the experience when you first play feels surreal with the giant titans roaming the maps. I love just about everything about this game, and with the addition of a ranking system, I feel the game has a competitive edge over other more casual FPS titles.. The game is pretty fun to play with friends online. Not quite the best multiplayer experience out there but still worth a look, especially with how cheap you can now get the complete game for.. One of my favourite game. It would be better with more weapon but it's still very funny. Wall run is awesome as the fights between titans but I think the game has been over hyped.. In a word: Meh Played a grand total of maybe 5 hours over the span of a week and really just wasn't feeling it. Not terrible, but nothing to write home about either.. Better on PC, but this game was the best new IP this generation. it is a shame how respawn ruined this franchise with it's awful sequel spinoff. Do not buy Titanfall 2. Instead support this game and show the AAA industry that we won't take their crap anymore.. This is a great game that is unique in its own way. The wall running and double jumping makes travel so much easier and brings out the acrobatic skills in a player. This game brings out different ways to wipe out the enemy whether it's shooting, smashing, or vaporizing the enemy. The multi-player is great, but the fact that there is no story mode is a bummer. The variety of maps bring out the best of players and tests their skills pushing their talents to the limit. There could be more options for weapons for both pilots and titans but the fast-paced action is something that doesn't get old.. I have never played a shooting game like this one. I'm disappointed because it doesn't get the recognition it deserves, if you aren't a COD fanboy then you will enjoy this game, I enjoy a variety of shooters and this one really reminds me of Halo but with its own twist of Titans. I really hope this game will rise to the likes of COD or Halo, I noticed the game was always priced cheap in my area, and when I finally bought it for 5 dollars (yes 5 dollars and sealed) I realized that my expectations were so low because of its price. If you enjoy Halo you will definitely enjoy this, or well at least I do. I will definitely purchase the second game when it comes out in a few months and I'm hoping that in the future there will be visual character customization like in Halo Reach. My only complaint is the HUD is either LARGE or small, no in between, other than though you should really consider this game and don't be fooled by the company or anything at all. Just give it some thought when you play and compare it to the likeness of other shooters.. Titanfall is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. + Fun Multiplayer - Campaign - Few Modes. I found this game at GameStop for under $10, and Titanfall is worth the price. While the game takes place in a futuristic setting, it is not ruined by gimmicks and unfair advantages (unlike Black Ops 3.) As a shooter, it is fun and satisfying, but the mech battles are the best part of the game. You can pilot your titan, make your titan follow and defend you, or ride on other people's titans. There are plenty of modes to choose from, but my favorites are Attrition (team deathmatch) and capture the flag. The game has two problems though. The first is that in every match, along with the human players there are AI players, which are very easy to kill and are kind of annoying. I would prefer an entirely human lobby. Second, there is no free for all mode. That is a disappointment, but for $8, Titanfall is absolutely worth it.. Varied weapons, different style of movement, fun modes, customized Titans, and sadly no offline mode. It's a great multiplayer game, with tons of interesting ideas to bring to the table, but it severely lacks in the offline department. Titanfall is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. + Fun Multiplayer - Campaign - Few Modes. You may call this cod with titan robots in it, but it is a totally different game. Its got great new gameplay with you running on walls, pretty cool. The multiplayer has new modes that cod doesn't, plus when you take control of a titan, it feels massively great.. Just awesome!.......................................................................................................................................... As an off shoot from COD, thos is a far, far better game than it. The wall runs take skill, and reward you with good map positioning, the maps are large enough hat surprising someone is always an option. The titans dont add much, but, a little bit of newb slaying is hardly ever a bad thing. Really, shows all the recent COD installments to be the joke that they are, this is a far better game. After the disappointing Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, the Xbox One finally has a top shooter, which listens to the name of Titanfall. Respawn hit it out of the park with this fantastic multiplayer experience. It looks and plays great, its levels are varied and challenging, and the use of the titans is hugely entertaining. If you own an Xbox One or high end PC, you should own this game.. Although this game (much like other multiplayer focused games) is lacking in content,the game play is what saves this game and it's easily my favorite FPS of 2014 but that's not saying much but I am very excited for the sequel coming out 2017. Check it out if you have some spare cash.. Titanfall was an alright game. Just alright. It was a multiplayer game (with free DLC mind you) that didn't try to be anything it wasn't. Giant mechs fighting. It was a blast to play with friends, online alone gets pretty boring. I wasn't hyped so much for this game so I felt none of the initial disappointment, but I definitely see what people are talking about. It's a multiplayer game, with a confusing campaign layout, generic multiplayer and guns, and just a lingering feeling that something was missing the whole time.. I picked this game up on the Xbox One Store when it was on sale for $5, and oh my god, I was completely blown away. Titanfall mixes infantry and mech-armor combat so well, it is incredible. Parkour is a great addition and the campaign is great, too, it's an interesting idea for a campaign. Reminds me of Battlefront 2's campaign. This game is what every FPS should be: easy to learn, hard to master. I am looking forward to Titanfall 2, as the Titanfall IP is a great one. I hope every future FPS follows Titanfall's idea of being an easy to get into, but hard to master first-person shooter, and instead of not adding a campaign, at least add a campaign like Titanfall's.. Titanfall is/was great. I really enjoyed it and put countless hours into the game, even before the expansion content came out. In fact, I really wish I hadn't stopped playing it when I did, and I often think about sticking it back in to play some more but there are just too many new games stacked on top of it at this point. Regardless, 9 out of 10 is an easy assessment to make (and from what I've heard, since I stopped playing they added a lot of content that probably would bump it up to a 10 if I played it). I'm looking forward to a Titanfall 2.. This is an updated review written well and truly after the game release, for starters I want to say that this is the most well balanced and enjoyable online multiplayer shooter I have ever played, there were a number of ways and tactics to employ throughout this game and one of the best aspects was that it obliterated camping, this is a game where to be any good you need to be able to play. Despite my praise the problem here is that it is only multiplayer only and with the player base having moved on to new things there is only one game mode still accessible and the people who still player generally fall into two categories new and testing it out or veterans who will leave you endlessly frustrated. The game is so cheap now that it may be worthwhile picking up and giving a run but the level of enjoyment is no longer there with the limitations of a shifting multiplayer market.. 10 out of 10. Why? Because Titanfall feels exactly like everything Activition wanted to do with their games and never did because they were stuck on too much realism worries and arcade fire fights on endless mp battles... Titanfall is like no other fps where you jump, and use your tons of perks to customize your game and is so light as it is heavy to play while your running, destroying, flying around through wall jumps and of course, the robbots! Its is for sure the best fps for this generation so far considering its only multiplayer.. This Game is fun in all senses, there is a lot of options for weapons, parkour and Titans, and no game ever as made me so happy to hear the words ""Pilot, prepare for Titanfall"". This game is amazing. It incorporates great mechanics that have not been used in many games. It really has its own feel apart from any other shooter. The lack of some content such as guns is the only downfall to this game. There are a ton of different maps plus the three maps packs that were released add nine more to the already expansive locations. This is one of the few games I have played constantly and have not gotten bored. It is an amazing game and it's sequel will be just as good if not better.. I have gotten far more than my moneys worth. I love the various ways to kill people, bots and titans. No mater what the game mode, the dynamic battle always requires strategy. The free dlc is the icing on the cake.. Your first few steps in Titanfall are going to be amazing. The sheer amount of activity in the background, the context driven narrative, the theater of it all combines with the smooth player movement to give it a really good first look. But after several games, it wears a bit thin. It's still a lot of fun, still very novel and innovative. But for a game that hitched its wagon to multiplayer and refused to give us single-player, they make a lot of simple mistakes. It borrows from the Battlefield format with the hardpoints and vehicular combat, but when each map only has 3 hardpoints in a triangular or linear alignment, your tactical/teamwork approaches are very limited. And it's very easy for a highly skilled player to easily fend off attackers all day. Similar to battlefield, the AI grunts are unbelievably slow and stupid. The map is simply crawling with grunts/specters/militia and they never pose a threat to pilots, I can't remember the last time one of them killed me. And it's really a lost opportunity. I would have much preferred a combat system where AI troops move around the map in force and players are forced to use ambushes, long range strikes, or other clever tactics to take out the AI. Then the PvP moments could be much more visceral traditional multiplayer. But alas, players simply mow down the AI bots by the dozen and in the attrition matchups I can spend the entire match just killing bots and ignoring players with the players only offer 4 points and the bots offer 1, and a bot is more than four times easier to kill than a player. Everything from the bots' oohing and ahhing about you as a pilot, to their pitiful combat skills, to their warnings about a pilot in the area just seem like it's there to boost your ego without adding to the gameplay. The inability to issue commands or interact with the bots at all is also a big let down, and taking the time to hack/convert an enemy bot takes five times as long as it would take to just kill it. It would be great to have bot squads or general orders to order. If you have two hardpoints, maybe the bots shouldn't be rushing in to die at the third hardpoint. As fun as it is to double jump and wall-run around the map, I don't know that it makes for good gameplay. Sniping is almost impossible and is never worth the time. You'll waste 3 minutes getting to your sniper nest, waiting for someone to show up, and then you'll probably miss, meanwhile each of the guys on the ground have gotten 10 more bot kills on the scoreboard. Attrition mode is boring mode, and as soon as attrition mode comes on the voice chatter goes silent. There's no strategy in a mass deathmatch. Unfortunately that's how a lot of the game modes feel. Last titan standing, marked for death, etc. all lack any viable team strategy. It's really just best to gang up in a group and unleash a lot of firepower on the target. Players can hack turrets for their side, but these provide only a slight advantage and are far too few to really swing any mission. There's ample room to add more interesting interactive elements like capturing a mortar battery, hacking a system that interferes with the enemy bots, disabling enemy comms, etc. Having only three titan classes in a game called ""Titanfall"" is a bit disappointing. Sure they have customizable weapons and secondary abilities, but they just aren't different enough to make a big difference in the game. I would loved to have seen more variety, including artillery titans, smaller exoskeletons that augment the infantry combat, or even flying titans that would change the dimensions of the battlefield. Finally, the maps just don't feel that different. The views are amazing and I love the campaign voiceovers. But in the end the maps play second-fiddle to whatever the objective is. And unlike Battlefield 1942 where one might have to assault a beach leading to a village next to an airfield, the maps just look shiny and devoid of real content. Atmospheric conditions are few and far between, with just a camera shake momentarily when a cannon fires somewhere. And the campaign characters are always referencing infiltration teams or boarding crews, but we as the player are always just stuck on the battlefield when such special ops moments would really offer a solid change of pace. Titanfall is a fun game, and it looks amazing. I like having an integrated campaign, but it's too short and doesn't have the replayability of Enemy Territory or Battlefield. It also defaults too readily to the heroic good guys and the evil bad guys. The Aussie IMC commander slaughters civilians while the militia commander sacrifices himself for the good of the cause. I would have liked to see them muddy the waters a bit more on that one. All in all, worth the money, but less than it might have been.. The game is jumpy. so much when watching the other player who kill you, you see they never hit you. That’s if you even hear rounds impacting around you. Fun level. negative 10.. Most people, thought this game would have a campaign but they thought wrong. And thats probably why they rated this game really low. But lets face it, its an online game (kinda like Destiny, it will have no campaign or it will have a **** campaign). Respawn recently made a smart move and made the game's DLC free and the Season Pass for free. With this move, trying to improve sales and continue to have players play the game and probably it did. People thought that this game was going to compete with Call of Duty but all the little kids. They love Call of Duty and wont change their habits. I liked this game for about 4 days, after that game felt boring and felt like another shooter. The Titans where a cool addition to the game and added another challenging aspect to the game. But after having Titans, wall jumps, wall rides, and double jumps in this game. I feel like every game even Call of Duty now are trying to implement these features/things to there games now and now they are becoming Titanfall clones.. Unfortunately, this has been getting a bad wrap. On the contrary however, the gameplay and classes are much to be desired in such a game. from vaporizing pilots with your titan's fist to hacking into enemy units, Titanfall has changed the playing field for many FPS games coming out in 2015.. This game is one of the freshest and BEST multiplayer FPS experiences I EVER had. It took me back to playing Halo the first time and my first foray into Modern Warfare 2. It's fast, FUN, and involves BIG ASS ROBOTS!! How can you go wrong. (No single player hurts tho). small maps gimicky jumping and wall running game modes are poor player count is tiny overall a very average game ............................................... Awesome it's awesome, you get all dlcs for free now and it's just perfect, sure you'll jump off and on due to its repetiveness but it's still a awesome game. Titanfall is a great shooter. PROS -Outstanding graphics -Fun combat -Great multiplayer CONS -Not enough weapons -Horrible story .. This game is hands down the best FPS I've ever played. It puts every COD to open shame. From wall running, double jumping, to Titan fights and various load outs this game will leave you very satisfied. The ONLY reason it does not get a 10 is because it has a very poorly executed campaign mode (various multiplayer modes with a boring dialogue) and only has one (extremely fun) co-op mode. If it had more co-op modes or an actual single/co-op player campaign it would easily be a 10.. Titanfall comes close to being a great game. The pliability is remarkably fluid and the graphics are quiet decent. It lacks a destructible environment and while there is potential in how the game fells. The gap in content is undeniable. Without a solid single player mode the the game is left with to the weak, uninteresting melees within the mostly unoccupied maps/modes. There simply is not enough content here to keep any gamer occupied for very long. Titanfall is a good idea that just did not get well developed.. This game is the most fun I have had in a first person shooter EVER!!!! It is fast paced, easy to learn, but hard to master. The population has recently had a resurgence with some sales and free dlc so now you have no reason to not check it out. This is has been my favourite game on xbox one. Most fun and most balanced shooter ever. The parkour is amazing and steals the show from the titans. Can't wait for the next one. If respawn ups the graphics and gives us more to unlock this game will be epic.. The game is excellent, the criticism this game has been given is just pitiful. This is the best shooter I have played since the Call of duty 4 and bad company 2 days, it feels fresh and despite what some idiotic people are saying it is innovative. The parkour and the map design fit each other so well that it is a joy to manoeuvre around each map you play. The shooting mechanics are fast and responsive just what you want from a fast paced shooter. ""The Titans"" as their called are an innovative and entertaining way to keep the genre fresh and break up some of the normal shooting elements, Titan battles are very strategic it isn't just about firing every little bit of ammo you have because there are various defence mechanisms that each Titan has to avoid as much damage as possible. I am ok with the amount of modes available because I only play about 4 that are available anyway because some modes I feel have just been thrown in their for added value and are not suited to the overall gameplay. My gripes with the game are the lack of maps and customisation available for each pilot, they have released more maps in the form of dlc which is disappointing but developers have been doing this for years and it shouldn't be frowned upon just because EA are doing it. I think there is enough content here to satisfy you, it has kept me busy for a few months and that is more than enough for me. I always find myself going back to it because I honesly feel like no other shooter has had anything as innovative and interesting like titanfall has for a long time.. Really fun shooter and all DLC maps now free. I bought this on release and am still coming back to it. This is one of the few games I will not trade in. One of my favourites on X1 for sure.. I was sceptical of this game - especially given the hype surrounding it. After seeing some reviews it made it seem as if this game was a rush-job cashing in on the ""CoD developer"" hype. Whilst I can agree with the criticisms levelled at it, I cannot ignore the sublime gameplay Titanfall offers. Yes, it is multiplayer only (and no, you can't have bots). Yes, the campaign is completely pointless. By that I mean there is no explanation of the story that's interesting or deep enough to care, and since it's a multiplayer-only game, you will join campaign levels in an arbitrary order and have no clue as to which side is which in terms of the story. Really, it's pretending to have a campaign but it doesn't. But then again, why would anyone buy a multiplayer-only shooter for the ""campaign""? The gameplay is not different to the rest of the game, so nothing added other than pointless dialogue. Onto the gameplay then. What strikes me about it at first is the pacing. Inheriting from Call of Duty's legendary controls for which all console shooters aspire to be (in terms of fluency, intuitiveness and smoothness and ease of use), the game feels incredibly agile. The parkour mechanics are, without joke, the best I've ever come across. Wallrunning can go on for very long and speeds up movement, you can chain wallruns infinitely, you can double-jump, and wallrunning resets your double jump. So really it's (one of) the fastest moving FPS around. It's not just CoD with wallrunning - it feels even better than that. The titans also feel fairly agile and control intuitively. At first I disliked the idea of titans but they really make the game what it is. They're not overpowered, they're not easy to take out and you almost have to purposely stand in front of them to be killed by them as a pilot. AI controlled ""auto-titans"" can be useful for defending but obviously not as good as being piloted. The titans don't feel like tanks on legs - that's for sure. They have a unique presence but they don't feel overpowered or out of place. Given that the season pass is now free, I found that the quantity and quality of maps is amazing. The maps are really well-designed and each one feels different. They are well-suited to objective play and accommodate Titans and the parkour mechanics. Speaking of which, there is a decent selection of game modes - TDM, Domination, Last Titan Standing, CTF, Marked for Death and some other variants on these. This is a game where every game mode is exciting and fun to play. The combination of map design, Titans, controls and pacing make these really intense and action-packed. Then there is create-a-class. This is where you can tell it was made by same developers as Call of Duty 4. There aren't a bajillion weapons with hundreds of attachments or skins. No, a small selection of weapons (which are actually different), only a few attachments (which are unlocked by doing challenges), 5 custom slots and 2 custom slots for each game mode. You can customise both Titans and Pilots, but it's not a mess like modern CoD - you pick the ordnance (grenade), tactical ability (e.g. cloak or temporary speed boost), perk 1, perk 2, primary weapon, secondary weapon. There are only 3 secondary weapons - all of which are pistol for different ranges. That's it - no attachments, no SMGs as secondary or anything like that. Simple, easy, balanced. No weapon feels useless, underpowered or overpowered. The smart pistol received a lot of complaints but they are misguided - it is by far the least effective weapon in the game unless you are very stealthy. It has short range and takes a relatively long time to lock on. Overall there is good variety in create-a-class but not overly cluttered. The anti-titan weapons and the Titan create-a-class are particularly commendable for their variety. One of the things that makes Titanfall so action-packed is the minions. These are AI-controlled solider which are weak and dumb but there are quite a lot of them for both teams and they spawn infinitely. The make the maps feel more alive like a battlefield and provide easy kills and actually help you do objectives. They typically battle amongst themselves but their presence adds to the action. Even if you don't see many human players you will see plenty of minions so no shortage of action. This leads to another thing about Titanfall - it is never frustrating. No matter how bad you do, you never feel angry. To conclude, Titanfall is absolutely an epic shooter. Questions will inevitably arise as to whether a triple-A title can get by on multiplayer alone, but to be honest, I don't think it's a problem. Despite Call of Duty 4's incredible single player, it received little attention from players - most of whom probably never even touched the campaign! Titanfall is overall a very original shooter. It is fair, fun and by far the best-looking Source engine game to date. I have very little to complain about on this title.. I wanted to like this game, and I **** 5 days but then after that it went ****'t purchase this until the price has lowered to atleast 20$. I first bought this on PC and thought it looked great, but I was consumed with BF4 on the PC at the time. I didn't buy this on the Xbox One until a year after it came out. The deluxe edition - comes with all of the DLC - went on sale on Games with Gold for just over $13! I picked it up because I wanted to compare it to the PC edition.. There are plenty of maps and quite a few game modes are available. I primarily play a mode called variety pack by which the game modes rotate through all of the maps. For the most part, the maps are not made for campers so you have to watch in many directions no matter where you are on the map (it's best to just keep moving; stick and move). Though the frame rate and resolution are lower than on the PC, the graphical details on the Xbox One edition are comparable to a high-end PC setup. The surround sound on my surround sound setup is pretty amazing. The game is just plain fun. Even noobs can contribute to their team's cause by going after the AI enemies. There is an auto-aiming smart pistol many will complain about, but I think it is a good equalizer for new players as it allows fast lock-ons to AI, but slow lock-ons to other players. When going head to head with another player of any skill, the smart pistol will more than not lose to a player using a manual-aim weapon as the lock-on is that slow with other players when using the smart pistol (unless the other player is completely unaware of the the one with the smart pistol). I've found the matchmaking in this game to be quite good by which if one team dominates in a particular round, the next round will see a good shuffling of the players. From a first-person shooter standpoint, I've found nothing better on any console and I've owned them all at some point. The mechanics are great. The variety of ways to eliminate an enemy are comparable to most shooters. Hopping into a titan and wreaking havoc over the map is pretty cool. The visual and sound effects are great. While the PC version is in fact visually better, it's much harder to find matches online due to lack of interest on that platform. It's also nice to kick back in a recliner as opposed to a computer chair knowing you'll find any type of match virtually any time of day on the Xbox One. This is hands down the best first-person shooter game I've played on a next-gen console.. Game is a fun, blast to play. Fanboys will make people go and rate it 10 or 0 depending on who their corporate lover is. The game has such a great speed to it and balance as well. I personally am better at fighting titans as a runner then in my own Titan. And that's all good. Find what works for you and assist your team. It is a fun game to play.. Amazingly fast. Fun and clever. Full of interesting ideas that bring live to genre that was starting to feel like all the same. Graphically is awesome in 360, but not so impressive for a Xbox One game. Not really well optimized if you think in the resolution, but the main problem of this games is that it felt short. There are lots of games types as a multiplayer, but... still... I really like and I will go back time after time, but is basically just a quick game for a short amount of time.. This game is over a year old now, but it is",the core gameplay is generally fun but it does not have too much to offer . the sequel was for sure way better but still was fun at the time . the game has many fresh ideas and did set standards for future shooter games .
909.Tomb Raider,"Disregard this review. I played on PS3 and not on the XBOX 360. Metacritic has no option to remove reviews so I'm stuck with this.. What a long way for this character to come from PS1 era. Love the improvements on the gameplay, character is likeable and story enjoyable and the progression unlocking of weapons etc.. I love the Tomb Raider franchise. I thought this game was awesome. A very good game.. This game, from start to finish is just extremely fun. The soundtrack is great, not as good as the earlier games, but nonetheless a very enjoyable game. The story is extremely well written, and all the characters feel truly and like real people. If I had one complaint with the game, it's that there are too many action moments where Lara is just running through an area while things are destroyed around her. At first it's very tense and gripping, but because of the sheer amount of these, that by the end, you'll just be bored of them. The combat isn't anything revolutionary, but the guns feel powerful and satisfying to use. One complaint about the gameplay is the lack of options for stealth. You can use the bow and arrow or silently take down an enemy, but often times it's painfully obvious that the game wants you to do something and it's often the only way to take down all enemies.. A fresh new Tomb Raider origin story. Even though I was never into the typical linear story games, this reboot made me appreciate these games more. The gameplay is good, combat is fast and fluid, climbing is fun and the puzzles are fine. The Tombs are cool for the most part but unfortunately there aren't many of them, however, there are some open world elements, you can explore the island for secrets and collectibles. Now the plot, it's just mediocre. It has some great action-oriented moments, but for most of the time I didn't find myself attached to the story or the characters, and I didn't like the main villain. Also there are way too many Quick Time Events, and combined with the linear main story, there's no replay-ability, some sections are straight up exhausting to go through. Lara Croft carries this game, she is an exceptional female protagonist, and easily the highlight of the game. Final Rating: ""Decent"" ~ 6/10.. Puzzle parts are boring, but the rest of the game is good. I liked throwing the arrow in this game.. Replayed this year on my PC and this game still holds up very well. Graphics arent as good as the 2 sequels but then again they arent over 10 years old. Some hate the reboot trilogy but I absolutely love it. And this game is an excellent start. The gameplay is fun and the story/lore of the island is good. Start to finish it is quite the experience. My only gripe is the same I had all those years ago when it came out. WHY NO SPRINT. Just the right amount of puzzles, just the right amount of difficulty, but it gets old fast.. First time playing any type of Tomb Raider game and I have never been so hooked onto a game before for a 12 year old game this is a still an amazing game in 2024. With a well written cast of characters, mightily impressive production techniques, sumptuous visuals, tight platforming and surprisingly enjoyable combat, Tomb Raider is most definitely a release to be treasured.. This is what reboots should aspire to. A great game, with a couple of hiccups, but nothing major.. One of the best game ............ ..... .... ..... .. ....... ........... The original Tomb Raider games are some of the better games that released at the time & not only introduced, but evolved many gaming traditions that are still prevalent today. Of course they were heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, but they did a lot more than put a female protagonist in thralling & dangerous scenarios that should not be survivable, but still retain your attention to see how the next game can improve on these set pieces & (at the time) good level design. With that being said, I'm sure you can imagine I had high hopes for the reboot series, and many questions to go along with it; How will the set pieces appear in this new era of consoles & gaming? Will the puzzles be significantly improved to compensate for the improved hardware & evolution of puzzles in adventure games? My questions during my play through were answered, and the answers I received left me on the edge of my seat while I was experiencing set piece after set piece, and uncovering interesting artefacts, while Lara would show her knowledge of them by giving a brief history of their origins, further show her knowledge & dedication to her lifework. This game also introduces multiple allies, and hostiles that are decently well developed. I wouldn't say any character in the game is exceeding complex and left me curious as to what their intentions are, or if their actions had were performed for the good of others. The various characters you meet in this game aren't exactly mysterious, very deep or developed for that matter, but they service the story of the game well enough. Characters best compliment a story rather than to just service it, and I would've preferred for the various cutscenes to hold my attention more than they did (when a set piece weren't involved) but to be fair to the game it doesn't often attempt to do so. The one time it did though, when one of your ""allies"" was being ominous and suspicious, it was laughably mediocre & the betrayal could be seen from a mile away, but it was thankfully a one time thing. Excluding that sequence (that I won't directly mention for spoiler reasons), every character you meet will wear their intentions, loyalty or disloyalty on their sleeve. The plot is what you can expect of a Tomb Raider game, and the characters that service the plot do a good enough job to motivate you to continuously fight not just for yourself and your safety & freedom, but for theirs too. Level design for the most part I'd say is good. It's quite linear, and doesn't often deviate from that, but the most linear sections are during puzzles sequences so you never get lost or too distracted. During combat sequences the world opens up slightly to not have you feel claustrophobic, and gives you enough freedom to move in between cover, scale small buildings and watch towers and search for relics and ammunition as well tear through the local militia. These combat encounters are surprisingly good, though few and far in between until the final quarter of the game, they offer a good enough break from puzzles, and scaling mossy cliff sides or broken airplanes and maintains your attention from first to last grunt. This game had good intentions; bring Lara to the new consoles and a new generation of gaming and evolve everything from the original games. It does that well and then some, I wouldn't go as far as to call the game GREAT, but it is a very good & enjoyable experience that doesn't over stay it's welcome. I prefer this game over Uncharted 1 & 3, a series it's often compared to as the Uncharted series was inspired heavily by it. So much so it initially had the nickname ""Dude Raider"" due to how blatant its inspiration was, but was only able to meet Tomb Raider after its second and fourth attempts. If you enjoy any of the Uncharted games, you should enjoy this one. Though it's far more mature and grim in it's approach (which is what I like), but if you prioritise the humour and a light hearted take on Indiana Jones than this may be a bit too gloomy for you. I recommend this game, it stands up to the test of time & even 10 years later is a very good experience that I say most gamers interested in puzzles, set pieces & linear exploration should try.. Super gritty and action packed take on the well loved Lara Croft character and i love it. It was fine. It's really a game for when you feel like ""I really wanna play Uncharted, but also don't want to replay an old one."" It really does feel like that to me, not to say that I enjoyed it any less. It just didn't stick to me as much as uncharted 4 did, not to say it should or anything. It's good in it's own way.. One of the best adventure games. Restart saga. Win UNCHARTED in everything.. Learned more about Japanese/Chinese history from this game than history class. 10/10, would play again.. Although Tomb Raider has fun gameplay with great level designs, it has many flaws that prevent this title from using its full potential. Weak artificial intelligence, unrealistic shooting, a very low variety of side missions and weapons, cliched antagonist and a story that gets bad from the end of the game, are exactly that flaws.. I really loved the game. There is great voice acting, nice storyline, and decent side characters. It’s great open-world experience, that makes you feel like you’re almost in a movie, the whole game is almost cinematic. Combat is ok for the most part, it may feel a little wonky at times but it may just be me being an ass at the game. Overall, great experience having played Tomb Raider.. This is how a reboot should be made. Amazing job in bringing Lara Croft back from the grave.. I've never played the Tomb Raider series before, so I jumped on the reboot series, more precisely on Tomb Raider (2013). The game immediately captivated me with its adrenaline rush. Not much is expected here and you will immediately get the opportunity to play for Lara Croft and there will be something to see at the event. The event is great here. A good arsenal of weapons, thanks to which you will kill your enemies. The locations are good. The story is also nice. For me, a good game that will draw you into Lary Croft's franchise and her adventures. I recommend.. This game is amazing! I can't believe it took me so long to play it! It has the best graphics I've seen in a game. Those graphics are backed by super fun gameplay. The best game I played on Xbox 360. It has an astonishing graphics, good plot, great gameplay and funny secondary activities (tombs, collectibles, etc...). If you like adventure games, be sure to play this game. In my opinion it is even better than Uncharted.. The game offers good graphics and lays the foundation for the game series. However, the linear story, unimaginative implementation, the functions and controls could also be a Batman, Sherlock or Assassin's Creed, dampens the joy of the content. The repetitive processing of collectibles is also analogous to the examples mentioned.. This is an excellent revival to a series. The gameplay is great and the story is amazing and does a great service in developing Lara's character.. Strong reboot. Lara is fully realized as a character filling the series with loads of potential.. I was surprised by the quality of this game. Pushing to the limits the console.. Amazing! Great story, great graphics, to the top in Xbox 360 hardware. Looks almost like the next gen versions. More than a port, it's a unique version made with detail and care. If you have a good old 360, this is a must for you, one of the last great games made for that generation.. This was the first game that I ever 100% completed, and for good reason. The combat is super fun and the puzzles are super satisfying and just difficult enough that they aren't too easy.. A quite funny adventure game. Gamer can notice many another games influences. Playability works well, ambientation is quite beautiful, game is good to explore. It's a incredible flowing linear game. But this Lara Croft has a lack of charisma. Still very good.. Nothing but great things to say about this game. The story is rich and enjoyable, the graphics and animations were amazing for the time. I have even found myself playing through it a second and third time because of how much fun it was. The only complaint i would have about this game is the multiplayer......... its quite horrible. But i feel like that was just an extra thrown in the game. The real reason anyone plays a tomb raider game is for the single player experience, and this game delivers. Do yourself a favor and pick it up.. While the story is nothing special and the game really holds your hand with its difficulty being rather too easy, it's a really really fun game. The similarities to Uncharted are undeniable, but it does feel different enough where it did not bother me. In my first playthrough I had an absolute blast with this game. It's not engaging enough for multiple playthroughs, but it's a solid adventure game that gives you 10-12 hours of pure entertainment.. This is one of the best games I played on the Xbox 360. The graphics and game play were great but more importantly the story was fantastic. I always got excited to see what Lara would do next when I started a new part of the game.. I wasn't into any of the Tomb Raider games back in the day, although this one caught my eye. Initially, I didn't expect much from the game, but by the end of it I was impressed. The graphics and sound effects in particular kept me immersed the whole way through. The story and plot was quite captivating as well. It has to be noted that the map itself isn't very large, and features such as gathering, hunting, weapons weren't developed to its full potential (gathering/hunting is useless, not enough variety of weapons). There are only a few tombs to raid, and for the most part, they are quite easy. Furthermore, even though the story is well executed, it seems shorter than it needs to be. I like how the game is inspired by the Uncharted series, though at times I feel like it takes too much inspiration and doesn't create enough originality for itself. It is still a really good game that I'd suggest anyone to play, especially those who love the Uncharted series.. I remember when i was playing in Tomb Raider while i was kid. Best part of TR series were climbing, puzzles, graphics was bad but gameplay and fun was amazing. And now is remake, great graphics, i was wondering how it possible to generate graphics like that on old Xbox 360.Great polish dubbing by Karolina Gorczyca (Lara -voice), interesting story, best gameplay, puzzles, puzzles, and a little too much fights, and enemies for me. One point i have to subtract- too much violence, why we have to see how Lara died in such horrible scenes ? Byt to sum up its the best Tomb Raider on next generation hardware since many years, so i have to admit its good masterpiece. I would like to play in Rise of the Tomb Raider, but maybe when i buy Xbox one.. I played this game for the first time in 2013 and it seemed amazing to me. In retrospect, now that I've tried more recent games like Uncharted 4 or its sequel, Rise of the tomb raider, it seems no longer so epic. By the way, it's always a good game, it was innovative at that time. The graphics were cool and the story captivating, I still think plot was well-written, even more than the plot of Rise of the TR. But it has some lacks that I'd already noticed 4 years ago: the gameplay is too short, about 8 hours (tombs and collectibles included), map is not very big, hunting and gathering are almost useless, there are a few weapons, stealth doesn't exist and there a few tombs and too easy to do. But, I want to point out, the plot is captivating and really engaging. It was and still is a good game, but not excellent how I used to believe when I first tried it.. Very fun adventure with excellent gameplay and story. This one definitely caught me by surprise and is full of good graphics, controls, collectibles/replay, proper backtracking (with excellent auto-check system), music/effects, gadgets and upgrades. As well, the game is under 10bucks and intelligent gamers can make the experience even better if they do not cheat or use outside resources and make key in-game decisions.. This game is perfect example why games nowadays are full of **** . The story , gameplay physics make no sense at all. Lara alone kills about 5 hundreds mens - pretty stupid isnt it. Best game I had ever played in my whole life ! So much better than The Last of Us aw the Last Of Us is **** compared to this masterpiece !! in love with Lara *-* Some random girl. This is the most action packed and most story driven action adventure survival game I have ever played. You as Lara Croft is supposed to rescue and save your friends who have been lost on this mysterious island (but there is more to the story than just that). The gameplay feels smooth and fun. And by the way, this game is very intense. Your character gets knocked all over the place, has a lot of close calls of falling from great heights and get abused by a lot of the enemy soldiers, she nearly gets **** by one of them. Its very interesting to see how much Lara Croft changes as you go on your wild adventure. This is a must-buy.. 10 out of 10. If there was ever a game deserving of a perfect score. This is it. It does everything right. Multiplayer, not so much. Single player, top-notch.. 6.5/ 10 Gameplay 2.5/ 4 - combat is the only really responsive and enjoyable part of the gameplay; it's fun, can be challenging and offers good variety. The movement/ climbing/ jumping mechanics were a big disappointment; an extremely dumbed-down Assassin's Creed...almost impossible to miss a jump. Skill/ practice is irrelevant from the adventuring perspective. The entire skilltree was an obvious add-on and is meaningless....insultingly so. Story - 2/4 - not bad, not great. World is small and very linear. Puzzle sections are few, very, very brief and very simple. Largest single criticism of the game is that the devs knew that their audience was men, so even though you are ""playing"" Lara, she remains **** immersed in a game can I be if there continues to be close-up shots of solely my chest when forced to continually slide into cracks....seriously guys, grow up; at least Witcher allows us to be pervs the way we normally are :) Visuals 1/2 - again, not bad, not great. Soundtrack 1/1 - well suited and enjoyable.. Great game, good story, cool combats. I like Lara in new perspective, this parkour and archer girl is bad-ass. Great decision if you are choosing between Watch Dogs and this.. Good game overall with no real bugs. Biggest complaint is the reliance on QTEs for just about everything including combat which takes any sort of skill out of the game. There are also many places in the game where you fail the QTE once and you die. This takes all the fun out of the game. Button mashing isn't a skill. Final level is probably the worst of the entire game because of poor camera angles and tricky jumps that are hard to line up because of it. It looks like the devs ran out of ideas so they started coming up with stupid stuff. Not happy with achievements either. Several require sheer luck rather than any sort of skill.. A bit too much 'Action' and way too less riddles. This Game has also way too many ""wanna-be-cinematic""-cutscenes and many, many ideas from 'Survival-Horror' Games, especially from ""Dead Space"" (by the way: I think it has more blood than ""Dead Space""). Weapon-Upgrades; Open World, but not really Open World etc. And then there is additionally HP-Regeneration (worst Game-Feature ever.) The Game isn't bad, but it has the typical ""Game-diseases"" which have many Games in this decade. Oh and climbing reminds me a little bit of the ""Prince of Persia""-Series.... Best Tomb Raider to date. The reboot of this series is a stunning feat. I really had fun with the controls of Laura and the gun play. Rock solid I felt skill based. Gave it a 9 because the ending was a little less than the build up to it was.. The game started out not that bad, but soon turned into a never ending stream of blood guts and gore with enemies that can seem to hit you when shooting except when you have nearly won the battle. the only reason that i didn't give this a zero is because the scenes are well done. by scenes i mean the movie like videos that constantly interrupt the game. Even on easy it is ridiculously hard to kill the enemies, who by the way never seem to run out of bullets, oh and when you reach certain areas of the game be prepared to fight enemies who are well shielded, not to mention the sudden jumps in tech and the ""unwinnable"" situations. But don't take my word for it, try submitting yourself to this horrific game. It is currently free if you have a gold membership. But be warned, there is no way out. Side effects: fear, weird dreams, checking around the next corner, complete outrage that something like this was made, and wonder at the ""good"" reviews. I've played most of the previous Tomb Raider titles and this is a whole new experience. They've really taken this series to a whole new level. The previous games were pretty one dimensional and generally quite average. However, with this release you get the whole package of a well rounded experience. It was really thought out and expanded. Tomb Raider always fell short in the combat area, but now it is excellent. The weapons are a blast to use and have some great options to upgrade. Character leveling is pretty basic, but a nice addition. Just like the old games there are puzzles, but they are a little more basic in this release, however still fun and challenging in a few sections. The game is open world and beautiful - a blast to explore. The graphics in this game are just excellent, beautiful and immersive cut scenes too. The story is pretty interesting, though a bit typical at times. However, where it really excelled was in character development. This young Lara Croft is fleshed out so well and you really become attached to her as you experience her growing and becoming stronger in the face of adversity. She continues to be extremely sexy without the blatant sexism of the previous titles. Overall, this was an extremely well done release. I look forward to what they do with the series moving forward.. Definitely one of my favorite games from the past few years. The story is kind of all over the place, but few games keep you engaged as much as this one. The graphics are also fantastic and the death sequences are brutal. My only complaint would be too many F-words, but at least they’re not as prevalent as games like Last of Us or Walking Dead. Definitely try Tomb Raider if you haven’t already.. Bad things this game did: Not an open world like it could have been Horrible ending Forgettable story and characters Crafting (while good) you can't read what the hell you just did had to find tombs on your own. one location pretty much ""I hate tombs"" **** that line Good things: Story: all be it, not brilliant Combat was OK I suppose but it felt more like a cover shooter half the time. biggest falt: NOT ****ING TOMB RAIDER!!!!!!. This is the Tomb Raider game they always needed to make. Amazing story, amazing characters (especially Lara), and amazing gameplay. My only main criticism of the game is the tombs themselves. Tombs should have been incredibly expansive puzzle-fests. Instead, they're very short, single-puzzle distractions. Very disappointing. Some of the scripted events are lacking, but otherwise the gameplay is phenomenal. Although, I do think it focuses too much on action and too little on puzzle solving. Hopefully they'll fix that in the sequel. It was honestly a toss-up between an ""8"" and a ""9"", but ultimately I choose ""9"" because I didn't feel it's action-oriented gameplay should detract from the score, even though I think Tomb Raider should have more puzzle elements than action.. We all know Tomb Raider. It's an action adventure game, where you play as an overy sexualized British lady, and you shoot bad guys, and solve puzzles, and find relics; however, it's always been a bit cartoony. This reboot of Tomb Raider is real, and it's nitty, and it's gritty. But is that a bad thing? It depends on what you want. For me I thought it was a good game, but with too much deviation. Here are my cons and pros: CONS 1. There were not enough puzzling elements to the game. There were some, but they often didn't make sense, or weren't particularly enthralling. The puzzle/logic aspect to this game has been watered down a great deal in favor of action and adventure. 2. Combat, while improved in comparison to the other Tomb Raider games, is still lacking. It's hard to maneuver and turn when a million guys are attacking. You have to constantly switch back and forth between perspectives, and the dodge move Lara does isn't very good. Why does she crawl like a dog? It often moves you in the wrong direction. However, the combat isn't all bad. The auto cover is an excellent feature. And I also don't think they should scrap the idea of a combined system, where you view Lara in 3rd and 1st person modes. It's just that they need to make Lara more robust and able to dodge attacks better. Semi-assisted aiming would be good too. 3. I hate how the game automatically autosaves when you exit the campfire. What if I don't want to save it and I just want to experiment with my upgrades? 4. Tiny text. Why is the text so tiny? It's hard to see, especially when you consider the colors they chose to display information. 5. Lara is very sluggish in comparison to her former self. She's not as acrobatic and it feels more realistic...yeah, but it's not as fun. She can't leap and hop like she used to. Oh, sure, Lara is still a super human, but she needs to be more acrobatic, I feel. 6. Why does she scurry around like a dog? Why can't she just duck and skulk like a normal person (in a video game)? 7. It was very hard to see in some points of the game. The environments were too busy. It was way too dark. There was wind, and snow, and rain blowing in your face. You didn't know where to go. It made the game kind of annoying to play. There weren't huge issues with camera, but clarity was a problem. 8. Graphics are beautiful, yet somehow lacking. A lot of the environment looked dark and stiff. There was no sense of wonderement. You felt like you were always in a prison of some sort. 9. Voice acting. It's not that anyone did a bad job at voice acting, but I feel like the other Laras in Tomb Raider Legend and Underworld had better, more lively voices. 10. Button mashing! I hated it. It was so annoying to have to mash button X to open or do something. A couple times should do it. Having to press X rapidly 15 or 20 times is irritating. At most it should be 5 times. 11. So, you're in this huge rather lush world, but it's easy to get lost, and lose sight of your objectives. The ""instincts"" button while helpful didn't always hit the mark. In another Tomb Raider game I played she gave verbal clues, which was great, and in my opinion should be implemented into the next game in addition to the instincts tool. This would give further clarity as to what you have to do and where to go. 12. The story was so so. Nothing compelling or really emotional. I thought it lacked heart, and some of what happened was just ridiculous, and made no sense. It lacked consistency. 13. Game errors. There was a point in the game where my game just completely froze for no reason. I understand why this happens, but it should not be a thing. PROS (There are more pros than there are cons in this game, but I'm only listing what stuck out.) 1. I like how the remodeled Lara to make her more realistic. Her boobs, while still quite large, are not as ridiculous as they once were. And she looks more like an explorer rather than a stripper. 2. I really like the open world, how you can explore, and move around. Makes you feel like you're there. The environments are large and spacious. While I noted they weren't perfect it is much an improvement over the previous games. The graphics at times can be very, very beautiful. 3. Pumping up the action was a great idea. It really pushed you along in the game. Made you feel excited. 4. Other than my comments on the puzzling elements, the style of gameplay was mixed together quite well. It was not completely linear. There were parts of the game where you only had to run and slide, or push the button at the right moments, and was used in the right amount. 5. The weapons upgrades were good fun. It gave an RPG feel to the game. ... In conclusion: Good game. Can be a bit frustrating, but worth checking out. Especially if you're a Tomb Raider fan. If you're not you still might like this.. Tomb Raider has a very interesting plot with really good graphics for xbox 360. The voice actings are pretty good, and even though I don't like stealthing as much, but the stealth in tomb raider was really interesting. Awesome game, and I would recommend it to probably anybody.. What happened to Tomb Raider? It simply turned into a game like Uncharted, but that's okay. There is nothing to worry about. This one is good too, wonderful, refreshing, and full of adventures too. The graphics are amazing. The new Tomb Raider is very entertaining and no less important than the previous ones.. Overall is an amazing game and maybe my second favorite Tomb Raider game, what I didn't like a lot about this game it's the stage changes, some feel the same and Tomb Raider games usually have many stage changes, because usually they take you to different parts of the world, even when this is in one island, it's pretty good. The controls are great and fun, I enjoyed the gameplay a lot. The story is good enough but maybe the final part feels rushed, there's no face to face fight with Himiko and Mathias' button fight is dumb and too easy, it needed something better with those two. Visually is good, I like what they did to Lara's design and her character's emotions, she feels more vulnerable at first and you can feel how the character grows up while you continue playing. I recommend it a lot.. Beautiful game. Lara's a totally new character, we can feel more her, see her and her emotions. Her first kill and her first adventure in Yamatai to kill that **** of Himiko haha. Anyway, Tomb Raider give us a whole new experience, a journey with a new Lara. A more human Lara, a more characterized Lara, a totally new Lara.. I still dont know if it's worth an 8 or 9. really good game, immersive with crazy storyline. you really get into it. you feel lara's emotions. Nothing seems fake. it's detailed and beautiful. lots of variety. even some puzzles gameplay's amazing only negative point is concerning the bow. It really feels great when executed as it's supposed to but... when you've spent all your gun ammos and start to shoot with the bow without streching it at all like it would be a pistol and that it actually shoot and hits target.. hum (almost sorry to say that but it,s true) buy it. This game is so great that a year after playing it a second time I had to write a review. Tomb Raider is a series I loved on my ps2, and as the series continued I became disapointed. The series needed a reboot, and Crystal Dynamics hit it out of the park. The series reboot is a joy to play, and left me excited for the future of the series again. The island and detail in the visuals is a joy to behold. It is rare for me to really enjoy visuals to the extent that I would take my time taking in the island, and surrounding nature to explore. Exploration is a blast, and the only complaint I would have is it needed more of it. Finding artifacts and exploration is so fun, and done well I wanted more of it. The tombs were a highlight, and something done so well I wanted more. This may sound like a negative and it may be slightly, but it is more telling how well it is done. The mechanics and controls is masterfully done. Climbing and shooting is pure joy, and done very well. The game allows for sneaking, or hunting depending on how you want to approach areas. The graphics, as mentioned, are fantastic. It is mature in content, especially if you end of dieing. I rather enjoyed the grittiness of the content, and is something I wanted to see from Tomb Raider since the beginning. The sound and island life is done well, and hunting is fun to do, but lacks depth. This is something that could be fleshed out more in the future, and expand on the need to hunt to survive. The game is a blast and is a title I bel","the story is extremely well written, and all the characters feel truly and like real people . the combat isn't anything revolutionary, but the guns feel powerful and satisfying to use . the plot, however, is just mediocre ."
91.Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow,"Definitely the worst of both worlds. The incredibly slow pace of the first splinter cell and the forced set pieces of Chaos Theory. Enemy AI is also sporadic terrible one minute with X-ray vision the next. Splinter Cell isn't meant for combat yet they still try to force combat situations almost constantly. Just a chore to play, especially considering the way games have evolved now. A tweaked control system, crisper graphics and another fine vocal performance from Michael Ironside makes Pandora Tomorrow more of the same, but a little better.. Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow - Perfecting the Art of Stealth. In 2004, Ubisoft delivered a masterstroke with ""Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow,"" a sequel that not only met the high standards set by its predecessor but also elevated the franchise to new heights. Building upon the foundation of the original Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow refined and expanded the stealth genre, delivering an experience that is nothing short of exceptional.. Surprisingly great too be a such a old game, if you ask me, a masterpiece. A perfect sequel for a incredible series. It's honestly shocking that no one is talking about this game today. Yeah, the story is somehow rushed a little bit, but still very solid eventough some of the characters dosen't have the same voice actors, they are still doing a good job to portray them. More gadgets to use are awesome, some of the level design is legendary. Overall, nothing tops this game in terms of stealth.. I never write any reviews in general, but for this game I had too. One of the best games I have ever played. Gameplay feels flawless, the plot is awesome, soundtrack is incredible, and the maps... WOW. I probably go as far to say it's better than Chaos Theory.. Ladies and gentlemen, Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow is the Empire Strikes Back in stealth games, and has everything that makes a stealth game a masterpiece. The stealth mechanics are better, since now you have more gadgets to toy with, which also makes it easier to take down enemies and environments on the maps. When we talking about maps, is the strongest side with Pandora Tomorrow compared to entire series, heck, even some of the maps are even better than Chaos Theory.. and reason to that is the atmosphere and attention to detail that Ubisoft carefully crafted. Some maps have backstories, cool ways to interact with things and how Lambert/Grimsdottir react what you do ingame. You think the first game was hard considering the alams? Finally Ubisoft fixed that, you can trigger 3 mistakes without mission failed until the next checkpoints. AI is also improved a little bit from the predecessor but sometimes they can feel stupid. If you Im not gonna spoil the story, however, is it so much more tense and more intresting this time thanksfully. Graphics are still awesome til this date, Ubisoft made sure to upgrade lightning, shadow, and weather effects that are now more natural. For a 2004 game, it's pretty impressive, especially if you play it on Xbox One X/Series X, that offer 4K resolution, it's a absolute joy. Arguably one of the best stealth game ever made, this is good old Ubisoft magic. Pandora Tomorrow gets a 10.. I don't get why the score is so high, coz performance is soooo laggy, and it's not a pleasure to see the gameplay and actually play. Definitely an improvement from the first mechanic wise and some quality of life improvements but a pretty nothing story with an abrupt ending and still no quick saves. The check points were not as bad as in the first game but still would of been nice. Other then that pretty much the same as before.. Amongst the best stealth based games available with a more coherent story but less personality than the Metal Gear solid games. Pandora Tomorrow features improved visuals and gameplay over the original but suffers from the usual problems associated with the genre such as enemies simply following pre-set routes around the games levels and forgetting about you two minutes after they you alert them.. Another excellent title from the Splinter Cell series, I love the stealth games and this is one of the best. I've played through this game countless times, it never gets old.","in 2004, Ubisoft delivered a masterstroke with ""Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow"" a perfect sequel for an incredible series, Pandora Tomorrow delivers an experience that is nothing short of exceptional . overall, nothing tops this game in terms of stealth ."
910.Picross 3D: Round 2,"Man, this game is FANTASTIC. Perfect follow-up to the original title on the DS, which I loved a lot too, the newly introduced color system allows the player to develop a different and renovated approach to the world of 3d Picross puzzles, and has a lot of new challenges to offer. Masterpiece!. A must have for puzzle and Picross fans. It's fun, relaxing, addicting, challenging if you try the hard difficulty, it has over 300 puzzles and hours of gameplay.. 3D: Round 2 is an inventive follow-up to the DS original that expands on the gameplay whilst refining elements from the original to provide a compelling package for fans of the puzzle genre, regardless if you are a Picross master or not. ('+' refers to a good element about the game; '=' refers to a mediocre element; '-' refers to a bad element) + The gameplay is refined and expanded from the original, now adding both blue and orange cubes that have to be correctly identified and filled in before a puzzle is finished, unlike the original. The issue of puzzles being hard to track is fixed with the addition to mark cubes (an element only just added to the 2D Picross games). Furthermore, the tedious removal of rows/columns with a '0' on them is alleviated with the Bomb feature, which removes them all in only a few seconds. + The game is well geared towards both fans of the original and newcomers, with 3 difficulty settings and a Hint feature, allowing anyone to complete puzzles and make progress with the title. + The variety of puzzles is decent, with many different objects making up the large amount of content on offer, including much more Japanese objects than before, which is a positive. + The game has a large amount of replay value, as the game has a ranking system determined on how fast you complete a puzzle, the amount of errors you make, and the difficult at which you chose to play it. Better medals are offered for higher scores, and these help unlock more puzzles in the game. + The aesthetics are good, with nicer, higher-quality backgrounds and more interesting musical themes accompanying the action. = The gameplay can get stale if played for too long. The occasional 'Construction Challenge' or 'Time Trial' puzzles appear now and again, however, these don't help too much. - The removal of a puzzle creator is disappointing, but understandable, as the removal of said feature has allowed for more puzzles to be included in the main game. 9/10. Definitely my favourite puzzle game right now. A step up from Picross 3D. The new mechanic with blue and orange boxes adds a new layer of complexity to picross solving. The presentation is absolutely gorgeous. Picross 3D: Round 2 deserves much more praise than it gets. It has amazing review scores, but even the announcement of it in the Nintendo Direct was less than 15 seconds long. If you have the money to buy this game, get it. The franchise needs all the attention it can get for another sequel.. I actually liked the original Picross 3D a bit better, but I've been waiting for this one ever since they made new 2D picross games, so I'm happy they got around to this. It introduces a new mechanic with multiple colors, which is okay, but kinda feels a bit unnecessary, and the way some of the blocks change shape when you solve their row and column can be a little more mentally confusing than it needs to be. Not game ruining, but not needed. Regardless, a must-have for a fan of the original Picross 3D game, and probably for any Picross fan in general. But if you don't like those games or puzzle games in general, you won't like Picross. If you're not certain, download the free Pokemon Picross game first and see if it tickles your fancy.. Very addicting puzzle game. However, there are a few flaws. The music gets very annoying after a while. Each series of puzzles in a ""book"" share a common theme... and also a common background song. So you might spend an hour on a certain book of puzzles and the same 1-minute track will be on loop the entire time. Also the game doesn't explain at all what the stamps are all about, how to get them, or what they are even for. You just seem to unlock them randomly, then are congratulated when you find them all, then... nothing. And when you finish a book you are awarded a color for that book, also never explained. I've only seen silver and gold so far, but strangely silver is awarded for getting the best score on every puzzle and gold is for when I messed up somewhere.. Boring as crap tbh. There is absolutely no replay value and the unlockables are horrible. No motivation to play this garbage. The game is also filled with bugs. 0/10.. ZERO USER REVIEWS?!? FOR A PERFECT 10 ****?!? Allow me to be the first lowly common man to laud this masterpiece. That soothing SNES-SimCity-esque soundtrack. The snap of breaking blocks akin to cracking the top of a creme brulee. The bloops and bleeps of marking cubes only to eventually paint them a permanent shade of mango or cobalt. So many satisfying elements that combine to make of the most well-rounded puzzle games I've ever played. Round 2 picks up where the brilliant Picross 3D left off, only this time we are introduced to a new mechanic: the blue and orange blocks. This new feature is a welcome addition and adds just enough of a twist to make it feel like an actual sequel instead of ""Picross 3D: More Puzzles."" If you've played a Picross title before don't hesitate to switch the difficulty over to Hard the first chance you get. The two lower difficulty settings are simply too easy unless this is your introduction to the game. If you HAVEN'T played a Picross title before, this is a great starting point. If you keep the game on one of the easier settings you will get the hang of solving puzzles in no time. The best part of having multiple difficulty levels is once you finish the game on easy, you can switch to medium or hard and have a completely new experience playing all the way through a second time. I've seen people say that $30 is too expensive for a title like this but I think it's perfectly justified. Even if you're completing the puzzles as fast as possible, it'll take at least 30 hours to completely clear everything. This is my first user review. I created an account at Metacritic simply to heap praise on this title. It's criminal how overlooked this title is and will continue to be.",3D: Round 2 is an inventive follow-up to the original title on the DS . it expands on the gameplay whilst refining elements from the original . the game has over 300 puzzles and hours of gameplay .
911.Tribes: Ascend,"Literally too good to succeed. Hi-Rez has been on my **** ever since they screwed this game up and moved on to Smite, which is at best third place in its genre XD. Fun and free, what else do you want? For what it is, a halo-ish futuristic shooter, it delivers enough fun to keep you entertained. good game. I am new to the Tribes franchise and enjoyed the challenge of skiing and trying to aim. I really enjoyed the beta and I'm excited that it's finally out!. In 2011 I stood in line for PAX East and saw a trailer for a game I never thought I'd see. The original Starsiege: Tribes was the first game I ever played online, and I was enthralled by it from my first flag grab. Ascend is very much the inheritor of this classic series' legacy, and though it has modern trappings like regen health and an experience system, these do not greatly detract from the core gameplay. Ascend is easy to start playing, but is just as skill-intensive as it' forebears. You can't just ""press button, win game."" You have to play hard or go home. Ascend's sprawling levels, varied weapons, blinding speeds, and high-flying acrobatics set it in a class above other shooters, and has a variety of PC-friendly features such as support for custom servers. However, the game was seemingly abandoned by Hi-Rez studios in the face of their beloved e-sports baby, Smite. Then, from the blue, came a massive quality of life update that retooled Ascend to be more like its predecessors, removing classes in favor of a simpler armor-based loadout system. These changes were all that old-school Tribes players ever wanted, and that's exactly what we got. The game might not have much of a future from here... but what we have is good.. great game, and not a bit pay to win, like most free games where ripping a, go and try this awesome game good gameplay, have skill and more and looks okay. Another game that bought the ""Bezt gaem ever"" scores for a couple bucks. Sad where the game industry is going nowadays. Yeah, Tribes is certainly something unique, but that doesn't mean its good too. What makes this game promising is the ""fast-paced"" action that is in reality almost uncontrollably hovering (or as they call it ""skiing"") forwards while shooting stuff at people who do that same. Sadly, however, there is no sense of speed whatsoever, and you don't get chills because you're going so fast, mostly because the maps seem like someone accidentally scaling them ten times higher than they should be. The so called ""competitive gameplay"" falls flat by the simple fact that explosives deal an absurdly high damage plus have a huge blast radius which means that when ""skiing"", you hardly ever need to aim, and while indoors, you don't even need to because you'll blow everything in your way to pieces. The CTF is quite interesting, because the flags are, for some reason, keep left out in the open which means a luckier enemy who got quite the speed can dash by and pick it up, while the defenders simply can't go after him because there is no slope they can use to gain speed. And then there are the ""pay to win"" issues. No, don't come with that ""you can unlock anything"" thing, I'd like to unlock new weapons faster than classes, but after some calculations I figured it'd take hundreds of matches to switch my pea shooter that deals no damage to something that can actually do something, while who bought the Game of The Year (brb vomiting) package can get everything on spot, ready to go. Disgusting. I've played about one hour of this but I've already uninstalled it, utterly disappointing. I'll be honest, the only thing I liked about this game is the weapon designs, but those I LOVED.. The worst Tribes game, and ultimately the death of the Tribes series. Ruined by free to play and other nonsense. Class unlocks?! Rifles/smgs/pistols?! They have no place in a Tribes game. R.I.P. Tribes, you'll be missed!. Tribes Ascend is an excellent FPS. The emphasis on mobility makes it faster paced and makes it stand out among other online FPS games. The maps are well designed for this and the graphics are beautiful. Considering it's free to play you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not at least try Tribes Ascend.. Great initial game play. Provides lost of incentive to play again. VERY crappy lvl system that favors player who have been playing longer not skill... crap gaming style. Hi-Rez has the same problem with Smite and tried to fix it by starting all players at lvl 0 but still favors players who have been playing longer. Want more money? Make the game fun for everyone to play.. Well... I'm going to say that this game is great... if you have a powerful engine to run it on. The game runs on Unreal Engine, so it will be a pain in the ass to handle if your computer is a slow as **** computer, but with the right one, it is going to be a blast. I...I...I...I'm going to go play Tribes:Ascend some more. I'll just leave it at here.. I'm writing this fast review after playing the game more than 200 hours . + Competitve game you can easily tell the difference between good and noob player . + fast / smooth and balanced gameplay specially the fly and Ski. + more than 8 class . + very good map designing . + require highly team work . + very good voice chat command . + dedicated servers . + almost no lucky kills in the game you better be good or die . + no camping behind doors or corners or cheap kills you will have to go out and face your opponent . - only 3 active game modes . My personal rating 9.5/10 The best MultiPlayer Game of the generation .. Fast paced shooter with a unique airborne combat/movement ski system. If you like going fast and flying high Tribes is the place to be. Has some of the most satisfying skill-shots you'll experience in a first person shooter. Comes with a great Capture the Flag game mode (highly recommend) and a wide range of classes to play/weapons to unlock. Plus its Free-To-Play. Some Minor Issues: - Pro Snipers can really bog down CTF matches. - Late game can see quite a bit of skilless Orbital Strike spam. - There are some weapon/loadout balance issues here and there. - Minor pay-to-win elements regarding the Engineer and Spy class (must unlock explosive weapons to be effective indoors.) - Some classes are not as well defined as they probably should be. Example, Juggernauts are a long-range bombardment specialists yet these very same weapon loadouts can be godly indoors. - Vehicles, while fun, have very limited effective use due to the airborne nature of combat (vehicle effectiveness is often restricted to a few maps in a few select areas). - Base defenses are pretty easily dealt with which might bother some dedicated Engineer players. - Unlocking weapons/gear without paying cash is a long long long grind (F2P so not all that unexpected). These issues don't stop the game from being fun/addicting, but I they are worth noting.. Fun fast paced game! Great graphics and addictive gameplay! It's great if you're looking for a free but phenomenal game! Totally recommended. I will definitely be playing this game more!. another bad game from hirez, seems more a pay2win than a f2p i bought it for 25 euro before they understood it was a and changing it in f2p.... Worst sh never see.. This game is incredibly fun when i play it with my friends. But whenever i join a lobby with randoms i cant enjoy myself. The pathfinder class ruins ever game mode in this game. I understand he is supposed to be fast, but the fact that in CTF he can literally run laps around the map and cap the flag six time uncontested and run through you 20 turrets without taking a single shot is insane. In TDM he takes the flag and runs laps around the outside of the map and hes so fast the even an entire team of pathfinders cant kill him. Its a fun free game but the fact that this can happen in every game ruins the fun factor and takes out some of the strategy. I enjoy it i really do and i recommend it. Just this one flaw **** the fun out if it sometimes.. BEST Shooter ever. A revolutionary game mechanic. It makes so damn much fun. And: I't IS skill based and NOT Pay to Win. But it's really sad that Hi-Rez abadons Tribes: Ascend. They just said, the community shall do the rest and look for the game. :-/ And the community is not big.. Really hard and frustrating at first, even previous FPS experience doesn't help much. Once you get the gist of it though, it becomes the best shooter ever.. A unique game that, to me, feels like a mix of a first person shooter, a driving game and a flying simulator, though it is mostly a FPS Free to play, with a weapon system that is composed of unlockables and experience points. Though the game has been criticized for having gold and seasonal ""more xp"" passes, I do not find that so bad considering the game is free to play. A ""GOTY"" version of the game has also been released where you get all the items unlocked from the get-go. The game has also been released on steam, which makes it even easier to play. The game is very solid, multiple different roles and an absolutely MAGNIFICENT physics engine. A bit hard to learn but when you get to it, it is tons of fun. The only reason I did not give it a 10 is because some of the maps flawed, though this will most likely be fixed with time. Time to go fast folks!. I was a big fan of the original franchise and played it a lot. This version is super hardcore, but extremely well done. Hi-Rez deserves a lot of credit in this remake.. I would have given this game a perfect score 6 months ago. Since then, however a couple of things have changed. Many of the new weapon ""balances"" will take away a key element of the game, such as the decision to nerf the self-knockback on one of the grenades in the game. That being said, it is still a wonderful multiplayer fps experience, and I would recommend buying the newly released Game of the Year edition to instantly unlock all weapons and perks. You fly through the air using your jetpack and quickly slide along the ground while skiing. It brings a new light on the fps genre in a Call of Duty dominated world and rewards skill-not purchases. The one thing this game needs is voice communication. I understand that many users have been complaining about the difficulty to capture flags. The point is, if a coordinated team is able to specifically time well-organized flag caps, then it is not that hard. To do this, we need voice communication.. This is the coolest game in the world. Everything you do boils down to skill and skill alone, and even if you **** at the game, you can still have tons of fun. The game is incredibly well designed, even to the tiny things. All in all, if you don't like this game, you should go back to playing Halo 3 or whatever it is your get spoonfed for breakfast.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As an old fan of the original Tribes and all of the sequels, I was anticipating good things from this game. I am not disappointed. They captured the feel of the original game play and the mechanics and controls are extremely responsive. Could they improve the game? Sure, but I have no idea how. Sometimes a classic is good enough. Anyone for a blue plate special?. After 510 hours of gameplay, I believe that it's time for me to review this game in it's entirety. For a quick review: Great Graphics, fresh, original gameplay, free, but the freemium model, while not P2W, does aggressively encourage you to purchase premium currency. So, to those of you who aren't aware of *what* Tribes Ascend is, it's a free to play, multiplayer first person shooter with 32 player dedicated servers. Describing Tribes isn't hard, but it sure as hell isn't easy either. Let's focus on the graphical side first, as it's the easiest to explain. Tribes Ascend is an impressive looking game, with models that are painstakingly detailed. However, some of this detail disappears in the terrain textures, as from certain angles it's obvious that the textures tessellates. Animations are smooth, fluid and damn pretty to look at, with your character even angling his body to match rotation of strafing whilst he jets. But this is where we start to run into more serious graphical issues. Tribes is poorly optimised, on account of the Unreal Engine not handling large open environments well without map stitching. As a result, the framerate tanks when observing the vast open maps. Even 2 570s drop to ~45FPS in some areas. Not a problem, but interesting to see. Now let's look at gameplay. The core mechanic of Tribes is that of skiing. The ability to remove friction between you and the ground, and use gravity and jetpacks to attain ridiculous speeds is an absolute blast, and while easy to pick up, extremely difficult to master. Tribes:Ascend is a fairly well balanced (Keyword, FAIRLY) game, with each of the game's 9 classes featuring distinct strengths and weaknesses. Take the Soldier for example. He can cap, but not as fast as a Pathfinder. He can defend the stand, but not as well as a Doombringer or Brute. He can duel, but not as well as a Raider. When you first play, be prepared to die. alot. This is because very few weapons are hitscan, meaning the projectile takes a good deal of time to reach your target. While this isn't an issue on say Battlefield, when other players are whipping about at 200 + kph, it becomes a good bit more difficult. In addition, explosive weapons inherit some of your movement speed when you fire them. If your fire a basic spinfusor, for example, it will fire at ~280kph. But if your moving at 200 when you fire, it will inherit 50% of your momentum, and instead travel at ~380kph. This further raises the skill ceiling for the game, which was already quite high. Finally, let's look at the business model for this game. Here's where most of the game's problems reside for the average gamer. Weapons and equipment are quite expensive, requiring 4800 (not much) to 88000 (much better than closed beta, but still quite high) xp. You can get all FUNCTIONAL items in the game for free, so this game is far from pay to win, and one of the fairest f2p shooter models to date, but unlocking weapons is a long time consuming process (as should be expected of a f2p). You can purchase gold in order to unlock skins, weapons, classes or even voice packs, and the pricing, while a little expensive, isn't draconian. Overall, the business model could do with a little work, but it's by no means pay to win or insultingly expensive. If you want everything unlocked fairly quickly, drop $50 on the game, buy a year of boosted xp, and relish in the xp. As a conclusion, Tribes:Ascend does alot of things right. While it does have several flaws, most of these are minor complaints in comparison. This is by no means a perfect game, but it's the easily the best f2p FPS to date, and easily competes with today's AAA titles for graphic fidelity and gameplay mechanics. Metacritic doesn't allow for x.5 scores, but I'm giving Tribes the benefit of rounding, because of it's original concept, and solid core mechanics.. I just started playing this a couple days ago, and it has been the most fun I've had gaming in a long time. So much different than every other shooter. Extremely fast paced and just downright fun. It is also free to play which is amazing for a game of this caliber. People whining that this game is pay to win are stupid. Yes, you can pay to buy upgrades that help you out but you can also get them by just playing the game.. Yes, it takes a long time to get them without playing, but its FREE. This game could easily retail for $60. Besides, for $20-$30 you can pretty much unlock everything that would be relevant to your play style. For being a free game, this is definitely a must to check out and will be the most refreshing shooter you've played.. Having played Tribes Ascend for 50+ hours now, i can honestly say that this game is, second to Unreal Tournament Classic, THE best FPS Multiplayer ever concieved.. and its f2p.. but boy how i do not care giving the Hi-Rez Studios all of my money. If you have some time, and wish to learn a truly skillful teamplayer FPS, try it!. You would do well to just avoid this. As for the critics I doubt they plug this because its good. They say its good so the public buys. Best to talk to real gamers with years of exp in games So glad I did not try the other tribes, no surprises if this dies of within a few years tbh.. I played this for at least 50 hours in the beta, and have put another hundred in since its been on Steam.....this is a simply amazing game. The first FPS I have every played that focused more on movement than shooting. I know of no better feeling then skiing up the enemies base ramp at 180km an hour, snatching their flag, and turning around on the ski out to spinfuse some **** that thinks he's playing Call of Duty in space suits. Also this is truly free to play and not ""pay-to-win"". This game is hands down the best Free2Play game currently available (and it will stay that way until Survarium comes out, look it up!). There is no way I could give it less than 10- everything about it is superb. The gameplay style is unique and thrilling. No more hours wasted slogging across large maps by foot- fly across them at speeds in excess of 250 km/h! Now, imagine trying to shoot someone as they fly by you at that same speed and you can begin to comprehend how amazing this game really is. There is something for everyone here: straight up 5 on 5 deathmatches, huge 16 vs 16 deathmatches, on man army style fights, capture and hold style gameplay, and of course it's most in depth and well done mode, capture the flag. In capture the flag, there is a huge variety of roles to be played. A flag defender (typically Doombringer) will stand on the flag and has to be knocked off before the flag can be captured- they can also lay down mines and force fields to prevent capture as well. However, their forcefields won't work without the help of generator defenders (typically Technician), who have to set up shop in their teams generator room and protect it. If the generator goes down, so does the whole defense system- turrets, forcefields, radar sensors, vehicle stations, and more. But a good defense is nothing without a good offense, and thus the most integral role of flag cappers (typically Pathfinders) comes into play. Perhaps the most difficult task, they have to make their way through the enemy defenses and escape with the flag. But then the hard part comes of escaping your numerous pursuers- the flag hunters (also typically Pathfinders), whose job is to chase after anyone who manages to steal the flag and retrieve it. However, the flag capper will never get the flag from the flag defenders without the help of the two other roles. The generator attacker role (typically Infiltrators and Raiders) are specially equipped to sneak past enemy defenses and destroy the enemy generator. However this task is one of the most difficult as the generators are often in enclosed spaces and have a lot of health. Should they fail in their task, it remains up to the defense harassers (typically Sentinel and Juggernaut) to soften up enemy defenses around the actually flag itself to allow the flag capper access. This is just one example of the huge amount of team play, tactics, and depth that make this game so good. With just one of those roles not being properly filled, your team's entire strategy can collapse, and there are a lot of roles so each player needs to be contributing in order to win. The games other features are too countless to name them all, but a important one to mention is the huge amount of character customization, including armor, voice packs, skins, weapons, perks, packs, deployables, thrown weapons, and more. You make your character unique and you play it how you want to. I will lastly mention the best part of the game. Quite simply, this is a Free2Play game done right. Every single game-changing item can be obtained without paying a cent. Some of the weapons have quite a grind and can take a week or two to get, but if you want variety fast, there are a bunch of arguably better weapons you can earn in just a day or two. You can have a ton of fun without pulling out your wallet. If you choose to put money into the game, though, the advantages are great. You can get custom skins, voice packs, and of course that weapon you always wanted. Not only that, but every day a new item goes on sale that you can get for anywhere between 25% and 75% off, so if you want to wait and only buy when what you want goes on sale, you can easily get double the value of whatever you paid. In addition, your account becomes VIP as soon as you spend any amount of money on the game (anywhere from 10-50 USD). VIP status gives you +50% exp permanently, so for just a little money you can get a whole lot of value. If you want to get a very high quality game completely free, this is the game for you. If you want to get that same game, but don't mind shelling out a few bucks to make it even awesomer, this is still the game for you. Download this game as soon as you finish reading this, if you haven't already. What are you waiting for?. Hi-Rez has succeeded with an amazing game that is faithful to the original tribes franchise. Graphically, things are average. Gameplay, and overall user emjoyment is where the game thrives. Hitscan was phased out during the later beta period, and now this is one of the few shooter games that has no hacks available. Pure skill game with E-sports affiliation.. This game is to the closest to the original I've played. It really is a polished game. It's was polished when I started playing in Beta. If you like FPS and flying this game is awesome. It's certainly on a level with TF2.. Tribes is fun, fast paced and free. What more can you ask for. The movement mechanics free up the need to have free run, jump or sprint in place for that shooter lone wolf chase feel. The guns i'll admit are in need of some battlefield beefiness but are more than made up for by the visuals and the effects of the guns. Overall Tribes: Ascend is what halo or COD never were and will hold its own in the game community for years to come.. A very fun and addicting multiplayer FPS, with very fast paced combat, different classes, and it's free! The reward system is similar to League of Legends, after every match you play you get EXP, which you can use to buy new weapons, you get more EXP for winning a match, and doing well. Or you could buy Gold with real money and use that to unlock things. As you use weapons they level up, providing new bonuses, like more damage, better fire rate, accuracy, ect. It's very similar to Quake. This is a game worth playing if you're sick of FPS games like ""Battlefield: Generic Modern Warfare 6"". I hate to review games based on their business models, but Tribes: Ascend is just another low quality production with extremely generic maps (no interacts with environment available), mediocre technical work and low production value on top of being a traditional F2P. While the main complaint about F2P is the P2W (pay-to-win) argument, it isn't reason it's bad. F2P models generally feel cheap because in most cases it is. Low production value has always been a hallmark of F2P games with the exception of those made by Valve (TF2 and DOTA2).. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is how Free 2 Play should be done! Tribes Ascend has such a fine tuned and well crafted experience that it is a real treat to play, and is quite addictive. This isn't anything new with a lot of Free 2 Play games, a lot of them are addictive and a treat to play INITIALLY. That's what the model is about, its designed to **** you in to pay. However, Tribes Ascend does not do that. The game doesn't force a brick wall on you to prevent advancement without constant grinding or your credit card. It certainly does take a lot longer to advance in this game without paying than with, but paying doesn't really give you a quantifiable advantage. What paying does is it will give you quick access to some great classes, weapons, and gear that can be very helpful, but does not make you play better. This game still requires skill and dedication over anything else to master. The game is 100% playable without paying a cent. Every thing in the game that is unlockable can be done with the experience points, you dont have to buy the gold for ANYTHING. However, because of how good the game is, the sheer quality of the gameplay, graphics, controls, and variety of content, you will still want to pay for some gold (if you can afford it), not necessarily to level up faster, but because you just ended up playing a game that's so damn good, it would morally feel like piracy if you didn't pay. Now THAT'S how to do a Free 2 Play game!. Pure multiplayer goodness. Fast gameplay, beautiful graphics, great controls. Only problem I got was taht some stuff are expensive as hell but you don't really need them, it's all about the skill.. It's comeback of very fresh series and great evidence that games similiar to old school FPS games (Increadibly high skill gap, very fast gameplay) are still great and haven't become worse. It lacks in reminder of how great singleplayer campaigns can be made without overscripting, but who cares! Even having multiplayer only game is enough! The fresh gameplay works fantastically. It doesn't work as well in closed enviroments when compared to open enviroments due to the game's explosive focus. But it still works. Every kill feels very satisfying, making you play the game longer and longer. But sure this can't be just praising of the game? Well, there are few weapons, which would take forever to unlock without using real money. Yes, there needs to be a way for the developers to have money, but when the only primary explosive weapon of a specific class is Pay-2-Use, it does get a little annoying. As a good thing though, the game isin't Pay-2-Win, even with weapons like that. Can I honestly find any other bad things? No. So just like many others, I recommend this game. Its quality flies over 99.9999% of the other FPS games released today.. Fast, Frantic, Tactical, and downright brutal at times. This game brought me back into FPS games after a 2 year hiatus. after trying tribes i went to try the current FPS heavy hitters, CoD, Battlefield 3. I even tried the F2P competitors, Blacklight retribution, Combat Arms, etc. No other FPS I've played since the original tribes games holds a candle to this. And no other franchise in FPS history has ever kept my attention, and kept me going like tribes has. SHAZBOT FOREVER!. Great free to play game. It's NOT too much a ""pay to win"" game, and that's the main pro i've found. The game is original (different to normal FPS), very funny and skill based: at level 1 i killed many high level guys only with the default weapons. Of course unlocking new stuff is a bit long without paying anything, but it could be done.. This is a great game that anyone who likes FPS should give a try. Yes it is a free to play but if you like it I recommend spending $20 and unlock a few classes all the way. While I do not think this a pay to win it is nice to have all the guns of your favorite classes. They do a good job updating and balancing the guns, nothing seems like the must have or only use gun which is great.. This game is tightly designed around speed and fun and I couldn't have dreamed of a better version of the game (actually thought it might **** like the previous version but it's actually super awesome). Wait, why am I wasting time writing this review? Gotta go fast!Fantastic game, free to play but not pay to win. Its a fun game. Many complain about the free to play mechanic, but unlike many others, you dont HAVE to buy ingame purchases to be good at it, you can unlock everything by simply PLAYING THE GAME ITSELF. If you do want to buy anything, its the Steam Starter Pack. It gives you everything you need to well, begin, and even if you didnt buy this, there are promotions to get you gold for free. I myself did buy the Starter Pack on sale and it did give me a good start, but in all reality if i played for about a week i could have gotten all of the items in the pack, besides the gold of course. It is high in quality, even though the only problem i may have is there should be just a tiny bit more terrain details, very few maps have endless hills, but id rather have that than flatlands. If you think a weapon is going to come out you want? Save up XP! Dont bother listening to those who hate because of the F2P mechanic, ignore that and have fun.. Like Team Fortress 2, great free-to-play with item system and not all items being unlocked at once unlike old games. Hi-Rez Studios has found out how to correctly balance Tribes: Ascend and avoiding pay-to-win ""gameplay."" Tribes: Ascend is amazing.. One of the greatest FPS's to ever hit game scene. I have thousand of hours played in this and probably never gonna stop, got everything already unlocked and my most favorite gear Is soldier with spinfusor, pistol and short fuse grenade. Stuff you can get pretty much for free or is part of starter pack, so no there can't even be talk of Pay2Win. My 4:1 KDR says so.. Had loads of fun with this game at beta. Then it just got worse. And worse. And worse. And worse with every single update they released which is odd considering Hi-Rez studios pride themselves on listening on the community which has clearly not been the case for this game. Originally, they threw a few mixed updates both with good and bad, nerfing some of the obnoxious explosive weapons but then they tugged down the weapons that requires actual aiming and started adding more explosives instead with not the slightest hint of concern for balancement in regards to rewarding players for aim or tactics. I thought that all the good stuff had to be in the paying section so I threw them a couple of bucks to try more content just to be met with even worse weapons, including a set of daggers that you could throw for around 200-300 damage each depending on enemy armor quite slowly with extremely precise aiming and timing required or pick up the standard silenced SMG that spews out hundreds of rounds per minute for 50 damage each. I asked for a refund not too long afterwards, explaining my disappointment and they insisted on having my account closed due to their inability to retract purchases manually which is a shame because now I've lost all hope of returning to the game once things have been polished but hey, at least they honored people refunds which is more than I can say for most US companies right now.. One of the best shooters i' ve played in the last years. Very fast with great weapons and ah fair balance between the classes. And you earn enough XP during the game to get your favourite weapons instead of buying them.. Honestly this game is more of a let down compared to Tribes 2 and part of that deals with the fact that it's Free 2 Play. There's no dedicated servers with custom maps which is always a great thing. The graphics are somewhat boring and not really up to par with current games. You either have to buy a Starter Pack or play non stop to get enough xp to unlock items or classes. If I'm gonna be doing that I would rather do this on a MMO then a fps. I would have rather this be a full price game with the wish that the overall feel and play of the game would be alot better then what it is. Playing this game makes me miss Tribes 2 and want to play that more then this tribes. Even though Tribes 3 was short lived I would even would rather play that then this game. Heck even the music in Tribes 2 really got you into the feel of the game.. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game. Pay to win game.. Tribes: Ascend is probably the only online FPS I've actually enjoyed playing, no other game has you capping t","ascend is a halo-ish futuristic shooter that delivers enough fun to keep you entertained . it's easy to start playing, but is just as skill-intensive as its forebears . the game was seemingly abandoned by Hi-Rez in the face of their beloved e-sports baby, Smite ."
912.Asgard's Wrath 2,"Haven't finished yet, but it's a worth sequel of the first VR masterpiece! I would never imagined to play such a cool RPG on Quest 3! A must-game for every VR collection!. People say this game is like Zelda and I do agree, but the puzzle part is just not so great in this game. Almost half of the puzzle feels like a chore to do rather than fun. The boss fights on the other hand are the best part of this game. I think I have just forced myself to get through the puzzles just to get to those fights, they are truly epic, and I have yet to find any other game that has done it this good. Overall, this is a good attempt to standalone AAA game. I have spent 28 hours to beat it, but I feel like a lot of it are just padding. If I just count all the good parts, this game is like 10 hours.. It's better than AW1 in case of mechanics (weapons are colliding now with surroundings and each other, space for crafting junk is almost unlimited), however story and atmosphere still doesn't keep me interested in playing this game.. Wow. What an amazing experience this game was. The main game took me 59 hours to finish and there was never a boring moment! The world is huge and mostly interesting with little obstacle courses spread out and amazingly well designed puzzles. Combat is fun, but not too sophisticated. The character building system is fun and the follower characters are also fun to have by your side. Boss battles are fun and the difficultly level is very reasonable. I was able to beat most bosses in 3 to 5 tries. The story is fine, but nothing amazing. Pretty standard story with a villain and victims along the way. The weapons, armor and crafting are all fun and not overwhelming to understand and use. Even the lore was somewhat interesting. Controls are great and there are plenty of fun gameplay mechanics The only cons I can think of are that there are occasional performance issues and stuttering, but it's infrequent and doesn't affect the overall experience too much. There were a couple times during battle where the game froze for about 15 seconds. The game crashed on me once. There were some issues with the map screen not loading correctly or even coming up at all. The worst bug I encountered was a door that wouldn't open even though I hit the switch to open it. To get past the door, I had to go into the map screen and warp to a warp point beyond the door, which was ridiculous. Also, during a boss battle, I got stuck inside a pillar in the battle arena and couldn't get out, and the boss killed me. Even considering these bugs, I had a fantastic time with this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs, especially in VR!. Do you like weapons and armor?! You should play AG2 and choose a side! Oops! you chose the wrong side, There is nothing you can do to change sides, and nothing you can do to earn that gear after the month is over. You will never see that gear in your inventory. Good luck next month. Heres a nova stone.. One of the most important AAA games in VR and for the Meta Quest. Its heavily inspired by the God of War series, and if you like GOW you should feel right at home here. VR Games like this one are worth paying the full price, and i hope we get to see MORE of them in the future!. This game is the most important game I've played since Grand Theft Auto 3. It revolutionizes the gaming industry and will change things forever. And it's faaaaaar from perfect, but I gotta say I've been less than enamored with video games as I've got older. They are still amazing, but this VR stuff just hits different when done correctly. It doesn't feel like a tech demo, or a Beat Saber style of game; this is a full fledged video game showcasing what VR platform is truly capable of. I cannot wait for more games to build off this experience, which is awesome. I am only 25 hours in and I cant wait to be done at work just to get back to putting in an hour of two in this game when I get home. The 9 isn't a 10 due to some problems with VR more than the game itself; it's a long setup each time I play, hard to show others the brilliance, and a bit confusing on how to move around and utilitize the upgrade systems, or exactly what the rift is? But the controls are so fluid, the fighting and action is fun (a 180 spin would be welcome), the story and voice acting is fun, and it even does boss battles well! Awesome, Zelda like puzzles... I could go on, but you NEED to play this game for yourself; just play intro level, grab a virtual beer, then see that first giant boss fought on an iceburg... And you'll understand just how amazing virtual reality gaming can actually be.. This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played on VR, the story, the puzzles, the fighting, it's all incredible, with over 100 hours of gameplay, and story. The combat system is great, the story is amazing, the puzzles feel great to solve. If there was one thing I were say that wasn't the best in this game is once is that it felt a bit rushed towards the end. Overall the best VR game that I have ever played.. The biggest game VR has ever seen. I’ve played this thing for 25h and feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface. My mom has played it for nearly 40h and has cleared like half the content I did but she is still in love with this thing haha. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't understand the enthusiasm for this very average game. The storytelling is bad, there are portals (= loading) at every turn, the fights are repetitive, the world is empty, the ""puzzles"" are bogus, it's not incredibly beautiful, in short, I'm bored to tears.. After the 12 hour mark you start to see the ambition and scope of this game. Combat is awesome, once you start to skill up it’s absolutely fantastic. I hate puzzles in games but in VR it’s a lot more enjoyable and enhances the experience here. After the update for Quest 3 I am so happy with the graphics , it made everything so clear and crisp. For a standalone game it’s masterfull what they have accomplished.. An extremely immersive game with an exciting story and lots of content. That’s why VR was invented. Graphics should never be as important as gameplay. and the gameplay is wonderful here. 10/10!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece. If you suffer from VR motionsickness and need a teleporting option please don't give the game a 1. If you suffer from motion sicknes then you should probably not be playing VR in the first place. Also it should definitely not be the driving force of the review being a 10 or a 1. This game is truly a masterpiece with so much content, and even more to come. The four playable characters all have their special perks that makes them unique to use. The environments are filled with so much life and personality. Truly the most impressive VR game I have played. Well done Sanzaru games!. It runs amazing on my quest 2. I have no clue how they got this game to run so well on this headset. Yes there are quite a few stutters when fighting heavy and in certain areas but the gameplay and core mechanics of the game is amazing. It is loaded with content not seen before in a VR game let alone standalone. Do not listen to reviews saying graphics are bad... they are sadly mistaken. The review that bothered me the most was trying to compare it to PSVR2 which has no game with this much content for this price point. There are a lot of puzzles and I am not into puzzle games but it has something for everyone which is why I still feel fine giving it a 9/10. Anyone hating on this game has not put the hours in to truly give it a chance. Hell I got 20+ hours in and I am not even half way through this game. The content is insane and the story is actually really interesting. It makes me want a quest 3 badly! This game is gonna be a huge reason I upgrade!. Shockingly bad graphics on the Quest 3, like really bad. The glowing reviews feel a bit disingenuous, especially when compared with an actually good looking game like Red Matter 2.. it's overall an awesome game, the combat mechanics are amazing and the story and voice acting are both great. I am only giving it a 9 because of issues i'm having running it on the quest without linking it to the pc.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is amongst the best RPG I've played on any medium. The only VR game which tops Half Life Alyx for me.. Asgard’s Wrath 2 is a game-changer in the virtual reality gaming landscape. Despite occasional performance issues, the sheer depth, variety, and innovation it brings to the table make it a must-play for VR enthusiasts. As a landmark title, it exemplifies the potential of VR RPGs, offering a journey that captivates players for hours on end.. Doesn't support teleporting, therefore not playable at all for people suffering from VR sickness.. Had to make an account just to review this game. About 20 hours in and barely scratched the surface. Not only that but they announced they will be updating the game to run at a higher fps as well as better graphics. Amazing support. Easily the best VR game out there. I can’t believe how much content there is in this game while still feeling fresh. This is an amazing achievement. Having this huge world looking they way it does on a cell phone chip is a miracle. There is so much variety and charm. In my opinion, best VR game to date.. Incredible masterpiece. Art Style (yes, even without q3 optimization), content, story, mechanics, performance- this Titel Stands out in every single category. Must have, must buy, must play.. I have to write this review to balance out whatever hype train is going on with this game, I am currently playing through it and have to say, whilst it is playable, and quite enjoyable, its mostly underwhelming in terms of mechanics and graphics, perhaps I have been spoiled by the PSVR2 and I know its potentially unfair to compare as the headset is relying on a mobile chipset but the textures are poor, the movement and un-seamless loading is clunky and drags you out of immersion, sorry, its an enjoyable play through but I dont understand the hype. One of the best VR games out there, If you like Zelda or Skyrim you will have a blast with this game. AW2 is super impressive especially since its on a standalone (Quest 2 or 3) device. There is so much depth within the RPG mechanics, so much to explore in the vast world, and so much variation with the characters you play with. The visuals are very impressive on the Quest. It doesn't have the visual fidelity that you would get on a PCVR, but that is expected. The art direction does a great job with the limitations of the hardware. 10 out of 10, would recommend!. Common VR W Awesome puzzles and combat, huge expansive world to explore with different weapons and abilities to find.. I have been an avid VR enthusiasts since the original Oculus Rift and PSVR1 and while I have had many ""wow"" or ""holy $*@!"" moments through the last few years those moments grew fewer as playing games like Half Life, Skyrim, Atrobot, Rush of Blood, Stormlands, Resident Evil 7 to name a few, spoiled me from appreciating the small titles. I can say that Asgards Wrath 2 gave me more of those moments than I've had in years in just the first 5 to 10 hours of the game. It seems to take the best practices from many games and builds them into something more integrated and complex as a proper RPG. The combat is fantastic and once you start upgrading and crafting it gets even better. Having a companion that can fight at your side and transform into a giant panther to ride around on it immensely cool. Some of the environmental puzzles are very clearly influenced by the last 2 God of War games but are really fun. The God mode puzzles are reminiscent of Moss and once they start incorporating some of the mechanics like timing a wall run from a trap while needing to time the puzzles presents a nice challenge progression curve. The menus are easy to navigate and things like a fast travel system from the map make it quick to get around and everything has been pretty intuitive. The roguelike mode is also fun and challenging, but gives you a chance to improve your combat skills and there are unlockabke upgrades that carry forward helping you make it further everything. This game is definitely worthy of being classified as a system seller and let's hope it does sell well so that we can continue to see more content and full games as large as this going forward. Sets a new bar for what the gold standard of VR gaming and RPGs are.. I had zero interest in Asgard's Wrath 2. It looks like a PS3 era game, I can't do PCVR with it and must use the standalone oculus 3, and the art & cover just didn't interest me. But moly moly did this game surprise me! This game is actually a top-notch full-length RPG on the VR where you acquire weapons and powers to defeat non-Marvel Loki. The powers feel 'oh so good', especially this God of War 2 axe that returns to my hand when i recall it. The devs really nailed the satisfying feeling of throwing a hammer and recalling it to your hand, or whipping the axe around to slay enemies. I want spoil it but there are wayyy more weapons that also feel satisfying. Other VR titles, THIS is how you do VR cinematics. They actually hired good voice actors like mah man, Matt Mercer. This game is like 100+ hours, and not like these other VR tech demos! Also i complained that this only does native oculus quest 3 with no PC, but it really didnt matter at all because this game looks great once i was inside the game. This game surprised me like Baldurs Gate 3 surprised me and truly deserves the title of 'System Seller'. Once they do PCVR with this, I would rank it better than Half-Life Alyx.. I really dont play many vr games on quest since they all feel like shirt tech demos aside from resident evil 4 and a few others, but this game is the best of them all. Only complaint is that it isnt on pcvr for better graphics like the first. I rarely see such perfection in a VR Game. This is a must-have for a quest owner. The attention given to the details, at the physics, story and everything else, sets this game as one the best. I've never enjoyed VR gaming so much, except when I played Resident Evil 4 and Half Life Alyx. EDIT: I gave a 9, but after more hours of gameplay I need change to 10. I love this game. Finally we have a real RPG in VR. For years we have had devs try to make them but they all feel shallow and not as expansive as actual RPGs. This finally changes that and gives us one of the RPGs ever made and it’s in VR!. I dont give a 10 often. But this has to be the game of the year and one of best VR games ever made (alongside Half Life alyx and flight simulator). It isnt actually my type of game to be honest. But it still offers an incredible audio visual VR experience with great game mechanics and VR interactions. It offers many hours gameplay. And later on an quest 3 graphucs update will increase the experience further. Small drawbacks are the save options (that dont really excist).. After watching the flat trailer, I didn't expect to be so exceptionally pleased with the VR setting and am extremely positively surprised. With QuestOptimizer, you can significantly increase the resolution and frame rate. The CPU is set to Unlocked, and the GPU to Insane, with the frame mode on Dynamic. QuestOptimizer monitors the temperature, but that's not a problem. It does consume more battery, but I have three original magnetic batteries from BoboVR for the headset, so it's absolutely no issue.. Best game on Quest by far and the best VR game in years. if you have a quest, you have to play this game. Pretty blown away by this game. I went in expecting a solid VR-RPG that pushed the Quest 2 to its limits. What we instead got is one of the most groundbreaking VR games to date. Nearly 134 hours of story gameplay and endless an Rogue-lite mode make this game a must play for anyone who plays VR. It takes inspiration from games like God of War 2018, Half-Life Alyx, Zelda and so many more historic games. Not only does it borrow from these gaming juggernauts, but the game actually improves on many of the mechanics. This game fixes a lot of the locomotion issues from HLA's ladder and stair climbing. It also has the greatest use of cutscenes in VR period. Things are happening all around you and no matter where you look, something interesting is going on. I applaud Sanzaru games for this achievement and I cannot wait to see what else oculus studios games are cooking.. This game is really impressive in terms of combat system, story and gameplay. I have never played a VR game where I have been really immersed as much as I did with Asgard's Wrath 2. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has a Meta Quest headset. I think this is the first genuine blockbuster game on the Meta Quest.","i have spent 28 hours to beat this game, but i feel like a lot of it are just padding . combat is fun, but not too sophisticated . the game took me 59 hours to finish and there was never a boring moment ."
913.Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10/10 dog **** garbage game. First ever bad review for this **** up beyond comprehension.. This is hands-down the single best piece of DLC content that has ever been produced! It was so magnificent as to spawn an entire AAA game of its own, which is almost inconceivable in the modern era.. The best Borderlands 2 DLC from my point of view. They clearly put an effort to build a unique universe, which was lacking in the previous extensions. Though the game mechanics could have been changed to better fit the background, the table top RPG ambiance works well.. some of the best soundtracks ever to be displayed in a DLC together with a load of fun and a lot, i repeat a LOT of references make this DLC a must have for every fan of role-playing games and firtst person shooters. Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is the best expansion to hit Borderlands 2 yet. Excellent loot, great gunplay, and a funny story make this dlc worth it's price. Tiny Tina's assault on dragons keep is a great D.L.C addition to an already amazing game. It adds a new twist to gameplay in the form of ""magic grenades"" grenades that automatically recharge over time. The part of this downloadable content that disapoints is lack of innovation in boss fights. As a whole Dragons Keep is an amazingly fun D.L.C that is a worthwhile buy mainly for the amusing story and the incredibly useful Magic Grenades.. This campaign is hilarious. The D&D theme coupled with Maria Bamford's (Tiny Tina) humor make this campaign so fun to play. Tina changing things around in the middle of the game was particularly hilarious. And the ending managed to be touching and hilarious at the same time.. Best ever DLC of all other DLC's made for the Borderlands 2. This DLC is great. Love the storyline. Exploration's unique. I've endured one of the true.. noble gaming experience of Borderlands 2. Great DLC. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This DLC is actually quite **** the graphics aren't bad. If you like Borderlands, this is worth a shot. There are new enemies and new weaponry, and Tiny Tina remains awesome.. Once a year, there comes a DLC that is truly brilliant. This is the DLC for 2013. It has some of the best quests to come to Borderlands 2 including a quest where the Vault Hunter slaps a Joffery look alike.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. I grew up with old school RPGs and Dungeons and Dragons, and as an unabashed geek, loved the inside (or not?) jokes that permeated the game. You can tell that this was a labor of love for Gearbox, as they incorporated new (not reskinned) character models, great voice acting, and homage to tropes spanning the breadth of geekdom. From the New-U station snarking ""At least it's not too easy!"" to orcs screaming at ""Humies,"" to the spatula samurai that reminded me of Kingdom of Loathing, to... well, there's a lot to appreciate. And appreciate it, I did. The gameplay was challenging, but what drove me to marathoning through the DLC was the story. Gearbox did a great job spotlighting Tiny Tina more than the game or previous DLCs without a doubt, she's still the same ""what did she just say?"" character you remember, but also a child mourning the loss of friends, and escaping the flood of emotion through her imagination (took that part from the Escapist, but it's so very true). As a working professional with a family, I have very little time to enjoy games as I did when I was younger. I made a point to stick with this expansion after the first 10 minutes. And the game rewarded me for it with challenge, laughs, bittersweet reminisces, and nostalgia aplenty. Thanks, Gearbox.. This DLC is just awesome and thats not just because tiny tina is the greatest. A lot of jokes about Game of Thrones, Skyrim, Lord of the Rings and so on... BUY IT!. Take one of the best co-op games (and series) ever made, add in a ""Dungeons & Dragons-esque"" game idea, add in all the extra characters you love (Torque is one of the best characters ever) and you have arguably the best DLC for any game ever. Much of what makes Borderlands great (breaking down the 4th wall) is heightened in this DLC, and if you are a fan of Borderlands you will love this. Not to mention the new areas add new enemies and give you a ""Fable"" feel. If you like Borderlands and you miss out on this it really is a travesty because this just makes you love the game more and hope they continue the DLC and hopefully announce a new Borderlands for the next console generation.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tiny Tina is probably the best addition to The Borderlands Universe so I love seeing a DC centered around her. The graphics are unique much like Hammerlock's DLC was but the story and exploration here is sooo much better. It's the first time in a Borderlands game where I don't feel like I am thrown into a sandbox area and its refreshing. It actually feels like a linear adventure with little side roads along the way which is refreshing to the usual Borderlands game dynamic of grab quest, run either north, east, south, west to complete, and then backtrack to complete quest. It is easily the best DLC to Borderlands 2. I would rank them as: 1) Dragon Keep- Fantastic 2) Pirate Captain Scarlett DLC Good to Great 3) Torgue Campaign- Average to Good (mainly because of Mr. Torgue) 4) Hammerlock- Forgettable other than the graphic design","Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is the best expansion to hit Borderlands 2 yet . it adds a new twist to gameplay in the form of ""magic grenades"" grenades that automatically recharge over time . as a whole Dragons Keep is an amazingly fun D.L.C that is a worthwhile buy ."
914.Alundra,"Dude, stop doing those annoying puzzles. Can I fight a little now? Or can I buy equipment? It's been almost 4 hours and I have a f***g kitchen knife in my hand. I've been dealing with puzzles and searching for NPCs since the beginning of the game.ENOUGH! I'm opening a chest. There are 10 gold coins inside the chest. If I cut 2 grasses, I already collect 10 gold. Also enoying.. Trying to be like a Zelda game. This game is not even 1/1000 of Link to the Past from 8 years ago.. Way too hard, i really struggled with it until i got stuck and had to abandon it. But really good memories.. It could have been an awesome metroidvania if not for those dreadful puzzles everywhere and unforgiving platforming. Jumping platforms is difficult, but not because you need to calculate precise timing or have lighting fast reflexes, but because camera angle makes it very hard to predict where you will land. Top down or isometric view platformers all suffer from this issue. There's no analog stick support, so good luck making precise moves diagonally with a D-pad and missing diagonal movement animation adds to this issue. So the best experience you can get from Alundra, is when level is built like a traditional side scroller. Too bad it rarely happens. But if you have enough patience, you can have fun with this game. Pixel art is gorgeous, world if full of secrets and exploration, and you'll keep returning to visited areas to unlock previously closed paths all the time. Story itself is also quite interesting, weaved nicely into gameplay. Zelda-like music fits perfectly. In the end, Alundra aged not too great, but I really would love to see it reimagined with better controls.. Masterpiece ! the only Zelda clone that is better then Zelda it self. Really hope by a miracle we get a remaster of this. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A perfect game. Tight platforming, great story, interesting characters, collectables, great bosses and puzzles. It's Zelda for the PlayStation but better. Unfortunately I've played it too many times and the challenge is lost XD. The perfect 2d game in an anti-2d era. Alundra out-Zeldas Zelda. A must play for any action rpg fan or those who love intricate and difficult yet fair games. A true masterpiece that is frequently under-appreciated.. 2D Zelda fans, get on this! Alundra is the 32-Bit Zelda Nintendo never made. Swords, bombs, arrows, the fire cane, it's all here! An evolving story, beautiful aesthetics, a massive overworld, and over twenty dungeons make this a beefy and challenging offering that any Zelda fan should be able to sink their teeth into. The main way Alundra deviates from the zelda formula is with with platforming. Unlike Zelda, you can jump up to higher planes. This gives the moment-to-moment gameplay a whole different feel that in my opinion, more closely resembles 3D zelda than 2D. Being able to climb around the environment connects you to the world in ways that 2D zelda never has. This is used for puzzles, exploration, and combat. The downside of this is that Alundra is an isometric 2D game so depth perception can require some trial and error. I suspect this will be a sore spot for many people but I loved it and it made the game stand out as more than a Zelda clone. The other ways Alundra deviates from Zelda are in its story and dream sequences. The story feels like a midpoint between JRPG's and Zelda. A village is under attack from monkeys and demons and it's up to you to save everyone. The story makes some dark turns throughout but that and its excellent dialogue will stick with you for some time. Throughout the game, many villagers experience awful nightmares that threaten their lives. At these moments, you are able to enter the villager's mind and play a dungeon based on their thoughts. These start small but quickly escalate into full-scale dungeons, on top of the many dungeons you'll play in the overworld as well. While I absolutely loved this game and recommend it to any Zelda fan, it is not perfect. First things first, this game is hard and long. Be prepared for many of these puzzles to kick your butt. The combat isn't too hard but you'll need to constantly stock up on healing items in the early game, as you are booted back to a save point when you die. Alundra is also very very long. I clocked in at over 40 hours and honestly, I think it's too long, with the dream dungeons feeling particularly like padding. I'm just not sure these needed to be full-fledged 1-2 hour dungeons... Anyway, given that there are nearly 25 dungeons, Alundra can be exhausting to play in long bursts, as it throws you into one dungeon after the next. The main problem with this is that the overworld isn't big enough and there aren't enough ability upgrades to support this many dungeons. By the time I was halfway through Alundra, I'd seen 90% of its overworld, lessening the sense of Adventure. Also, Zelda has always been smart to give you a new ability in each dungeon, even if it is formulaic. This gives each dungeon its own identity and keeps the gameplay fresh. Alundra simply doesn't have this, giving you a new ability only every 2 or 3 dungeons and most of those abilities having very limited use. While all the dungeons are good and they do have good aesthetic theming, they all blend together from gameplay standpoint. It's not the end of the world but it can make the game a slog at times. There's a 10-15 hour section in the middle where the only new item you get is the bow and arrow and you use it solve exactly one puzzle! My other big gripe with Alundra would be that it loves to hold your hand. Much like Twilight Princess, Minish Cap, or Okami, it is very specific about what you do in what order. You'll often need to talk to a person in order to trigger another conversation in order to trigger a dream dungeon in order to go to a real dungeon. It's just a shame it doesn't let you explore its world and conquer its dungeons at your own pace. This greatly diminishes the sense of adventure and can make Alundra feel overbearing. Hell, I got stuck in the prologue because I needed to talk to some guy twice in two different rooms to trigger a cutscene! These frustrating JRPG moments blocked my progress and drove me to a guide far more than the actual puzzles which is a shame. Thankfully, Alundra finally takes the training wheels off in its last third, allowing you to get abilities early and get an optional sword upgrade but all this is too little, too late. A few other minor problems would be that the combat difficulty is all over the place, and that money quickly loses its purpose with only a few expensive items to buy, and the poor control scheme means you'll constantly be pausing and switching out equipment but these didn't impact my enjoyment much. I realize I've spent much of this review complaining but Alundra is simply fantastic. If you can get past all these problems then you'll find one of the best Zelda-like games out there. If you love LTTP and Minish Cap, then you need to play Alundra.. + nozin t envy d zelda +damn kul - som puzles r try and failure (fkn blu orbs) - tipical respawn chambers/enemies - weak story/town/xaractrs. Alundra is one of my childhood masterpiece, the atmosphere is outstanding, if you're a pure soul, you'll fall in dream or nightmare thank's to Alundra's story, literally. Not a 10 just because sometimes an empty, and not exceptional gameplay. But never mind, the adventure worth all.. Gameplay - The gameplay design was excellent, like a cross between Landstalker (its even more obscure spiritual predecessor) and Zelda, but much more hardcore than both. The gameplay was very well-designed, in almost every area, from the puzzles, platforming and combat to the open world, levels and dungeons. The gameplay was very difficult (more so than Landstalker, Zelda, or even Soulsborne), though not in an unfair way, but in a manner that rewards player skill and logical thinking. The game's difficulty, however, limited its accessibility for many players. Story - The story design was also excellent. It has some of the best storytelling ever written for a video game. The plot, in some ways, foreshadowed Paprika and Inception, dealing with a similar dream-walking theme, but in a fantasy world and in a much darker manner. Despite the bright art design, the story is very dark and unforgiving (like classic Gundam, and foreshadowing Game of Thrones). The script is also very well-written, thanks to the great localization by Working Designs. The story was also well-integrated into the gameplay, with dream levels designed around character psyche. Graphics - The graphics was criticized at the time for being 2D in an industry that was moving towards 3D. But looking back, its beautiful 2D sprite-work and bright art design has aged better than the 3D games of that era. The anime cutscenes were also well-animated, and I prefer its '90s anime style over the modern anime style we see in modern Japanese games. Audio - The music soundtrack still sounds great to this day. Almost every piece suits the scenes and levels. And the soundtrack is also great to listen to on its own. Conclusion - A criminally underrated PS1 action/adventure/RPG from Matrix Software, Alundra is one of the best games I've ever played. This was a masterpiece of game design, excelling in almost every area, from the gameplay and the story to the graphics and the music.. Great and epic battles, terrific and captivating atmosphere, gorgeous retro soundtrack and charismatic characters. This is Alundra. It's gameplay is perfect: The ""let's explore this world"", with deadly dungeons and complex puzzles. Once finished, you may never forget such well designed game.. There are so many words that can describe Alundra that I think there are not enough space here to write! I can only say PLAY Alundra, this is a must play game for everyone who likes a good history, RPG, Puzzle, Adventure and the felt that you are inside the game *-*. GO AND PLAY!. I think 1997 was the best year ever for quality videogames, Alundra (or, as originally named ""The adventures of Alundra"") makes no exception to this. This games even now in 2012 still shows how a game should be done. There is only one word to describe the game in its complex and this word is ""MASTERPIECE"". I've put at that time a lot of faith in its follow-up Alundra 2 which instead disappointed me as hell, the first one keeps being unrivaled and aside from the first half hour of game that could seem a little slow the game rocks till the end in a progression of well balanced mix of RPG, exploration and puzzle solving with some rare ""finger-knotting"" steps, a compelling soundtrack and the ability to keeps alive the wish to play. I live in Europe and if someone shouldn't come out with something that could only stay aside at the same level of the first Alundra I'll be really glad to have the chance of downloading and re-playing it on my PS3 system, unfortunately is not currently available in Europe. It has the same ""magic taste"" of FF7 for the lucky ones who played it at the right time, if you knows what I mean you definitely can't miss this one. I don't care if it could seem ""old"", it's ""GREAT"" first thing first, even now in 2012 we NEED a team that could send 3D-eye-candy garbage to hell and make game like this one cause the main reason for a game to exist is to let users HAVE FUN not to bore them with increasingly ""realistic"" graphics without soul, yes that's the word this is an old game with a huge SOUL, one of my dreams is to play another adventure like this. I'm gonna rating this title as it were newly released cause I've played it at that time and I've to say that for many reasons is still unsurpassed, a new same-style game would be over-welcome, in the meanwhile this is still a 10/10 game.","alundra is the only Zelda clone that is better than Zelda it self . pixel art is gorgeous, world if full of secrets and exploration . story is also quite interesting, weaved nicely into gameplay ."
915.Lunar 2: Eternal Blue,"Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: AWESOME.. My favorite RPG on the PS1. Characters are all interesting and likable, and serve their purpose within the function of the party. The story can tug at your heartstrings at times, and the art and anime-esque cutscenes are beautiful.. Lunar 2 : EBC doesn't quite come to par with the first game but if you've played Lunar 1 : SSSC then you'll most likely love this one as well. It just feels like the Return of the Jedi compared to A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back. If you know what I mean... Great game nevertheless ! I own both SSSC and EBC and I regularly do a full play-through of one or the other every year or so. Whenever I talk to someone who doesn't know Lunar, I like to compare it to ""if Miyazaki had written and directed a JRPG"". The relatively low sales of Lunar 1 and 2 for the PlayStation make them rather expensive to buy today, but for anyone looking for some good old '90s nostalgia, look no further !. This is a masterpiece of an RPG, play it on the Playstation or Sega CD. Its turn based and has no random encounters. It has some great animated cutsenes. I played it with a friend a few months ago and we ended up playing it the whole weekend.. Not quite the epic that SSSC originally delivered but Eternal Blue Complete definitely rode on the biggest nostalgia wave ever... And it was awesome !!! Colorful and engaging as the original. A side note to whoever may whine that the characters are too similar to the original... THAT'S WHAT THEY MEANT TO DO !!! A recurring even in history (kind of like in Xenogears, where Kim and Fei are reincarnations of Abel). I just couldn't handle that one specific painfully repetitive dungeon song that was also on SSSC. Might I add that the ""Complete"" box-set is probably the most thorough and awesome ever released !!!. Do you love JRPG's? DId you ever? Then play this. Consider that this game came out in 1994 for the Sega CD, so you probably never heard of it back then. At that time, this game had an hour and a half of full anime style animation, and an hour and a half of spoken dialog, six years and two generations earlier than the juggernaut Final Fantasy had it's first spoken dialog. It's too bad that the original came out for Sega CD because by the time it was reworked for PSX, LUNAR was graphically dated and didn't get the praise that it highly deserved as one of the best RPG series of all time. Why is that? Well, it's the writing and the likeable characters that do it for me. Working Designs put great care into their translations, and they were leagues better than the competition at that time, with none of that awkward stuff common in 1990's JRPG's. That, combined with a far bigger adventure than the first LUNAR, make it an incredible journey and game. The music of the series is also incredible, and I still have it on my computer. Check out Star Dragon Theme and compare it to the quality of other games of the 16/32-bit era. If you can still play through games like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, or any other of those classic JRPG's, I highly recommend the Sega CD or PSX version of LUNAR Eternal Blue.","if you've played Lunar 1 : SSSC then you'll most likely love this one as well . the story can tug at your heartstrings at times, and the art and anime-esque cutscenes are beautiful . play it on the Playstation or Sega CD.

916.Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered,"Accidental review, so leaving as a 5, for that or it doesn’t hurt too badly. Without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. If you enjoy the works of Studio Ghibli/Hayao Miyazaki (the studio responsible for classics such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle and My Neighbour Totoro) or you just enjoy adventurous, family friendly stories with mature, underlying themes for more experienced players, this is for you. The story is tear jerking at times, the characters all memorable, the combat is incredibly unique - although it takes a hot minute to get used to, the music is astounding and the world is rich, vivid and full of life. 10/10.. Ni no kuni is a great RPG game for those who like traditional JRPGs. I particualrly love the storyline and artwork. Definitely worth a go if you love studio ghibli films and an RPG fan.. One of the most beautiful games & experiences ever played. From soundtrack to visuals and game mechanics. A must.. After completing the game and getting the platinum, I can say that I found it a bit boring. The plot is flat with no real twist typical of other Level5 games, the party battle system makes no sense, as the other characters simply don't follow any orders and do whatever they want without prirotizing actions over others. The tactical setting is very poor with no explanation of what each action means. The world exploration is fine, although very simple with lots of useless spots and hidden forests. The mission are just a re-do the same thing all the time, although the Bounty Hunts were quite interesting and fun. The real pain over everything else is the farming: too many hours sown to get ""rare"" material from ""rare"" monsters that 3 times out of 5 don't show up at all and when they do they leave the common objects. I understand the dynamics of farming rare material but this was designed very bad with no consideration of the gamer. Overall, Studio Ghibli and Level 5 produced a fine game, pretty enjoyable but awfully overrated.. The Ghibli visuals and story are endearing, but the game is just not good. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend time with their kids while watching them play something though.. Well... it's mostly the battle system that lets this down. It's a real-time button-mashing festival. There is more to it, explained at the start of the game and then never again. You steer your character/familiar around the battle arena with the left thumbstick, and you switch actions with the... what? The left d-pad? Well there's a massive design flaw right there. I played on easy, and during the bit where you look for the cat king in the sewers, the difficult suddenly ramped up severely. My character or familiar could easily be taken out in a few hits. The only way through was to pick just one familiar each time and mash the attack action repeatedly and hope for the best. When I tried anything more tactical, I was decimated... and I quickly ran out of MP trying to heal myself in-between each fight. So, after only 2 hours game time, I quit in disgust. I expect what I did wrong was not grinding to level up my character in some easier area first... well pffft. Any game that requires a grind is, by definition, poorly balanced. What's hilarious is that if you watch any YouTube video explaining the battle system... the narrator commonly apologises for how confusing it all looks. In fact, I haven't yet found one that explains it clearly. But it's not just the battles... there's far too much back-and-forth fetch quests, the text speed is too slow (even on the fastest setting) and the text makes a super-irritating noise as it displays which will drive anyone else in the room up the wall. And the music, although lovely at first, quickly gets repetitive, as they're pretty short audio loops. It's a real shame as the voice work and graphics are absolutely top notch. With a turn-based battle mechanic, this would have been unmissable.. Music and art is good. The story is an unrelateable slow burn, and the combat is incredibly frustrating and slow, not to mention it forces you to grind a lot for materials that have a really low drop rate. Evolving familiars is reall Catching new familiars, a core mechanic, is an rng process, which really ****. incredibly frustrating.. Graphics: 10/10 For a PS3 game, this game looks drop dead gorgeous. And even more than 10 years later, the graphics still hold up very VERY well. The only thing that makes it a bit jarring is when the animated cutscenes try to play before and after any in-game graphic cutscenes, but I’m not knocking any points out of this score for that, primarily because that’s more of a directional choice. Sound: 10/10 The music is absolutely top notch and beautiful. I still hum the main overworld theme from time to time, even well after I’m done playing. Sound fxs and voice acting are also very good. My only complaint is the fact that the audio clips out from time to time, but again, only a minor complaint. Gameplay: 5/10 Easily my biggest complaint with this game. Being a PS3 game, there’s some clear choices here that seemed like the norm in that era, but now seems a bit dated. Stuff like no objective markers on the map for side quests, grinding being an absolute chore and the battle system being unreliable to work with. To me, this game plays like a predecessor to Yokai Watch, in that at times, you have to choose certain actions when certain things play out. The problem is because the battle system can sometimes be a bit laggy, the game can easily cheese you out of a deserving actions (Example: An enemy is about to use a special attack, but you’re already in the middle of another action with a character who cannot defend. You know you have to switch to another character to defend, but by the time you attempt to do so, the attack has already pulled through. Half the times, this will lead to a wipe on your character or, worse, on your party) Worse yet, the game has a very bad habit of not giving your any forewarnings of any pending boss battles. It seems to be generous to you early on to give the subtle hints via a save point, but as you progress, boss battles will suddenly pop out of nowhere and slap you upside the head, leaving you with either taking the money penalty to retry or restart at a save point that’s more than 30 minutes out. Again, all of this was the norm during the PS3 era and before (I’m looking at you Cyber Sleuth, a game that was initially designed for the Vita), but these deterants just make me realize even harder that, even during this generation, there were many faults games had. Story: 6/10 There’s really nothing noteworthy about the story; Boy loses mom, is told he can save her in another world, boy goes on a Zelda-like quest to find several sages who can help him find his mom. It’s a very generic story and is told fairly well. I don’t exactly hate the story, but put it this way: With my grips with the gameplay, the story wasn’t enough of a pull for me to play this past the 10 hour mark Difficulty: Hard The gameplay issues and grind fest make this a game that, while not extremely difficult, does curve up the difficultly spike past normal. Most guides that are out there will help a bit but you’re gonna be left with many questions that, honestly, will take you a lot of time just to research to begin with. BOTTOM LINE: 7/10 I wanted to say I love this game. I really do. But because of the gameplay issues and mildly ok story, I can only say I like it. I know there’s many others out there who will swear to their lives that this game stands toe to toe with FF7, Kingdom Hearts, Dragon Quest and many other legendary JRPGs. But I think that’s the thing with me; All of those games are great entries to the world of JRPGs. This game can serve that same purpose. But the difference, in my opinion, is those games stand out on their own because they pioneered these sort of tropes and gameplay mechanics. Ni no Kuni just feels like it’s trying to do the same thing these games already did and, for someone like me who’s played all those games, it felt like a game that I already played, but with its mechanics far more aged.. This one was on my wishlist for such a long time i feared I would be frustrated, but it still entertained me for 100+ hours. lots of side quests, all of them cataloged so I could complete them all without a struggle. Such a good game. There's a lot of monsters to tame, (unfortunately they are less unique than I'd hope, tho). Very Pleasing RPG Game. Level 5 collaboration with Ghibli is surely a majestic one with this game. It is resulting in a very great environment design and character that have an art of Ghibli which stunning. Gameplay is good where you can move around your character. Although, its didn't serve any kind of purpose because it doesn't mean you can dodge an enemy attack so, its still a turn based RPG. The reason I give this game an 8 is due to big chunk of monsters in the game which didn't have any kind of variety besides their affinity. This game is trying to make some sort of Pokemon like game but they are adding way too much element in it which makes the system way more complicated than it should and resulting in such an unappealing process for it. Overall its a very relaxing game, different RPG than kind like Persona 5.. One of the best jrpgs of last gen. Both the story and the gameplay are solid.. I think this game was a bit better than Ni no Kuni 2. Such a classic. The world is beautiful.. One of the best JRPGs last gen, slightly better than part 2 I think? both games are good though.. Do not buy for switch! Frequent crashes and loss of save data on a finished offline game while playing on Nintendo.. Não vou falar de nada da história. Esse é uma das melhores coisas que já vi ele tem gráficos melhores do que muitos jogos do PS4 já no ps3 no PS4 melhora muito mais. a melhor trilha sonora que eu já ouvi não tem dublagem brasileira que é de onde eu vim mas a dublagem Japonesa é melhor do que a americana a animação 2d foi feita pelo Studio gibli (não sei como se escreve) que foi um dos pioneiros da animação japonesa e ficou uma maravilha o que o segundo jogo não teve mas tem um cara do Studio gibli (não sei como se escreve)que voltou pro segundo para dar os desings do primeiro pro segundoas sem as animações 2d o que não dá a mesma sensação do primeiro não é a mesma coisa não é a mesma magia do primeiro segundo/I won't talk about any of the history. That's one of the best things I've seen it has better graphics than many PS4 games whereas on ps3 on PS4 it improves a lot more. the best soundtrack i've heard doesn't have brazilian dubbing which is where i came from but the japanese dubbing is better than the american dubbing 2d animation was made by Studio gibli (don't know how to spell it) who was one of the pioneers of animation Japanese and it was a wonder what the second game didn't have but there's a guy from Studio gibli (I don't know how to spell it) who went back to second to give the designs from the first to the second without the 2d animations which doesn't give the same feeling as the first is not the same thing is not the same magic from first to second. The world this game creates makes you feel like you might just be on the adventure of a lifetime, and then it tears that all apart every way it can! I warn you about this game, and am amaze and appalled at the high ratings it keeps getting. The only way this can get high ratings is from underdog-identifying jrpg obsessed fans that refuse to see flaws because they use a mindless grind to cope with reality. First of all, that beautiful, unique, aesthetic world is constantly ruined with puns. The spell to open doors is Open-says-a-me! HAHHAHAHAHAHA. WOW SO FUNNY! Imagine if Bloodborne or Skyrim ruined it's aesthetic like this. Wow this cave is called ""Bandits think they aren't about to get killed Cave!"" HAHAHAHAHA. The only reason this isn't brought up is because the large majority of jrpg fans are extremely trashy. Skip this Game Oh before I started writing this, when I was giving the game a final chance, the game crashed when I was saving, loosing loads of mindless-grindy progress. Just putting this here in case you were thinking this was too negative and wouldn't read all this. Skip this Game. You are from the normal Earth world and go to a fantasy style world. You meet a cute companion and bring her back to your world. How does she react???? SHE DOESN'T REACT AT ALL. Skip this Game. You have to collect milk from the milk fountains in town. You go to one only to find it isn't the one the game decided you should go to, the prompt just doesn't show up at all, you had to somehow predict that the developers wanted you to only collect milk from a certain fountain even though that isn't part of the story or quest at all. Skip this Game. How is the grind? If you have the Remastered or preordered the original, then you have Griffy and the grind is grindy. If not, then you have to constantly consume expensive health and mana potions all the time. Most of the Pokémon are completely weak and useless. [oh, and this is true on Easy difficulty] Skip this Game. Did a quest, it isn't completed because it's glitched. Skip this Game! You thought the art style was good? Wait until you see the most appallingly ugly talking tree design you have ever seen or imagined. Skip this Game! What a severe disappointment.. Great jrpg, I think this game is slightly better than the sequel. The story, gameplay and the music were all great.. Have you ever been recommended a game by a friend that claimed it was this phenomenal piece of art, only to try it and wonder what in the world they saw in it? Nostalgia is a powerful thing that can keep even the most lacking games still have life decades later. However, in the case of Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, nostalgia is not something the game needs to lean on 10 years after its initial release; it’s a solid game all on its own. ****/nino-kuni-switch-review-defeat-a-great-evil-on-the-go/. For the life of me, I cannot understand how this game has such stellar reviews. The combat mechanics are atrocious. The attempt to mix real-time and turn-based mechanics ruins the game. They are conflicting mechanics, and it doesn’t work. I don’t want to scroll through command menus while trying to dodge enemies and pick up items on the fly. It doesn’t work. Ruins the game for me.. I don't remember a game, which gave me more mixed feelings. From the one side - this game is perfect. Epic, beautiful, heartwarming, truly masterpiece. From the other side, the JRPG system just doesn't do it. Often you just have to grind, and grind, and grind.. Especially, when one particular NPC gives you a ""bring me those creatures"" quest, so, you have to defeat one hundred same enemies until one of them will join your party. Another thing, the second part of the story looks torn out... So, it's really something between 8 and 9, depending on your glass-half-empty-or-half-full character.. Beautiful to look at with an interesting twist on traditional JRPG mechanics. The game is long and can get a bit grindy, but it was largely engaging and well made.. One of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s a mixture between Harry Potter and Pokemon with its own charm. The story is compelling and emotional, The world is enchanting, the fights are super fun. I played on the PS3 and I’m playing again on the switch. I constantly want the game to last longer and longer. It’s not boring even for one second. The bad reviews are very vague, from people that want to play Final Fantasy 100 times and get upset when other RPGs aren’t like FF. Ignore the bad reviews and get this game! You will thank me.. I don't know if the remastered really brings anything to the table that the PS3 version didn't. It's the same great JRPG it always was, but I think the 4K looks fantastic. I'm glad I didn't pick this up when it was new and 40 bucks, but the used prices these days are well worth the price for anyone new or wanting to revisit it.. Game has some beautiful cutscenes, but over all the ai in the game makes it extremely frustrating. They regularly go all out on random encounters and waste there mp, then in boss fights they will just not defend from a heavy attack and die super fast.. I enjoyed the heck out of this game. But the battle system is just wrong. I have no idea how the critic scores have zero negative reviews and a couple of mixed. The combat system is the most frustrating I have played in any JRPG. It's slow, your familiars tend to jump about instead of attacking some of the time. You get pretty much zero time to react and defend when a boss unleashes a powerful attack, Oliver 100% of the time casts Ward for some reason when you control another character, the amount of times I had to recast a spell cause it gets cancelled by an enemy attack (Or an ally's ability) 95% of the time, MP replenishing items are so expensive, when it's heavily reliant on using attacks that cost MP, I could go on. Don't get me wrong, I loved the game, story and characters, but it's just the battle system that let it down. I just feel that if it wasn't a Studio Ghibli game, this would have gotten bombed due to the combat system.. (DISCLAIMER: I did not finish the game. I got roughly ten hours in before I decided to call it quits.) An endearing premise and Ghibli visuals do a lot to carry this JRPG, but not enough to save it from clunky combat mechanics that ultimately drag this game into the murky waters of mediocrity. Like many modern JRPGs, NNK has walked away from the clean precision of turn based combat, opting instead for clumsy action-rpg system where your party and a handful of monsters run around a little combat area in real time. Despite this, commands such as ""attack"" and ""defend"" still require you to flip through a menu, which can become an issue when enemy attacks are time sensitive, leading to a lot of frustration when big attacks you saw coming hit you anyway as you fumble with the controls. You can only control one party member at any given time, so there isn't much in the way of teamwork. Your other party members can have certain behaviors set if you don't want them burning through mana, but you can only change behaviors if you're in control of a human character. You see, you aren't just having to shuffle through a single party of characters, but each character has a sub-party in the form of monster familiars who all share health and mana with their user. The designs of the familiars are mostly forgettable, which is an issue because the game emphasizes you use them in combat over the more endearing human characters. I quit once the game introduced monster capturing and evolving (think pokemon), finally burying my already waning interest under a even more pet management mechanics.. This Game is a Masterpiece. I dont need to say anything more than that. Just buy it.. It's just a slugfest. Boring characters, terrible gameplay, only thing going for it is the art. The combat doesnt function properly, walking through enemies, defense glitches, completely scripted deaths when bosses have almost no health left after 20 minutes of fighting. Awful combat even if it functioned. This game is one of the worst gameplay experiences ever, and I'm 40 hours in. Wat a waste of time.. The biggest complaint I have about this game is that the first 20 hours of this game is very slow and pretty boring. If you manage to get through that part it gets way better as it doesn't take forever to do everything. Apart from that: Good story, graphics and music. You prepare your team kind of like in Pokemon and you can choose to fight using the pokemon or their trainers in combat, I really liked the combat system. I also had a lot of fun with all the sidequests and bountyhunts throughout the game.. After 16 hours I really can't see myself playing for 34 more; there's really nothing here to draw me in. The story is way too G and has no urgency, the combat is mostly automated and rather dull, and the party AI in combat is ABYSMAL. Date Dropped: 2020-06-08 Playtime: 16h Enjoyment: 5/10 Recommendation: meeeeeeeh. There is a lot of ado about this game, but it plays just like commonplace. There is nothing really new in the battles, and the story sometimes really gets nonsense, in a quite uninteresting way. The speeches are kinda harsh for non-english speakers. Definitely, not the masterpiece thar many claim it tob be. Just an ordinary RPG, graced by occasional Ghibli animations.. Great game animation is superb interesting story great rpg a must play(playing on Nintendo Switch).. Its a big game with over 100 hours of game time you can finish the game and play the dlc which enhances the combat which is fun HOWEVER the story could have been better with some aspects and the soundtracks are repetitive but it was still a fun game. Absolutely beautiful looking game with a creative world and amazing character designs. The characters are well made with great development lots of explorations to make your cry, make you laugh and much more. I love the battle system it is different but works amazing. So much to do and explore on the side as well. An RPG that mixes Pokémon elements with wonderful graphics and beautiful art direction. A very tangled plot in the last few hours, but a great jrpg. The best Pokemon game ever made. Which should embarrass the Pokemon company. With only minor visual improvements it's not something you need to immediately buy a second time but if you've never played it then it's the best place to start.. Game is amazing. Great RPG. Definitely a classic. Very in-depth game. Buying it again was automatic.. BulgarianCritic doesn't know JRPG games from FGC games. Don't pay attention to that review. Especially since he likes the 2nd better than the 1st, which was absolutely pathetic in comparison! This game is very underrated IMO in the JRPG realm. I played it 4 times already and can tell you with certainty that the 2nd can only be played once and never again. Regarding the excessive ""walking"" that they mention, that's if you don't want to fight anyone. If you want to fight familiars, which are the little pokemon-like creatures in the game, then you can spend days doing that. There are secrets. There are side quests. There is everything you can enjoy in Pokemon found in this game. Evolutions? Check. Learn new moves? Check. Feeding familiars? Check. This is 1 of my favorite all time games for the genre. The story and world are beautiful and charming, but the combat system really killed the enjoyment i had with this game. This could have been an amazing experience, what a shame.. This is a lovely RPG with an enchanting world, likeable characters and beautiful design. The story is engaging all the way through, the combat feels quite unique and levelling up always feels satisfying. My only gripe is the excessive amount of grinding that needs to be done in order to complete the game in its entirety.. The story is pretty interesting the animation is gorgeous and the music is **** the biggest problem i have with this game is that h 70% of it is just walking and walking and walking and walking and it gets so boring and annoying so **** the combat is incredibly slow and tedious and i got tired of it after 20 mins of **** you have the patience and love walking simulators with good stories and boring as heck fights sure play it,but if not i suggest you play the second Ni No Kuni 2 since it was so good and way better than its prequel. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is a 10/10. The remaster is a 7/10. The improvements simply are not enough to warrant a re-purchase if you already own and have played the PS3 version. All you are getting is an improved resolution and 60 fps...both of which are nice but unneeded improvements for this type of game. (The PS3 version has a softer glow which many may actually find more aesthetically pleasing than the sharper PS4 version). What you are NOT getting is improved geometry (i.e. round things like mushrooms are still ""hexagons""), additional familiars, improved controls, or additional modes. It is the exact same game as the PS3 version. I would only recommend this to people who do not have a PS3...otherwise just pick up a brand new PS3 copy for $16 on amazon. The PS4 version is currently $50...with minimal improvements. As a fan of the game I was disappointed with this remaster.. A visual masterpiece. Loved it from the very first moment. If you love JRPGs you can't miss this one. I've played for 50 hours already.. One of the best JRPG game of the generation. The design is outstanding! colorful and magical! beautiful characters and mechanics!. The best JRPG from the PS3 era is now available for the current generation, beautiful remastered and finally in 60 FPS (on PC and PS4) . If you have any love for JRPGs or Studio Ghibli Movies you should buy this Game",Ni no kuni is a great RPG for those who like traditional JRPGs . the plot is flat with no real twist typical of other level5 games . the farming mechanics are awfully overrated .
917.Guilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR-,"So bloody late getting to this fighter but man is it good. Its created with so much passion and detail. It's a striking looking game. It's fighting gameplay is both varied and fun and it's full of content. I almost missed this and now today after buying its up there with the very bloody best.. As someone who had never played any Guilty Gear before, I found this game to be a challenging fighting game with some mediocre weak points. PROS: great graphics, awesome BGM, challenging combat, unique characters with their own combat styles. CONS: story mode (it's just cinematics, you don't actually ""play"". Also too much information, hard to get what the heck's going on if you've never played any GG game).. Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator is hands down the best fighting game I‘ve ever seen it has excellent visual graphics, incredible combos and well-made characters, with excellent stories and, cinematics are the best, you must play this game now. This is also my first review I make about videogames on metacritic.. This is by far the best fighting game out there ! Stunning graphics, great gameplay and awesome music. it's fast paced, has a good story and even his tutorial mode is so good that it puts every other fighting game to shame ! It's really a pleasure to see so much efforts and passion was put into it. I didn't see that since the good old days of Capcom/SNK.... This is my first guilty gear game. This game is the hardest fighting game to master that I have ever played. It is truly worth mastering also. I was starting to prefer 3D fighting games until I played this.. Excellent, deep, challenging gameplay. This is not a button masher and takes work to improve but it certainly is rewarding when you do step up a level or two. It is a must buy if you even sort of like fighting games. My only fighting game experience is SFII and Mortal Kombat (yes the originals) - get ready to learn several new techniques, meters, and specials. Arcade mode is great for learning the game, as is M.O.M. mode - a single-player version with some RPG-style progression to it. Pros: Gameplay and mechanics - graphics and sound (the important things), good balance of on and offline activities Cons: Online player base is a little small, story mode is pretty weird and isn't interactive. ps4 version steals playerbase from pc version and this game doesn't have the GGX version of awe of she also **** minigame 2 it can go die in a fire forever. As a huge Fan of the Guilty Gear Series I was literally blown away by the predecessor ""Sign"" - theres hardly any other 2D Game out there thats as graphically stunning than this one (well, BlazBlue from the same devs lol). Since ""Sign"" left off with a huge cliffhanger Story wise (and much to be desired when it Comes to the character roster) - Revelator packs up as a full fledged Sequel, continuing the Story, adding a few chars and tweaking/improving the Systems even further. In short, the new chars are Overall pretty great, though I admit ist a huge letdown that two of them have to be bought with real cash (they were free to download for a while). And as much as Johnny, Jam and Dizzy are welcomed yet again to the roster, the new chars like Jack-O, Kum and Raven also add to the huge variety of the GG chars and fit in very well in both design and fighting style. Still a shame that so many of the past chars are still absent (just to save em up for future installments). The Story mode is - yet again - a sorta 3 hrs Long Anime movie that catches up where ""Sign"" left off and Ends with .. you know it ... a huge cliffhanger as soon as things start to get really interesting. The Online Mode has been vastly improved in ist awkward design, with Lobbys and Avatars to meet up, Chat, and of course compete. Theres hardly any lag noticeable as far as I have experieced, but - GG is not so populated online as Id wish. Finding a ranked match can take forever if you are lookin in another Region than US or JP. For single Players theres also plenty to do - a very good Tutorial, Combo Training and Challenge Mode teach you all there is to know about the complex fighting mechanics, the Arcade and VS Modes are kinda self explainatory, with the Survival Mode ""MOM"" being the star of the Show here (where you collect medals, can buy Upgrades for your character and dive deeper an deeper). Theres also a Gallery mode where you can spend the ingame earned Money for new Character Colors, Artworks and Stuff like that. The graphics and the Soundtrack have to be mentioned especially, since its even imporoved over the predecessor - eveything Looks sharper. The only real negative about this game is the lack of so many characters that I grew attached to as a Long term fan, that two chars from the roster have to be bought with real Money as a highly overpriced DLC, and that the Story leaves you with a cliffhanger like someone cuts off the energy in the middle of a tense fight. Dont worry though - Revelator2 is announced already, so in a few months (spring 2017) it will all continue. Its also a shame that there is no english voiceover - I get extremely annoyed by japanese voices (I know thats weird coming from an Anime Fan) but thats not as much of a big deal as the missing characters (Justice, Testament, Kliff, Bridget - what the hell ArcSys lol). Also kinda sad that there will be almost as many updates to ""Xrd"" as there have been with ""X"" before. Milk that cow ArcSys. Apart from that - probably the best fighting game of this gen so far. Must buy for anyone that has interest in fighting games.. + You can see A rough story of the previous work + Main storymode is just like watching anime. but Most of Cutscene is awesome + Digital figure mode + The best Shell Shading Graphic you've ever heard. + great Hitting feeling,hit effects,A special move - The game itself is difficult. not kidding, every combo,control.... whatever. this game just difficult. There are not have enough Beginner characters - The Fighting games can be have worst matchmaking you've ever heard. this game is don't have matchmaking like a tekken 6. For example, match of tekken6. when you join match. and just wait a few second, Automatically matches player,ping,class. don't need a host and entrant. That's it. but this game...(sigh) you can be a host or challenger. host is make a match. and wait until come challenger The challenger can see the host created match list. and you can see hosts class and ping. Select and connect match. Of course, this game have a filter to the ping and skills before joining. but this system is Uncomfortable. I love this game, is fantastic, great graphics and gameplay... but we need baiken, more costumes for everyone, more stuff for the gallery, like artwork, sketches and more dlc with other characters, please make it happen, Arc System Works. Easily the best fighting game out there. Great visuals, tutorial, music and character design. I was a SF player for years, but this game converted me. Rock on!. Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- takes familiar controls and creates something truly unique in the fighting genre. The story is a little hard to digest, but the gameplay and mechanics of the game are flawless. Chances are you'll play the game so much, the story becomes organically apparent. It is a must play for fans of fighting games.. Best fighting game since Sign and King of Fighters XIII. Best fighting game for 'next gen' consoles. Absolutly great characters, incredible music, beautiful visuals, FUN, and a lot of single player content. If you have a PS4 and love Fighting Games (Not only Street Fighter, a true fighting game fan) you can't miss it.. Clearly, majority of the previous game is remain same in this ""new"" sequel. No doubt Arc System still following the same routine that they did with Blazblue formula. Offering almost nothing in terms of extra contents comparing to previous one. In addition to some new stages, old stages are also swapped into new design, overall visuals are slightly enhanced. Not to mention that two new characters are already confirmed as DLC long before the release date (da heck ?) At the end of the day, it's just a fast money consumer crap made by greedy Arc System.﻿ If you haven't tried the Xrd yet, new installment may be useful opportunity this time.. The lack of an English dub keeps this score lower than it should be. Then English voice acting for SIGN was quite good, and it's definitely a negative to not have this alternative set of voices. I only put this note here because of what I have read on a lot of forums as of late, but ""player nostalgia"" is not a good excuse for not properly localizing the audio for an audience. This lack of English will also hinder the game's ability to attract new players. In particular, not having Slayer's English voice is a sin (no pun intended). However, the new graphics effects are quite good and add some great polish to the visual experience. The new fight mechanics, such as the ability to overdrive with a burst and the blitz attacks, make for more interesting and complex fight situations. Tutorials and formerly Challenges, now called Combos, have seen some improvement in detail as well. Overall, there are both pros and cons to this newest Guilty Gear installment.. Incredible art style, deep game play and robust tutorial. The online lobby is a mini game by itself while waiting for opponents. Very good story mode with animesque computer art style (no game play though). One of the most complete packages this generation which is rare to say these days. Even the physical game comes with a manual.. Best fighting game in the market so far. BUY IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","this is my first guilty gear game . it's the hardest fighting game to master that i have ever played . it's fast paced, has a good story and even his tutorial mode is so good that it puts every other fighting game to shame ."
919.Pinball FX 2: Marvel Pinball,"Generally a terrific table set. I would test out each table individually before deciding to go for the whole package. Quality is pretty solid across all of the tables. Blade is interestingly laid out, but it doesn't flow as well as most of the other tables. Still, it's fun, there's plenty to do on it, and the day/night transition thing is a blast. Very good artwork as one would come to expect from Pinball FX tables. Spider Man has a ton of crazy ramps befitting the name, and few things to interrupt play flow. It's pretty easy, but that's part of the fun. The voice clips are annoying, but I guess that's also fitting. Wolverine is great. It's more difficult, but it's still solid. There's a spinning wheel that your ball is held onto and then dropped from; this is a nice little gimmick, but occasionally it dumps the ball straight between your flippers. Aside from that, it's a very nice table. The special effects, artwork, sound effects, and music are possibly the best of the four. Iron Man I don't like as much. Lots of ramps, but they don't really do anything outside of the missions (a couple thousand points here or there, which is pennies compared to the millions you get from the missions). There's a ball lock right-of-center that requires you smack a couple targets blocking it before you can get your ball in. Those targets happen to be oriented directly towards the spot between the two flippers. Whoops! The music isn't as great, the missions aren't as wacky, the sounds and voice clips are weird, and there's no neat gimmicks to it.. If you like Pinball FX 2 you will love these Marvel tables. They are great! If you are a pinball fan and have not tried Pinball FX 2 what are you waiting for?","Generally a terrific table set. I would test out each table individually before deciding to go for the whole package. Blade is interestingly laid out, but it doesn't flow as well as most other tables."
92.Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars,"The game starts with great pacing and has a very good use of the touch screen with classic GTA series artwork. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best GTA .. better than IV or V also the best Nintendo DS games ever made to be real. GTA returns to its roots with an overhead view as you step into the shoes of a wannabe Triad. Cool cel-shaded cut scenes, plenty of humour and its stripped down gameplay suits the hand held format to a tee. As usual, the PSP version has better graphics thanks to its larger screen but the creative use of the touch screen plays to the strengths of the DS. Great stuff.. While certainly limited by the DS's hardware, Rockstar really squeezed out every ounce of power in the handheld with this title. This is essentially a mini-GTAIV with GTA3-ish top-down graphics (and a new story). Though that's not a bad thing at all. This truly is a GTA title, even on a handheld. Would definitely recommend making this a part of your DS library. (This is also one of few Rated M titles on the DS). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't play violence games, because I always think they have a bad effect on mind. I saw CSGO, Fortnite, GTA IV and several other Violence games and did not play them, none of them was not enough for breaking rules. But this game is worth to that. I played it more than 100 hours, and I still am playing it. Forget Ds, it is far the best Handheld game at its category.. Probably the best NDS game of all time. The main story is pretty awesome, it's fun to mess around in the sandbox world and the game has a surprising amount of mechanics. You can be a drugs dealer, be a police catching criminals, do random mini games and of course buy a ton of houses. 10/10. One of the best GTA i have ever played, amazing visuals and outstanding gameplay.. GTA: Chinatown Wars, while not a full-on recreation of the originals, is a rather fun and violent diversion from the traditional DS library. Highly recommended for people who are a fan of the first two games in the GTA library and anyone who like arcade-style games in general.. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a great game to play while taking a **** I like to play in the nude using my **** as a stylus. I like selling drugs for good money, and Chinatown Wars will turn you into a drug dealer expert. The combat is good, and so is the driving, this is the only GTA title where you can cause police cars to crash and lower your wanted level, that's right, crashing cop cars diminishes those wanted stars. The missions are nice and short, so playing in short bursts or while, again, taking a **** is quick and fun. Final verdict? 10/10. This game is near perfection, I love to do scratch cards in this game and win a house. It is a big open world game on the Nintendo Ds and I think that's incredible!. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is probably the best game on the DS. Rockstar created a perfectly balanced game with perfect use of the two screens of the DS. The gameplay is arcady and the story and graphics are stunning. Incredibly intense experience!. Must-play game with tons of contents to play with. It is as good as the other GTA series.. gta chinatown wars is a funny game , a master pice of rockstar , thanks for raise the gta in 2-D. GTA CW = GTA Chinatown wars So, friend you are talking about GTA SA which is considered the best GTA game even better than GTA v, it is a 3d game whereas GTA CW is 2.5d game at least I consider it though people consider it 2d game like classic games but it has better 2d. If you want to read more about it visit - ****/uwC79. I'll give this game a 7.5. The story increases twists gradually as you progress. The gameplay is better than any sandbox game in such a portable console like ds. The missions are unique. It also has some flaws. The complexity of the game increases.. One of the best DS games, but I have to admit that many nintendo gamers don`t appreciate it. This game has a lot of fun. It is easy to play, but if you want to master it, then you have to make a lot of effort . The graphics are fine, but the game play is excellent. The music could have been better.. Just one of the best Grand Theft Auto games, Chinatown Wars to NDS innovated a lot in the Gameplay that uses the touchscreen to many functions but not forcing it. The cutscenes has good retro styles and good lines and it's simple to understand the story. The story at itself is good and interactive with the touchscreen. In my opinion, the best version of GTA: Chinatown Wars is for DS because the gameplay with the touchscreen that I have already talked about. You HAVE TO play that game, you'll not regret!. A throwback to the original classic top down GTA's. An amazing game that is one of the best on the DS. If you own a DS or 3DS then this is a must buy game. Highly recommended.. Man oh Man! This is probably still the best games playable in the DS! It was perfect! Good drug exchanges, new cool weapons, (especially the tazer) and, just perfectness! You can take this everywhere you go if you have a DS. I can play this on my mobile phone so, cool!. This is actually a sick game! I played it yesterday. The story is awesome. And the graphics are also awesome. Love the music too! I will definitely be playing it again.. I started playing the game with my same reaction as GTA Advanced ""It's cool that it's on a handheld, but it can't keep my attention for long. After the first mission and 50+ hours later this stands as my third favourite GTA. I'm dead serious, this is the most fun I've ever had on a handheld, I mean it has everything good story, good characters, good gameplay and good controls it's just plain fun. If your looking in your bargain bin in your Walmart, or Gamestop pick it up I highly recommend it.. A great blast from the past this game is just like the older GTA games like 1&2 of what is my childhood btw its just fantastic its just its story that can be a little lackluster. This is perhaps the best Nintendo DS games ever made. Rockstar made an amazing transition from the console to a handle held. Even if this is simplified from it's larger console buddies, do not think your going to get a watered down version of the game. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars proves the gaming industry that it's not graphics that makes it's games amazing- but the game play. Rockstar managed to grab such a massive game and squeeze it down into the palm of your hand- with lengthily missions, absurdly simple yet satisfying touch screen mini-games, and a massive world to explore. Easily the best game the DS has to offer and is not an experience to miss.. This is simply the best game on DS and you will be troubled to find anything that comes close to Chinatown wars's unique and excellent gameplay. Running around the streets dealing drugs and turning an excellent profit whilst desperately avoiding the police and sending there cars smashing into buildings proves to be an fun past time and doing lengthy unique missions that use the touch screen controls effectively is also very enjoyable.. Yeah, I think GTA Chinatown wars was the best games for me among the GTA IV Series. I think it compromises of higher level graphics, but from my point of view, the game for the PSP was a beautiful success. Not only the best game on the DS, it may just be one of the best games for any handheld device. The story, while lacking in the serious vibe GTA IV had, is well written and hilarious. There's a plethora of extras and secrets, and the car physics is an amazing milestone for a DS game. The greatest triumph of Chinatown Wars, however, is the drug-dealing. Missions give a VERY limited amount of money, so if you want to buy extra weapons and armor, drug dealing is a necessity. Finding drug dealers, finding the lowest seller and the highest bidder, getting emails from dealers giving you great deals, the entire system is much more than a gimmick. It's what sets Chinatown Wars apart, and maybe even better, than GTA IV. Missions are varied, characters are colorful and funny, shootouts are intense, and the cars are fast. This is the best way to play GTA, and it's on a handheld, no less.. For Fans it must be amazing, but it is not much if I look at it as a new videogame. Low graphs, weak story, just a copy of the Game Boy GTA. Not bad to play on the Metro/Bus.. GTA at it's best. A full-feature game on a handheld with amazing graphics and sound effects. I lacked the voice acting from the storyline but there is some when you meet people on the street. You can't go into buildings, but you have a bunch of mini-games instead. The GPS works really well, the vehicles are varied. There is a constant FPS, and the controls use all buttons of the console and even the touch screen, which is amazing! 11 points of 10 for this one!. 9.5/10 = The best handheld GTA experi . . . never mind, this IS one of the best GTA experiences on any system.. I personally think this game has some of the best graphics on the DS. Rockstar really did good with what they had to work with on this one. The touch screen mini-games are great and it's a lot of fun just to run around stealing cars, killing people, and dealing drugs for profit. Some people don't really like the top-down view, but keep in mind it's not like Grand Theft Auto 1, 2, or Advance. The view is actually at an angle and you can use a cinematic camera when you're driving. A great game on the Nintendo DS.","cool cel-shaded cut scenes, plenty of humour and its stripped down gameplay suits the hand held format to a tee . while certainly limited by the DS's hardware, rockstar really squeezed out every ounce of power in the handheld with this title . forget DS, it is far the best hand held game at its category ."
920.God of War: Ghost of Sparta,"Waaaaaaaaaaayyy better than chains of olympus. Smash Erinys, next question.. this game is one of the best games I played as a child, now I would also be happy to play it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is not a masterpiece and should be free there is a part that ruins the entire game where ur stuck in a boat fightning enemies till you die and its apparently a glitch. I spent like 3 hours just to get fked by the game!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a great prequel, the final chapter is the best part of the game, kratos is really the greatest protagonist in video game history.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. best game ever, takes you back into the story for sure , and creative, inovative, new. GAMEPLAY: 10 STORY: 8 VISUALS: 9.5 MUSIC: 8.5 I just need a little more work in the boss fights, but for the rest a 9.. Holy, This game is incredible, and here I am thinking GOW III is the only game with extreme improvements across the board, this game on the PSP and the PS3 is top tier. Oh and if you are on PC, I did get to emulate them, and they work great on PPSPP, PS2 and PS3 emulators. Of course, let me just put a little disclaimer here, I do not under any circumstances condone or recommend piracy. I was lucky enough to get the disks officially from a friend, the older PSP games and the collection on PS2 and PS3. Anyway, Ghost of Sparta is my second-best GOW game in the franchise now, it's better than GOW I and II in my opinion. However, 2 small tiny details that I dislike in this game, are the abilities, and the amount of red orbs you get. I never once used any magical abilities because to me they kind of ****, lol. Besides Spartan weapons that's nice. And the amount of red orbs in this game is a bit much, I fully upgraded all my weapons and I had left 20k+ orbs for no reason whatsoever. But overall this is a great game that takes elements from GOW III and does a great gameplay twist on the PSP console, rushing enemies and beating them never felt so satisfying. GOW games have always been good maybe not Ascension but this game kept the franchise strong on PSP. I'm glad, I played this, Next is Chains of Olympus. Oh right, the rating is a 9/10, just right under GOW III.. A cool scenario and great graphics mark out another quality scrolling beat 'em up/platform hybrid from the franchise. Perhaps a little overly difficult in places and more save points wouldn't have gone amiss, but a quality title.. Master piece for PSP console. Very nice combat model that fully leveraged possibilities of the console. Very interesting Greece plot. God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a good slasher. fantastic story , gameplay , boss fights , game design and music.. Pretty underrated game in the GOW series. It´s a bit too short but it´s an interesting addition to the franchise, and it´s fun too.. With the interesting atmosphere of the game, the interesting story and the strange monsters and the constant arrival of the monsters, the game becomes very fun, even fighting the enemy at the end of the game is very nice and if you have the opportunity to play, do not miss this opportunity.. God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. great great great What can I say about this masterpiece? All versions of God's War are masterpieces and deserve praise. my second favorite GoW game in the original franchise and my third overall only behind GoW Ragnarok and GoW 3. I could have released it quietly on PS2, I don't know why it wasn't done! an amazing game to play on emulator. Great game !! GAMEPLAY: 10 STORY: 8 VISUALS: 8 MUSIC: 9 PERSONAL SCORE: 9 ¡¡ A JEWELL !!. I'll rate 9.2 overall by soundtrack/gameplay/story/graphic. The story has portrait Kratos brother's life and his childhood memories although it's kind of brief for storytelling but that's enough for all of point of the story. The gameplay is challenging enough even after you completed you could still challenge God Mode for training yourself not to be rusty at control. Soundtrack emotional if you listen to soundtrack while enjoying the story. It's probably not fair to judge with height of our days, but the game feels kinda outdated(finishing every ""big"" mob). It looks great, CGI videos are great, direction, effects, dynamic fights. But the story itself is empty and lame, weapon arsenal is not that big(but to be fair, it is big enough to keep your interest through the whole game). The game feels not great in it's size, in sense of content, the only difficulty is enemy HP bar, which is i should say in our days feels like too much? It has't smooth difficulty rise. The hardest(and i would say, the only hard episode) and it's simple ship fight, just because it is nearly 20 minutes in one place, pressing the same buttons and killing endless enemies, it is just feels like eternity. Still, i should give Sony some redit, for this game and what they managed to do. But last third of the game feels kinda empty and exausting. Didn't play COO( and any other game except GOS, but gonna do it and correct my opinion about GOS). Though i have a lot of claims to this game, though i think that the story is absent, though i returned to this game through many years in 2022, and i feel that is is outdated i'm thinking about green rating. Okay, let's do it this way: for today's nerd it is 7, for hardcore gamer of early 2010's it is 8 with a plus, when most people(including me) played this game when we were young it was 10/10. So, it is fair to make allowances on it's age. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily one of the best god of war ever. The story is dark, the boss fights are thrilling,there is deep gore during fights etc.Short, but ""GOAT"".. 9/10, while i was thinking of giving it a 10, the magic in this game is the worst in the franchise. Good - a lot of new additions from Chains of Olympus. - we finally get some emotions out of Kratos, and some back story - spear and shield was fun to use - some new enemies - amazing game as developed on a handheld - the cutscenes and fighting animations are impressive as ever. Bad - nothing really.. A great game, an amazing story, Kratos is the best spartan warrior. I just Love it.. Good graphics good gameplay good story and can play in school !!! that's crazy. Perfect.even better than chains of Olympus good amount of story perfect gameplay perfect everything. Thanks sony thanks.. The worst gow game in my opinion after gow asencion. This game is of course above average but somewhat repetitive and not that epic compared to other gow games. Is this game a hack n slash or a metroidvania?Boring story,meh combat,terrible difficulty(sometimes so hard sometimes so easy)ok graphics,repetetive enemies,bad level design,repetetive bosses,. Very good game and i enjoy it. I made it platinum in 24 hours. But i think its not the best game in old god of war series. But its slightly better than Chains of Olympus.. Best PSP Game Ever, This Game is Playable On This Days, İf You Have Psp You Can Buy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game to humanize the sterile Kratos. Solid story with great God of War action.. An excellent slasher, with bewitching gameplay, plot, cool locations, characters and a brutal main character.. The best God of War game on the PSP. It happens between the time of God of War and God of War 2. Kratos is on a journey to solve a mystery of his past and a prophecy that worried even the Gods. This is as good as it can get on the PSP. The story is engaging with many memorable boss fights and foreshadowing the coming events. The game-play and battle system was improved and you have now more options including a never used set of weapons I wont spoil. Again I hate that I cant get into details because of Spoilers. So I can only say that I enjoyed the well made battle system and the story with a conclusion that is as much epic and heartbreaking. You see that the results of God of War 3 will be unavoidable as they are the conclusions of the past (mistakes). I will also praise the graphics and the again awesome soundtrack that is a staple of the God of War series. Overall one of the best PSP games an a worthy addition to the franchise.. Story - 8/10 Graphics - 9/10 Levels - 8/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Ghost of Sparta is the best looking game i've played on the psp, i think it might even look better than GoW1 on the psp2. This game is definitely an improvement on Chains of Olympus on every level and it features one on of my favorites arsenal's for Kratos. Ghost of Sparta pushed the psp to its limits and its still impressive to this day, definitely a must play for any GoW fan 8/10. The best PSP game ever.I couldn't believe the graphics were from a PSP game. Great story and gameplay. It's the most underrated GOW game.. In my opinion one of the best God of War games in the series . In a good link between the first and second game . My best advice is to play this game in chronological order. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Just like Chains of Olympus, this game is a great addition to the GoW franchise and excels and recreating the feels of the console games.... Without a doubt, my favorite of the four God of War games I've played so far. To me, this is a near perfect edition of the God of War style and mechanics, and adding a great story on top of it. Full of epic moments, thrills, chills, action, drama, and deep character relationships, Ghost of Sparta amazed me around every **** this was a PSP to PS3 port? That astounds me. The visuals and gameplay were better than the PS2 games for sure and I can't wait to see what III and Ascension offer after this amazing entry. Really, my only problems have been problems with the other games as well: the chests, the inability to load single chapters, and the confusing bonuses. The chests are absolutely ridiculous even still, especially when you're fighting and need to open one right next to you but it flashes different colors so you have to wait for the right one, and hope that you don't get hit in the meantime. It's not a skillful mechanic, it's a cheap tactic that absolutely needs to disappear. The inability to load bugs me as well because to go back to get just one Gorgon Eye that you missed means replaying the ENTIRE campaign over again which again, is cheap. It definitely ruins any replayability and so far, this would be the one God of War game I'd go back to play for **** and giggles. Lastly, the confusing bonuses... there are some things I grabbed throughout the campaign that told me I'd have to beat the game to use. Once completing the game, nothing in the menus at all gave any hint on how to use these items. I started up a new game and was able to choose my outfit but I still couldn't figure out how to use these relics, so I just turned it off and decided to write this review before moving onto the third main entry. Anyways, this game is amazing and I'm really excited to play the rest now (finally).. Pretty much just Chains of Olympus. It's a fun and enjoyable action game, just nothing new really. For me doesn't feel as necessary as the first portable story, anyhow it gets deeper into Kratos and the burden that makes him who he is and gives you new toys and mechanics to give them good use.. Great god of war as a portable game. This game satisfies everyone who like the main series. Great variation of gameplay, but special powers could've been better. Great (and typical gow combat), with intriguing story. The only negative (which was expected) was nothing mind-blowingly new or epic was introduced in this game. The ending which was very unique ended rather abruptly. But overall any gow fan would enjoy this game on the go.. Yes yeeeesss. Pushing that psp to the peek performance. Wow. 9/10. This is incredible. When I first heard I Went like meh let's check it out but wow that was some awesome stuff right there. Compelling characters. The boss is scary as hell and wow amazing story arc and the emotion level is unbelievable in this game. I loved it and I believe you will too. This game shows the true psp power house and how it compares to its big brother the PS2.. A great game for a handheld, though not as good as Chains of Olympus. Graphics are very good, story is touching, but the difficulty is inconsistent and may frustrate at times.. This game has got very amazing bosses, this game very adactive and this game one of the best exclusive on Playstation Portable . Graphics in this game is good and storyline is wonderful and this is one of the best God Of War Game, but God of War on Playstation 2 is better and God of War Ghost of Sparta is better than God of War 2 and God of War 3 . Amazing and Awesome game, wonderful .. Game: God of War Ghost of Sparta Genre: Action Developer: Sony/Ready at Dawn System: Playstation Portable (PSP) Total Score: 85/100 Value Score: 8.5/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 8/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 9/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 7/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Gameplay has been improved with new battle mechanics and abilities +Less annoying QTEs +Game Length is longer +More boss battles have been added +Visuals max out the platform's most potential +Gameplay is well balanced and modified for portable experience +Post game content consists of harder difficulties, challenges, costumes and developer videos Cons -Controls can be somewhat frustrating due to the PSP's analog. The God Of War Ghost Sparta is one of the best psp games experienced yet with awesome control, gameplay, graphic one of the best the game, the graphic style is more like movie, watching movie everything of this games is the best.. Ghost of Sparta is cool. But not the best game on the PlayStation Portable. Graphic is great but i dont like the mithology worlds. Gameplay is excitied.. Graphically one of the most beautiful game on the PSP system. Nothing hugely different about the gameplay, but there's no need to change already perfect system. And like other God of Wars this one also provides epic soundtrack and story. Little short in length and provides nothing new but still a great GOW game.. Ghost of Sparda takes place between God of War and God of War II, Kratos is filled with anger because the gods did not rid him of his haunting visions, Kratos finds out that his younger brother is still alive. Kratos embarks on a journey to save his brother. The gameplay is better than Chains of Olympus, Ghost of Sparta is by far the best looking game on the PSP. They added a new tackling button which is awesome. The story is great, in my opinion this is the best game you can find on a portable device.. Excellent game to play on your the Vita, looks great and is awesome to play. I got this at the same time as God of war Ascension and while there's obvious graphical differences, the gameplay is virtually the same in this game and i'm enjoying flicking between the two titles.Good story and cut scene that keep you engrossed. A must have for the handheld.. Best PSP game hands-down. It has great graphics (for its time), fun gameplay, intriguing story, and lots of replay value. Highly recommended for all of the people out there who still play their PSP.. Terribly short, Poor combat, good story, despicable camera, weird enemies. Is this supposed to be clown school? Just a terrible game. The only thing you expect is terrible ideas. Chains of Olympus is tons better.. This game has an amazing story, cool and awesome with nice roles in the game, and of course, a gameplay that never gets old, and the best graphics I've ever seen for a PSP game. This realistic, fun, and awesome adventure will make you have the fun playing as Kratos, anywhere and anytime, because it is portable. Gameplay: 10/10 - The gameplay never gets old --- Fresh and good controls, you can get new skills in the game, and more. Music: 10/10 - The music never gets annoying and keeps the game fun and exciting. Story: 10/10 - They don't added more than what they needed, just something easy to learn, specially if you have played the first GoF games. Graphics: 10/10 - Remember, this is a handheld console made in 2004... The graphics are simply amazing and won't make you lag. Sony and Capcom made an amazing job at this point.. Good but could have been great. Their ""puzzles"" are awful, they're either so obvious that you breeze through them or they're so hidden that you spend 20 minutes jumping around looking for the exit before you give up and look for a walkthrough on google. Fighting is a lot of fun, and thankfully that is half of the game. Although his chains are kind of lame, so are his glowing blades. Why can't Kratos have any cool weapons like Conan?. I played this game on Vita and it still looked like is it made by gods. I love it, I admire it, I cry for more. The plot is really involving, the bosses are gorgeous, the slaughter is awesome. Must play.. This game is amazing. To me all the things i didnt like about chains of olympus they fixed in some way in this game. There are much more boss battles and they are all great and would satisfy you even if this game wuz on a console. Its longer,twice as long to be exact. If your on a harder diffuculty or are just slow it will take about 5-7 hours to beat. The story is deep and well thought out,this game will constantly make you forget what system your playing on. The graphics are buetiful and some mechanics are borrowed from the other games. Like the quick time events now appear on the side of the screen,blood splatters on Kratos,there are ledge swinging segments,etc. You get a new weapon(spear/shield) alot of critics liked this weapon but i didnt idk y but **** for me because there are parts toward the end where you have to use it for puzzles and far away enemies. This game is fantastic and you wont truly beleive it untill you play it,wutever negative thing people have said about this game they are just haters and dont let them deprive you from enjoying most likely the best handheld game ever.. Better than previous one. 'nuff said. God of War: Ghost of Sparta for the Playstation Portable was great as if gave my inner killer great Spartan rage!!SCEA did a beautiful job on the graphics as well! I hope they make another to the the trilogy~ Good Job! 10/10. When I first started playing this for about the first hour or more it just felt like another god of war game, but as I got deeper into it I quickly became submersed in this games fantastic story which takes place between the first and second games, which is the best in a game in this series so far, it really shows a new side of Kratos that you only saw once for a short time in Chains of Olympus, and shows is more than just an angry dude who screams a lot, this game also does what I thought almost impossible, it surpasses the previous god of war game to come out for the PSP in every way, the graphics are better although at times it takes on a more cartoony effect (think of how the Star Wars The Clone Wars games look), this honestly looks better than either of PS2 games, and the sound is fantastic as always, and there are a few new changes to combat, and replenishing fire meter that sets your weapons ablaze is a nice addition, and the new tackle move is quite effective, and the platforming additions make Kratos seem like a more agile character and they reminded me of the Prince of Persia games, and some awesome new foes to fight are cool, if you are a fan of the series this is a must play, and the best PSP game I've played so far.. Expanded the story of kratos and the adventure of COO. Even Better. Soon to be put on a PS3 Blu-ray collection. Must buy for the PSP................................................................................................................................ God Mode: Overall, the game series is captivating with its well thought out storyline to which it has resulted in endless enjoyment; furthermore, the learning of the Greek mythology. Past reviews have spotted it quite high up on the pedestal but what most reviewers don't seem to realize is that, there are different modes of game play for which they don't take into consideration, especially in GOD MODE or mode of the highest difficulty. As a recent follower of GOW and its series, I have decided to endeavor into the god mode realm of the game due to boredom for which, to my surprise, I had my butt kicked so many times that has made me rethink about the skills that a player can play in the game play. For example, the technicalities does not seem to have much implication on standard mode but when every second, every action, etc. counts, God Mode cuts short of oneâ. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very cool game, im a GOW lover and this is the best that ive played!! If the Score went higher, i would say a 96!! And yet again, his adventure starts on a crashed/sinking ship :). Nothing but an improvement from the first game, who knew the graphics could get this good on a psp!!!!! its the same AAA brutal rewarding combat with added features. its a longer story... what more is not to like!. Brilliant set pieces and graphics for the handheld with some truly magnificent (if somewhat easy) boss battles are only marred by some awkward camera issues and lack of any real innovation. A must but nonetheless. Ghost of Sparta is a great PSP game and a fine addition to the God of War series. The developer has taken the strengths of its console brethren and injected some much needed backstory and character development for Kratos (aka the angriest dude in videogames). By providing gamers with some insight into Kratos' rage, Ready at Dawn has enhanced the series' appeal.. I really liked this game. But I don't know if its for everybody, get it if you want to kill short time. Even though video games are excellent time killers LOL. You wont get as pissed off on the challenges unlike the other god of war games. But don't worry, the game is not a huge letdown like ""chains of olympus"". Overall great game. Recommended Buy!^_^. Absolutely fantastic game! The graphics, combat, and story are all polished and combine to create one of the best experiences to be had on the PSP. I just wish the length was a tad longer. Clocking in at 8 hours is fine, but really need some more to do to increase the replay value.. Though the series hasn't come up with any striking new ideas, Ghost of Sparta nails the fundamentals to bring us a God of War game that is very much just as epic as prior games. It's also a very considerable step up from Chains of Olympus as far as visuals and presentation are concerned. There's no doubt that I think if you consider yourself a PSP fan in anyway at all you should own this without hesitation.. Best PSP game ever made! Graphics are amazing. Story is better and more personal than GOW3. Combat is refined, polished and fun. Pacing is impeccable, it hits all the highs, lows, cool downs etc. I will make 8 hours just disappear!. As a fan of God Of War this is a great game. There are quite a few new weapons as well as some of the older ones in this game. The boss battles so far has been fair, and the graphics are amazing. The only downfall is that it is on the PSP and not the PS3.","this game is not a masterpiece and should be free there is a glitch . the final chapter is the best part of the game, kratos is really the greatest protagonist in video game history . if you are on PC, this game on the PSP and the PS3 is top tier ."
921.Silent Hill 2,"All the characters feel so human and man the way James feels remorse and pain and guilt but also at the same time he doesn't is just peak. The way the game tells you that the most terryfing enemy of a man is your own mind is amazingly well done. Every issue I have with this remake stems from the fact that Bloober and/or Konami decided to double the runtime . Because they knew that messing up with the story too much would get them a lot of backlash they decided to retell it practically beat for beat . So in order to stretch out the game they decided to greatly expand the dungeons and puzzles . For example a door that had a lock that required a key that you got from a puzzle in the original will now have 3 locks which will require 3 keys , 3 puzzles/combat rooms and a LOT more running around . Due to this extra running around they were practically forced to crap 4 times as many enemies and leg monster jumpscares everywhere to keep up the tension and to make the game not feel like a walking simulator . The issue? Not only is SH2 having a hyperfocus on combat is tone deaf but they literally copied and pasted everything from The Last of Us minus the stealth and called it a day . Does the bog standard combat function better comparetively? Sure but combat was never a focal point in the OG so does that ultimatelly matter? . The one true novelty of the remake are the graphics which allow for far more expressive facial animations and make certain scenes far more impactful . I say certain scenes because the in engine stuff can't touch anything the old game did with FMV's in terms of atmosphere and if you disagree that the Maria jail scene was butchered then you are arguing in bad faith . Ultimately the game is not bad unless you decide to compare it to the original and see how much corporate meddling was involved with a lot of the design changes in the remake. The devs have perfectly captured the eerie atmosphere and look of the game. For the most part this is a very good game.. The game dragged on a little too much for my liking, the middle part of the game especially. Repeatedly having to do the same tasks 3 times in each location soon lost its appeal. The combat mechanics are extremely clunky especially during the boss battles. Also too many puzzles, some were okay & others tedious. I did enjoy my playthrough but will certainly not play it again.. This is a masterpiece. I played the original game ages ago. But this one is just an amazing balance of old and new, contemporary gameplay and graphics, acting, sound, design, and the nostalgic mood, great story, and so many references to the original game design.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it’s the first time playing this game and I like it a lot. It reminds me a little bit of Ellen awake2. The story and the message behind the characters is great and the form of the delivery. The quests And the riddles are challenging the interesting overall it’s so well Good game. One of my top 10. I just finished the game never having played the original. I gotta say as a survival horror game this one gets many things right. I honestly would not listen to what anyone that gives this game anything less than a 7. First I am going to talk about what it got right. Atmosphere is key here. Not many games recently have done atmosphere justice like this one. Which I think is essential for the type of genre. You are most of the time thinking what is down that hallway or that room. Jump scares are fewer than other type of similar games, but I honestly think that is for the better rather than overplayed out . The game is is just really eerie. The story is another thing that is makes me keep guessing. If its plain cut and dry whats going on or where its going, it would be disappointing. On top of that their are many endings to this game. While it can be mysterious. At times you are asking yourself what is happening or is it really **** lets talk about the mixed bag. The puzzles in this game at times can be fun and makes you think, meanwhile other times can be absolutely dumb and can make you frustrated, and I enjoy puzzles. The combat is another thing here that is pretty eh. I get this is some action game and that should be a focusing point. However, it is ultimately pretty clunky. Most of the time you are going to be doing melee combat since ammo is pretty scarce in the game. And lastly. The bad. The only real bad thing about this game is the optimization. I have a very expensive PC. 4090 with a 7950 CPU. It can stutter. ALOT. I ended up turning on DLSS and Frame Generation, but would still stutter. Look if you have great taste and want a great game. Buy it. It does so many things right. People are never going to be happy nowadays. They want action packed, they want live service, they want battle passes. This genre of gaming is one of my favorites. If you liked games like RE2 Remake, Dead Space, etc. You will not be disappointed.. The Silent Hill 2 Remake is unsettling and beautiful from the fighting to the puzzles or the environment everything feels well thought out and impactful Would recommend. I had a lot of fun with this game. What really set it apart was the atmosphere and sound design. The graphics and gameplay, though are also above average. The story in characters kept me engaged until the very end.. This game is excellent, I never played the original and wanted to give this game a try because I liked similar games like resident evil. I have about 4 hours into it and am loving it so far. The atmosphere is creepy and I have to sometimes take a break because I feel uneasy about whats going to happen next. The game doesn't hold your hand or point you in the right directions. You have a map with some markings on it and you have to figure it out. The game is beautiful and the gameplay is fun and not too repetitive and keeps you on your toes.. Silent Hill 2 Remake: A Haunting Masterpiece - 9/10. When Silent Hill 2 was first released in 2001, it redefined survival horror with its chilling atmosphere, psychological depth, and complex storytelling. Now, over two decades later, the Silent Hill 2 remake has emerged, and it’s not just an homage to the original but a brilliant reimagining that breathes new life into a classic while retaining its eerie essence. With a delicate balance between nostalgia and innovation, this remake captivates both veterans of the series and newcomers alike.. The remake of Silent Hill 2 was a very thrilled experience. A one and only kind of game. Glad i had to experience it. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The remake of Silent Hill 2 completely drained and wrecked me. There were times during the game when I felt genuinely awful and had to turn it off because I’d just had enough of the whole grim vibe. The best part? I consider that proof of the game’s brilliance. I tend to split horror into two main categories: the entertaining kind, where fear gives you a thrilling buzz, and the genuinely terrifying kind that stirs up a deep sense of unease. The first type is like a spooky rollercoaster ride—fear as a fun attraction. But the second type? That’s an encounter with pure evil, and it’s how I separate good craftsmanship from true art that digs into the core of human existence. I enjoy a well-made horror flick, but watching something like The Exorcist, Rosemary’s Baby, or Hereditary is an entirely different kind of experience. Silent Hill 2 belongs firmly in the second category, though at first, it doesn’t seem like it. The opening gives you an abandoned town, some creepy monsters, and a letter from beyond the grave, which makes it feel like a “fun” kind of scary. For the first hour or two, that impression holds. Sure, Silent Hill isn’t exactly a cheerful spot, but if it weren’t for the monsters roaming the streets, it could pass as a paradise for urbex enthusiasts. But that’s just the surface. Real horror lurks around the corner, and things only get more unsettling as you go. Fear in this game wears many masks. The most obvious is classic horror—the kind that comes from dim lighting, a barely functional flashlight, and the nasty things hiding in the dark. Mostly, it’s monsters jumping out at you, which might seem cheap in films but still packs a punch in games. The remake nails these moments, like when you follow your flashlight beam to see a creature crawling up a wall, only to discover a swarm of them gathering on the ceiling. The darkness hides so much, and you’re never sure if you’ve missed something lurking nearby. Then there’s the psychological horror—the hallmark of this series. If you’ve never played Silent Hill, you’re probably not prepared for how dark James’ story gets. Few games dare to explore the ugliest, most violent sides of human nature like this. The few characters James meets are so broken that it feels like they’ve passed the point of no return. Even James’ quest to find his wife, dead for years, seems doomed from the start, making his journey feel more like a desperate cry than a hopeful mission. Another thing that left a mark on me was the game’s use of disgust-driven fear. This game is outright revolting—filled with grime, rust, bugs, and dried blood. Filthy rooms trigger a primal sense of revulsion, and the developers lean into it, forcing you to crawl along walls or stick your hand into holes, clogged toilets, or unidentifiable goo. The nastiness feels like the final spit in the face of human dignity, not that there’s much left of it in this grim town. All these layers of fear are carefully paced, making it feel like you’re really in a place where the line between reality and nightmare has blurred. James—and by extension, the player—gradually gives in to this twisted world’s shifting rules. At first, everything, even the puzzles, seems logical. But the deeper you go, the stranger it gets, and you find yourself accepting it. That slow descent into madness is terrifying in itself. I mean, jumping into an empty grave to reach the next area? Totally normal, right? Silent Hill 2 isn’t a game designed to entertain—it’s there to fill your soul with darkness and make you confront the worst parts of human nature. It’s not an easy journey, but it’s definitely one that leaves you feeling like you’ve experienced something truly unique.. A one and done kind of game. I was expecting more in terms of replay value and I may not be back. For how few enemy types there are, the game throws a ton of enemies at you. You cant always run away because you need to kill them to explore the rooms safely. The melee combat is extremely repetitive and when you kill 300 enemies a play through it gets tired. Other than the chainsaw there is one melee weapon. The wooden plank and the led pipe are exactly the same and then there are only a few guns. If there were fewer enemies it wouldn't be such a problem. The game drags on and could be a few hours shorter. The variety in gameplay doesn't support the length. You can get all the different endings, but you will be playing the exact same way every time or using the chainsaw and the game just become a chore. This is a very good looking game in most ways. Lighting and faces look really good here. It's just that you have to compromise too much with each graphic mode on base ps5. The 30 fps mode looks great but is choppy and then the 60fps mode is like a dynamic 1080p with reduced reflections/lighting. Not the best offering in 2024. I guess ps5 pro has to ""fix""it. I guess when these devs/publishers don't have to come up with an original concept for a game I just expect more.. I can't really say much that hasn't already been said. I loved the original release, and this remake has improved upon the original in basically every way.. It’s an old game with new graphics. Gameplay and mechanics just feel old. It’s not anywhere near something like „The Last of Us“. There is no real intriguing story, just lots of jumpscares that keeps it exciting.. Amazing game honestly amazing, captures the original atmosphere of the eerie fog and the baron town while improving the graphics and making the game more modern, I agree that it takes some of the original style away but it adds up to it with the realism and the way it can really immerse you. The controls are much better, though the original clunky controls made a lot of sense due to James not being a trained soldier but oh my god were they annoying especially with the camera angle, the remake keeps some of that feeling of James not being experienced with fighting, but the remake just makes it so much more fun to play still a little repetitive but the game was never meant to be an amazing combat game. I find that the voice actors in this game show so much more emotion and I get that the original sh2 with it’s no emotion was part of its charm and eeriness of it all but I much prefer the characters showing emotion because I feel like it suits silent hill 2s story so much more with James being a very emotional person well I don’t know if that’s just me being dumb but that’s what I think. But overall i think they did such an amazing job at recreating such an original masterpiece and I honestly prefer it and see it as a better game, I still love the og and it will always have a special place in my heart as the first horror game I played and having to rely on my older brother when I got too scared, this might just be because I’m younger and played the original when I was like 7 or 8 in 2015 ( and I don’t mean I played the hd I played the original on my ps2 ) but I think that it just makes the game so much more accessible to other people and is such a good way to get into silent hill if you have no prior knowledge because James story is not connected to the first silent hill at all, also with this games success we might even see 1 and 3 get remakes which would make me so happy, but 10/10 I love this game so much and is definitely worth your time to play.. Amazing story, best by far. Genuine horror with terrifying music and ambience!. Complete and utter masterpiece. Period. Master class is sound design. Both open world and linear at the same time. Ending extremely satisfying. Must play.. Rarely do I want to play a game I’ve already played that’s not multiplayer. But the recent wave of remakes , remasters , etc… that keep coming up leaves little new gameplay. Bloober did a great job on this title , and I applaud them. Sounds and sights gave me the same Erie feeling I felt in 2001. That being said I didn’t feel the need to see all endings or replay multiple times. Something is missing in this new generation of console gaming , that being something new that we haven’t already seen and played. Reading others reviews, I can understand, but not relate to those who’ve given almost perfect scores. I’ve been playing games since the Intelevision/ Atari era. Thats over 40 years of gaming!. An incredible game driven by nostalgia, the surreal graphics are too incredible, the gameplay is a success, a great remake brought back from 2001 compared to the original, excellent Bloober Team, this is a masterpiece.. Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic game from 2001 and Bloober Team did everything to make this remake reliable to it’s predecessor. The graphics are very good and the general style was enhanced a lot. Everything was extended so even an old player will find something interesting in this title. Every boss fight is now even more than challenging than in original. Combat was improved a lot. PS5’s controller with it’s unique vibrations and speakers (which are used for the in-game radio detecting monsters) makes every fight very tense. There are a lot of collectibles, with, most noticeable memory glimpses. This expands the story and makes it feel more personal. I really could feel I was James Sunderland. And of course on top of the cake is remade soundtrack, which makes you feel how terrifying Silent Hill is. Remake adds new changes, such as very cool, modern outfit for Maria. Also, there are two new endings on new game +. This gives even more playtime. And trust me, you will play this title more than once, as this title is gripping to the end. The most important thing: gameplay, is just simply fun. You can dodge monsters, shoot them, fight them with melee. Now even the riddles are unique as everyone can choose the difficulty of them as they please. You love solving puzzles? Play on hard. You prefer to have fun by exploring the town and fighting evil creatures? Put them on easy. And yes, they will really be different! This makes it very welcoming for all types of players. That’s what I have to say for the remake. As for game in general, it’s easily 10/10. This is an old classic. You won’t find as good psychological horror as this gets The story itself is very good, it focuses on moral dilemmas and every single location seems to be cooperating with it, giving an outstanding effect. Every single thing you see during playthrough will probably be important later or even impact the ending. Characters are fantastic, each has their own point of view and everyone treats life differently. They are very complex and deep. Akira Yamaoka did a phenomenal job making an unforgettable soundtrack. This game hits you right in the heart. I’m sure when I’m saying there isn’t any game close in terms of what Silent Hill 2 does. The feeling of loneliness and anxiety won’t let you go as you move through the fog. It’s hard to say anything more without spoilers but I’m astonished and impressed. Definitely worth the money. When I was playing the remake I didn’t stumble upon any glitches at all. I can only say: beautiful. This isn’t just a standard horror, it’s very special in a lot of ways.. Almost perfect game. Story is in top 5 ever in gaming (if you understand it), graphics are awesome and modernized gameplay make this game pretty perfect even for today standards! Great work and keep them coming.. Just so well updated. The map compared to Tormented Souls is a great help and saves a great deal of time. Good length. Boss fights OK. The Eddie fight was just annoying in the end but the game balance and atmosphere was so good.. Overall: 65/100 For detailed review see my article on X titled ""Silent Hill 2 (Remake) Review: Stunning Visuals, But a Story That Falls Flat"" Story: 10/20 Gameplay & Controls: 12/20 Graphics: 18/20 Music & Sound: 15/20 Replay Value 10/20. An excellent remake that captures the essence of the original while improving in areas that needed improvement, such as the gameplay and combat. Love the new VAs for the cast of SH2. Luke Roberts, the new VA for James Sunderland deserves a special mention. Bloober proved the haters wrong. A few stutters here and there in the Unreal engine, but patches can fix those issues. A couple of lines in the voice delivery could've been better with a bit more oomph to them, but doesn't take anything away from the experience. Both the new and old fans of the Silent Hill franchise can enjoy this game without a problem.. This was a great game. It took what made the original great and it improved upon it. There are a few things the original did better like certain line deliveries being better or the ps2 graphics adding to the uneasy atmosphere but all in all, I enjoy this version of the game better. If I had 1 big criticism it would be that there is to much combat but it doesn't make me want to play the game any less.. True to it's legacy it feels like Silent hill 2 remake done right. Kudos for some scenes that were extended and gives more depth to it. Weird choice designs with female face characters very different from the first game. From a bloated face to exaggeratedly extended jaw line.. This is how you do a remake of an already legendary video game. Loved the classic and I now love the remake. one of the best horror games i ever played. the graphic is great and the story is entertaining. the best thing about this game is the voice acting which i think has the best voice acting in gaming ever. but i think that the replayablity is really bad and there is too many enemey/action which takes away the horror.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Too repetitive, boring combat. Gives sense of fake freedom while being linear. Most likely Silent Hill problem, rather than Remake’s. I had played almost all the games of Bloober Team. I had expectations from them in such a difficult mission they have chosen to participate to. But at the same I had a lot of faith to them and I can easily and safe say that the remake of one of the most iconic games ever and especially for a Silent Hill fan like me, was a pure masterpiece. In terms of everything. Highly recommend to play it with headphones. Well done to Bloober and Konami. I hope we can have the remake of the Silent Hill 1 too anytime later.. I was really nervous when it became known that Bloober Team cooperated with this SBI-like consulting company. But, luckily, there were user reviews I was waiting for and they were favorable. And oh boy, little idea I had it was going to be one of the best purchases this year. Environment, sound design, regular enemies, boss fights (and I went for tropheys with no radio/melee only on my first playthrough on hard) - everything was perfect to the point I started questioning whether I'm myself in Silent Hill or not. They even somehow managed to incorporate this souls-like combat system in a way that adds to the overall atmosphere. And whatever influence mentioned consulting company might have on development, it was reduced to so miniscule level that I doubt it's noticable much. Konami, don't you dare to lose these developers. Make remaking SH franchise their top priority in your cooperation. I'm pretty sure they can even fix Homecoming if you ever decide to greenlit its remake. It's absolutely deserved 10/10 and could be 100/10, but Metacritic doesn't allow it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I hope Konami do Remake for the other Silent Hill games, I think this franchise deserves. They got everything right. This should become the gold standard for how to do a remake. By only complaint is that there's no extra secret options menu. Bummer But they did add extra endings so I'll get over it. As someone new to the franchise, I expected to enjoy it, given my love for recent horror games like Resident Evil, Dead Space, and Callisto Protocol. However, this was a frustrating experience. The gameplay shows its age, with few quality-of-life improvements. The map doesn’t show when a room is cleared out, leaving you endlessly searching for items in dark, repetitive environments without direction. Combat feels like a chore—too many enemies, few variations, and the frustration of them getting back up even on lower difficulties. I didn’t make it past the Blue Creek Apartments, as the dull environments and aimless exploration left me bored and irritated. For me, this fell flat.. Best remake I have ever played, I was so glad that bloober team did justice with the original and was truly an amazing experience. Never played the original, but I decided to give game a shot. The atmosphere and sound design are amazing, really makes you feel on edge and tense. The exploration really keeps you engaged and wanting to continue. The combat is a bit basic, but goes to James being a regular guy and not a trained marksman like Jill Valentine. The story is an amazing, timeless classic that makes you think about it even after beating the game. Really surprised at how well they executed the psychological horror. It’s not just a pretentious, and incoherent mess. The puzzles are unique and the 8 different endings encourage replays. Can’t recommend it enough, one of the best horror games ever!. To be honest, I didn't expect they could make this game this good. Developers did a great job here. Soundtracks, story and graphics are topnotch. If you are an old gamer, gameplay will take you old times with modern touches. This is what we should expect when they say remake.. It is the best thing i have ever seen in my entire life, i can’t explain how much i admire this piece of art, it is truly the best thing that humans have delivered us.. A profoundly beautiful, haunting, and frightening retelling of an all time classic horror story. The narrative is expertly written and woven into the gameplay while providing a deeply harrowing look at the fragility of the human psyche. The puzzle designs are excellent overall and find various creative ways to make you think outside the box. The art direction is absolutely stellar with eerily liminal and claustrophobic environments that constantly keep you on edge. As you explore more of the town, these environments gradually morph from realistic and believable locations to sinister and otherworldly areas that seem to bend reality in ominous ways. The moment to moment gameplay is extremely suspenseful and downright terrifying at times due to multiple factors. The impeccable sound design is some of the best I have ever seen in the survival horror genre and completely immerses you within the ghastly environments of Silent Hill. The monsters designs are grotesque and nightmarish while also being symbolic of the core themes of the game. Moreover, many of the monsters are surprisingly smart and will stealthily ambush you from the darkness like a predator hunting its prey. Overall, this is a brilliantly effective piece of horror that showcases the genre at its most compelling and unforgettable.. MWAH Literally perfect down from graphics , atmosphere to sound design. Perfectly horrifying game. What the developers have done with this game is worthy of all honors. With these fans, this remake had little chance from the start. The presentation, the combat system, the atmosphere, the sound and visual effects are all of the highest standard. Hats off to this fantastic remake.. Best Game, ever best remake ever ,bes tstory ever ,best atmosphere ever ,best horror game ever, best graphic ever, best complexity ever made in gaming history since now. this game has everything that is attacking to made literally perfect. there is not one point that is not good abt this remake the only game that is truly a masterpiece without any bad things. Perfect remake on an PS2 alltime classic. I personally never really played the original myself, just watched it here and there at my buddys house that time or on youtube **** me THIS is an REAL HORROR GAME! The sound design, the enemies, the atmosphere and the deep deep content of the story is amazing. This game let you feel so uncomftorable in the right way.Only small minor point for me was the fact that there were a bit to many enemies overall. Here and there a bit less enemies and it would have been perfect.I had the ""Maria - James ****"" ending which I really liked and I rarely experienced such and ending anywhere else!. A true plot masterpiece. Of course, praising a game only for its plot is a bad sign, but the plot is so good that it can easily rank with literary classics.. Without having played the original, I found this to be the perfect survival horror game. The story hits hard and tackles very complex themes about the human condition. It keeps the tension high all the way to the end.. I’ll be the first to admit when I saw the original trailer and teasers for the Silent Hill 2 Remake I was sure it was going to be a big turd but I’m happy to admit how wrong I was. While I’ve been a SH fan since SH1 back on PS1 I also admit I’m by no means a rabid fan and I haven’t played the original SH2 in decades so I won’t speak much on the quality of retelling the story. What I can say is what I love and that this remake excels at is atmosphere. The sound design is phenomenal, from brushing up against chain link fences, random woman sighs coming from seemingly no where, and the soundtrack that brought the creepy factor up to another level. The voice acting was great too and captured the bizarre and fever dream dialogue of the original. The graphics were also fantastic and I loved how dark the game was and how your flashlight would flicker especially when facing enemies. All the praise aside there are a couple issues that really kept this game from true greatness. The combat is quite clunky and there were a few battles where the camera went bonkers in tight corridors that caused me to almost lose battles. Perhaps the developers were trying to capture the energy of what is essentially a man who has no combat experience but it was more frustrating than anything. Also, trying to interact with items was often a pure headache. I’d be directly in front of something but couldn’t pick it up until I moved the camera in what felt like random directions. But my biggest gripe, and quite frankly the most baffling, is that this game has caused my PS5 to shut down completely and I can’t restart it until I unplug and then re plug it in. I haven’t had my PS long and have never encountered this with any other game and from searching online I see that I’m not the only player experiencing this. To see this game getting so much praise and nominations for awards with such a huge game breaking issue is wild to me and ultimately what keeps me from giving it anything higher than a 6 until it is fixed.. This game is outstanding—easily the best game I’ve played this year, even in a year when I played and beat Elden Ring. I had never played the original Silent Hill 2. I left this feeling like I’ve suffered through psychological trauma haha; the scary moments just didn’t end. One after the other, and always upping the ante. If you’re looking for a game that feels like psychological torture, this is it. Turn off the lights, crank up the audio, and immerse yourself. Don’t look up any instructions or guides (much like Elden Ring, just go with it). It took me over a week to beat; I played on hard difficulty but kept puzzles on the standard setting. Letting my dog out at night towards the end of that week, I thought I saw shadows moving haha. The game genuinely made me feel like a kid playing a game again – I haven’t felt that way in years. I also haven’t beaten a game and have it stick with me like this in years. It’s a gaming experience that I’ll remember for the rest of my life. I remember being scared by Dead Space when it was first released, and it was my personal best horror experience prior to Silent Hill 2, however, in hindsight Dead Space relies on jump scare and individual moments – Dead Space is fantastic, but this... this from beginning to end felt more of a truely psychologically tortuous experience... from the boss designs, to the sense of mystery, the dreamy/ awkward dialogue, the slow burn when peeling away at levels and puzzles; level after level you just feel unease. It's outstanding. You finally leave with so many questions after the game, but you can dive into the lore online and find answers that make things click into place - a great benefit of a being a 20+ year old game. I’ve read reviews saying some sections feel padded. I can empathise with this view thinking on it... but at the time when playing, I honestly didn’t feel that way. The game’s length felt perfect to me and never overstayed its welcome. I never review things here... but I wanted to look back on this review in the future. I genuinely loved this game. (FYI - turn off the low-health screen effect in the settings; you won’t need it, and it keeps the immersion intact. Just look at your controller.). This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the BEST Remake of a classic ""survival horror"" game that I have ever had the privilege of playing in recent times. It was a surreal experience that made me feel uncomfortable, insecure, scared, sad and always with my heart pounding... all the feelings that a true psychological ""Survival Horror"" game must be able to convey to the player! I recommend it 100% Thank you to Bloober Team for the EXCELLENT work they did","the game dragged on a little too much for my liking, the middle part especially . the one true novelty of the remake is the graphics which allow for far more expressive facial animations and make certain scenes far more impactful ."
922.Trials HD,"This is an amazing game like holy **** I 100% the game and it's the best. Try it out on Xbox one also. Great, endless fun with hilarious ragdoll physics that will leave you chuckling as your player is 'twerking' while in the ground. Apart from that, this is a great, simple and challenging game!. A great addictive game with a fantastic physics engine and a fun selection of mini games, the more challenging maps will keep you playing for a long time but can be very frustrating.. I loved trials ever since it came out. I am giving it a solid 8 because I can't tell you how many countless frustrating hours I spent trying to finish the extra games on it. The game was innovative an original. I liked competing against my friends scores or taking turns trying to beat the impossible levels. Hours of entertainment in my home all thanks to Trials HD. Good Job redlynx. When it comes to addictive gameplay, Trials is one of the first games that comes to mind. It's easy to pick up and play a few quick levels, or you can focus on spending time conquering the harder ones. The smooth controls, over-the-top sets and hilarious deaths make for a fun time. In addition to the main series of levels, there are side challenges that are equally as fun and a nice change of pace. You won't regret buying it.. This is probably one of my favorite games ever. I play almost everyday, I actually hold some of the top record in trials evolution. Look me up, King Krai. I am 200 something for the big air challenge. Trials HD and Evo are epic games. I jam Race Bike Wipeout on the go now because it's essentially the iVersion of the game. I think I have issues with making imaginary people crash and rag doll... As with many of Xbox Live arcades best games Trials HD takes a simple concept and produces an addictive downloadable title. In this case that simple concept involves traversing a motorcycle obstacle course within a set time limit. As one would expect this becomes increasingly difficult as the game progresses and the later levels will challenge even the most skilled of gamers. The very definition of ‘just one more go’ gaming.. Trials HD is one of the most better XBLA games of Microsoft, is funny, addictive, interesting. The graphics are awesome, the gameplay, wow, is really powerful. All the game is amazing. Trials HD is one of the most better options on XBLA.. This is the best game I have ever played so far. I really mean this. Maybe it is not suitable for beginners or very casual players because it really needs some skill. Have to say that I hate motorbikes thought. Which is strange but that just shows how good this game is. :-). Trials HD is one of the best, as well as one of my favorite games that I have ever played. I have had it over 2 years now and it has gotten to the point where I have all the achievements and metals and the record on every track compared to all of my friends, yet i still find myself coming back and playing it nearly every day. On top of the fun to play tracks, the replay system lets you watch the top people in the world and see how they do things and can even teach you things you didn't know, or faster routes or even if you've never been able to complete a track, how to finish it off. Then sense of satisfaction from beating a track or your friends times is endless. Even now being under 600th in the world at this game, i still just want to beat my own times and move up the leaderboards. This game is endless fun and has so much to do and so much to improve no matter what skill level you are. This games is a must play, if you don't have it by now, PLAY THE DEMO and buy this amazing XBLA game!. A time-waster among time-wasters! But here, that's no bad thing... The controls are simplicity itself (accelerate, brake, tilt forwards & backwards) but don't let that fool you - there are hours of perfecting techniques and infinitesimal adjustments to tilting the bike that will keep you on your toes. Coupled with the fact that you can replay almost instantly, and you can see where your friends were at the same time on any given course, and this is one the most addictive games you're ever likely to play. So, one more go anyone?. One of the best games on XBLA PERIOD. Easy to learn, fun to play and difficult to master. Challenging difficulty levels, different tournaments, online leaderboards and a track editor/creator make this a must buy for all xbox360 owners.. Freaking fun, this is one of the games that it's hard but innovates by the big joy it offers. In a list of the top most downloadable games Trials HD is a most own tittle along with Limbo, Toy Soldiers etc.. No **** on my review. I bought this game over a year ago and have since put, no kidding, over 500 hours into it. Usually racing games and sports game don't really do it for me at all, but this...I mean, come on. Every little thing you succeed in with this game will bump you up the leader board, which is by far the most addictive part about it. If you get a bronze medal in a track, go for silver. Got a silver, go for gold, then platinum, then just try to get better than everyone else in the world. The physics are perfect. The track design, at its best is brilliant, especially in Big Thrills DLC (all user-created tracks, of which the built-in editor allows for amazing creations). This game will frustrate those who can't appreciate it, but to those who can, welcome to hours upon hours of mind-numbing fun.. Trials HD is an excellent physics bases trials racing game - With it's in-game track editor and huge learning curve the game has an infinite replay value. Trials HD is an enjoyable XBLA game. Its best aspect is its physics that will have players imagining how to navigate their motorbikes long after they put the controller down. Tracks are diverse, even amusing at times and always fun to play. Online leaderboards are a great incentive to keep playing. However, there is a steep difficulty curve particularly in the transition from medium to hard tracks. This means that many players wont even reach many levels which is a shame. Enjoyment soon turns to frustration from failure after failure. Overall though, Trials HD is a worthy addition to any XBLA library.. Its a really cool little arcade game, great graphics lots of tracks and an editor too. This game really provides you with a challenge once you get into the harder courses. The only thing I see this game needs is some more polishing on the physics on some bikes making some courses a nightmare. Other than that its a great little game.. The game is truly one of the best Arcade games I've seen in my life. Stunning graphics, excellent gameplay, great music, and has a variety of settings and amazing motorcycles. The free modes are amazing and funny bestiality again, albeit with a very small portion of bloodshed. Also not hard (1200 MSP) compared to what it entails. My note was undoubtedly a resounding and well deserved 9 .. This game is remarkably fun and also insanely challenging. If you are on the fence about this game due to seeing some rather bland screenshots somewhere, do yourself a favor and just buy it and play. The physics of the bikes is amazing, and the controls are tight as can be. I actually just bought an add-on pack for this game in order to race some additional tracks.. Trials HD is a superb quality production ****. It contains all the landmark features of a masterpiece, the old; easy to learn - hard to master and addictive game-play techniques are sprung instantly upon your first few minutes of playing the game. You'll soon learn that although the mechanics at first appear simple, the three buttons you have at your arsenal are going to drive you insane, in a good way, as you will have to perfect your skills to complete the later - much harder levels. You do not have to be interested in motocross or motorbikes at all, before long you will be only interested in beating your own times (and all your mates) by split seconds attempts to shave time off jumps, tricks and flips for bragging rights. The basic concept is to get from the start of a level, ride from left to right to the finish line. The way in which you must do this revolves from the right trigger (acceleration from rear wheel), left trigger (brake) and the left analogue stick controls the riders posture (the basis for all bunny hops, lands and flips, you will depend on this for better times). There's a catch, however, as once the beginner mode is over it's onto harder times. There is also a track editor, where it is possible to make anything that has already been made by the Trials HD staff, but with your own creativity thrown in - these can be played via friends on XBOX LIVE. A replay mode for the best 5000 scores on every level, customizable colours for your bike and rider, skills mode for interesting game-play mechanics, endurance tournaments, DLC (Big Pack), and soon to be released DLC Big Thrills. Bang for buck this game far outweighs anything I've yet to discover on XBOX LIVE Arcade - and competes against retail games for fun, depth, re-playability and price. A must buy for all Xbox Live members.. This game is absolutely brilliant. Addictive, fun there's nothing about it to not like, an absolute must buy for anyone and everyone. I think it is possibly one of the best games on XBLA. The controls work perfectly, the graphics are surprisingly good considering it's 2D, one of the best games i have ever played.","trials HD is one of the most better XBLA games of Microsoft . it's easy to pick up and play a few quick levels, or you can focus on conquering the harder ones . it's easy to pick up and play a few quick levels, or you can focus on conquering the harder ones ."
923.Panzer Corps 2,"Panzer Corps 2 represents a significant improvement over its predecessor, offering a more balanced and refined experience. One of the immediate changes that might catch your eye is the transition to 3D graphics. Initially, I was skeptical, but as I delved into the game, the 3D environment began to grow on me, adding a new layer of depth to the experience. Perhaps the most noteworthy upgrade is the game's balance and level design. While perfection may still elude the level design, it's markedly superior to its predecessor, thanks to the introduction of diverse objectives. These objectives not only keep the gameplay fresh but also infuse a higher level of challenge. Panzer Corps 2 excels in delivering deep strategic elements. Players must carefully consider unit deployment, terrain utilization, weather conditions, and the effective use of generals. If you're a fan of World War II strategy games or enjoyed the original Panzer Corps, this sequel should undoubtedly find a place in your collection. In summary, Panzer Corps 2 is a commendable evolution of the franchise, offering enhanced graphics, better balance, and deeper strategy elements. It's a must-try for WW2 strategy enthusiasts and fans of the original Panzer Corps.. A joy to play. Supports some additional and important tactical options than before, and still in an approachable system with loads of depth. Looks great. Looking forward to the traditional expansions for the US/UK campaigns, but what you get already is of course plenty of content.. The game tries to be so realistic that it tells you when you win a battle that your side actually lost according to history. It will even tell you if slightly different tanks are used. But then presents female soldiers and officers and plays it straight, even has the male officer fangirl over how strong they are.. Waited it so long to be disappointed so much…. I don’t expect miracles from the industry these days, but to screw up a perfectly fine game, in exactly the same way SSI did it with PG2/3 – one would expect devs to do their homework. Who on Earth asked you to do a classic wargame in 3D? Oh, oh, I’m so happy my PzIV turns its turret, wohoo! C’mon. Air units sometimes are barely visible unless you hit the Tab key, especially if located above multiple land units. Ok, my eyes are not what they used to be, but still. For me the only way to visually discern, say, Dorniers 217 from U-88 from Bf110 at normal viewing distance was to put different liveries on them. All in all, graphics are a step (or two) back. Thanks, thanks a lot for that. No, really, PG1, released 25 years ago, with simple, but reasonably detailed, unit icons and nice animations, looked better. Amount of content is, well, underwhelming. Ok, I understand, guys plan to sell lots of dlc like '39-’40-you name-it campaigns, Africa-corps 2, allied/soviet/pacific/alien-vs-predator corps 2 and so on, and live from it for years, but hey – for people to buy a dls to the game they at least have to remember it exists, which is not the case here. Balance seems… not really thought out. FlaK 18, the acht-acht, in terms of core slots costs as a Tiger, while lacking armor, ability to use it offensively, unless certain heroes are embedded, and decimated by “support fire” trait. Captured units, that provided so much fun in PC1, became almost impossible to obtain and operate, unless you are fine with severely reduced unit headcount and minimal to no reinforcements available. Artillery pieces cost sky high, and you need lots of them cos they’ve been nerfed compared to PC1. And remember – LeFH 10,5 will support your units against attacks of soft-type enemies, PACs – against hard types, SFH-15s – against both, and K-17, costing a small fortune – against none of them. Don’t mix it up, soldier! What else? Encirclements? Fine, but I can swear I’ve seen it somewhere nearby. Heroes fine, but mostly useless. Constant rush to capture all victory points in time while trying to figure out, whether you have to draw reinforcements and pay extra or can make do and save prestige, feels like work, not fun. Different types of objectives? Nope, never heard. When you move a unit there is no indication of terrain in target hex. Thank you very much, it cost me half of Tiger prototypes cos that hex turned out to be town. All in all? I’ve returned to PC1 to never look back. Game is not that bad on itself, it deserves 5 or six, but gets only 3 because most of the effort was put into wrong places. Let’s consider it “supporting fire” trait.. As a fan of grand strategy games end enthusiast of WWII i can highly recommend this title. Don't listen those frustrated guys who gave 2/10 because they didn't receive a tons of new content compared to PC1. You can expect a lot of fun on many prepared scenarios and on procedurally generated maps in a new game mode, so the sky is the limit!. From Panzer General to Panzer Corps 2, beer and nuts war games have been great fun. Panzer Corp 2 brings 3D Graphics, a huge variety of vehicles, and great changes to the ruleset. I couldn't rely on my experience at first and had to relearn all over. Still easy to play but more strategic. Although the 3D rendering is a nice change, planes especially can be hard to find on the background.. Really disappointed with this game . WAY OVERPRICED - A BIG RIP OFF. All scenarios very similar ! Now Unity of Command 1 and 2 they are GREAT games. Challenging , thoughtful scenario construction and re-playable again and again. PC2 £50 to change some camoflage on your units. WOW !. A treat for all strategy fans. Much improved graphics over Panzer Corps 2. Many new mechanics like encirclement, supply and core slots make this a fresh take on the series which . It is challenging and there is a lot of content. More will come in the form of dlc’s and mods.. Great game. The king is back ! If you are reading the reviews looking at if you should buy the game... I say: yes you must have it.. Waiting so long for such crap. What a disappointment. After years of working on the title, that's what we heard from the producer, we get a copy of PC1 only with other colors and 3D images. No improvements, maps are almost the same. One of the best strategy games since original Panzer General is not evolving. Actually you can play the original tile from 1994 and have the same fun without spending big cash on the 2020 remake, I feel cheated by this release from **** the others said, it's a classic rip off. Better go for the Unity of Command II title in the same genre. Fresh, eyecatching strategy that brings a lot of fun, improvement and innovation.. Very disappointing. First off, the release was over an hour late, so thanks for having me stare at the steam page refreshing every 2 minutes for an hour. Second off - I'm deeply disappointed, and hate the game. Which is sad, because I loved the first game. It suffers from the same crap Panzer General suffered from when it went from 2D to 3D - somehow they think they need to change other things that worked too. I like the new tactical debth to some units, and hate the changes they made to others - like for instance that artillery now no-longer can support adjacent units being attacked by hard units(tanks etc), and is generally worthless when it comes to scoring any kind of damage. Now they are relegated to uber-crap support units. Here's my main gripes with the game, tho; As with Panzer General, it went from a somewhat ""massive"" scale, where you could have cool combinations of units and field quite a force, to now limiting you excessively, and leaving both you and the enemy with less units on the field, that for some stupid reason have more numbers per unit in a hex. This is terrible. Now you can't be as tactical as you could before, because there are so damn little units to play around with. There's a new core pool, and it's **** Instead of having a set number of units you can mix and match for the tactic of your pleasing, now you are limited to a core number that each unit fills up an excessive amount of, and oversizing units seems somewhat a must (infantry is oversized by default, and it ****) - the graphics are messy and somewhat confusing, and hurts my attention-span to look at, and tires me. I did not enjoy this one bit. I wanted to. I've been looking forwards to it for years. But what they delivered is unacceptable garbage. I can't bother writing much more, but it's safe to say that unless they radically change the game, it's trash. Just stick to the original. It is still a 10/10 for me - this seems amateur-like, and just plain ****. Devoid of fun. What happened with PG 3D? They removed the sense of tactics by severely limiting the number of units you can control - and the same is true here. Among several other terrible... TERRIBLE mistakes they've made decision-wise while making this pile of steaming ****. Steer clear. Not worth your money at the asking-price, or even a third of it. I wish I pirated it. I want my money back. This was garbage. Matrix/slitherine games are usually hit or miss. This was a huge miss. 2/10. Do better. I just really don't want to ever start this game up again. Had to go 0/10 to make the actual score more correct. Blatant idiots keep giving it 10/10. This is nowhere near 10/10. It's misleading BS.. A great turn-based strategy for VS or Co-op multiplayer. You can play it ""via e-mail"": make your turn and upload. You do not need to wait for your opponent in-game. A major improvement over Panzer Corps 1: the game is faster, good to look at and at the same time is more rewarding and tactical.. This game's a rip off and a bad one at that. Even disregarding the price, it's still not very good and a major let down. First of all, the content. This game costs premium, but all you get is only the Wehrmacht campaign yet again. Yup, same old campaign that you've played dozens of times already if you're a fan of the genre. Panzer General had German campaign, but Panzer General 2 had 2 German campaigns, 2 Allied campaigns and a Soviet one to boot. This is just ridiculous. They claim the campaign has 60 scenarios or something, but of course in reality it's about 20, as it's a branching campaign just like in PC1 that you won't play more than once, cause you'll be bored out of your mind anyway. You now have two currencies to manage your army, as core slots aren't the number of units anymore. Different units have different core slots prices now and you need to mix and match. This sounds fine, but then you look at the system and immediately realize that the devs were either drunk, trolling or have extremely vague idea about their own game. For example fairly useless AA units can cost same, or sometimes even more, amount of slots as a full fighter unit. Just lol. Who in their right mind will use the AA units then? Congrats on completely invalidating an entire branch of units with their own models, stats, etc. Don't even get me started on other things, such as artillery pieces costing same as 2-3 tanks and other idiocies. This will probably get patched as time goes on, but still a massive rotfl and ""you just have no idea what you're doing, do you"" badge for all involved. The new graphic engine ****, but everyone knew that already. Shooting for 3D in a niche strategy game when you don't have resources to make it look good, because you think it will bring more sales. Let's think how many times this has worked. Oh, right - never. All you get is poor readability and strategic overview when compared to 2D. The graphics are simplistic, blurry and some assets are just absolutely hideous - ships, for example. Some animations seem to be completely missing: destroyed tank will blow up and leave a wreckage, but artillery just vanishes into thin air. The music and sound design is poor as well. The production values are nowhere near the money demanded for this game. The game is also streamlined and a lot of features were stripped. There's a lot of that, so let me name a few: no different victory types based on performance, no SE units, smaller maps, lack of differentiation in objectives, copious amount of turns to complete each mission, lack of new equipment summary at the start of a mission... There are some things I like: - Heroes are now impactful with unique abilities like in PG2, not boring +number to a stat like in PC1 - Units have new special abilities, which are often quite interesting, for example parking recon near an enemy unit will give accuracy bonuses to all attackers - Point buy system to customize your game with positive and negative traits Other changes are just meh/whatever, like splitting units in half when it costs additional slot and time or the need to re-base your aircraft to provide more air coverage, which again costs time. Overall, avoid this game now and maybe come back in a couple of years when there's some full dlc edition at like -60%. Even if you like what you see it's a horrible deal for the current price.. This game is not panzer corps at all. This game is order of battle with some skins. Play isn't fun anymore.. almost nothing new besides heroes and overrun. short campaign with 23 missions, technical problems and so on.. Gameplay is like in PzC1, but with 3D (which is unnecessary, 2D was better) and heroes (interesting, but we can live without them). You can find technical problems. And be ready to see short campaign (only 23-24 missions). The worst thing of the game is publisher. Slitherine is absolutely inadequate company. I’ve said here about no bonuses for those who are in quarantine (for example, new stage of beta), no preload, overprice and censorship at the official forum (publisher closed some themes where gamers criticized Slitherine). And then I was banned forever. So, these guys will ban everyone who criticizes their games. Dear developers, please, find another publisher with adequate employees.",it's a must-try for WW2 strategy enthusiasts and fans of the original Panzer Corps . the game tries to be so realistic that it tells you when you win a battle that your side actually lost according to history . but then presents female soldiers and officers and plays it straight .
924.Her Story,"Innovative gameplay mechanic that made me wish the game was longer and there were more cases to investigate. Terrific acting by the lead.. Her Story pushes the boundaries of what a game is. It grabbed me by the collar in a way that more traditional and widely lauded story-driven games haven't quite managed.. Whether or not this is really a game, can be a point of contention. But I liked the experience, and after more puzzle pieces started to fall into place while watching the videos, I liked it.. Original ? Yes. Interesting ? No ! I was expecting an investigation game in the role of a police officer. In fact the gameplay boils down to watching videos corresponding to a keyword. Little by little we unravel this whole murder story and then the game stops. Not really an investigation game so.... Short story game, where you search with keywords for videos about a murder case. You as the player dont really know why you watch these clips, but in the end you get it. Took me 4 hours to watch/find all the clips and make up my mind about what happened. Very unique experience and fun.. Design: 5 Mechanics: 3 Content: 5 Simple gameplay of the same type. Quickly gets bored.. the same game, in turn, gives you a new gaming experience and makes you feel like a real detective, it's interesting to delve into this, but the story can be made even more intense. An interesting experiment that demonstrates the different ways that the video game industry has to tell a story.. This game gave me a lot of inspiration both on storytelling and simulator design. The story is mind-blowing and I enjoyed how it unfolds dramatically throw the video clips searching process.. This is a game you cannot win. You are presented with a series of some 200 videos (total 90 minutes long) of police (inaudible) interviewing a woman regarding her missing husband. The catch is you cannot watch them in order, but have to search by guessing key words which gets you only the top 5 matches. Once you watch a certain number of the key videos, you get a popup asking you if you want to quit or you can keep going to try and find more videos. That's it, that's the whole game. Notice you do not have to do any detective work, or find clues or solve any mysteries. The whole gameplay consists of watching a woman talk for 90 minutes. You just keep searching for videos until you decide to stop (or you can just watch them all in order on YouTube). Now the mystery is well done and there are lots of twists and turns to find. I liked the acting. It could have made a good movie, but this video game format is just contrived and frustrating.. A unique game, that most people have never seen before. Sam Barlow's games are some of the most interesting games I have seen. In Her Story you go through several interviews and watch clips to find out what is going on. You can change the clips by using the search function, if you search ""apple"" you will see every time someone says ""apple"". It is so unique and I love it, ofc it is not for everyone, but I think if you like a good story and care more for that than amazing gameplay then this is a game you should check out.. A captivating narrative experience built by brilliant storytelling and a strong acting performance.. This game caters for a particular niche. People who primarily play traditional games don't seem to understand this. Not all games have to be shooters, adventures or platformers. This is basically a modernised text game with videos that will engage your mental faculties. If you're not into that, don't buy it and then bemoan the lack of ""gameplay"". I, personally, find it absolutely riveting.. Her Story is an interactive film video game written and directed by Sam Barlow. In the game, the player searches and sorts through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and uses the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.. The game doesn’t have a satisfying ending. It’s unnatural and disappointing, felt like the game was a waste of time when I started searching for numbers from one to ten just to find new and irrelevant clips. More like a google search simulator to me. Only has one type of interaction and one type of stimulus during the whole experience, which makes it a bland and unidimensional interactive story. You just keep waiting for something to happen, and the game doesn’t give you indications of progress besides some, little animations and database percentages. The chat system is poor, it could help me to see that I am doing progress.. I truly felt like a detective playing the game. The vintage art direction reminded me of MS-DOS days and VHS tapes. The acting is great, the story is good (but not great to be honest), the music is fine, the gameplay is closer to the puzzle game (that's why 8 and not 9, they're not my favorite genre per se). A video game equivalent of Bandersnatch episode of Black Mirror.. This interactive movie is not a game by any means It's dull and boring. The acting is meh. I'd rather just watch a 1 hour long movie then spend time clicking on 30 seconds clips trying to figure out what's this about. The database search that shows only the 5 first entries defies its own purpose.. Unfortunately it's pretty short, mostly because of the idea. But it is really good stuff! Very innovative and intriguing game.. This is one of the most unique gaming experiences I´ve ever had. To the people who think that this is not a game: Seriously? Where is the line? In my opinion, it doesn´t even matter it it´s a game. It´s an amazing storyline that you get to follow, similar to Life is Strange.. Very unique game. This is very different experience. But the story needs more clear.. 10/10 Idea 9/10 for the execution The game is an absolute indie masterpiece and I much recommend it! The only beef I have with this game is that it doesn't have a proper ending. It leaves you with the feeling ""Wait, that's it?"" when you finish the game. At least that's what happened to me. So be prepared for an amazing game with such an ending, and you'll not be disappointed! I recommend watching this video after playing through the game: ****/fFveBzbyIVA Finally, from the game design perspective, it's not quite clear to the player that the part of the database colored yellow is the video that you're currently watching, meaning you have found that video. Don't let that confuse you at the end if you are aiming for collecting all the video footage. The green parts are all the videos you have collected, red parts are all the videos missing, and a yellow part is a video you're currently watching, meaning you have collected it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game way better than your mom and It is must play game it got goty award kinda cool Great classic story Kid dont play it only mature people. The storytelling technique was different. It's an interesting mystery game which makes you feel like a detective. 6hrs on record.. On the one hand game-play is very simple without very much variations of actions, but on the other hand it is exiting to follow her story in the game. I like this game.. After years of curiosity I decided to try Her Story out, and I have to say that **** completely flabbergasted as to why this has so many high reviews and received so much media praise. This ""game"" is an interesting little proof of concept at best, but as a ""game"" it's absolute trash that becomes incredibly boring very fast, I mean REALLY fast. This is coming from someone who really enjoys interactive movie type games like what Telltale and Quantic Dream produce. Her Story even fails to accomplish that level of engagement.. It's an interactive movie where you're playing detective and trying to figure out the story from a single location. Overall, the story is ok. There are no weak spots, but there are also no outstanding moments. It's kind of forgettable game.. I don't care if ""Her Story"" is technically a game or not. What's important is wether it delivers on its premise. The general idea is that you play detective by watching interrogation tapes related to a crime. However, you can only access files by searching for the correct keywords. In theory that's an interesting concept, allowing the player to slowly unravel the story as you figure out more and more plot points. In execution this won't always work. I think the very mixed user reviews of this game reflect that one player may have a vastly different experience from another player, depending on the order in which they ""unravel"" the video clips. In my playthrough (no spoilers) I had a great time for the first 20 minutes or so as I discovered all kinds of ""storylines"" and clues. Then I ran out of keywords to search for, so for an hour I was backpedaling to old videos or blindly searching for keywords to get access to new videos. I barely made any progress in that time, since many of the videos I found were completely redundant/pointless and didn't provide any new clues at all. Then suddenly (it felt like it was by accident) I got to the end of the story: For me it fell completely flat, while still leaving many plot points unanswered. There are statistics in the game that show how many clips you uncovered and it seems like I jumped wildly in the database, while having huge chunks of videomaterial missing in between. I could try to go back and figure out the missing parts of the story but it seems like way to much effort as I already solved the case and I haven't found the right keywords. The great flaw of the game is that there is no pre-planned pacing. A player may ""solve"" the case in 5 minutes without knowing any of the backstory or characters. Another player might spend hours uncovering every detail, knowing exactly how it will resolve but lacking the right keyword to get to the ending. Oh, and also the acting is pretty mediocre. It was one of those seasonal story games, but it grabbed my attention. I found the experience very unique for a video game albeit in te video format. The plot was interesting and the investigation was not trivial at all, there were some twists and turns. Overall I'd say it was worth a try for the uniqueness of the experience alone.. Her story is unique experience, story tailored by your own curiosity. It is only 1-3 hours long, but it really hooked me and left searching the internet for additional clues. P.S. Make sure not to 'brute force' the solution or you might accidentally ruin most of the fun.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Super interesting concept - I really loved this game and I felt like I had a really unique experience trying to solve the mystery of what was going on.. An engrossing experience from start to finish Her Story is a game like nothing you've ever played before. Fantastically acted and written once you sit in the detectives chair you won't be able to leave until you've solved the mystery.. This game is definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. It's worth it if it's cheap, basically it's a movie and cheaper than going to see one. Great little story where you piece it together and search for what has happened in the Story.. If you like FMV games and murder mysteries, what are you waiting for? Her Story ticks all the right boxes. The only criticism I could make is that the game might not be enough of a traditional game to some since it's more of an exercise in exploring videos on an old PC at your own pace. However, I still enjoyed the game and appreciated its strong narrative as well as the nostalgia factor (Win 95 represent!).. Her Story breaks the conventional barrier with how unconventional it is. It subverts your expectations of what constitutes a game and might infuriate you, but it is well crafted and commits to its purpose of letting you uncover its story. Going into it, I had initial expectations of playing detective and piecing together evidence, which is true to an extent. However this small title achieves this by simple watching of short clips as short as a few seconds to a little over a minute. The only ""actress"" plays a woman being interviewed regarding her husband's death. It's easy to assume who the culprit is, but the meat and backbone of this story rests on the believability of the character and the details that surround the story. It's as simple as typing in keywords you observe and watching the clips that correspond, but it was very interesting and learning most of her motives by the end is a challenge. It's not chronological, but it's designed in a way that it tailors your interest until you pull the curtains and reach a poignant conclusion only described in text. Her Story isn't exactly astounding, the actress isn't always spot on in her delivery and because of the total reliance on her performance, it hurts some key story ""clips"". It's not exactly fun either and can be frustrating when you become stumped at conjuring words to obtain more clips. Some of the clips drag on, and others are insanely short and irrelevant (even to the smaller details that matter) it boggles me as to why they were included. It's definitely under fire by the community for not being a game and this backlash isn't totally unfounded, there isn't anything that resembles game mechanics aside from an othello clone you'll play for one achievement, but Her Story is an engaging experiment that succeeds in what it set out to do. We need more games like Her Story not for the sake of telling a story, but for how it conveys its story to its players, trusting them to piece it together.. Why isn't this in the movie section? This is NOT a video game. I'm not joking. Look it up on youtube if you don't believe me. This is a movie where you are rarely forced to click your mouse sometimes. Interactive movies are not video games, regardless of what some people who like final fantasy might tell you.. This is a game like no other. It has been a long time since I played a game through without being able to stop. Also like no other movie, novel, graphic novel or of course game in a long time, I was staring at the end screen for what felt like hours. Of course you need to leave behind, what you learned in the last years about graphics, effects and what not and approach it like a completely new experience. It's hard to call it a game, or a novel either. It shows instead what depth in any media can be like, if you are willing to open your mind.. The actress (Viva Seifert) in the video sequences actually gave a fairly decent performance, but here's the problem : Being ""unconventional"" and ""artsy"" doesn't automatically make engaging gameplay. You basically sit in front of a ""screen"" and enter search terms as vague as ""yes"" and ""us"" to unravel a murder-mystery. A list of up to 5 matching videos is then brought up to watch in out of order sequence. This is interesting and different for the first 50 searches at which point you'll have already figured out the plot long in advance of watching all available videos. Then you have a choice to make : spend the other +400x searches in boredom filling in the gaps awaiting a ""proper end"" that never comes, or ""end"" early and treat it as a 30-45min game-less ""narrative experience"" whose ""effect"" on you is entirely relative... At time of writing, the user score is averaging 5.7, and honestly that's not unreasonable. The acting is well done, and plot fairly interesting so it doesn't deserve a zero, but likewise if you guess the right search terms early and figure out the plot fairly quickly, there really isn't much ""game"" there at any stage regardless of ""narration"".. The issue I have for this game is that it's not really that innovative. I've seen something done before in a game called: In Memoriam (aka Evidence: The last ritual), made in 2006, where clues (and resolving puzzles) from a video would lead users to the next clip. In memoriam is an immersive experience as you're contacted by text and email when you don't play. Her story on the other hand relies on entering a single keyword in a google type search, and it took me about 30 mins to figure out what the premise of the game was about. The problem I have is that it's way too easy to second guess what the interviewee is going to say by typing in expected dialogue keywords. Because of this, the game is a little too easy. For example, search for the word ""police"", or ""arrest"" and you'll get videos. I'll have to admit, I haven't seen ALL the recorded videos, so perhaps I'm jumping the gun if there's a twist at the end. In the meantime I'm a little amazed how this game got some many Video game BAFTA's. Her Story involves you in a deep investigation experience, but it's concept could have been deeper and it's story a lot better. It's a good idea to star reconsidering the genre, but it has a lot of mistakes to correct.. Amazed by it. I totally felt like a detective trying to solve a case. It has been a great experience, it felt almost real. A puzzle that step by step shows the whole picture. You must try it!. I don't get the negative criticism in this game. Is it that people doesn't appreciate innovation? Is it really that I enjoyed it much more than he average? My opinion is that it is because people is too attached to the classical definition of videogame, and things that work out different as expected are labeled as ""not games"". I, personally, enjoyed the game very much, and as a game designer I feel that we need more like this. Good job!. It was an ok game and I don't regret playing it, but my god did Polygon and some others overrate this game. And it didn't even put The Witcher 3 in its top 10. This is barely a game, and I am someone who very much enjoys Life Is Strange Until Dawn, Heavy Rain, and Telltale games. Again, it was ok, especially for the low price, and it won't take more than a few hours of your time.. I had heard so many good things about this game and it had been nominated for so many awards so I thought it must have something going for it. I jumped in, open minded, but in the end the game just bored me to tears. It is an interesting concept, you search through videos and pick up clues within them to find more videos and within them more clues as the story slowly unravels. The problem here is, for me at least, the story in itself was not enough to keep me engaged. There were a few interesting tidbits here and there, but in the end nothing that hasn't been done before and nothing that really ever gets you to sit down properly think and remain engaged. I believe it would have done much better if it incorporated more mechanics within the and investigation. You found these clues? You have an idea of what this woman did or didn't do? Let me use that on something else other than an endless search for more videos. I'm not really one to usually jump on the ""this is not a game"" bandwagon, but Her Story is on thin ice.. A FMV “video game”, ultimately Her Story is really nothing more than a movie with a very strange interface. This pretty much points to the primary flaw in Her Story, as the actual story being told by the videos is best viewed sequentially, but the interface of the game makes it so that viewing the videos sequentially is extremely unlikely. Hannah is the main character of Her Story, and indeed, the only one who shows up in the videos. The central conceit of the game is that Hannah was a murder suspect in 1994, and the protagonist is going through an old police database, wherein the videos are sorted by keywords in their transcripts. This sounds like a clever idea, but in practice, it doesn’t really work very well at all; beyond being very confusing, it suffers from the fact that it is entirely possible to search for the wrong keyword and end up stumbling across the game’s central twist five minutes in. Unsurprisingly, I did exactly this by simply searching for the most innocuous of the names I had come across first (for the record, it was the name of one of Hannah’s childhood friends). This resulted in me happening across a video which spoiled the game’s central plot twist, and consequently I spent the rest of the game trying to piece together everything else in the hopes of finding another twist, and then failing to find one. The net result of the search interface is that you are likely to watch lots of garbage scenes, with odd scenes which are really important thrown in between them. Some of the videos are nothing more than Hannah saying “no”, while others are minute-long monologues explaining crucial plot or character details. Worst of all, if you actually watch the videos in order, they follow the standard variances of a plot; the rise and fall of action as the police officers piece things together before Hannah finally explains exactly what is going on in the final interview. As a movie, it makes sense. But as a video game, it makes no sense at all. It has other flaws as well – as a murder mystery game, one would think that little details would be pretty important, but as it turns out, the people who made the videos didn’t actually pay much attention to time constraints. On many occaisions, something happens – such as a character changing clothing, or taking a ponygraph – which ignores the necessary setup time, with the videos happening too close together in time. At first, I had assumed that these little mistakes was related to the plot twist, but eventually I realized it was simple laziness on the part of the game creators. If the plot was actually viewed in order, it might be passable, though the awkward interface of the game still would make it annoying. And if parts had been locked off until you had figured some stuff out, it might have worked. But as-is, the thing is kind of a mess, and while the central idea wasn’t a bad one, the UI and erratic pacing as a result of it being made into a “game” (which it really isn’t any more than searching for stuff on YouTube is a “game”) makes it hard to really get into it properly. It is possible to spoil the entire plot of the game within five minutes, and a lot of the videos end up feeling a lot like filler, especially when viewed out of context.. Spectacular achievement. With the most absolute bare bones of gameplay, you are given complete free reign to explore an interesting, and unpredictable narrative. Because you are allowed to explore the entire story as you see fit, but are subtly guided toward making certain investigations so as not to spoil the ending, I think this is a real masterpiece of gaming. A way of allowing players to really DISCOVER a story, rather than being told one. Uncovering the story becomes an active achievement on your behalf, not something fed to you.. It's a unique experience with a unique story. I think much of the praise given to this game is due to it being so unique and to a lot of people that breath of fresh air elevates the game to places that it wouldn't normally be at if this was a more established genre.. Is this a game? Dunno. Dont care. I immensely enjoyed exploring her story. It took me less than 2h to decide that I understand it well enough to stop, though some doubts still lingered (I reckon it must be intentional that you can never completely clarify everything). Probably that's why a week after deleting the local content I keep thinking about it. So the game is pretty short, but I see myself re-installing it one day and give it a second run, doing a bit more brainwork, trying to find answers to my questions. Or not. Anyway, sometimes it feels good not to kill another alien/ganxta/orc/etc, but to make your eyes and brain do some work instead. Just because it is unique, does not make it a good game. Actually, it is so horrible, I used the refund for the first time... I recommend Life Is Strange.. This game is horrible, to say the truth, no game this is. It's just an interactive movie with random scenes. Life Is Strange or other games in the same style had gameplay, but this movie is a joke.. The actress makes everything absolutely a chore to go through. AND WHY DOES SHE KEEP PLAYING THE GUITAR IT ****. The narrator is frustrating. the interface is frustrating. This game is frustrating.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Her Story is an interactive movie video game developed and published by Sam Barlow and starring Viva Seifert. The game was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and iOS.. Tier 2 + Offers a very engaging and unique story with some fun twists and turns + Overall carried well by the main actress, who displays a fair amount of nuance ? Pretty weird gameplay that might offer a bit too much freedom in how the player discovers the story - Somewhat tedious at times, and many of the clips offer nothing particularly interesting to fill out the experience. At first, you'll be a bit disappointed with the ""gameplay"" and you'll think a lot of the clips are unnecessary. (Like, 'why is she saying the same thing 3 times!?'). Then, you'll be blown up by an unexpected twist (well, at least I didn't expect it). You'll finish the game ready to put a 6 in your review. But then you stop, and start actually thinking of what just happened. You'll get a lot of questions and no answers. While you're reading discussions online you'll see that not everybody thought the same towards the end of the game, and you'll realize how much exists to interpretation. You'll spend more time thinking about the game afterwards than actually playing it. And I personally love that. The only thing I didn't like was the absence of a closure, more than just a couple of texts. I didn't want all the answers spilled to me in a final video, but I did expect something at least different, because it just finishes by telling you ""you're done"". Even though, that's not enough to not absolutely love this game. Spoiler: I find the twist quite similar to the twist the creator also did in ""Aisle"". But that didn't stop me from being surprised.. This game is memorable and I do recommend it. The game consists of the player learning the story in a fragmented, disjointed, and non-linear way because the story is chopped up into video fragments ranging from a few seconds to up to a minute or two, and you only see fragments of the story that contain the words in your search. The videos themselves are of interviews in a murder investigation. I personally found this a fun way to see the story develop, and the technique lets you feel as if you are picking up a ""cold case"" and looking into inverviews from a long-ago crime to try to find out what happened. I won't go into detail of the story itself, but I'll just say the acting was excellent, and the story was ""rich"". Very well done. In my view, the game leaves room for multiple interpretations - and I don't see that as a negative - although a part of me wishes things were tied up a bit tighter because I still had questions. But the videos are all you have to go on, so it'll keep you thinking until the end. Anyhow, good game. Recommended. I honestly don't understand negative reviews. It was an entertaining 3-4 hours for me. Way better than watching a TV crime show. Just approach it honestly and logically, like you're trying to understand what happened, and I think you'll enjoy how the story is revealed to you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a rather unusual game, where the entire gameplay consists of watching old clips of a woman being investigated by the police, across a period of a few weeks in 1994. The player cannot hear the questions, but can type search keywords, as all videos are full text indexed. The interface is pretty limiting and deliberately made to look like some archive software from that era. Up to 5 results per search terms can be accessed and you can keep bookmarks but can’t delete them. You can also add your own keywords. Watching the clips tells a non-linear story, and the ability to understand it depends directly on the search term the player comes up with. The story gradually becomes clearer the more videos you watch, but even if you manage to watch all of them there’s more than one possible interpretation. If you’re looking for chewed up ending, you’re not going to get it here, but there is closure (or at least that’s how it felt to me). The game is great for “over-the-shoulder co-op”, where two or more people consult about the story, try to think together about new search terms and exchange theories about what happened. Needless to say, only one person needs to actually type the keywords. It’s also advisable to write down findings and revisit the more hard to interpret clips with these additional findings in mind. The game may not sound so interesting and the screenshots sure aren’t appealing, but the interesting story and the great acting by Viva Seifert turn it into something very unique and captivating. Highly recommended.. Oh God, why? This so called *game* isn't worth your attention. It relies purely on a gimmick and a nostalgia trip. People give it a good score just because they never experienced this *genere* before. There are much better alternatives to this.. It's okay, I quickly searched some key words that revealed most of the story to me fairly early on, leaving quite alot of videos and info I didn't really need to follow up on, It'd be better if you were fully investigating her to, checking out stories etc. This is an incredible idea for a game executed... ok. The story is good and you find out the pieces of the puzzle in a kind of random way (if you wish to play that way). If you try to really investigate, you still just try some words and see if anything comes up. Two hours in, you will figure out what's going on, which was quite great when you do, but despite what the dev says, there are indeed 2-3 ""golden"" clips that explain everything. Beyond that, the option to see every clip in order unfortunately is missing, which is quite odd. There is some ending and credits rolling, despite what some people say, so you do get a kind of closure. You can also try to find all of the clips, but that's just tedious. All in all, kudos for the excellent concept, which overall works quite well.. If you love to feel like Sherlock Holmes, you may like this game. Ok, it's maybe not a 'game', more of an interactive story perhaps, but if you want something different then this could be what you're after. I loved it, but it did leave me wanting more content, and some other interaction rather than just 'search for video - watch video - repeat'.. The acting is horrendous. Hard to take the story seriously, unfortunately. I like the approach to the game concept but given that the videos of the girl is the base of the entire story, I can't play it. It feels like I'm back in first-year drama class at high school. Are there any game designers left? Sid Meier, Al Lowe, Will Wright. But who creates the new Assassins Creed? Sam Barlow is still there and Her Story gives me good old Silent Hill feelings. For some bucks you get a really interesting ""game"" worth playing. See also ****. Truly outstanding game. You can metagame a bit (if you haven't played skip this to not be tempted) by looking up in the Database where you are in the videos and focusing on the end (because those parts are the hardest to get = most valuable). But all in all it's an outstanding game, with an captivating story that glued me to the monitor for a few hours. It's probably a game for a ""book person"" and not for the CoD or WoW gamer. I am really thankful that games like this give me hope in the medium and do something truly unique and new!. Interesting, but the game mechanic of having to using 'word find' to view tiny video clips for clues is very artificial, and not in a good way. Also, the 'ending', if you can call it that, leaves a lot to be desired and will satisfy few.. ","short story game, where you search with keywords for videos about a murder case . little by little we unravel this whole murder story and then the game stops . game gave me a lot of inspiration both on storytelling and simulator design ."
925.Punch-Out!!,"Punch Out is the best boxing game I've ever played on all consoles and they are not going to deny it to me, it is CINEMA made by Wii. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the peak of punch out. Its like what DOOM 2016 was. It's the perfect evolution of the NES and SNES games to modern day gameplay. It has great motion control integration (Some of the best on the console) but doesn't force it apon you. My complaint is this. First of all it was the last Punch out game to release so far, The side additions are lost to time like Doc Hudsons punch out, and post game leaves a bit to be desired.. Punching through the title. Although it is extra challenging, it's a great game to play with friends where you try to beat a boss by changing turns and see who gets you through.. This game is the definition of personality. So many fun characters to fight. And I love punching ethnic minoritys!! It uses the wii controller very well and has secret micanics that spice up the gameplay.. This game is perfect in every way the game is fun, the controls are great, and the fights are challenging but fair. The only complaint is that there is only one fighter unique to this game.. It's been 15 years since this game came out, but I'll keep it short and sweet. It's not uncommon for game developers to like making their games, but here, the people at Next Level Games INSISTED that they wanted to make this game. And hey, it shows. Looking back now, it took some guts for them to transfer the arcade-style appeal of the original game into a modern console environment. But the artstyle sells it for me. If Wind Waker was the GameCube's graphical masterpiece, then Punch-Out!! Wii is the Wii's graphical masterpiece. And even though the game is short and simple, I can't help but want to sit down every once in a while on the holidays and play it again. The goal of the original was wanting to pick up the controller again, and even in an era where online and wireless exist, this game manages to hook you and makes you want to come back, even when there's no point to going back. And the presentation is nothing short of electrifying. The fast reflexes are still a must, the humor is intact, and I'm glad to see that in the 21st century, the developers were brave enough to keep the stereotypical satire from the original; it's all in fun. Anyway, go beat that sodomiet Aran Ryan for me.. This is my favourite game ever and if you don't like it, you can chode off.. Love it. My second game ever was the original Mike tison one on the NES. Pick it up and beat the living daylights out of people from all around the world. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game was fun but sometime the wiimote disconnects in the middle of battles and I lose the fight. It is also glitchy because sometimes tall boxer’s shoes clip through the ground.. At their best, the fights in Punch-Out!!! are about finding the perfect counter to every attack and executing them to perfection. But too often the fights are either so easy you beat them on the first try or so hard that you have to memorize the exact sequence of their moves for the entire fight.. Absolutely amazing reaction-puzzle game. I've personally played the game an ungodly amount of times, enough to beat the entire game blindfolded. A game very close to my heart.. This has got to be one of the best wii games!! I really love that feeling that it is a huge boss Rush which gets very hard as you progress. Definitely worth your money and I am sad that punch out is probably not getting a sequel.. remake of one of my favorite video games ever I really want a switch remake **** that little mac is trash in smash ultimate they really don't give this dude love anymore. I would buy a used Wii and new copy of this game just to play it again. I played this game so much when I was 9 back in 2010. Charming, Challenging and with a Cast of Characters more Crude than the last. Seriously, it's a must play.. a reboot done right. it takes the NES game and modernizes it, and the result is amazing. there aren't a lot of games like Punch out wii in this day and age. If you've ever played a Punch-Out game you know what to expect. Definitely the best one in my opinion. It's really cool how everyone speaks their native tongue.. Great game. A masterpiece in strategy puzzle fighting games, a must play if you want to have a great time on the Wii.. This is such a good game, a great retro revival from the NES, the gameplay has the same charm as the Punch-Out on NES, something about the gameplay just makes it so enjoyable and replayable, the cast of characters in this game is also amazing, they're all so hilarious and entertaining. This game is also good for completion, as there are many different challenges you can take on. The only thing I mildly dislike about this game is the fact that theres too many unskippable cutscenes, but thats not absolutely game-ruining, nevertheless, spectacular game.. This might be the perfect game. It looks good and not dated at all, the gameplay is fun, every fighter is unique on its own, the controls are reactive, and every punch feels right. The only bad thing about this game i that you'll never be able to play it for the first time again.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A really fantastic and under-appreciated gem for the Wii. It's an arcade-style boxing game, with gameplay based on memorization and quick reflexes - don't expect a realistic boxing experience here. the graphics are truly amazing - some of the absolute best, not just for the Wii, but the entire 7th generation. The animations are so well done and over the top, and the humor is simply hilarious. If you played the original on the NES, you'll instantly feel familiar with this game. Little Mac is a really great character, very likable. The way this little guy takes on these huge fighters over twice his size without any fear is really cool. And this game is also VERY challenging - I can't stress that enough. You have to have a lot of patience if you want to beat the later figthers, there is a lot of trial and error here to learn their patterns. But it feels so rewarding when you do, and makes you feel really powerful . Like a small freight-train or something, lol. This game is a lot of fun, lots of replay-value, one of the most challenging games I've ever played, and has such amazing visuals. Highly recommended!. Took me long enough to review this game. Even if you don't feel like playing it again, you should be glad that you played this for at least once in your life.. The games characters are very fun to play.Sure some of the opponents are annoying as **** they can still be very fun to play with.Also the edition of tittle defense makes the game length longer meaning more fun.. This game is a good game. I haven't played it in AGES though... Last played: probably 2012. The graphics are awesome. The controls are mediocre but okay... The character designs are well done. This game Punch Out for Wii is a Nintendo Select and is usually $20 USD or less, or probably around $30 Canadian Dollars (Never been there, so don't know. Closest place to Canada I lived in: Box Elder, South Dakota and don't try to hunt me down there because I don't live there anymore.) and if it is cheaper, it is DEFINITELY wourth it. I recommend this game EVEN though I haven't played it in ages. Be aware: Defeated opponents are looking for a rematch, coming back to haunt you.. This is the 2nd best Wii game, no question. Just behind Brawl. Very reminiscent of the NES and SNES titles. There are no issues with this game. Buy it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Punch-Out Wii is a game anyone who has a Wii U or Wii should have, It's lighthearted humor and fast paced action are what makes this game shine, not only that, but Nintendo did a wonderful job integrating the Wii's motion controls into the game. Even though i stick with the classic controls, anyone who loves motion controls will love this game. The only disappointing thing about Punch-Out Wii is its lackluster multiplayer, but other than that, Punch-Out Wii is a must-have game for your Wii collection!. The Game involves a lot of challenges to overcome along with a superb story and an awesome wii controls. This game also causes a lot of Exercise. This is one of my Favourte wii Games Highly Recommended for Wii Owners.. Punch-Out!! for Wii is awesome, plain and simple. Every match is intense, every victory is satisfying, and every defeat acts as a learning experience. Your hands will sweat and your nerves will kick in late into intensely difficult matches as you try to best your opponent. It's a great game. Highly recommended.. The visuals are beautiful, animations are a lot of fun to watch, and the stereotypical voice acting can be hilarious. And on top of all that, the controls are near-perfect, every battle feels significantly different, and the bonus exhibition challenges will give diehards a run for their money. My Nintendo Wii has been collecting dust on my shelf every since I invested in an Xbox 360, but Punch Out was the game that brought me back. Highly recommended.. Punch-Out!! For Wii - One Line Review! Good challenge, not too hard, great retro feel - A lot of fun, the option to play with the nuchuck/balance board is a lot of fun too - the graphics and presentation are awesome! Check it out - ****/. First I should say I never played the original Punch Out games back in the day. I've tried one on the NES since beating the Wii version, and it's a blast. That said, the Wii game is far superior. Its style and animations are amazing and very fun to watch. The characters are also more fleshed out and given personalities, often based on stereotypes from whatever country you opponent hails from. I still love how the weakest opponent was the Frenchman... Of course, the most important element is the gameplay, and that's where this game really shines. Memorizing the pattern of your opponent's attacks and swiftly dodging to fire off a punch of your own is fun and satisfying, and gets pretty challenging later in the game. In fact, this game proved to be one of the most difficult games I've played on this generation, and that's really saying something seeing as how many games I've played. One problem I had with this game was the controls. I chose to use the Wii remote and nunchuk, punching the air to fell my rivals. Though the motion controls were never misread, there seemed to be slight lag between the controller and system. It was fraction-of-a-second lag, but in a game where timing is everything, it could be frustrating. To be fair, it wasn't the Wii's fault; it was just the lag that comes with wireless controllers. You wouldn't notice it in most games, but it can appear to be glaring in Punch Out! This whole issue can be circumvented by using a wired Gamecube remote, however, and therefore isn't all that bad. This game is awesome. Everyone should play it at least once to experience its simple but oh-so-enjoyable gameplay and eccentric characters.. A fantastic remake to one of the greatest video games on the NES and is actually better than the original to me with much more addicting gameplay than the original. Excellent graphics. Fun gameplay. One of the best on Wii!!! Little Mac is back and this time he's fighting some new characters. This is a worthy sequel in the punch out series with many nationalities to fight. German. Italian. Spanish. Glass Joe etc. etc. kind of short game but supports the wii remote rather well.. Although there could be a few things improved about this game, it overall succeeds very much. Punch-Out is less about fighting and more about timing compared to other boxing games. The system works well, and the game is BY FAR the best played with the Wii Remote held on its side. The number of fighters is underwhelming, and there is only one new boss (plus an awesome secret one). The game looks great and is very funny. There is also a stupid multiplayer mode where both players are Little Mac and can turn into Giga Mac! Yeah, not very awesome. Punch-Out is a superb Wii game and a must-have to anyone who has enjoyed Punch-Out games in the past.. The single player experience of Punch-Out is amazing. However, the multiplayer mode lacks in the fun department. Give Punch-Out a shot if you liked any of the previous installments.",punch out is the best boxing game i've ever played on all consoles . it's the perfect evolution of the NES and SNES games to modern day gameplay . it's a great game to play with friends where you try to beat a boss by changing turns .
927.Suikoden III,"So this is considered to be a mixed bag by many. Some claim to love all the different storylines while others were extremely dissatisfied. I’m in the middle here. I think this was just your run of the mill experience. Nothing particularly horrible but nothing special. It’ll get you by if you want a different experience & something to play. But honestly, there’s better options out there & nothing really hits for me. 5/10 it’s just mediocre.. Nothing is really explained as far as character abilities or how to strategize in this game. I wish it were just a little more simple.. + You're in control of the narrative+ Collecting a team for your castle is fun+ All characters have personality+ Less missable character recruitments+ Customizable Character builds~ Regular Ending has no pay off~ No Voice Acting~ War combat can be too luck based.- The more time spent, the more apparent it's all the same- Soundtrack will dip or be nonexistant in certain areas- Not a lot of new locations to visit any given time.- Too many mechanics are introduced at once.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GOOD.. I absolutely adore the Suikoden series. However, I kind of hate this game. I think it is the worst of the entire suikoden franchise. They show 6 people army but its more like a 3 person army since the attacks are combined. The storyline isn't really that strong. And they butchered Yuber in this game. Which is so very disappointing because the first 2 games, all you wanted to do is find out who this Yuber guy was. And in this game, he becomes a goth boy in a fedora. Not the big, scary armor wearing (maybe) demon that he was in the other games. Idk, Its not terrible. Theres nothing that breaks the game like glitches. But I do think its on the weaker side of the franchise. Plus, I wasn't really interested in the true runes in this game. The first game was about an evil, soul stealing rune. Then the second game was about a sword and shield rune that represents the emotions of that game. In this game, its just the earth elements. Which, I understand fire and water can be dangerous. But there wasn't anything actually cool. They just, existed. The last final straw was how the game kept switching up the main characters. I wanted to love this game, I really did. But the way the made this game was more disappointing than any other Suikoden game out there.. Repetitive, that word sums this game up more than any other. The game is played in Chapters and the game only has about 20 locations including towns, dungeons and paths. Then add that you will wander these same locations via several different characters. Its comparable to Saga Frontier for the PS1 in that regard. You will literally traverse a few forests and paths over a hundred times. Fight the same ""treasure bosses"" dozens of times. with diminishing returns. The story is OK, cliché but solid. Graphics for 2002 PS2 are very nice. The camera angle is beyond annoying though as you have to turn and move your character to see in front of his/her face sometimes. The 108 stars are mostly filler few of them stand out and only a couple are really more useful than others in combat. Parts 1 and 2 are nothing like this version outside of the 108 stars/fortress at the center of all 5 titles. It takes a very long time to have access to everyone you recruit and if you pick someone up in certain chapters you will have zero ability to use them for most of the game. Then and this is more a pet peeve, they got unwinnable battles which is fine a lot of RPGs have them BUT this one has battles you actually win and then you end up losing in the storyline more than once. Its like you beat off a mugger and then decide to hand him your wallet anyways, dumb. The combat system is traditional for the series and the army battle system is way better than the rock, paper, scissors system from the previous titles. You actually have combat based on the levels and equipment of the people deployed in your units. If you load a Suikoden 2 save at the beginning the game adds a few perks and things. I got this game back when it was released and played it through way back in 2002 and it sat on a shelf till recently when I broke my ankle and found I had a lot of downtime for a month or so and decided to play all five of these in a row. I really took my time and raised tons of levels and beat it in around 60 hours but a more casual play thru would probably be half that for most. Weakest game of the series but still worth at least a play thru if you love the series.. Nice follow up to the one of my favorite game, Suikoden II. Somewhat lost its charm when it went 3d but the mechanics and the storytelling makes up for it. The bonus chapters of the different POV is also a great addition that I hope some other games catch on. Its a nice way of playing different perspectives.. I picked this game up at a whim in an EB Games years ago, and I loved it! The different character's stories were well written, and extremely fun to play through and experience. This is the highlight of the Suikoden series for me.. Really this game is a 9.5, but I gave Suikoden V a 10 so this gets a 9. The game is fantastic and it definitely has the best plot and fullest character development of any game in the series. I wish the player's hand was not kind of...""forced"" on some important decision making towards end game, but that does little to take away from the overall beauty of the game. This is also the most difficult game in the series, which is a good thing.. My favorite game for the PS2. Granted, I'm a little biased in that I've always had a soft spot for the Suikoden series, but it has the earmarks of things I appreciate in a game. The plot is phenomenal, it has a ton of characters, it has recruitment, the graphics are great, the battle system is innovative. It's the best of the Suikoden family, slightly even surpassing II. It's an overall ambitious title, and a must for any rpg fans. High replay value.. I can only recommend S3 to gamers who like their games story-driven. The writing is really good, but things move forward at a snail's pace. Add to that events (and whole optional chapters) that are superfluous, long battle animations and the need to search towns and castles over and over for NPCs who'll generate the next cutscene and the experience may get to be very exhausting. Visually the game still holds up well, and the battle system is just okay but all the more fun for being a break from the many cutscenes. There are 108 characters to recruit, but they only offer four distinct styles: you have melee units, ranged units, spell casters and support units that can, for instance, speed up spell casting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Oh boy this is a great game with one the earliest yet most lively open worlds in gaming. The combat system is clean and simple to learn. Overall this game has it all for being released in 2002 and it still stands the test of time as I see myself playing it today.. One of best Suikoden games in the series. Not great like II, but best of the Ps2 and handhelds generations. Suikoden V has more overated because of the combat system. Suikoden III brings combat system in 6 party members, but is diferent from previous games, and have a slower flow. But this game really shines on plotline, one of best I ever seen. A must for Suikoden old series fans.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Extremely refreshing game in an era that was saturated with mediocre RPGs. This game stood up heads and shoulders over most of the other games of it's time.",i think this was just your run of the mill experience. nothing particularly horrible but nothing special . nothing is really explained as far as character abilities or how to strategize in this game .
928.Radiant Silvergun,"Very confusing at times but a good topdown Shooter with unique aspects you never heard of. A challenging, deep, and incredible shooter, well worth the required time it will take to become great at it (or even merely proficient). It's clear many people seem intent to punish the game with low review scores because they lack this patience, or don't understand what they're playing. Quite sad.. This is a great shooter, but not for everyone. Extremely steep learning curve and absurdly hardcore difficulty await you here, but there are rewards for the persistent. This is from a different era of games -- a shooter that could take years to master and doesn't hold your hand for a single second. Online co-op is also quite spotty -- very difficult to find a match, and when you do, your game may be filled with lag. If you've got patience, and you're not against the idea of replaying a single stage hundreds of times to master it, then you'll likely love this ultra hardcore gem from the golden era of shooters.","this is a great topdown shooter, but not for everyone .

929.Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown,"Amazing Metroidvania with on point controls and fighting system. The puzzles are smart and uses the abilities you learn. New smart systems for Metroidvania.. A classic but well-structured metroidvania: the world map is vast, coherent, and well-organized, the environments have a successful, fairy-tale-like atmosphere. Excellent platforming; spikes of difficulty in some boss fights.. Excellent game! Level design is incredible. Plataforming and fighting bosses is tough and fun. PoP was a big surprise to me. I've been a fan of the series for a long time, but i never played the 2D games. And I am amazed at how good this game turned out. It is so obvious that this game was made by the same team that made Rayman Legends, the best 2D platformer in recent years, because the gameplay, action and graphics of this game are so perfect and beautiful. It plays so good that you can spent hours and hours doing basically the same thing over and over and never getting bored. The combat system is excellent, the best in any metroidvania that I've played. I had some bugs and technical issues with the game, but i don't know if they are only on the switch version. Still I think that the game was not fully optimized at least on the Switch. I wish we could get a sequel or something similar for the Prince of Persia series which has been pretty much death for some time now, but hearing the news about Ubisoft lately it makes me a little worried about the future. Overpriced, overhyped, overturned, and poorly optimized. Playing on PS5, there is infrequent but consistent frame hitching that can severely impact gameplay. The game requires very precise timing and spacing for both platforming and combat and these things can be adversely affected by an inopportune hitch. Post release of the DLC, the additional content is made available within the core game far too early and can result in the player being waylaid into an area where abilities and upgrades are completely independent from the main game and very little carries over when returning to the campaign. The gameplay content of the DLC area is significantly more difficult than the main game and can lead to undue frustration by funneling players away from the experience they were enjoying only to present them with with lengthy, overly complicated puzzle-platforming challenges for virtually no discernible reward. It’s an absolutely mind boggling decision on the part of the developers to, for all intents and purposes, force relatively new players into this content that was clearly intended for players looking for a more hardcore challenge. This mode does include some additional storytelling but it revolves around a character that, at the point the mode becomes available, has appeared for perhaps a total of two minutes and uttered three sentences. Again, why the developers thought it was wise to position a lengthy, frustrating mode about a character the player knows nothing about and therefore cares little for so early into the game is baffling. I’m continually convinced that the art of game design is concept that is all but lost on today’s developers. Once, game design revolved around finding ingenious ways to create new and exciting experiences within the limitations of the hardware. Now, the only limitation (excluding time and money) is that we still can’t quite achieve truly believable, photo realistic human characters. With so few limitations, most developers don’t have the restraint to achieve what I’d call elegant game design. Because they can do everything, they will. The Lost Crown’s combat noticeably suffers from this failure of conceptualization. The most basic fodder enemies have numerous attacks, counters, and evasive maneuvers. This is true of all enemies in the game, including the very first that you encounter. Basic enemies that have projectile attacks can hurl them in any direction they choose. Tools that make implementing these actions simple means that they’re included with little consideration for why they’re being included. Because they can, they will. Almost all enemies are overtuned in this way, with the even lowliest grunts having nearly as many offensive and defensive options available to them as the player themselves. This means that combat can always be fun and exciting… or frustrating. Running around, exploring and platforming can be brought to a halt in an instant by a single, stubborn enemy grunt. It affects the game’s pacing in a way that, while not ruinous, is not ideal. This unnecessary complexity, incorporated without consideration for how it affects other aspects of gameplay, is mirrored in the DLC’s tediously lengthy and complicated platforming challenges. In the DLC, your playtime will be padded with lengthy treks and numerous difficult jumps and dashes from a faraway checkpoint to the spot where failed by the slightest mistake, only to fail again a few steps past that. These puzzle-platforming challenges are designed in such a way that you can never see what’s ahead so your progress is limited to extremely small gains that you only achieve by doing the preceding segments countless times. I found it maddeningly unfun. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown retails for $39.99. ($49.99 for the Complete Edition) While Metroid Dread might have justified its $60 price tag, I do not feel that PoP:TLC justifies its asking price. The core game is competently made aside from the poor optimization on my platform of choice but it lacks some of the polish and charm of better games in the genre. I believe that it also loses sight of what makes a truly compelling Metroidvania; atmosphere. The map layouts and design are fine but lack the character to be truly memorable or immersive. The backgrounds look decent but they’re just kind of there and don’t really draw you into the fantasy as much as they could and fail to create any real intrigue. I paid $15 for The Lost Crown new on disc and an additional $5 for the DLC at a 50% discount, which was a savings of $30 from the initial asking price and still $5 cheaper than the current sale price of buying both as digital copies. I think this range of $20-$25 if a fair price for anyone interested in playing this title. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND postponing the start of the DLC until some time after it becomes available as attempting it that early greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game and irrevocably damaged my opinion of the game as a whole.. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a bold attempt to revive the beloved franchise, blending fast-paced platforming with modern combat mechanics. The game shines in its movement system, with smooth parkour and challenging platforming sections that capture the essence of the series. The vibrant art style and flashy visuals also add a unique flair to the game. However, the experience is bogged down by a lackluster story and uninspired characters, making it hard to stay invested in the adventure. Combat, while flashy, can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to remain engaging throughout. The game tries to strike a balance between nostalgia and innovation but doesn’t fully deliver on either front. While The Lost Crown has moments of fun and potential, it struggles to leave a lasting impression. It’s an average entry in a franchise with a rich legacy, offering just enough to satisfy fans looking for a light platforming challenge but falling short of greatness. I personally expected something better from Ubisoft. A very good Metroidvania with outstanding combat, level design, lore, progression, and visuals. Quantity and quality. Unfortunately, there's too much talking, a few repetitive and over-long puzzles, a glitchy save system (I lost about an hour), and requires Ubisoft account.. This may be my new favorite Search Action game. (metroidvania) I enjoyed every second of this game on my way to the platnium trophy. What a shape that Ubisoft disbanded this creative team. Shame on your Ubisoft.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game, reminded me a Hollow Knight. Combat system is solid, bosses are amazing, parkour is challanging and great, story is okeyish. I would prefer just a little bit more bosses and a different art style, but overall, great game. Generally fun game, but get repetitive fast. Some parts which needed for 100% are hard and annoying without any reason. Why would anybody create ultra hard jumping section to die 50 times just to pick up unimportant item needed just for platinum trophy?. Typical metroidvania backtracking ****. Most of your play time is spent A) being lost, or B) being forced to go over ground you've already covered again and again and again. Ubisoft is a soulless corporation pumping out personality-free garbage. Every Ubisoft game has one priority -- to waste as much of your time as possible while preventing you from actually having any fun. Hated this game. Hated it.. Great metroidvania for the lovers of the genre. Both gameplay and artistic style are of high quality, but storywise lacks a bit imo.. It's a solid platformer that's only let down by it's story. Controls work well and are responsive, graphics look nice albeit are more basic considering it's a sidescroller. It does get noticeably harder later on in the game, but this isn't really a bad thing. The story is a bit lackluster and the ending may annoy some of the older fans of the franchise.. Long story short... this game isn't fun. It's confusing and buggy. Controls aren't sharp enough for the platforming areas. I made it about 30% through and I'm giving up.. Even with the easy option, this game is very hard ( and confusing ) if you want to platinium the game....Unless you're a maso , I don't recommend this game... This is peak metroidvania. ---- Combat: weapon with an actual moveset, with some dark souls and devil may cry on it. Cool ""super"" attacks. Also can parry anything with the right timing. Couldn't ask for more. ---- Exploration: a lot of variety, always finding some interesting loot to get more powerful, great map, easy markings. ---- Bosses: each one completely different from the other, each one difficult and rewarding, with epic ""super"" attack animations. ---- Platforming: tough and rewarding, optional challenges are high level stuff. ---- Accessibility: difficulty can be customized on everything (combat, platforming), I only changed parry to ""omnidirectional"", but saw a ton of other config options ---- Graphics/sound: I always support indie games, but the AAA levels of polish shows here, it's Ubisoft, and it's great, believe it or not.. First time I experiment a rogue-like and I love it! I went through the whole game with constant excitement!. Very good game with a very goodstory line, juicy arts, interesting puzzles and thrilling fights. A long play time and open world. I really enjoyed prince of persia. I'm a big fan of metroidvania type games and I can confidently say that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is among the best in the genre. I have it up there with the best modern games of the genre like Metroid: Dread, Hollow Knight, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The combat is insanely deep and rewarding when you practice. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through the game and still learning new things about the base attacks! The boss fights are great! The art, music, voice acting, and graphics are beautifully done. This is a must have game!. Great game, really good gameplay and boss **** story is nice. One of the best Metroidvania.. Really good. A couple of tricky areas but nothing overly frustrating. .. As a big fan of Metroidvania, this is easily one of the best i played in the last 10 years. Great Combat, great Platforming and a really good story, hope we got a sequel! We need more games like this.. This game is nothing like Metroid or Castlevania. It has repetitive areas of constant rooms of death spikes in every area of this game. I'm not a 30 something virgin living in his parents basement.I'm an OG, ORIGINAL GAMMER that is disgusted lazy programming. Metroid was ground breaking & every Castlevania was amazing.Ubisoft needs to stick with their amazing open world platform. POP The Lost Crown is NOT worth replaying. I've played every Metroid & Castlevania more time than I Can count. NOT A FAN!!!. Excellent Metroidvanvia title that excels at movement while also delivering interesting boss fights.. Ubisoft's best game in at least a decade, but it's unfortunately ruined because of a critical bug that makes me unable to heal. Pushing the heal button does nothing whatsoever despite the fact that I have potions in stock, and getting through the entire game on a single life bar is just not a realistic scenario. Until this issue is fixed, which it will probably never be considering they've done diddly-squat about it in the half year that has gone by since launch, I won't be able to keep playing this game. If I'd bought it on PC, I'd be requesting a refund right now, but since I got it on PS5 and Sony's refund policy is ridiculously bad, I'm unable to do so and will just have to accept the fact that this was a complete waste of money.. Excellent Metroidvania with a comprehensive options menu to calibrate difficulty. This includes the availability of the world map. Platforming can be very challenging but is not required to play through the story. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Metroid Dread.. Great game and actually has a Persian setting which is new and unique. Good job Ubisoft. Hopefully we get a new mainline 3D Prince of Persia game soon!. Highly mediocre metroidvania. Action is boring and repetitive, navigation is beyond tedious. The bosses and puzzles are not very fun, and some of the ""powers"" are useless and gimmicky. The story and areas are unmemorable.. A very fun Metroidvania that clearly has some money behind it. The presentation for the game is great and the story does very well to keep you interested. The combat also works great, while the platforming stuff can be hit or miss. Also have to mention that this is one of the harder games in the genre I've ever played. The critical path stuff isn't too bad but some of the puzzles for the 100% status are absolutely insane. I very quickly realized I wouldn't be getting to that point. As for the Switch port, it runs very well most of the time. There is some slow down later in the game while docked and I seemed to have alot if I didn't power the game down completely instead of putting the system in sleep like I usually do. Overall this is a wonderful game and I'm surprised at how well optimized the Switch version is here. So much so that I would probably recommend it over the other ports.. End credits are rolling as I write this. After hitting a wall with the difficulty of the combat in the first hour, I eventually got into the flow of this game and it became more and more rewarding the further I progressed. This is one of my favorite genres and Prince of Persia the Lost Crown is among the best Metroidvania games I've played. It is absolutely huge! The map is utterly filled with traps and environmental hazards and call back to the very first Prince of Persia side scrolling game. Every enemy could be a game over situation if you're not careful and these are some of the most spectacular boss fights I've ever encountered. The visuals are gorgeous, from the over-the-top cast of characters to the richly detailed landscape. I can tell so much care and attention went into this game from start to finish.. Great game, one of the best game 2024. Many are not happy that this is not the same Prince of Persia, but they forget that initially the Prince of Persia was exactly like that. I hope there will be a continuation, it will be interesting to know the story further.. What an amazing game! After playing Hollow Knight, I wasn`t sure I would be satisfied playing any other metroidvania out there, but I was wrong. This game reaches the same heights. Amazing platform and level design, deep and varied combat and an interesting story that is easy to follow. Better than Most Blockbusters AAA games out there. Awesome metroidvania with a nice little story and awesome moves. 9/10 without comparing it to the masterpieces of the genre.. I can say this is my favorite metroidvania since Hollow Knight. Great story, responsive controls, good characters. The Switch version didn't let me down. 10 out of 10.. Amazing mix of Metroid Dread, Mario, Rayman and Dark Souls. As strange as it sound the effect is a superb, addicting, responsive and challenging game with amazing mood.. Changing my review to 1 I got bug locked because a door won't open anymore after a crash. The game is rich, diverse, and really innovative on some mechanics. The gameplay is really smooth and nice. I'm not giving 10 because I think it could benefit some QoL improvement like a mini map, in order to navigate without opening the map every 10 secondes to know where I am going. Don't ever hesitate to play it if you have the chance.. This game is really fun, but it's been a long time since I played a game this difficult. The reason I can't give it 10 points is simply because the game is too difficult. I honestly wonder if people will be able to play this game on normal difficulty. I've died countless times and played on easy mode, but it's still difficult. Some puzzles require very difficult manipulations to even reach the location and do not allow for even a single mistake. The map is unimaginably large and fun to explore, and the graphics are excellent. Although it was difficult, I had a lot of fun playing it.. This is my first Prince of Persia game. I never really showed any interest in this series until I decided to check out the demo for this reboot. As a huge metroidvania fan, I knew I had to have it. 20+ hours in, I'm in love. The Lost Crown has to be one of the greatest and most rewarding action platformers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The level design and puzzles are nothing short of brilliant, the controls are incredibly tight and responsive, and innovative time abilities constantly do a good job of changing the dynamic of gameplay. A couple of things could've been better. The story could've been a bit more engaging, and the music is just forgettable. But while quite not enough to redeem Ubisoft's many years of recent screwups, this title is by far one of 2024's best games, and is possibly the best game they've produced in over a decade.. I'm giving this a 6 because it has really good production values and mechanics, but I personally hated it and will never play a game in this genre again, so I can't rate it any higher. The exploration was amazingly tedious and frustrating, and so were the boss fights. Making progress was a chore, the whole game feels like a job, it's very rarely just fun, it's maybe something I would enjoy on my couch on a different platform, but I don't want tedious, annoying gameplay on my handheld.. Overall the game was decent in quality. Throughly enjoyed the story even though it was fairly obvious what would transpire. Solid platformer with fluid combat. Crashed a few times but didn’t run into the bugs reported in earlier patches. Would definitely give it a go if it’s in your potential game list.. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great game. I really enjoyed the Trilogy, which I played on PC and I hoped for a Prince of Persia title for the modern PlayStation consoles. I was sceptical at first, when I found out it was a 2.5D game, but I still decided to buy it. In the end, it was much more fun than I had thought it would be. The combat system is great, even though it is in 2D and there are many hidden areas, which are fun to explore. There are also different areas, which are thematically different and they are all in an open world. The game was quite long (I needed around 50 hours to complete it the first time) and it didn't become boring. I would give it 10 points, but the story wasn't really well made, due to the game being non-linear. Overall, I think it's a great game.. Underrated great fun game.. easy to pick up any time.. no crazy commitment needed. very fun puzzles and challenges to solve.. wish the game would be longer. hope they release a DLC. Simply one of the best metroidvania I ever played. Cool art style, kinda low-res but smooth 60 FPSon PS5. Great combat and platforming for like25 hours to platinum trophy.. Ubi's best work since Rayman Legends from my point of view. An original metroidvania with clever mechanics and even more clever difficulty and exploration settings, allowing every player to experience it at its best. Graphics are sober but neat, framerate is solid. The fights are almost as thrilling as those of Hollow knight, demanding but fair, with an emphasis on the parry. From my point of view again, I recommend to begin in Hero difficulty, and even put it to max difficulty near the end since the accumulation of power ups and the player's assimilation of the skills can make you overpowered. A must play for metroidvania lovers.. Prince of persia is my game of the year. Very fun combat, platforming, and exploration . Combat is satisfying. You always have new stuff going on. Not repetitive. Abilities are amazing and badass. it looks and plays excellent, very smooth in everything. Some parts of platforming is challenging in a good way. Best metroidvania game.. great metroidvania/soulslike, very fun and challenging bossfights, very customizable settings, you can let the game tell you where to go next or explore on your own. if you liked hollow knight, ori or any other beloved metroidvania then you should definitely try this one too. i am hyped for the upcoming updates. A really good Metroidvania title. The gameplay is really engaging and fun. Some elements do feel derivative of other titles. I found the narrative fairly uninteresting. Overall a good time, would recommend.. Great game overall. The story could be perfectible. But, the gameplay itself is just great. I loved my time with it.. This is the best POP I have played since Warrior Within. The gameplay is perfect.. Very fun to play, compelling story, the art style is beautiful. The platforming is challenging and the puzzles was ok, but it's strongest point, in my opinion, is the fighting mechanics. I really enjoyed playing it.. My favorite metroid-vania to date (displacing Metroid: Dread). The melee combat is very well realized and the enemy variety is wide enough to keep it interesting throughout the run time. The platforming is incredibly satisfying and not too difficult. The game feel here is absolutely top notch. The amount of air control, jump height and the way you can (and should) lift enemies and kick their asses in the air all feels amazing. When you complete a longer section of demanding platforming, using multiple powers, it's great. The story is surprisingly good as well! If the story was throw-away, I still would have rated this game highly because it's the least important factor in a game like this, but I'm a **** for time travel and this game handles it well. This game has all three kinds of heat and will surely be a classic in the genre for years to come. I will definitely put this on my replay list for a few years down the road.. Prince of Persia lost crown is a top tier Metroidvania game. The game plays similarly to other Metroidvania games in the fashion of obtaining new abilities to access new areas of the game. There’s lots of collectibles and 9 side quests, so you are always rewarded when exploring. The story is fine, but the gameplay is what makesthis game shine. The combat is real smooth and responsive, there’s lots of different abilities and different items for customization, lots of various enemies and bosses, the platforming is challenging in parts, but also very enjoyable. There are a number different puzzles throughout the game as well that are thought provoking and fun. The only issue I really had was often items I was searching for items and once found, I would be in a corner of the map with no fast travels nearby and I would just kill myself to respawn at last resting place. The game could have benefited from a “teleport to town” item of some sorts in my opinion. Fantastic game overall 9/10.. This is actually the first Metroidvania I can get into! I'd rather have little games like this than those godforsaken remakes. As far as I'm concerned, they can keep the Sands of Time remake and make a sequel to this!. This game really caught me offguard, its an excellent metroidvania with fluid traversal, a huge map full of useful collectibles and challenges, and fun combat. It scales a little strangely: the platforming difficulty spike is huge while combat doesn't really grow from the early game, while the narrative is a bit unfocused and straight up forgets about a character, and bosses are (mostly) forgettable. But for 80% of the game it is addicting and fun. The real star is the platforming and the enormous map, coupled with a ton of great QOL changes.. Wasn’t the game I expected to play compared to other prince of Persia played it for a while.. Excellent game and I do wish they allow these studios to make more games so they can create games with love. The story is catchy, and by the end you’ll be somewhat of an aem Jaír expert on Ancient Persian history and mythology! The puzzles and gameplay are really quite good, if you like other 2d platformers. The accessibility/control customizability is 11/10: anyone can have a good time playing this whether you’re a hardcore vet or it’s your first game ever. Also, Ubisoft did not use this game to showcase how much costly DLC costumes and addons they can offer, which is highly appreciated.. Why are people pretending this game is good lmao. Some of the worst level design, puzzle design, and boss design I've ever seen. Mixed in with clunky unresponsible controls. Even Indivisible is better than this.. If you enjoy Metroid, Hollow Knight type games then this is the game for you. Hell, even some of the puzzles reminded me of Celeste, which is also a game that I adore! Great atmosphere, great gameplay, great music, great voice acting. All in all a great game! Kudos to all involved. near perfection, hard, good story, good biomes, great mechanics. By far the best metroidvania of those 20 last years.. Short reviews from a casual gamer - should you buy? Yes (details below). This is my first dive into the Prince of Persia universe so bear that in mind when you read this small review, as I understand that most of the criticism with this game is the fact it's not your traditional Prince of Persia experience. This game is utterly fantastic, I really admire the art style, almost a comic book feel. The game itself is a mixture of a classic Metroidvania and to a lesser extent, Dark Souls with intense and mostly difficult Boss Battles with move sets you need to learn and punish. The game whilst being at it's core, a Metroidvania, is surprisingly deep with RPG elements such as gear upgrades, new amulets and special moves which ensures the formula does not get stale. Overall, the game drew me in almost immediately and I would strongly recommend you give it a try, providing you are not going into The Lost Crown with the expectation of it being your 'typical' Prince of Persia experience.. I generally do not play platforming games but this one I really enjoyed. Mechanics and gameplay are really smooth, art style is amazing and early difficulty is real.. I didn't like the graphics, but overall mechanics looks ok. Does this game deserve a chance? IDK??. really fun metroidvania .... the platforming requires a lot of attention and can get into a little gray area of challenging and frustrating ... but overall really enjoyed it and finished it in about 30+ hours did all the side quests and found most of the items. Dropped to an 8 instead of 9 because it was a little buggy ... i needed to restart my ps5 a few times through my playthrough to fix reset some issues with powers I would have given a 9 if there was a new game +. If you started gaming as a kid in the 90s this game is exactly what you want. Beautiful art style, challenging and evolving combat, puzzles galore. I actually thought I was past this platform style but Lost Crown brought me right back and got me thinking how much I would love more Metroid, Alien, Robocop, Judge Dredd games. For the price it is a lot of game, never mind the 20 hour length nonsense. It's more like 30 unless you are either a cheat or a genius. Your dexterity better be good is all I will say because there are even times when you are patting yourself on the back for just jumping around.. 1. The overall difficulty is high, requiring a solid grasp of game mechanics even on the lowest setting. 2. High repetition: Every teleportation requires going to the position, leading to significant time wasted on meaningless travelling. 3. The plot is average, with many untold stories and hastily concluded characters, and the campaign is relatively short, taking around 10 hours to complete.. Prince of Persia The Lost Crown is a beautiful game with impressive art and character design. The fluent gameplay and traversal elements all come together during its epic boss fights. Through exploration of its many environments, you will be well rewarded for your efforts upon completion of simple but rather fun puzzles. As you progress you will unlock tons of new abilities that can be used both in combat and parkour. The game's huge enemy variety keeps you on your feet while giving you a challenge. To finish things off the side content was mostly enjoyable and the OST was remarkable. My experience with Prince of Persia was truly special and for my first Metroidvania game, I was blown away! Ubisoft's best game!!. Phoenomenal in every single way. Love it. From the beautiful art style, immensely satisfying combat and great platforming. A must have.. One of the best metroidvania games I've ever played. Never thought an actual good game would come out of Ubisoft. Game is amazing and runs amazing on all platforms, even Switch got 60fps.. One of the better Metroidvania games I've played in a while. And while the story is generally serviceable, it had a moment or two that stood out. Highly recommend it!. Brilliantly made game. Will definitely replay it many times. Some bugs, but nothing that makes or breaks the game. Would highly recommend!. An amazing game to start the new year , everything was perfect for this game, specially the art direction . I have been enjoyed platinum this game. Special thanks to Ubisoft for this masterpiece. I hope this games sells well so we can get more of Prince of persia.. Average most of the time, decent at best, action is boring and repetitive, navigation is tedious, puzzles are not very fun, and the story is a cliche.. The best game I've played in a long time.I really hope there is DLS for this. Game play, graphics, are incredible, it's a big game and took me well over the 20 hours I read it takes.. Easily the best 2d metrovania because the combat is really fun! The platforming is good and the story actually has effort compared to other metrovania. This is the best PoP since its SOT. I really hope one day this combat and PoP platforming can be translated into the 3d space. Very good Metroidvania and inspired by Hollow Knight too. The combat system is deep and versatile, depending of talisman and special moves equipped you can completely change the combat style. The combinations of button is maybe a little confusing at the beginning, but after a few hours of playing you get used to it. This game has also a good story, well written and explained. Wonderful graphic style, even though in some cut scene it could be a little better. Overall there are some minor bugs, which I hope will be fixed with a patch, but it's a very great game, absolutely recommended!. A nice and enjoyable game! The graphics are good and the story is incredible!. The ensuing decade saw the se","the combat system is excellent, the best in any metroidvania that i've played . the game requires very precise timing and spacing for both platforming and combat . the game is overpriced, overhyped, overturned, and poorly optimized ."
93.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX,"This is the greatest edition of pac-man to date. Pac-man perfection has been reached.. One Minute Review: Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ (2013) PAC-MAN DX+ is a maze runner high score chaser, originally released on consoles in 2010, and later on PC and Mobile devices - The DX+ version released in 2013, offering DLC with extra maps and skins,and rendering previous versions of the title obsolete.This game focuses on speed and precision, as you try to rack up points, beat the clock, and munch the most ghosts possible - depending on game mode. The player is given bombs to knock away ghosts and a very generous ""slow down"" system when you're about to be eaten, allowing you to keep the action going. The presentation is great, and there's customization options to keep things **** nitpicks don't invovle the gameplay: the interface is a bit clunky by today's standards, and for a high score chaser, the leaderboards are loaded with fake scores, which is always frustrating. It's a fun arcade game with solid mechanics and plenty of that ""one more run"" addictiveness - serious Pac Fans will love it, casuals may find it a little repetitive after a couple hours - regardless, you'll get your monies worth.. A fine reimagining, but still doesn't do enough to really be a must-play for everyone.. I love this game. It takes Pac-Man, a really good but slightly aged concept, and throws some amazing stuff into it. Dig Dug used to be my favorite high score game, but this definitely beats it out. Everything in this game is just so satisfying. Besides the music. Y'all need better music.. A decent PAC-Man game, but the vivid and vibrant colors don’t compare to the original, not to mention how much easier this version is.. This is one way to revitalize a franchise. A lot of fun in the most simplest of forms.. A lazy, over-glorified expansion pack. Even after all these years, I never understood the hype behind this game compared to the likes of Pac-Mania and Pac-Man Arrangement. It's linear up the ass and forces you down scripted hallways due to how the trains and sleeping ghosts work, and gobbling up trains is only fun for a few minutes before it becomes boring. Honestly, I had more fun playing New Super Mario Bros. 2, Another sequel I deem lazy and uninspired. But at least that game had content, This game is just lacking and is not worth my time. I am astoundingly disappointed.. Remember the old Pac-Man arcade machines back in the 80s? This is it on steroids. I am seriously blown away from how they improved the classic we all know and love. The presentation is amazing. It vastly improves from the original Pac-Man Championship Edition. The graphics are very colorful, and there are many skins you can use to customize your game. The sprites of Pac-Man and the many ghosts in the game are very detailed and resemble their 8-bit counterparts. The soundtrack is phenomenal. Not only do you have the original Pac-Man Championship Edition game, you have several other tracks as well, and they all kick butt. The game allows you to choose from a variety of game modes and mazes. Game modes can vary from getting the most points to eating the most ghosts in a row. You can choose from 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. How fast the game goes, the number of lives, and the number of bombs you get depend on your difficulty level. When you start the game, Pac-Man goes at the speed you set at the beginning, but as you eat more pac-dots and ghosts, the speed gradually increases until Pac-Man achieves speeds that make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous (What has SEGA done to him?). Unlike the original Pac-Man Championship Edition, this game has lots of ghosts scattered around the maze. When you get close to them, they will start following you from behind. Don't turn back whatever you do or else these colorful jerks will kill you. The main source of progression in the game is fruit. As you know, fruit comes in different forms and increase in point value. When you eat them, they will add new pac-dots to the maze, and the maze will change forms. This is a good way of keeping a time limited game going. The power ups are awesome. Once again, the power pellet returns. As you might know, you can use power pellets to turn ghosts dark blue and eat them. It's really satisfying when you get one of these and eat all 30 to 40 ghosts behind you. That's awesome. New to this game are bombs, and let me just say I am glad that bombs are in this game. In a really bad situation—such as getting trapped in a corner by ghosts—the game will go into a slo-mo effect and allow Pac-Man time to react and use a bomb. When you use a bomb, all the ghosts that are chasing you will be blasted back into the ghost box, allowing you time to get out of a tough situation. When the game gets fast, you will need these. Stock up on them and use them wisely. I cannot stress enough how great Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is. It is one of the best games I played on the Xbox 360. The graphics and sountrack are very amazing, and the gameplay is a major improvement from the original arcade game. If you haven't bought this game yet on the Xbox Live Arcade, now's the time since we're about a year away from end of Live support for Xbox 360. I give this game a 10 out of 10. 10/10 (Legendary!) •The Good + Colorful Graphics + Lots of Ghosts + Kick-butt soundtrack + Bombs + Intense Gameplay The Bad - N/A. Updating the classic Pac-Man formula this Championship Addition adds score and time attack modes to make for an addictive Xbox Live title.. Namco have added so much more since the original Championship Edition. It's not strategic in terms of avoiding ghosts any more. The game is a lot easier due to the addition of bombs, dumb ghosts who will just follow you rather than trying to catch you out and the slow-mo when you're about to lose a life. And yet it's way more fun. By not letting players abuse ghost combos without advancing the maze, Namco have made a game that is rewarding and is much more about efficiency in terms of eating the dots as quickly as possible- as well as careful timing for ghost combos. The addition of new mazes, time trial and ghost combo modes give the player lots more choice, and hours of fun.. This game is addictive, it's deep, beautiful visually, and it thrives on design, rather than fluffy bullet point features which is a common selling point of mainstream juggernaut franchises. It's not about checking a sequel out and now you have RACE CAR KILLSTREAK or now you have JETPACKS. It's just something you play, and the gameplay speaks for itself. That is something of real, true high quality, and well-crafted game design.. Yeah I'm an old school gamer. Yeah I love Pac-Man & Mr. Do! But this is more like Pac-Man does Trials HD, it just has that addictive ""one more go"" quality. And it was the first game I went out off my way to 100% complete. Worth the 800 M$ no questions, although if you go back to it after 100% completing is another matter. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is the best downloadable game of the year, as well as the best Pac-Man to date. Pros: 'Addictive' doesn't even do it justice; gorgeous visuals; lots of modes, boards, and more importantly, ghosts. Cons: You'll never be the best.. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Can anyone spell ""addiction""? I know I can! Great retro throwback, and the most addictive game of 2010!!. This game is pretty fun, and the leaderboards are engaging, and it's cheap. The game lets you pick your favorite graphhics styles (classic, modern, or some just a tad weird but in a cool way), sound track, and there's somewhere around 8 maps to play on each with it's own pathing and 15 or so time trials. The formula is still pac-man but has a nice modern feeling with the responsive controls and an awesome slow-mo feature when your near a ghost and a gradually increasing speed, so all that is gold. There's just one major flaw that undermines all the afore-mentioned praise, which is this: it's still pac-man. It's not new, it's not original, it's nothing you haven't seen before, nothing that's gonna keep your interest through all 8 levels because it's just more of the same pac-man with a few added features. Just because the game has modern features doesn't mean it can compete with modern arcade titles; but hey, for the money, it's a pretty good buy if you're looking for a change of pace from the plethora of steroid spraying shooters out there.. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is definitely a fun turn on the traditional Pac-Man games, but I found it to be a bit over-priced. If you are a Pac-Fan, then by all means... download. The graphics are nice, sound and music are more modern (and not annoying), and gameplay blends old and new together quite nicely. And the developers added one feature that will always be a favorite: Matrix-style slow down right before colliding with enemies.. I never believed Pac-Man could be so fun... I often buy Pac-mans in different platforms (especially portable ones) because Pacman is a Must have in any console; since I already had original Pac-Man in my xbox, i thought there was no reason to buy Pacman CE DX; I was wrong. I played the trial and I felt in love with it. It is totally different from original pacman, having the focus on speed, and eating ghosts... It gives you a lot of tools for surviving the ghosts, but it is challenging (a little bit) at the same time. Moreover, it has a lot of puzzles... If you have a chance, buy it... Seriously... (If you have a psp, I think it is available for it, so that is the best choice, if not, go 360). dont see the big deal about this. its pacman for christ sake!! cant believe its also been rated higher than dead space 2, call of duty black ops!!?? good price but not worth the score it got.. Really fun and addicting only thing its missing is co-op or multiplayer it seems interesting... The graphics are great too... Best played when really bored i played this non stop fir like 3 hours straight. Simply outstanding. It's got the old school 80's gaming mechanics, the insane high speed action of current arcade games, and the rainbow euphoria of Peggle all wrapped up into one package. Great for short bursts of gaming or longer periods of trying to get the new high score. It is addicting and just plain FUN.. The best $10 you could ever spend. This game will drain hours and hours of your life if you are not careful! It's simply a must buy for anyone remotely interested in Pac-Man.. Easily the most enjoyable adaptation of Pac-Man I have ever played. It feels great to play and will leave you coming back for better high scores time and time again. A must own game. excelent game, its one of the best pacman i ever played :). I thoroughly enjoyed Champion Edition when it came out and still play it to this day. DX took it to a whole new level for me. The options available for game play make every play through entertaining. A must have for any Pac-man enthusiast.. As one of those that could never get into the original Pac Man (read: **** at), I've never been bitten by the nostalgia bug for this franchise's more recent iterations. It's too difficult for me and my aging reflexes and I'll be the first to admit it. I've never come across an entry in this franchise that I could play for longer then a minute. That is... until DX came along. A brilliant take on the classic formula which breathes new life, accessibility and replayability into this 30 year old gaming icon. Fantastic stuff.. i love this i couldn't play regular cause as the game went on the ghosts got faster, but now with the slow-mo im a pro and i love seeing all the points flash on the screen. i cant find anything wrong with this game.. Unbelievably addicting. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX will have you playing 'till the wee hours of the morning. From the variations of music, colors, characters and mazes to the highly competitive formula, you won't be able to tear yourself away. Pure adrenaline-pumping fun.. This game is proof positive that game developers' time and effort is better spent on exploring new gameplay mechanics than on striving for photorealistic images and Hollywood-style cinematics. The developers at Namco, instead of asking themselves how to make Pac-Man look and sound better, poured their energy into figuring out how to make the game more fun. This isn't just a modernized or tweaked version of the old arcade game - it is a completely new game, created specifically for networked home gaming consoles. It tosses aside the old notion that a game's objective needs to be about survival and focuses entirely on competitive scoring. Reviewers who complained about the near-colision slowdown and bombs must not have really thought it through, because those elements provide a complexity to the playing stretegy that is absolutely essential. Without them, there'd be a 1,000-way tie for best score on all the lederboards. This is a masterpiece of gaming design.. OK so you have Pac-Man. Now you have this Pac-Man. This IS Pac-Man. I am amazed how they could improve the formula. This game is addicting. It's fast paced and there is nothing more satisfying then eating a train of 30 ghosts and wiping out the rest as you keep extending the power pill time. I even enjoy the Matrix time effect whenever you are close to getting nailed by a ghost. I can't think of any negatives.. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX just does what a game should do : it's fun to play and play again, it doesn't break too much away from the mold that made it an instant classic back when it originally released and adds a few variations here and there along with leader boards to give it replayability. Forget spending quarters over and over; for 10$, you'll be able to play this gem **** without fear of running out of change. If you're still skeptical, download the trial and let the game show you what gaming is about : pure, unadulterated fun.. This is one if not the best arcade games on XBLA. its fast, fun,colorful, and the music's great. Once you eat 40 ghosts in a row you will know why your still living.. When Namco released Championship Edition a couple years ago, I was completely blown away. Somehow, they've done it again. They've beefed up the gameplay yet again, this time adding more modes than you should get for $10. This game is awesome. Go get the trial!","PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is a maze runner high score chaser, originally released on consoles in 2010 . the player is given bombs to knock away ghosts, and a generous ""slow down"" system when you're about to be eaten, allowing you to keep the action going . besides the music, y'all need better music ."
930.Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm,"One of the best story telling games, it's like watching a good movie, but better. Recomend for everyone to play.. Good example of good quality game, good campaigne, I am still playing sc2 in 2022 in customs. Pretty good example of the RTS genre. HoTS has a fun collection of units with nifty abilities to control. It has an inventive campaign with light RPG elements built in that allow you to choose abilities for your main hero and units. I was only mildly entertained while playing it however. Maybe the time of the RTS has passed, at least for me. Maybe I'm too old to control 2 armies at the same time while making sure my bases are collecting resources and pumping out units. I find it annoying and stressful in an unfun way, like herding cats. I do like the unit choices that you can make in the game though. If Blizzard had leaned harder on the RPG part of the game I would have liked it better.. In some way it feels like StarCraft and just a little bit... rushed? I feel I just lack of something there.. It's a shame they didn't take the script as seriously as they did the technical part. I played both parts already 10 times. The first part was much more serious and more mature, I would call it category R, ​​and the second part is PG-13. It feels like the story of the first part is not ideal, but it was written by people with a level of knowledge comparable to university students .. It would seem that we have grown, they have too... Many naive works of art from our childhood grew up with us and began to acquire adult materialistic features or even rethought, without ceasing to be themselves, without losing the spirit of the original source. But not StarCraft. He not only remained in the same place, but also took a step back. Feels like the second part was written by schoolchildren. The game itself became brighter, the feeling of stuffiness disappeared, a large amount of children's humor appeared. An evil villain who is evil because he is evil, Prophecies, chosen ones, cosmic magic, abstract gods devouring worlds to which it is difficult to experience any kind of emotion, just as a person is not able to feel the distance in light years (since our biology was formed in conditions where this was not necessary), pink queen of blades, with a healthy complexion, neat eyebrows, hair styling and lip gloss with stilettos from a modeling agency called ""swarm"" ... if stilettos are her evolutionary advantage, then what does the world in which she exist look like? The world of strip clubs? Queen of our ... ""blades"". She is no longer a ruthless sociopath and manipulator, but a campy hysterical model from high society in Zerg. The first part is materialism, realism, and the second part is idealism and romanticism / classicism. The first SC is Terminator 1, 2, Alien 1, 2, Bladerunner and SC2 is Terminator 3, 5. This was the first time the game hurt me, the second time was BL3. In the opening videos Wol, Hots, LotV there is the spirit of the first part of the game, but in the game itself and in the rest of the videos, everything is much and much worse. And it's not the high cost of the videos, watch the SC: BroodWar videos. They are outdated, but they have a sense of danger, war, impending threat. The videos in the second part seem to be made by Hollywood. Secondary techniques, only proven methods. They seemed to come off the assembly line, as a result of the work of a raw neural network, and not of people.. For those of us who still deeply love this specific style of real-time strategy and want more of it, this is a must-have add-on.. if u are a fan of rts games there is nothing better than this so 10 out of 10 SP is just great as well 2nd of trylogy. I loved the original Starcraft and Brood war. And while Starcraft 2 is still good gameplay-wise and character-wise, the story is much worse. It feels like they wanted to get rid of the series. Wrap it all up and be done with it. Pretty stale and straight-forward, uninspired. No more twists, betrayals and interesting political situations, like the original story had. The whole Xel'naga and Duran story-line mystery especially has basically been straight up thrown away. Gameplay: 10 Characters: 8 Story: 3. Like WoL, the single player campaign is has good variety, but the whole ""primal zerg"" thing didn't gel with me. Still a good game in both single and multi player, but easily my least favorite part of the campaign. Honestly, the most memorable part is the intro video.. One of the greatest RTS experience I ever have. The single player campaign is very solid. All missions was very fun and have a replay potential. Story line makes sense and make me want to go through all this. And the final... That was worth it! So sad, that may be last Blizzard' game that have this old good single player mode.. More of the Starcraft 2. Still very good campaing, playing as zerg is fun. I like WoL more but this is still very very good. I'm gonna give it a perfect 10. Loved the Campaign, loved it. The graphics and feel of the game.. Great, great story. The game is addictive, worry about the main characters. Definitely 9 points.. Very short campaign, nice design, great cinematic. Sad to admit it, since I love zerg, but WoL is superior to this one in every possible way.. I don't like Zerg, but this campaign has made me purr with pleasure! The developers are great.. This trilogy have become a very big breath of very fresh air in the strategy genre. I would say that for me it is the best real-time strategy about battles. The continuation of the cult story of the first game, made in a new, very beautiful and stylish graphics. All movements, animations, sounds and music are made at the highest level as Blizzard only can do. The plot and cut-scenes of the game make you constantly watch and delve into, like a some good movie or book. Such a strategy seems to be for the most part in a single structure (battles on a limited area in the form of a map), but many levels in this game are something unique with their own ideas. And the rest, what are just battles with the bases, are still made so, that they are never boring, and you do not think that they are similar. In this game, absolutely everything is perfect... I didn't give Heart of the Swarm rating 10 only because I didn't like to play for bugs... they are not comfortable for me. Not my type, so I felt some difficult feelings during that company.. Tried playing through Heart of the Swarm recently and actually completely forgot I was playing it mid-way through. Didn't come to me until a few weeks later. It's just so incredibly bland and without that flare of earlier Blizzard titles.. Story is cheesy and unlogical compared to the WoL campaign. It is way to short and filled with several no-brain-missions where you simply have to build more units than the opponent and ****ty characters with bull**** dialogues. Gameplay is (as expected) superior to most other competitive rts games. (The few new units didnt change much from my noob pov) as a conclusion id say it is not worth a full priced game. Blizzard has lost a lot of my respect after D3 and this.. The campaign mode was incredibly unexpected, since this expansion felt much like Warcraft 3. For those who did not play Warcraft 3, it is a RTS game only with a hero in the midst of an army who can use multiple spells. They borrowed elements from Diablo and implemented that in this game which make it an interesting game. AND IT HAS BOSS FIGHTS !!! Furthermore the missions are creative, for those who loved WoL and wc3 then you will love this one too. Surprisingly for Blizzard this game has a weak story compared to starcraft and startcraft 2 WoL. Reunite the Swarm, Upgrade Kerrigan and take revenge, that's probably it. But at least the music and the cutscences are always outstanding on the side of blizzard, makes everything more enjoyable.. Second part of the Startcraft 2 story, now the Zerg campaign with Kerrigan as the main protagonist. It's very good for what it is and I liked the story mode, Kerrigan is cool and so are her other Zerg buddies, but I'm giving it a 1 point lower score compared to the first one. It was all a bit too easy, but the main problem for me is simply the fact that while in the 90's Starcraft you had all 3 races and their story campaigns in 1 game, now they basically force you to buy 3 games to complete the full story. 7/10. Good game, but single player is very short. Also, it feels like most of the game is a tutorial, getting a new unit every few levels, or a new mutation to a unit. It took forever to have the hydralisk available. The end credits are looooooooooong.. Although being a fun campaign, i was hoping for a little more within this addon. Competitive gameplay needed balancing in the beginning but is okay by now. Nothing too spectacular in the ""new stuff department"" but still a good choice if you like SC in general.. After an amazing start with Wings of liberty Blizzard did it again, a totaly fresh take on the zerg with a different and an unique interactive campaign, the story isnt anything crazy but as always its more then good enough. It was an amazing ride and i cant wait for the third part. My only negative comment is that i actually felt bad killing protoss on some of the different missions and i hated kerrigan for being so evil hehe, but it sits right with the theme of this expansion, you are the zerg after all hehe.. --Campaign rating only I must say: The story writing is awful. Don't want to spoil anything here, just state that it's really, really awful. And the gameplay isn't much better. The whole game plays like Warcraft 3 with dumbed down tactics. While in Warcraft 3 you actually had to make decisions and also had more options, like a wider variety of upgrades, tactics, importance of terrain, more decisions around your hero etc. you just have a dumbed down husk of that left for Heart of the Swarm. You run around with your group of units, including hero, and kill stuff. That's it. All the time. Everywhere. The mission design is annoying: It's so HEAVILY scripted that everything plays all the same every goddamn time. There's no real AI here. Just to a minor degree. Everything else is just scripted like hell. Even if you're not supposed to destory an enemy base they'll tell you to not do so and after you're done destroying the base you're not allowed to win because *hurr durr* you must still play all remaining events as we intended you to ! Complete all tasks and the game ends the mission for you. You don't get to decide whether you want to continue until all enemies are dead. The game doesn't care what you'd like to do and is fun to you. Ressource management is as catastrophic as ever: Turbo mining with 3 workers per ressource node is still a thing instead of either a wider variety of ressources or a slower, but more enjoyable game, like Starcraft 1 was, with less troop massing and less damage spikes. Base managemant is also quite boring: Protect your base as necessary, else there's no managemant. You construct all tech buildings once for unit access and there's nothing useful you can do with them or any relevance as why you'd want a specific building in a specific spot, unless it's for defense. You can't research anything, except for +damage and +armor in one single building and that's it. Instead you choose some evolution stuff right before the mission starts. This is actually good, but taking away strategy and variety in each and every mission for that is far too annoying and only necessary because everything is scripted like hell - no time for actual gameplay / decisions here ! MUST GO FAST ! FAST IS FUN ! This game is just out of control. Ressource gathering is either low or explodes, no healthy middle area, units are built in masses and also die in masses, thanks to the ressource flow and damage spikes. In the end you get a hero unit that can just blow up a whole base... Just... what were they thinking... Strategy game... ffs. At that point I'm just gonna pirate the last part of the trilogy, assuming that it just continues on it's path downhill from here. If it's any good or even better or like, real good, THEN I'll buy it. If I had anything to say it'd be this: 1) Fire the idiot writing the story. Any school kid of any school at any age can do equal or better. 2) Stop the heavy scripting. It's beyond annoying that the game tell's me how I should play in a strategy game or forces me to play a certain way. You're allowed to do that some time, if it adds to the game, is fun or any other good reason. But not all the time non-stop ! 3) The economy needs a redesign ! Mass harvesting as only tactical dimension for an economy is poor design. Past games already delivered good, fun, engaging ideas. Just because Starcraft 1 didn't have them doesn't mean Starcraft 2 would be less fun with them. Instead try those. C&C had ressource depots, base capture, ressource stealing, intel sabotage, tech stealing, power levels and actual harvesters out in the field. Starcraft 2 is shallow compared to just this one game, even if it's just economical options. And there are other examples. Just pick what works and is fun but stop this mass everything concept because it has no depth ! 4) Give tech structures a purpose besides existing. Because that's all the tech buildings are good for in the campaign. 5) Tell story like you did in Starcraft 1: Let the other characters talk to the player instead of having them act as if the player doesn't exist. That just disconnects. 6) Actually play your game and see if it's fun. And stop ruining it. --Campaign rating only. Campaign: WoL campaign was bad, but I think it was still overall a worth while experience. Hots campaign is awful, its a waste of time if you are older than 12. The dialog is painful and simple. There is no character, emotion, or purpose. Things simply happen and then you have to kill everything. Yay! The missions become very repetitive, especially the evolve missions. I know they are built to be simple but its really boring. Other missions are simple, revolve around one idea and are easily accomplished. There are no twists or turns in a mission that will make you think of any sort of strategy. Blizzard has introduced even more of their **** wow ideals as well. Everything has levels and all sort of **** maybe in an attempt to distract you from the poor quality of everything else. Multiplayer: I played a lot of WOL and really got **** into the scene. I left after I realized that many of the players were smarter than blizzard and were aware that bliz was running a multi million dollar gaming industry into the ground. Simply from a business perspective they failed. 60$ for a game and 40$ for the expansion, is it any wonder why LOL and Dota took off? That compounded by the team nature of the games, even counter strike became successful with a 20$ fee which is really 5$ if you wait for a steam sale. Anyway blizzard really needed to do something amazing here if they wanted to survive, release the game for 20$ total and free multiplayer if you already have WOL. Then they would need to create a game mode that works with 4v4 or more players. Instead of barely putting effort into those maps, team games should have become much more of a focus. NOPE none of that. Lets add a few more units that don't contribute to the game in any meaningful way, then lets charge 40$ for it on top of the 60$ original. GREAT WAY TO EXPAND YOUR PLAYER BASE BLIZZARD!!!. One of the funnest games I have played in years. Blizzard did an excellent job with the story, game play and graphics. The game is just smooth to play.. Great game. Great story with interesting characters, great music like it's predecessors, beautiful cutscenes, great gameplay with nice missions and nice new add-ons.. Button mashing simulator. If you always dreamed of developing carpal tunnel syndrome, this game is for you ! In order to beat your opponent, you must be able to perform more actions per minute than they do. Oh and when you see x unit on the minimap, you have to produce y unit, that counters it. That's all the strategy there is to it. Another solid game by Blizzard.. To quote on of the users: ""I don't like giving out 10's, especially to Blizzard, but this one earned it. I sat here for a good 5 mins trying to think of something I did not like about the game. But honestly, as far as RTS's go this is a great one. "" Can't stop playing this even today. :). this game is trash, as Starcraft 2 has always been, its about who can hit the most keys per minute in a sim city world. it should be a combat game, try making something new that resembles Myth: The Fallen Lords and maybe we buy your garbage.. I waited until recently to pick this expansion pack up for only $20. They wanted $40 for this when it came out and I just laughed, I'm not paying Activision $40 every time they feel like reskinning their multiplayer games. They added a couple new units, completely changed the tech requirements for many units, and I feel like I'm not even playing the same game anymore. It's annoying to me, I spent months learning to play StarCraft II, I get this expansion and now the command centre queues the first SCV for me? Why? This is confusing, I am OCD as Hell and I can't stand when a game developer makes pointless changes like this. Well, I'm going back to Wings of Liberty since this is a dead game.. This game haven´t 4 core support yet, at the same time 4 core cpus are 8 years old. I have Intel i7 3770 and this game use one my core at max. on 45 percent and second max on. 93. I have Geforce 780 and usage is 50 percent at max. Ram i have 1600mhz cl9. And SSD Samsung 840 Evo 256GB. I have 144 hz monitor and every fps, which drops under 144 cause shutters, because tearing is biger and biger lag. In mid game i have barely 100 fps and in late game i don´t have even 60 fps. And nobody have, even Nathanias haven´t 60 fps+ 60 fps is same bad, 120 fps is ok, but 60 is not playable, input lag is so big and tearing is huge. Blizzad customer support affirms, that even 30 fps are playable lol. They should try it yourself. They said it, because they can´t do 4 core support. You can´t play on unstable fps, so you need lock, so if this game haven´t even 60 fps, ok try play on 45, or 50 fps for example, really, or bigg lagg and you gona lose whole army. No way. Totaly unplayable game from medieval age. Even starcraft 1 is more playable lol. That should be great game, but performance ruined all game. Also Protoss is imba and no balance, protoss need nerf and they still nerf terran ??? I don´t understand how somebody can play this **** pro, on this performance. GSYNC, doesn´t work well with this game a lot of issues and Eizo 244 monitors have input lagg 40 ms... I hate this game and there is also no option for disable chat, i don´t want listen kids and cries, so at start every game i need put player to ignore and do this on every round and after clean ignore list because 50 players are maximum.. Great game for sure, but more in terms of gameplay than story. I found the SP campaign to be way too easy but I can only blame myself for playing on Normal instead of Hard... MP is obviously quite competitive, but one may still have fun without being a pro. In any case it offers a lot of different strategies so that each match is really unique, and the balance between the 3 races is really good, in spite of their fundamental differences.. Starcraft went from a somber military-science fiction RTS about cybernetically enhanced exiles struggling for survival in a hostile sector of the universe, to a painfully generic space western with **** dragonflies grabbing a highly advanced two-story tall colossus. Bask in the glory of real time strategy as two testicular masses of comically isometric units duke it out with lighter fluid filled RC cars, decoy **** inflatable eyeballs, and figure skaters with akimbo popsicles to smack you with! By the time Legacy rolls around, RTS will die. Good riddance and RIP in pieces to the RTS genre.. Heart of the Swarm is a decent expansion. More story. New units. 1. Graphics: 7/10 - detailed unit models, good relative to other games on the market 2. Gameplay: 7/10 - great interface and satisfying micro/macro control 3. Multiplayer: 8/10 - competitive and fun 4. Story: 2/10 - more shallow story, not interesting Overall, average expansion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Although challenging, this game proves to be one of the best Real Time Strategy games out in the market. It probably is the best at this moment both in product as well as in its competition.. I just adore this expansion: For Music, for Kerrigan being a badass, for Abatour being... Abatour, for cinematics being amazing, for the thrill of swarming poor enemies with my huge army of zerglings. Last time I had so much fun with a RTS campaign was Warcraft 3 Undead one. SC2 is great on its own, but HotS is just an outstanding gem for me.. This game is beyond words amazing. Campaign is interesting (something you don't often see in modern releases), and I felt invested in playing. When I won a multiplayer game I felt accomplished and up there with professionals, despite being leagues behind. I've invested almost twice as much hours into this game alone compared to any other game I've ever played. There are a few balance issues (2/2 roach/hydra can be really difficult to beat if not dealt with quickly), but luckily it suffers from perfect imbalance, where a certain cheap strategy will eventually be useless due to a large community working together to beat that strategy. The modding community is huge as well. Overall, buy this game if you liked the first one, if you like RTS games, eSports: heck, just buy the game anyway!. ignore all the hate that people are throwing at this game. this is a great game for 20USD. Very polish with good singleplayer and multiplayer aspect. I like how to revamped the missions just to fit the ""zerg"" mutation and parasite abilities. Very clever. highly recommended.. Well first I think this is the best RTS game we have currently however there are some major problems. 1. No Lan (It’s pathetic that hackers have made it available but blizzard has not) 2. Selling each game separately for more $$$ is Bull**** overall I like this game however the story is getting a little out there and not really making alot of sense but again its worth playing if you like Starcraft. This game has gone down a bit in quality since Wings of Liberty. Game mechanics have been tweaked slightly. There isn't much of a story in the cut scenes between missions which is quite disappointing. Previous instalments of Starcraft used to have good stories.. Near perfect balance if not for protoss and the storyline is moving along, though not as fast as most of us would like. There really isnt any better RTS out there.. Cross-Realms introduced Campaign lacking, no where near as good as WOL strong Pro-Scene Added units are interesting and adds depth to game well Decent sound-track additions. It's World of Warcraft but in space! *yawn* is a good summary of how I feel when I play this game Gamplay: Same as Wings of Liberty, nothing notable to point out. Great RTS, it is losing it's shine though, Story: This is where everything sort've downfalls. If you are tired of these ""WoW writers"" then get ready for the same old hubub when it comes to this game. Nothing original, not even close to following it's roots. Lots of retcon, lots of plot holes, lots of cliche dialog and generic actions scenes. After putting the original Star Craft on the back burner for so long, they lost everything that made a game unique. Now it feels like a ""WoW"" set in space of a story line everywhere you turn. Diablo 3 is another good example of this. WoW just bleeds into everything they do now, churning everything into a gray mush of mediocre game play and story. The casual game play is fun, but after 10 hours the game is now up a creek relying on the multiplayer, which has potential, but probably won't be fully engaging till the last expansion comes out. By then, SC2 will be outdated and forgotten because that what happens when you split a game up into 1/3's and make people wait 4 extra years to see the end of a story line.. Like many games, most reviews for this are useless. They either falsely praise the game due to the reviewer being a idiot and/or paid off, or they sweep the game under the rug as if the game is the worst thing ever. The reality is that this is a very fun, but poorly written and mediocre product. Firstly, if you played Wings of Liberty; you pretty much know what you're getting here. I'm going to compare this to Wings of Liberty; because I assume you played the last game or you probably wouldn't be playing this one. The biggest problem with Heart of the Swarm, which was also the biggest problem of Wings of Liberty; is the story. The story in this game is the worst thing you'll ever have seen since... well... Wings of Liberty. It's full of plot holes and meaningless made up crap for the sake of filler missions. I should mention that they ruin Kerrigan's character beyond belief, but is that surprising after they've shamelessly ruined Jim Raynor already? Someone needs to tell these that Jim and Kerrigan never even had a romance in the past. Blizzard pulled that right out of their ass for the sake of these games. They wanted to force in a needless romance with no idea how to even write it, just like Georgia Lucas with Episode 2. It also reminds me of when they revived Illidan for the Burning Crusade just so he could be a raid boss. I hate how Blizzard completely ruins everything previously established in order to just ""do their own thing"" in follow up games. If you were once a fan of their games; things like this are downright insulting. Here, for instance, Kerrigan goes right back to being Zerg, even though she was suppose to be ""cured"" in the last game, something that already made no sense.(Not a spoiler either; look at the box cover and read it) It's very clear they didn't write very far ahead. Also, Jim and Kerrigan's romance is almost as pathetic as Bell and Edward's. But did you really expect much, after playing Wings of Liberty? This was a follow up to that; and seeing as how that game's story was up in every possible way and full of plot holes, why shouldn't this one be too? The cutscenes are numerous and have a nice quality to them... but it's just hard to care when the game doesn't make any damn sense nor has any kind of competent story you're going to be invested in. Like Wings of Liberty; as soon as you finish the game, you'll not care about anything that happened in it. I could go on more about how awful the stories are in these games; but I think you get the point. Putting aside the awful storytelling; you've now got the actual gameplay... which is more or less the same as it was in the last game. The biggest differences are that the game is played 2-3x faster and Kerrigan is a main hero in most missions. Both of these are bad things. The faster pacing saps out most of the fun. By the time you get a hold of what you're doing in a mission; it's over. There's no time to actually enjoy it, think about what you're doing, or fool around. I hate how Starcraft has basically become an action genre. Why does it have to be so fast? Wings of Liberty was fast, but not ""this"" fast, and the originals were snails by comparison. But that's not to say that the game is hard. It's quite easy on the first 2 settings; especially since Kerrigan is a 1 woman army that can pillage and plunder forces with little to no help. That's more fun sapped right out of the game, because an RTS isn't suppose to revolve around 1 walking demi god. Warcraft 3, which I loved, had heroes, but they couldn't solo half an army this effectively. Kerrigan is better than a level 10 hero in Warcraft 3; and much so, even right away. I should add that the game features pointless upgrade choices and filler missions to unlock more. It's very clear that they had almost no content to work with; so they just filled it up with all this This is what happens when you break 1 game into 3 pieces. But while they managed to fill out Wings of Liberty with a nice campaign; the Zerg got the short stick. The campaign feels disappointingly short due to how fast the missions unfortunately are; and everything not in a mission, is just overly obvious padding or window dressing. You've then got the multiplayer... which didn't do much except add a few new units. They want 60$ for this BTW. So you basically paid 120$ just to play SC2 online. Good for you if you did that, but I didn't. In summery it's tough to recommend this. It does have a campaign that can be some fun, but once again is drowned is terrible cutscenes that do nothing but fuel a totally nonsensical story. And since you already got multiplayer with the first game... you're basically paying for that again. I leave this one up for you to decide. -Drain (Steam). Just 10/10. Awesome story, awesome gameplay, awesome multiplayer(if you can overcome ladder anxiety, of course). One of the best strategy game of all times.. Love the campaign and cut scenes, Like the leveling system they added and overall a great expansion for Starcraft II. Looking forward to the next expansion.. This game is pretty great. Relatively well balanced, still a few balance problems. But hey, it took Blizzard about 8-10 years to make Starcraft: Brood War the game that everyone wanted it to be. And it only succeeded because Blizz made the effort. I feel it's the same with this game. I recommend a buy. Campaign wasn't that good, though. But I only play for the 1v1 Multiplayer anyways, so.... Campaign and story was a huge disappointment, WoL was much better not even mentioning BW which are is different league. Other than that it is still good SC, so multiplayer is superior to anything in the market (RTS wise).. As much as I love Starcraft, they've turned it into a super cheese fest where the only viable strategy is to go one unit and go one unit hard. Gone are the days of variety and the epically big battles in place of small, 5 minute smashfests. Their attempt to e-sport Starcraft more than it already was really took the heart out of it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I expected it to be worse than WoL, but not this bad. Characters have this horrible division where you feel like half of them are Zerg(Dehaka, Zurvan, Abathur) and the other half behave like humans in a Zerg disguise(Izsha, Zagara). Izsha is particularly painful to listen to as every single line she has just reeks of a human being and not a Zerg. Put together with Abathur, it's really glaring and kills the atmosphere entirely. Also why doesn't the Leviathan talk?! It's a Zerg creature, thinking and understanding, not a machine! The story is extremely lackluster. If WoL had lots of side missions with their own small reward and one 10-mission main quest(which was ultimately a fetch quest of 6 missions and then just fighting Kerrigan and a few missions devoted to harming Mengsk's reputation), HotS is literally nothing but one main mission: assemble the Horde-I mean the Swarm. It gets very old very fast. Too simple a plot, it's also not really helped by the side missions since very few of them bring any sort of plot advancement. Ultimately, you spend 20 missions assembling the Swarm, then you (spoiler alert, watch out this'll blow your mind you'll never see it coming!) kill Mengsk. Which means that you literally had all this buildup about Hybrids and the world's end in WoL and no follow up at all in HotS where it's just Kerrigan being mad at Mengsk and getting stronger so she can kill him... It's not even lackluster, it's just lame in comparison. Music is still meh. Still can't recall a single tune, apart from WoL's cutscenes. And even those were not that memorable, despite being well-conceived along with th","hots is one of the best story telling games, it's like watching a good movie, but better . the game has a fun collection of units with nifty abilities to control . i found it annoying and stressful in an unfun way, like herding cats ."
931.Pentiment,"Original, Educational, and calming to play. Bringing to life a 1500’s village entrenched in history is a great video game alternative. It brings to light the very real challenge of the times- serving justice when evidence and general education is hard to find. I was thorough as possible in finding the culprit. Apparently, there is no right answer. Although I can appreciate the lesson in its design of the times- that often times people were accused, justice was “served”, and the repercussions are felt long afterwards- I wanted to get it right. Once I realized that wasn’t the point, I was personally less motivated to finish. This is a great alternative game to the AAA’s and I hope these kinds of original ideas in game making continue to be greenlit.. Bold to put out a story game in this day & age of online gaming & a gaming community that has poor attention span & low IQ where as they can't play a game without combat... Playing this game if basically like reading a book, if you don't like reading, you wont like this game, if are an intellect & like to relax by reading, then you will enjoy this game. Story is nothing spectacular but you having the capability of making choices that effect some outcomes make it more interesting, will be a game I will remember for sure, neat experience.. What a special spectacular game. Didn't think I would like it but since it's in game pass i gave it try & fell in love with it. I think everyone should at least give it try & u will most likely be surprised by this little gem. Peters out a bit toward the end, but this is a surprisingly bang-up period piece murder mystery. It's hilarious and very well-written. The investigative aspects of the game are fun with some sobering consequences if poor decisions are made. Gorgeous arty style and thought-provoking examination of how religion and government intersect to impact the lives of common people. This is a must-play.. It’s just so boring. It’s never exciting any second. Sound design is dull, graphics are dull. It feels like an interactive very boring book with lots to read. You never have to be smart. Just click through the dialogs, speak to all persoan mentioned in your diary and the mystery will reveal itself. I stopped playing in the middle of the second act when I realized I would have to spend another 7 hours with this.. A nice ""medieval"" visual novel with an original artistic direction. I'd advise to turn on the ""instant"" option for the dialogs as they are massively present. The story unfolds in an interesting way, the choices for the protagonist background has some impact and the choices in the way you investigate is appreciated. Be aware you have to like the visual novel genre before playing though.. Pentiment is an incredibly immersive story driven rpg. It is set in Germany during the middle ages . Pentiment also has a beautiful art style and music.. A wonderfully immersive experience. Pentiment is the perfect game to sit down and relax while unfolding both a complexe murder story and a incredibly detailed medieval reality.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably my favorite game. Completely unique gaming experience with great dialogue and trippy visuals and an engrossing story. Great adventure, with lots of culture references to a period often ignored or represented in a simplistic way by videogames. I wish there were more games like this one. Thumbs up!. Loved the story, the mystery, the historical accuracy, the art. This game was a pleasant surprise to me. Story centered games like this are a new thing to me and I'm loving them, and Pentiment is partly responsible.. Loved the game. The story and characters are soooo well written. The graphics/design are so unique and great (if you like it). Choices matter a lot. The setting is something not too often used so that was refreshing. Why play Pentiment? It's one of the greatest works of historical fiction I've ever seen in a video game. Make no mistake, it's a text-based adventure with the lightest of RPG elements. That might put you off but believe me here, you can't judge this book by its cover. And it's not just excellent for it's genre, it's excellent. As as longtime history fanatic ploughing through Assassin's Creed games, Age of Empires and Crusader Kings, I've never seen historical fiction shine this well in a game, and I've certainly never seen it so stylishly. Early modern Bavaria isn't just the backdrop for some 21st century-equivalent sitcom. It's the lens through which every character lives and breaths. Getting to know them doesn't just teach you about their personal story, but also about the time period as a whole. And then you get to the artistic style of each scene, bursting with vibrant expression and beautiful detail. The plot is dense, scandalous and philosophical and simply glides across beautiful lines of dialogue that effortlessly draw you in. I've never found it easier to read in a video game because each text bubble is a work of art – in it's written content and visually stylish fonts true to the early-modern period. It's all brilliant, flipping through menus, codexes, maps and stories never felt this good. But again, why play Pentiment? Because it just might teach you something new and allow you to feel things you haven't felt before.. I really liked this game, it is just my kinda game and the art style is just very unique. the story is beatiful something that really stands out of the ordinary...loved it. Beautiful with a poignant story. Chapter 1 and 2 were very good, chapter 3 was boring. Story is well written, development of arc of the main character accompanied by the history of a small town, fascinating. The game is absolutely brilliant. I am very satisfied.. I was on board and enthralled for much of the first two acts, but the third act was a slog of an experience before a really smart ending. I really loved the discovery and mystery, but the repetition of the third act was too much for me to overcome. Would have been better with a much shorter late game and the early acts are great.. For me it was a big surprise. A beautiful role-playing game with a strong ""artistic"" character, where dialogues and choices reign supreme. Very intriguing plot.. The art style is horrible. The sounds are awful, the dialogue even in easy read mode could have picked way better fonts, it is a reading game after all, so make it as readable as possible. This is a review after very little time because it was so irritating I had to turn it off. Just nothing likeable. I'm all up for plod along adventure games but this lost me from the word go. The start **** is very important to make someone excited to play. This made me excited to free up hard drive space.. This game deserves more love. The story is well done and the whole game looks like a painting. I didn’t expect much from this game, but end up liking it very much! The story is brilliant, art is beautiful and replayability factor is there, which is rare for this kind of games.. As an avid gamer and enthusiast of unique gaming experiences, I was utterly blown away by Pentiment. This remarkable game transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming, emerging as a true work of art that captivates both the mind and the heart. From the very moment I delved into the world of Pentiment, I was entranced by its breathtaking visuals and awe-inspiring design. The hand-painted landscapes and meticulously crafted environments not only showcase the developers' exceptional talent but also evoke a profound sense of immersion that few other games can replicate. Each stroke of the virtual brush adds depth and meaning to the narrative, leaving players in a state of pure wonderment. Speaking of the narrative, Pentiment delivers an emotional journey like no other. It skillfully weaves together a compelling story that touches upon profound themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. The characters are beautifully fleshed out, each with their own unique struggles and triumphs. It's a testament to the game's writing that I found myself emotionally invested in their fates, often shedding a tear or two during the game's poignant moments. The gameplay mechanics are perfectly tailored to complement the overall experience. The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, striking an ideal balance between engagement and contemplation. I appreciated how the gameplay seamlessly intertwined with the narrative, reinforcing the themes and evoking a sense of personal growth as I progressed through the game. Pentiment's soundtrack is a masterpiece in its own right. The hauntingly beautiful melodies, perfectly synchronized with the on-screen events, amplified the emotional impact of every scene. It is rare to find a game where the music becomes an inseparable part of the experience, but Pentiment achieves this with grace and finesse. Furthermore, the attention to detail exhibited by the developers is commendable. The game is polished to perfection, free of any major technical hiccups that could disrupt the player's immersion. It's evident that the creators poured their hearts and souls into crafting a flawless gaming experience, and it truly pays off. In conclusion, Pentiment is a game that deserves to be celebrated and cherished as a magnum opus of the gaming industry. Its stunning visuals, captivating narrative, seamless gameplay, and evocative soundtrack make it an unforgettable journey that resonates with players on a profound level. If you're searching for a gaming experience that transcends entertainment and ventures into the realm of art, Pentiment is an absolute must-play. Kudos to the talented team behind this gem - you've created something truly extraordinary!. A narratively-brilliant, excellent, and original medieval adventure game with a unique art style and extremely deep choice and dialog reactivity. There's a good amount of the Persona games here with Pentiment's time management system, where you only have certain amount of time segments in a day, and have to pick and choose what to do with each one. You also build up relationships by talking to people and saying the right things, which ultimately helps you achieve your goals. Pentiment also reminded of Frogwares' Sherlock games because you spend most of your time investigating and following up on clues, usually to solve a murder. The reason I can't rate it higher is that there isn't that much gameplay to speak of. It's almost all clicking on things and choosing dialog options. One of the selling points of the game, the feeling of authenticity, is also a negative, as most NPCs are fairly mundane, and talking to them isn't that interesting. It's a masterfully-crafted adventure game, but I found a lot of it dull, talking to villagers about raising kids or a monk about life in a monastery. I seldom say this, but it could have used some more whackiness and excitement.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Maybe one of the worst independant game I ever played in my life This game is very poor at any stages. Well, and this ""game..."" I think if you look at the red notes you'll see what most really think. A game full of polemics and affronts against the church? Will if I comment something disrespectful I'll be wrong or is it just you who can offend other people's faith and religion? Hard to call this game filmmaker, I've never seen something so silly and boring in my entire life. I really don't understand what Microsoft has been doing all these years, first they deliver Redfall totally broken, full of bugs, full of problems with 30fps, then they invent this totally useless ""game"", and lastly Starfiled which is coming again to 30fps... The biggest company of all can't deliver something the console can support. I'm tired of these bad games. Fresh and brilliant story. Great game for chilling. Not everybody will love that graphic and systems but it’s worth to play for sure :). Boring and nonsensical. It wants to be a Disco Elysium in the Dark Ages but ends up being the worst Professor Layton game you would ever play.. The narrative is really the highlight of this game. It's all about experiencing a well-crafted, thoughtful, and moving slice-of-life tale in a provincial 16th-century town in the Holy Roman Empire. It's kind of a murder mystery but not really. Essentially, it's like a choose-your-own-adventure graphic novel: a ""choices matter""-style game, although the choices presented to you are largely immaterial to the overarching story. And that's fine by me; the story had me gripped for the game's entire runtime -- about 15 hours. During that time, your enjoyment will largely depend on how you jive with said story. For me, interacting with all of the characters, seeing them develop over the course of the story, and learning more about the world proved just as entertaining as the game's central mystery. Obsidian has a knack for writing characters with depth and creating worlds that are rich in detail. Pentiment has a simple but effective presentation. The game sports an era-appropriate art style, and there is a tonne of dialogue and, therefore, a tonne of reading. Gameplay amounts to picking options from branching dialogue trees and the occasional, trivial puzzle -- which serve more as storytelling devices than actual gameplay. All this is accompanied by a simple but effective score. There's a sting that plays whenever you find mysterious notes -- chef's kiss. If all that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then give it a miss. I wouldn't blame you -- for many, it can barely be considered a game. If, however, this has piqued your interest, then it's on Game Pass and costs very little to have a go.. A narrative game with multiple dialogue choices, but there are only one ending and 0 variety in the narration.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a Masterpiece! So glad Game Pass exists! Would have never played this game if it wasn't on Game Pass.. Love a game like this outside of the norm. Don't get why people love to review bomb a game they clearly haven't played. It's pretty pathetic tbh. One of the best games of 2022. I love story focused games though. Between this and As Dusk Falls I feel like Xbox has done a great job with these story games. At first I wasn’t feeling the art style but quickly thought it was pretty beautiful as I progressed. The story and history behind the game were super interesting too. May not be for everyone but I loved it.. Probably not for everyone but I really enjoyed my playthrough. The visuals are outstanding and the dialogues are interesting. The plot is pretty good too.. A piece of art like pretty much everything obsidian creates. Highly recommended.. Game was cool the art was old school but I found the story to be very entertaining.. Masterpiece and Art Ignore PlayStation fan review bombers or those who can’t control expectations based on obsidians past RPGs. A Review **** set in the Protestant reformation from a reformed pastor! I did not know what to expect with this game but it blew me away. First, check out Obsidians YouTube to see how much they put into the set and fonts in the game. They consulted actual historians and other PhDs. The game is art, like actual art! Also this game was the first game I’ve ever played with a bibliography in the credits, amazing. This game is rich in so many ways from the art direction to the history, characters, and story. The plot is thick and very intelligent and it all comes together in a beautiful way. The rpg elements are so fun, especially for a pastor who has had theological education. I knew a lot of the terms and even some of the Greek, Hebrew, and theological words and lingo. But don’t let that keep you from it, it was just an added bonus for me, but you do not have to play in a way that makes you learn that, you can be a hedonist pagan if you want. Here are my positives - Art style and font work. - history - commentary on religion and social classes - amazing story and murder mystery plot. - the two protagonists are goated for me. Such good character work for a non-voice acted game. - the writing - the rpg elements - the process of investigating and accusing people of murder. - this game is a true work of art in every way. You need to give this game a shot especially if you are a game pass subscriber! If you are unsure wait to make a verdict until you begin investigating the first crime, you will get hooked!. Very interesting game. A narrative detective story with gameplay similar to Disco Elysium, albeit with a very different style and setting. The game was obviously a labour of love from Obsidian. Every conversation shows a huge amount of historical research behind it, and a lot of care in development of the characters over multiple time periods. Each character has their own background and narrative style which is demonstrated through the different ""writing"" styles used in conversations. The story is deep, well-written, and novel. And finally special mention for the ASMR experience of quill scratching on parchment whenever you speak to someone! Only one thing I disliked - throughout the game your investigation seems very free-form and open to the player's own thoughts. By the end you'll understand that this was a bit of an illusion. Can't say more here without spoilers. Overall it was a great game.. As a fan of point and click adventure games, this one caught me a little off guard. What I mean is that it didn't have the same sort of puzzle or item discovery structure I have long associated with this type of game. This game, on the other hand, is entirely built around you understanding the stories of the people in the world you are in, their hopes, their motivations, their backgrounds, and how they all intertwine. It starts a little slow as you familiarize yourself with the world, but a mystery starts to unfold. And once it did, the story had its hooks in me. I wanted to interrogate every person, discover every secret, and uncover the truth of the mystery. It had its hooks in me and didn't let go until I finished. It was a fantastic experience.. A masterpiece from start to finish. Not for everybody but I adored it. Great job Obsidian. Great example **** script. I found the game wonderful, but I'm aware that this game is enjoyable only if you're able to take your time and live the experience without rush. This is because Pentiment lives through dialogue and characters. I found the sound amazing, but the soundtrack could have been better in terms of timing: mostly during the 3rd and last act, in tense situations the soundtrack was lacking.. Caught me by surprise. Not a game for everyone but I definitely loved it. I thought it wasn't for me but im glad I gave it a try. I loved it for its uniqueness and mystery. The dullest “video game” experience I’ve ever had. I’ve never been this bored on my Xbox before.. Pentiment is a fantastic mix of immersive story telling in tandem with a world that actively reacts to your decision making. It’s delicately wrapped in an atmosphere passionately dripping in character and historical immersion. If you’re a fan of historical games, or classical role playing, you’ll find great fun with this future cult classic.. Just amazing. Simple as that, the stories lock you in the game, they draw you in, and very charismatic characters. And of course, the design, the art of this game is a masterpiece. This game is a Must Play for everyone.. The negative reviews are an indictment to the intellectual capacity of the „gaming community“. Since the people are giving it a 10 or a 0 I gave it a 10. True punctuation would be a 80/100. I still remember many visual games from the 90s that were better. Warning : if you don’t like to read books and don’t like medieval stories stay A.W.A.Y of this game (or virtual book as many describe it ) I really enjoyed the characters and loved to see them grow up , die , reproduce , etc.. you learn a lot of literature and history background . At the beginning I was kinda angry at the graphics and way your character moves but I ended up loving the design after some minutes in . A refreshment for the genre . Please Microsoft stop producing so many shooters. Josh sawyer does it again!! Glad to see Josh and people at obsidian stepping away from their traditional games and making this pretty fascinating story driven one. The art style is beautiful and unique and really helps set the tone and scene of the Era the game takes place in. Definitely suggest everyone with gamepass subscription try this one out. And support on the greatest game designers out there.. I am still impressed on what Xbox is giving to the community. A random game tha perfectly match with a cellphone game. Disappointing.. I think it's fair to say this isn't going to be for everyone. It's an old-school point and click - no voiceovers, lots of reading and lots of interacting with everything you can see. However, I enjoyed it. It's a thoughtful, slow-paced game with a unique art style and I was left thinking about the plot a good while after finishing it. Absolutely worth a go - especially if you have game pass.. One of the best games in the genre. Disco Elusium meets Medievil (without skeletons).. It was like reading a good book that I just couldn't put down. Slow start but drew me in after the first hour or so. Charming, well thought out graphics, and a history lesson to boot. Not a game for everyone but if you like a good narrative game as if it was a book you'll enjoy Pentiment, a refreshing bug free release like no other.. Rubbish with shert paper cutout graphics is this unity engine because it is well known for using these budget graphics. This is a special game. Rare is it that when the credits roll do tears roll down my cheeks. Such a compelling and adult narrative, dealing with issues which all of us face in our lives. Beyond anything that I could possibly expect this game is my personal number 1 this year.. While not quite a visual novel, and not quite an RPG, Pentiment carves out a nice little niche that shows off the best of both of these genres. With flushed out characters and a well thought out story, Pentiment tells a very unique story that probably wouldn’t have been made without Gamepass. If you’re a fan of shorter, story-based games, do yourself a favor and download Pentiment.. A below 8 review is unfair for this game. Negative reviews mostly come from people who dislike the genre and had other expectations for this game. I'll tell you what this is so you can decide if it's the game for you. Pentiment is a story focused mystery game. And I mean story focused. There is no combat, no platforming, the gameplay is purely conversations where you get to pick what you say, with a little bit of exploration. You find clues, talk to people and take part in the story with your decisions. It's more akin to an old point and click adventure. There's a little bit of role-playing as you choose backgrounds to help you in dialogue choices. It's a game if you like good writing and mystery, and it's a must play for history buffs.. Went into this not knowing a thing, but found the writing pretty banal and the gameplay tedious. Personally didn't like the writing, feels high-handed and pretentious, and the art is overrated. Extraordinary exploration of history, art, faith, and life. Wept, gasped, and had my heart pounding multiple times. Try to roleplay vs. purely puzzlesolve and you will likely have a better time.. Pentiment at its core is a OG Xbox game and a digital book thats boring AF. IMO not worth your time. The story was ok but omg i'd rather just read a book its slow to get going and when it does I was left hating myself for staying with this visual book as long as I did. Full disclosure the art style used for this visual book was not my thing so i cant award review pts for the developers effort. As a rental game on Xbox Game Pass it was a waste of time and im sure there's better ways you can waste yours. My score 1.. If I wanted to read a book- I wouldn't be playing a video game. People actually think this is a GOTY contender? I just don't get it. Opinions will vary but I'm glad I didn't actually have to pay for this game. Thanks Gamepass! Another Gamepass fodder game confirmed.. A beautiful game with a beautiful story. Bravo Obsidian. To those wondering why the user score is so low, this usually happens with games like this. It takes people a little while to wrap their heads around types of games they’re not used to playing. Which is understandable. But do yourself a favor and try this game out. If it’s the type of game for you, you’ll fall in love.. A fun adventure game with an art style that is faithful to the time period with very obvious affection for it from the developers. The dialogue and persuasion system is very well done, with simply picking the “nice guy” option not being the best way to handle every interaction. A great addition to Game Pass and another winner from Obsidian. If you are a fan of adventure games and murder mysteries, definitely give it a look. If you’re a gamer like the user “OnlyOneHere” who reviewed this game after playing it for only 20 minutes and gave it a “0”, calling it a “virtual book” while also expecting action and multiplayer for some reason, it probably won’t be the game for you. In that case, you’d really just be better off keeping your “opinion” to yourself, as you’d be saving yourself the embarrassment that comes from being the “only one here” to be such an absolute moron.. So, I understand that this game is a little niche, from what i can see the developers also knew this. I'll preface this with the understanding that I have been absolutely fascinated with the medieval period in Europe since I was little. You can really see that this was a passion project and they did they're research well. Maybe it's not for everyone, but I've been waiting for this game for months.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It has a great story, great music, great graphics and ambientation. However, the gameplay is NON existent. You basically goes through the dialogs, choose options and thats it. It feels tiresome after some hours.. I hate sony fanboys....................................................................................................................................................................................... Really charming game, especially if you have game pass it's a must play. Big recommendation. This is a visual novel/choose your own adventure type of game. There are some light ""RPG"" elements of picking certain background/skills for your character that can shape the story differently. One interesting thing it does is that, just becauae your background allows a certain action, it does not mean it's the best action. Whereas most RPGs make the unlocked option the best option, think the more recent fallout games. High Science skill in conversation means that option is probably the best, but as mentioned not always the case in Pentiment. You play as an artist who is working in an abby and is later tasked with finding a murderer. To investigate you go around asking questions but there is a bit of a time limit so you WILL NOT be able to do everything on your list. Time will pass when you complete a task and the day does have meal times breaking up the day. At those points you must break bread with others in town, who you choose to share a meal with will provide different information as well as let you learn more about the world and the different types of people living there. Forgot to mention, the game starts in 1518 and if you really like history, this should be interesting. The characters are more like real people, just because someone is a part of the church doesnt necessarily make them inherently good or evil. From a gameplay perspective, there are a few simple puzzles but mostly you will interact with items or people similar to an old point and click adventure. Since you can't do everything in 1 play through, replaying allows you to get info you didn't have before and learn about other characters. I highly recommend.. A masterpiece of the genre. Longer than you'd expect, too. 15-25 hours depending on how you play it and I was pleasantly surprised. A masterclass in world-building, characters, and storytelling imo. I highly recommend it so long as you know what you're getting into.. Great game!! Really interesting. I Like the style and story. I would recommend it to everyone. Don't bother with the negative reviews. They're written by the types of people who, if you asked them to prove they could read, would take a book and hold it upside down while trying to convince you. They're also the type that thinks every RPG should be Skyrim or Elden Ring and have the graphics of Call of Duty. In other words, they live in more of a fantasyland than any RPG setting and they don't like to think too much or too hard. Truthfully, they would be doing us all a favor if they stayed away from games like Pentiment and stuck to Fortnite or whatever it is that keeps their very short attention span engaged. Pentiment is an excellent game for those who love story and character-focused games and don't need things to blow up or attack you every three seconds. If that sounds good to you, then Pentiment is worth your time, especially at its too modest price point. It's the kind of small narrative project long-time Obsidian fans should appreciate, given AAA gaming's limitations.. One of the best games this year. Outstanding visual style, with a great story, dialogue and characters. The sound design is great, but I would've liked some more music in the background. Also some voice acting would've been nice, atleast a few words to help give the players some aid in differantiating the characters. The gameplay is simple, but perfect for this game. Tl;dr: One of the best games this year, lacking music/voice acting.. This is not a game - it's an animated Illuminated manuscript akin to the transition scenes in Monty python and the holy grail.... Annoyed that this game is being review bombed for all of the wrong reasons. Wonderful experience.. The art style is really interesting, and the story is incredibly engaging. Its a different type of game for sure, but a lot of fun nonetheless. In an industry who keeps copying the same thing over and over again, its refreshing to see something diferent.. More indie garbo from XBS. I don't even consider this a video game. A visual book you get to play along in. Pfft. The art drew me in first but I was later surprised by how solid the narration is and was truly engaged. The story is dainty, as is the world-building, no grand narrative, just the vicissitudes of a small town yet reflects faithfully the general trend of medieval history. It's grounding, relatable, while retaining that shred of unreachable nostalgia of the past. My only problem with the mechanics is that there is no save-load, dialogue checks can be done once and once only, and I was often left regretful of my previous dialogue choices. But I think the story would develop in similar directions despite player's choices and unpack satisfyingly at the end all the same. The game is a pleasant surprise at the end of this year and I hope there'd be more games like this that REALLY try to tell a good story.. This game is bad because its boring and had bad graphics and you have to read too much - if I wanna read I get a book.. in a generation with games full of action, linear history, great cutscenes, combos, pressing several buttons, Pentiment has none of that, a slow story at the beginning but already intriguing, historical details of the middle age with an almost perfect background, animations and incredible details, Pentiment is the game that nobody asked for, almost unique. It's painful to see all there ""I deleted the game after 10 minutes"". I'm not giving zeroes to fifa's cuz I'm hate soccer, okay? This game is n","bringing to life a 1500’s village entrenched in history is a great alternative game to the AAA’s . i was thorough as possible in finding the culprit. Apparently, there is no right answer . gorgeous arty style and thought-provoking examination of how religion and government intersect to impact the lives of common people ."
932.Bayonetta 3,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a worthy successor to the franchise, the combats are challenging and frenetic and the soundtrack is spectacular. In my opinion it is the best game in all of Bayonetta.. Broke my heart but I'm a **** for sadness! The combat system was amazing, the variety made it so enjoyable! Not to mention the story and development! I fell in love again with the universe of BAYONETTA, because I was a bit disappointed with Bayo2!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a huge fan of the first game, I had high hopes for this sequel, but it ultimately left me disillusioned and uninterested in continuing with the series. While it does improve on some aspects, the game stumbles in crucial areas that detract from the overall experience. The combat system in Bayonetta 3 shows refinement, offering a more fluid and engaging experience compared to its direct predecessor Bayonetta 2. The responsive controls and expanded move set provide satisfying moments during battles, showcasing the series' trademark over-the-top action. Considering the limitations of the Nintendo Switch hardware, Bayonetta 3 manages to deliver impressive visuals. The game's art direction and graphical fidelity are commendable, pushing the console's capabilities to create a visually striking world. One of the game's major drawbacks is the introduction of Viola, a new playable character. Her presence feels forced and disruptive to the established dynamics of the series. Viola's segments often break the flow of the game and fail to capture the charm that made Bayonetta herself so iconic. The game also includes playable sections featuring Jeanne, Bayonetta's longtime ally. While the idea might seem interesting on paper, these segments feel superfluous and detract from the main storyline, adding little value to the overall experience. Perhaps the most jarring aspect of Bayonetta 3 is its enemy design. The game inexplicably shifts away from the series' established lore of witches, demons, and angels, introducing ""man-made bio-weapons"" as primary antagonists. This departure feels completely out of place and fails to capture the essence of what made the Bayonetta universe so unique and compelling.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Better than the second game but not as good as the first, Bayonetta 3 has interesting ideas that I enjoy for the most part.. Best Bayonetta part so far. Everything except the story and hurtful ending is excellent. Largest in scale PG project with huge moveset, weapons, skills etc. Bayonetta 3 feels so unique after Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta 2. best bayonetta out of the trilogy imho, i have put in more hours in it than the other two, would definitely recommend if you like bayonetta and stylish action games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awesome combat and variety of weapons. Not so good than 1 and 2 but still a must play of the generation. Could be more polish if nintendo had a best hardware to play.. Well straight in. New voice actress. Nothing wrong with her at all. Probably better tbh. I don't know who narrated the intro but that was excellent for VG standards. The game. I still feel the WiiU was better graphically than the Switch. Something with the graphics isn't quite right. I just can't pinpoint it. I thought both Bayonetta and Xenoblade just looked better on WiiU. Camera is pretty bad at times. The screen gets so busy and it can be a bit hard getting a good view of the action. The score is fantastic. Great work in the audio department. Generic, yes a little but very good. I'm not very far in and may change the score but this is an issue I'm having more and more with action games. Stop cutting the damn action. I don't want a huge cut scene every 2 minutes. It's like concerts where the singer does a song then talks **** for 10 minutes before the next one. Just get the hell on with the show. So basically watching a lot of cheesy film scenes with a bit of action between. I want to play a game, not watch an OTT cartoon. Looks wise, still standard Bayonetta. Body to die for with the face of a bulldog chewing a wasp.. great action game with sexy Bayonetta as in other installments of the series. Runs very well. With 10-12 hrs of gameplay.. Visually design is as pleasing as always. Although Switch hardware heavily restricted the probability of visual performance. The camera work in demon summoning is great. Enemy design is repetitive and much worse than the Bayonetta2. The ending is amazing but overall I think Bayonetta 2 is a better ACT game.. The last action super hero, Bayonetta... Game is betten than Bayo 2. First and last third of game are great while middle is low on good locations and story. Combat is BLAST!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Maybe as a sequel of Bayo1 and Bayo2 isn´t good enouch, but it´s a nice experience, the game has technnical issues but runs well normally, if you want to play a new hack´n´slash game, this game it´s for you!. Too bad plot, too bad ship development, one-time game. Large bosses are all in the form of mini-games and lose the original intention of this game. Advantages: enough excellent gameplay. This game is wonderful. I just became a little confused when the third game makes Bayonetta 1 and 2 one of the multiverses. Just wonder how this series will continue on.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is very good and innovative compared to its previous titles, you can spend hours playing and you will not get bored. I must admit that it is a bit annoying when you control the other characters, because the gameplay becomes a bit tedious. But my biggest problem with this title was its graphics. Ok, we all know the Switch isn't the best in this, but man...sometimes the resolution drops so low it looks like a Wii game, we know the Switch can do a lot more than that. In short, it is a good title but I much prefer their previous titles.. Bayonetta 3 Is excellent in so many ways with extremely high Highs and some lower points that comes together for a great experience. The combat in this game is really rewarding with great weapons and demons leading to a ton of player input and crazy battles. They smartly streamlined the weapon gaining process and getting the demon on screen is crazy leading to some insane potential, though it definitely is held back by the switch -mine is on fire. The game has insane bosses and variety in gameplay with over the top sequences, some control well others are eh, though that rhythm game fight is one of the best moments in this series. There is surprisingly great level design- its not just linear hallways it genuinely looks great in worlds and opens up puzzles and exploration in a good way for more. Viola is really fun to play and enjoyable and adds more to the game overall with variety and fun. The story is crazy and ill admit the ending is definitely going to be tough to swallow but it does not detract from the other 90% of the game being amazing. The ost is amazing as well as so much of the presentation having way more budget than previous games clearly just being held back by switch. Really a great time. Its finally here and its right on time.. It's nice to jump and kill every living being, no matter the size. However, that's all. Jump and press two buttons to kill the bad guys. The characters are too cool for me, but I know that's part of the game.. The game is fun but feels more flashy than actually fun. They took away hand and feet weapons and instead made all sets and Viola's combat feels confusing compared to Bayonetta's with the weird button placement differences. Gameplay is often littered with too much minigames that feel boring and sluggish and cutscenes often just show off exciting combat that feels like something that would've been really fun. Resolution often dips to a very noticeable amount and save points are no longer per verse and feel randomly placed around the levels. Some minigames are great, like the Jeanne sections or that singing rhythm game one, but they often feel annoying. The story's twists are either obvious or don't make any sense with the pre-established characters. Pretty good combat but has a story that doesn't feel like they cared enough and feels more like someone's fanfiction. Get it on sale if you're interested, or if you're new just get either 1 or 2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Call Hellena Taylor back immediately, because no good... So sooo sweetie sounding voice, i miss the sarcasm from Hellena's voice, now its some female generic Humanoid, no good, but cool game after all.. If you love this series and the stellar fast paced combat, skip this one and stick with Bayonetta 2. The story is very poorly done, basically the meta verse comes to Bayonetta. The big issue here is the clunky combat thanks to the poorly implemented demon controls. This could have been a fun addition, but instead it’s a slow, clunky, irresponsive mechanic that you wish wasn’t included. Your favorite characters are here, but the story is so bad that they cannot make it shine. Graphically it’s worse than Bayonetta 2. Hopefully, if they make a Bayonetta 4 it will be on next Gen hardware and if we are stick with the demon control portions, they actually make those parts fun. Love my Switch but some titles need more powerful hardware and Bayonetta is suffering here.. It’s as if Platinum Games has stripped everything I loved about this series and only kept the parts I didn’t like. This game feels like an imposter. It feels like this game was made under toxic working conditions and it seeped into the final product. Gone is the perfect camera that shows all the action. Gone is the fantastic art direction and rock solid 60fps frame rate. With few exceptions, gone is the great dialogue and character banter. Viola and Enzo being the only exceptions. Gone is the great combat system that allowed for nearly endless improv. Enemies have next to no hit stun. Hits don’t even feel like they connect. Gone is great enemy design. Gone is a normal mode that isn’t a miserable try-hard ****. Insanely tight timing windows are lame and nothing but padding to a game. Easy mode is an insult and a joke. Platinum Games has made it clear that they only want to cater to the hardcore, so I will no long support their products. I find hardcore gaming neither interesting or enjoyable. Gone is great enemy ai. Miserable campy/passive enemies. I don’t play online games because I hate this behavior. Nothing I consider fun about this enemy ai and same goes for human beings that play this way. They ****. Living or digital. Albeit bonkers, gone is a great story that embraces its time travel paradoxes.. Story 0/10 Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 6/10 Art style 8/10 Puzzles and treasures 5/10 Music 9/10 (I bought bayonetta game to play half the game with none bayonetta character) I like the gameplay of bayonetta and the art, the story is trash and hurts the old fan and force you to play with side character.. I consider bayonetta2 in the top 3 of action games and unfortunately i am disappointed in many aspects of this sequel. Some things work like the summons, when you control the demons directly is a fun new mechanic that transforms many fights into a kaiju battle, the semi-demonic transformation of Bayonetta in various forms adds fun and platforming to the exploration phases and in general the game has a good amount of content... but unfortunately the game has many negative aspects, having removed the possibility of equipping different weapons to the arms and legs has removed a lot of the possibilities in the combos which now result all very identical no matter which weapon you use, viola is a character with a very bad characterization and very ""castrated"" gameplay, in general the story is a real mess the actions of the characters make no sense, the villain has zero context and explanation, the ending very disappointing and worrying for the future of the series pros: +Gameplay remains fun +the climax battles between kaiju +Good amount of content, even in the post game with good extra challenges Con: -Lack of real variety in the combo option -Story is a mess, the characters don't know what they're doing and the villain is without context and motivation. -Viola is terrible Bayonetta 3 is overall a fun action game but far from the quality of the previous entry in the series... a bit dissapoing.. *** EDIT: 20 June 2023 *** Revised score from 10 to 6 now that I finished the game. Having played through the entire game, I find that it's the weakest of the 3 in the Bayonetta series. The Switch control struggles with the large monsters at times, and the exploration gets a bit confusing at times, and overall the game does get tired because it loses the fluidity of ongoing combat from the first 2 games. Overall it's still Bayonetta, but it's no match for #1 and #2, with #2 being my favourite. *** Earlier review below *** It's full-on Bayonetta action, but much BIGGER and BADDER, a masterpiece! Well, it took FOREVER for Nintendo and Platinum to release Bayonetta 3 and I'm only too glad it's finally here. I absolutely love the Bayonetta series so I replayed Bayonetta 1 and 2 back to back in readiness for this. Was Bayonetta 3 worth the wait? You bet! While I'm relatively early in the game, I can assure Bayonetta fans that Bayonetta 3 introduces new mechanics like the monster-controlling Demon Slave move very early on, so there's no time to feel as if this is just a same old Bayonetta game. When I first activated Demon Slave, it brought back the same feeling as when Mario first took over the T-Rex in Super Mario Odyssey. There's a certain ""weight"" to the monsters you control in Demon Slave, and it feels good. Because of the much larger scale of monsters you control, some fights are really between giants - a bit like King Kong vs Godzilla. This makes Bayonetta 3 the most epic in terms of scale of some battles. If you're new to Bayonetta, you're in for a treat. Bayonetta is an action game. An over-the-top action game. The signature of Bayonetta games is the crazy, over the top, non-stop bombastic action sequences and combos you can do. In this 3rd outing all the crazy over the top action moves remain, and certain levels have some exploration to be done, but some other things are different. For example, you upgrade your abilities in a slightly more ""RPG"" way and the enemies seem more agile and fluid than their rather rocky and hard predecessors. In some way, it makes them just slightly more challenging than the early baddies from the early games. But with the ability to change difficulties anytime, you can change it to whatever suits you best. Of course, the original voice of Bayonetta has changed hands from Hellena Taylor to Jennifer Hale. I prefer Hellena's voice due to stronger inflexions but I think I'll get used to Jennifer's eventually. As for the story (no spoilers here), right at the very beginning of the story, I thought, no way they're doing this to Bayonetta but I'll leave you to discover the story! All in all, I can say it's certainly worth the wait for the Umbran Witch's return. Bayonetta is just brilliant as ever. Love it.. Bayo 1 and 2 are fantastic. Bayo 3 Is hideous and does everything worse than before fundamentally and visually. First off the camera is awful, music is the worst I've heard from platinum and the combat feels like it lost all its impact and flair. The story in these games have always been a bit confusing when it comes to ""Bayonetta"" and her origins including the antagonist characters but they leave you with intrigue, you cant wait to see what they do or come up with next. With Bayo 3 on the other hand they really decided to make it as engaging as reading a warranty sticker, the characters are no longer interesting and the new antagonist gives no real sense of threat So the ending was going for cheap shock factor instead of something that builds up a compelling story and conclusion.. Easily the game of the year at me! An absulute mindblowing adrenalirush and a perfect sequel with good fan service and mind blowing combat and music! The story is forgatteble but that'a not the point in here. The combat is just an another level. And Bayonetta is best waifu. its a shame this game is not as loved as the two others. despite it being the most fun! my favourite platinum games game ever! although gloomy and less fan-servicey this game was insanely fun, i still go back to it from time to time to replay the witch trials. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loves me some Bayonetta, but will Platinum keep their strong track record in tack with Bayonetta 3? Is the action good? Is it funny? Will we finally see Ed and Edna IRL? Why is the fandom salty? These questions may or may not be answered in this review. I've finished the game twice now, on standard and on expert mode. And I think there are some legitimate criticisms to be made about the game. But all in all, I think it's a solid romp, and I have many positives things to say about it. The one aspect of B3 that I think really outdoes the previous games is the music. I didn't dislike the previous OSTs, but the music slaps hard this time around. The jazz is pumped up compared to the previous games, and Gh()st is a legit banger. Eff yeah. Action-wise, I like the overall feel of the game. I like the witch time system better than in B2. There, the time available for doing combos was so short, I'd always just mash punch-kick-punch to get the shortest wicked weave, and usually the last hit would happen outside of witch time. Now, on a well-timed dodge, the witch-time is much longer and allows for longer combos. I also liked most of the arcadey bits in the game. I like the rails shooter, I like the Panzer Dragon bit (though the camera could have been better), I liked the opera scene. The ones controlling Gomorrah are a bit meh because he moves so slowly, but on average I think these “mini-games” are fun. The Jeanne levels are a ton of fun on Normal, but kind of a hassle on Expert. On Normal I felt like I was really infiltrating a secret, high security bunker. On Expert, the enemy respawn rate is too high to really move around discreetly and do the fun spy stuff. I'm not excited about trying it on Infinite Climax. The James Bond/Persona 5-style intro is absolute fire, though. I like Viola's gameplay, but it does seem a bit restrictive that she only has access to one weapon and one demon. I get that it makes sense thematically and for the story, but for a gonzo action game it would not have affected my suspension of disbelief if she had more skills to choose from. A lot of people seem to hate Viola, but I don't know why. She's supposed to be an edgy annoying emo teenager, but that’s kind of the point? Kids, they're a mess, you know? I think her lack of self awareness contrasts well with her constant slapstick goof ups. Viola probably owns a Thrasher t-shirt without realizing it's a skateboarding magazine. It's funny, you know, the ignorance, it's funny, just laugh, they're kids, they don't know better, just nod and smile, they'll get there eventually. There are a few things I dislike about the action. First off, the camera can be so far away from the action it's hard to see Bayonetta at all. There are lots of particle and swooshing effects that seriously compromise visibility. The Dark Strider fight was particularly frustrating; the boss is mostly black on a dark purple background, with all those swishy effects on top. Groan. I don't love the Demon Slave mechanic. Being able to control huge demons sounds cool, but they move much slower than Bayonetta, and I don't get to play that fast, twitchy action that I love. Against large enemies, regular attack seem to do so little damage it's almost mandatory to use demon attacks. Most fights involve large areas with at least one large enemy, so the most efficient tactic is to abuse demon attacks. I like the smaller fights with smaller enemies in restrained spaces, but these are a rare. Enemy design is alright, but maybe a bit weaker than previous entries. I didn't mind the story so much, but I did find the big bad's motivations to be kinda vague. I've watched all the cutscenes without skipping at least twice, and I still didn't know what the antagonists motivations are. The fact that a seemingly omniscient, multiverse destroying, infinite monster-producing factory's master plan actively works against itself is pretty dumb. There are also a few scenes that made me go ""no, don't do that, that’s dumb don’t- you did it"". The pacing in the last few chapters feels rushed which isn't too surprising for a Platinum Game (i.e. Vanquish, Astral Chain), but for those other games, I didn't feel quite as invested in the characters as I am with Bayonetta and her buddies, which probably explains the salty fandom. My biggest complaint though might be about Bayonetta herself. She is not nearly sassy enough. I want a Pure Platinum level of sass. Over 9000 sass. Not some mid-tier sober Barney Stinson sass. What I NEED is a RuPaul's Drag Race best cattiest compilation Youtube video from user bestCelebComdeyKlips2004 level of sass. Anything less feels lacking, and Bayonetta just doesn't ham it up enough for me this time around. So, is Bayonetta 3 worth your monies? I'd say, not all of your monies, but some of them for sure. It still has good action, but it’s also still average story-telling. It’s not any better or any worse than the previous entries.. 7.1/10 The first Bayonetta game I didn't immediately start a second play through after finishing it. I actually haven't even bothered to go back and play it again. Pretty much everything here feels like a step backwards from Bayonetta 1 and 2. Gameplay is like two steps sideways and one step backwards. Cut scenes, dialogue and characters are less entertaining. Story is meh. Some parts of the game don't look that great and it doesn't always run smoothly. It's bloated and feels like it drags on way too long. Bayonetta 3 is worth playing through and it's still fun and engaging just nowhere near much as it was in the previous two games. 7.1/10. The ending makes everything feel underwhelming, like it isn't fair how badly the treat all the beloved characters in this game, I dunno what to say it's been months and there's at the end, not many positive things I can say about this adventure, feels like the years of waiting were not really worth it. such an amazing series, with a rich world and characters and everything feels underdeveloped at the end, even crucial details in some playable characters models are missing or straight up bugged. why? environments are empty, details are missing and the boss fights are filled with noise and nasty effects that block your vision and make the experience frustrating and less rewarding, more notable when you play with that dreadful new character viola, she is definetly not made for this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing entry into the Bayonetta series. I love the introduction of using the demons masquerades into combat and exploration. All of the weapons are interesting. In previous Bayonetta games I'd usually find and stick with one weapon, but this time around I enjoy trying them all and often go back and forth between old favorites and weapons recently acquired. While I'm not the biggest fan of multi-verse stories I feel that it was handled well and it's fun. The combat is fun and satisfying, the world exploration is the best it has ever been. There are also plenty of set pieces and mini-games that back up the usual combat so you don't get too fatigued from a long string of battles. Jeanne's side scrolling levels are fun to play. Bayonetta's boss battles are usually divided into normal combat boss battles followed up with mini game boss battles helps to make things varied and interesting. I'm not the biggest fan of Viola or her combat, but she's a fine addition to the cast of characters and her parts tend to be short so levels with her usually start wrapping up when I start to get bored of her. A few minor gripes I miss Bayonetta 2's co-op competitions for halos, I also think the enemies in Bayonetta 3 can sometimes be a bit too easy compared to the Bayonetta/Bayonetta 2 enemies. I wish the weapons felt a bit more unique and varied in their combos and special attacks. I think they did Jeanne dirty with how ugly she looks, and I didn't find many of the costumes that interesting, sticking almost exclusively to the first costume that you unlock in the game. But all in all I enjoyed this entry into Bayonetta and loved every moment of it.. This game really made me a fan of bayonetta. Even though i played B1 and B2 before, this was the game that told me, hey! this is a really good franchise. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the multiple weapons you can use. The music is amazing, really a blast. BUT, this game couldn't been perfect if it wasn't for the amount of gimmicky sections this game has. You can spend 20 of the best gameplay ever and later you have to spend 10 more minutes doing boring things that don't help with the passing of the game. Also, what with that ending OMG! that was horrible, so stupid it doesn't make sense. Anyway, very recommended game but a flawed one almost perfect. I played bayonetta 1 and 2 before starting the game I'm now In the game I have. Not fully played it but still I already love cerezas new design and the game is so funny I love the walk how confident she is and her style is amazing love the game 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's just awefull compared to 1 & 2 it's like the developer forget everything about thier good compared System or just throw it out the Windows and don't let me even Start about Violas gameplay. She feels like she was designe for a different game. Most of her Hits can't even connect because the enemys are often to fast for her.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is totally a 7, no more, no less. has potential but also ruins the series so much that I'm starting to dislike the game more after beating it. Because watching the full-picture made me sad. Btw, also the gameplay itself has it's own flaws Bayonetta 3 is easy but in the meanwhile makes you feel stupid because there are too many combos to remember, get the platinum score is not easy at all, and also because you struggle in other stuff like cathing the Umbra tears, or finding that portal (verse) that you keep missing. I'm a gamer, I always been, I've played so many games, but still, Bayo 3 made me feel lost for the most of the time and in various ways. For example, from the speed of controlling bayonetta suddenly to the extreme sloppiness of a scene when you control a Demon. Or simply with the useless choiche of making Viola time shift with the small button R instead of ZR. I've ejoyed the game but I also have so many complains. Just play it because it deserves to be played, but don't expect ""the final bayonetta experience"" because maybe is the opposite.. Fast pace action game, great soundtrack! Everything in this game is hypnotic, unfortunately the switch hardware is the only limit. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm new to Bayonetta, so this review is from the perspective of a player who has never played Bayonetta before, I have put probably 8-10hrs into the game now though so have a feel of the fundamentals. I'd strongly encourage anyone reading this read it fully because there is more than meets the eye here. Combat Mechanics: 1. Combat is both the worst and best thing about B3, the animations are fluid but execution is about as modern as Tekken 1 on PSX. You have a huge move list for each weapon (too huge, and combined is rather overwhelming) with combos to memorise but there is zero ability to invent your own combos with the provided moves, memorising set-in-stone button combinations in order to pull off something is not fun and feels archaic, Tekken 3 23 years ago broke this mold successfully, yes, it was archaic back then, let alone almost a quarter of a century later. This rigidity will relegate most players to simple punch, kick, or gun moves and your enjoyment will be severely impacted because of it. 2. Dodging in the game is awful, Bayonetta is nowhere near agile enough for the frantic pace of combat. I'm no stranger to games like this being accustomed to other games like DMC and Tekken to be perfectly frank dodging/blocking mechanics feels like a Tekken 1 alpha experiment. 3. Bayo 3 does an extremely poor job of letting you get a feel for the controls the game throws you into several large bombastic battles in a row starting you off at 1000 miles an hour, if you have never played a DMC or Tekken title you're going to have a very rough start. Compounding this hectic, jarring start is the fact that just as you might be getting some basic momentum in battle - in the middle of the fight - the game throws up text boxes completely destroying any rudimentary momentum you might have been getting increasing learning curve difficulty, this happens several times at various points, too. 4. There are a lot of cut scenes during and between combat at the start, during the boss fights, constantly wrestling control away from you in the middle of a fight is DO NOT DO 101 stuff. 5. During loading you can hit a button and practice moves against thin air, this in itself is fine, however during this ""training mode"" is also where probably one of the most irritating things about the game occurs, you have a combo menu that displays all of Bayonetta's moves for the equipped weapon but while you might be trying to learn one particular move the list will automatically scroll to a button combination the game ""thinks"" you are trying to do meaning you're always going to be losing sight of the more complex combinations you are practicing. This is also where you will encounter your first bug in the game, you can't manually scroll the combo list even though you are very clearly meant to be able to. 6. Where the hell is hit stun? Controls: Combat controls are not great, holding the ZL button will allow you to summon the currently equipped demon, that's cool, what's not cool is that you HAVE to keep holding the ZL button down while trying to control your demon, why the hell is the ZL button not a toggle? Worst of all is that there are 4 control layouts but NONE of them are customisable so you can't set your own control scheme. Story: This actually is quite solid from what I've (kindo of) worked out of it so far, what really let's it down though is that while the game offers a recap from Bayo 1 and 2 (I assume for new players) it is essentially LOCKED from new players requiring 1000.. rings?.. to purchase from the ""Gates of Hell"" shop meaning all new players are going to be stumbling around in the dark in terms of story plot, twists, and turns as well. Graphics/Performance: Graphics I don't find anything overly jarring however there is extremely heavy use of dithering which looks horrifically ugly, a lot of textures are also low resolution and muddy. I'm an old fashioned type of gamer and always have prioritised gameplay over graphics but when you have serious gameplay issues AND graphics that aren't all that stellar you've got serious problems. I have no doubt the reason for the heavy use of dithering and low resolution textures in B3 is all in aid of trying to hit 60FPS but the reality is frame rate is a mess in B3, even with Patch 1.2, and the devs absolutely should release another patch locking frame rate to 30FPS and use the performance headroom to improve docked resolution much closer to 1080p rather than what it is, which is 800p or so I'd say. How was it once put by Gavin Archer from Mas","the combat system in Bayonetta 3 shows refinement, offering a more fluid and engaging experience . the game's major drawbacks is the introduction of Viola, a new playable character . the game also includes playable sections featuring Jeanne, Bayonetta's longtime ally ."
933.Riven,"Puzzles: 9 (balanced with observational and logical puzzles. Best I've played yet, but would prefer world building had an even larger role in puzzles) Characters Graphics (VR): 9 (superb graphics for VR) Soundtrack: 8.5 (pretty much spot on to enhance the vibe) Ending: 8.5 (nothing mind blowing, but gets the job done) Ice cream: 8.4/10. A beautiful world in which I got deeply immersed. Most of the puzzles are really well integrated into the world and the story. Difficulty level is sometimes a bit uneven, but it's all about curiosity, attention, and slow savoring - quite the opposite to how games and other kinds of entertainment work nowadays.. I've been playing in VR and it looks and sounds amazing. Very immersive and interesting puzzles. I've had a couple issues with the VR implementation including rhe screen turning black and the game eventually crashes while in the submersible, but I hope that will be fixed soon.. I was obsessed with the Myst series growing up. Myst was the first time I remember sitting down at the computer to play a game (with my parents sitting beside me on fold-up chairs), before that it was gaming consoles and platforming. When Riven came out it was beyond the expectations set by Myst, everything was worn and detailed even from those tiny 608x392 pixel images. 27 years later and this remake comes out and blows away all of my expectations out of the water! Everything is still worn and lovingly crafted and even more detailed at 4K resolution! The one thing I was most surprised by was this wasn’t just a simple remake, many areas and puzzles are shifted or reworked! So it was wonderful to not simply be on autopilot solving puzzles, but like a brand new player I had to work out the solutions all over again! Most are excellent reworkings while keeping the core of the puzzle intact. There’s honestly very little that’s a misstep in this Riven! I would say the biggest flaw in this version is how people are rendered and presented. It makes sense with the move to full 3D and VR that the original FMVs couldn’t be adapter nor reshot for the remake. But I wish that the people weren’t so staunchly placed in the Uncanny Valley! There’s something strange about the rendering/textures and the animations (especially with Ghen’s guard and the finale) seem very disjointed. I only mention it because the world is so realistic and detailed, having the people being so much less so really places a giant spotlight on it. But still, that issue aside, Riven is well worth it for new and old players (old players that keep an open mind)! It’s just such an incredible game that pays loving tribute to the original while also forging its own path!. Atrus' speech at the beginning... why was it changed? The suspense in what he said in the original was lost, given the dialog change. And then we pop into a world that is free roam, surely, but the mystery is gone. The real actors, gone. The puzzles have been changed, several to many of them. This feels like a fan remake, I'm afraid. I think a proper remaster would have been enough.. This is the most cryptic puzzle game I've ever played. Myst is a cakewalk compared to this. I didn't understand half of the story and I completely missed the point of it. The game loves to waste your time - waiting for the all the animations to complete - be it climbing, riding trams, submarines, mining carts, elevators, opening rotating domes - a large percentage of the game is just waiting for the same thing to happen as slow as possible. I'll never play this again.. Imagine you listened to a record as a child (some 27 years ago) and you noticed that it contained the most beautiful and immersive music, inspite of the record having scratches on many parts that hindered fully enjoying the music. But you listened to this record again and again, because you understood that it is enchanting like no other music that has been composed before and ever since afterwards. And now, 27 years after you first listened to the record you can listen to it again. But this time with all the scratches and flaws being removed, revealing now its full beauty. Riven is my old record and I can't stop being captivated in its world which I visited a long time ago. And I want to return to this world time and time again. The remake of Riven proves that computer games are more than just ... games. They form the worlds that we take inspiration from. And which become a part of us ... now and forever.. Still completely illogical and frustrating to play despite no longer needing to swap CDs and being able to take screenshots. It's a visually gorgeous game, but it's a terrible puzzle game. There's way to much guesswork, too much noticing tiny details, and too little logic to solving the puzzles. Don't expect anything remotely similar to modern logical puzzle games like Portal, The Talos Principle, and The Witness.. The terms ""remake"" or ""reimagining"" elicit eye-rolls as, often, they're nothing more than cash grabs banking on a fanbase's nostalgia. They may be prettier, higher resolution, and capable of running on more powerful machines, but they don't normally add anything to the game. When I heard Riven was being remade, I was incredibly hesitant. In 1997, Riven was a masterpiece of environmental storytelling. Its visuals, plot, and puzzles were heralded as pushing the success of Myst forward. But why, after all these years later, did we need to return to the islands of Riven? It turns out that returning to Riven is not just a fantastic way to revisit a game I loved; it's also an altogether new game. The puzzles are redone, the story is expanded, and for a game that had a story tied together with small hints, Riven's remake builds more on those tiny elements of lore and rewards those whose curiosity drives them to piece things together. The visuals are stunning, as usual. That Cyan, a small developer in Spokane, built this world so wonderfully is a testament to the team's passion and skill. This is a game to be pulled into, to experience, to live in. This is a remake, true, but one that was built from scratch and delivers more than its exquisite predecessor.. Beautiful remake of a fantastic classic adventure/puzzle game, expanding on the lore and world of one of the best-realized places in video game history.. My favourite videogame of all time, now with added areas and puzzles which match the high standards of aesthetics and puzzle-design. This is a world you will want to live in. The world-building is some of the absolute greatest in the videogame medium, and is certainly *the* best in the adventure puzzle game genre.. it’s hard to separate my feelings about the original from this review, but I love both. Even more than 20 years later, the world of Riven remains utterly unique: a little steampunk, a little fantasy, a little tropical, and a little Midwest American desert. And the design is still nearly unique, too. The game really only has two massive, map-spanning puzzles—the meat of your time should and will be spent in understanding the world and its factions through masterful environmental storytelling. Understand why the puzzles are in the world, who made them, and who is intended to solve them, and the solutions will slowly fall into place. All of that was true about the original, and all of it remains true in this excellent, thoughtfully updated remake. The world has been substantially expanded in ways that make it more internally consistent (the delineation between public and private spaces, for example, is now almost completely consistent and coherent in a way the original didn’t manage) and both main puzzles have been overhauled for the better. The high quality of the remade portions kept me in the same world, the changes renewed my sense of mystery and excitement to explore, and the additions all felt natural and awe-inspiring to encounter. It wasn’t all great. Even today, real-time 3D graphics can’t quite generate the same feeling of reality as the pre-rendered scenes of the original, and the necessary loss of FMV pulls you out of the world a little as well. Running the new game on an older CPU, I had fairly frequent crashes, but I think that was more the fault of my old rig than the game itself. In all, as a fan of the old game I would call this an incredibly successful release. I hope that a newcomer to the series will give it a chance, too. There’s really nothing like this on the market—give yourself a chance to get lost for a few hours, you won’t regret it.",i was obsessed with the myst series growing up . 27 years later and this remake comes out and blows away all of my expectations out of the water! everything is still worn and lovingly crafted and even more detailed at 4K resolution!
934.Dungeon Siege,"You know when you try to click your fingers, and yet only succeed in doing so 3 times out of 10? Well this is what the gameplay feels like in Dungeon Siege. There are quite a few plus points though, dont get me wrong.... Oh, the lush graphics (not close up by the way)! Oh, the atmospheric music! Oh, the loot and lore! Oh, the character customization (even though you look like a you have a had a rough day farming your crops)! But after savouring all this, when you go to battle your angular enemies (with a plank of wood, not pitch fork...yikes!) in your corn fields and cabbage patches, it feels a bit like whack-a-mole or rock-em, sock-em robots. And what's with those mosquito things that shoot from afar? Not only do you die en route to clobbering them, but when you do get within striking distance, they seem to deftly avoid your 'razor sharp' wooden baton! Anyway...there may be worse to come, which is why I gave up **** didnt bother playing Dungeon Siege 2 (despite the rave reviews, and despite the urge to fall in love with it, regardless of the jolts delivered by the first game). But...hold your (angular) horses...thank God above that Throne of Agony (PSP) and Dungeon Siege 3 came **** THOSE TWO are shining beacons what the 1st (and possibly 2nd) game should have been stepping stones for!. The game does not have a bad atmosphere, interesting role-playing system, but has a rather unfortunate approach to the combat system and low frame rate.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved this game as a kid, but I have to say that I don't think it's aged well. The combat is just so...boring. I like juggling all the characters, but the attacking is just poor and the AI is bad. I tried to get back through it and after like 30 hours, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. At least finding the best items was fun and building your party's abilities was enjoyable. Overall though, it's only okay.. I love this open world/fixed path/one level system. The skill leveling is great. It is not perfect on the party/carrying capacity, but it is a real limitation. Sometimes I had to rework the order of items to make more fit as the auto sort does not move things for a best fit. Otherwise I have no negative points except maybe that it is old and you need to use a patch to make it work well. Now Dungeon Siege III is horrible in comparison except that it is likely to work better on your computer.. Did you know that, if you're astute enough, you can work out what this game is about solely by reading the title? After beating this game, I can only surmise that this game has something to do with conquering underground labyrinths full of monsters. Maybe they should have put something about that in the title. I want to go back to a time when games were still experimental, and genres weren't so strictly defined by what's marketable and proven a hundred times. You want an action RPG where you can control up to 8 characters who mostly automate combat so you can sit back and put the kettle on boil for a cup of tea. F&%k it, have a Dungeon Siege and make an Earl Grey for me. Is Dungeon Siege the greatest action RPG ever made? I don't know; is scat a valuable genre of p$rnography? Probably not, but if you made that claim I wouldn't think you any lesser. I just wouldn't ever hug you, or shake your hand. And finally: Was that line of questioning really necessary? You decide. The issue with a genre-expanding game like this is that fans like its uniqueness and don't want to hear the genuine criticisms the game deserves. It's an experiment, a dream brought to life; not the acting career of Ewan McGregor. On the other hand, people will hate this game more than it deserves out of a misplaced repulsion of games doing their own thing. Dungeon Siege boasts an amazing map to adventure through. There are no loading screens and the journey is vast. I can not understate how good it feels to immersively wander ever onwards, always feeling like there is an infinite, untapped breadth of world before you. I'd sell treadmills with this tagline. ""Get fit, Dungeon Siege style"" And then, of course, in small text: ""Not a euphemism. We mean the treadmill."" And what system could possibly enhance this force of wanderlust; this landscape that never ends? How about simplistic RPG mechanics that truly hit the root of ""your characters get stronger over time so you feel their destructive power grow until every enemy before you has the life expectancy of an abortion."" There isn't much to Dungeon Siege, but it's a satisfying experience because of it. There's no denying there's a repetition and tedium to the core gameplay loop, and that's drawn out over a long 30hr campaign; and that's just the singleplayer campaign. There's a separate multiplayer one I didn't play, plus an expansion. But I had my fun almost the entire way through. And I don't often have fun for more than 5 mins. Oversharing? That's journalism, baby! But now for the flaws. The obvious one is that the tedium, repetitiveness and long playtime won't be fun for all. But what is? Besides Dog's Life for the PS2, of course. However, you may have noticed that I stated that I had fun ALMOST the entire way through. There's a ludicrous difficulty spike when you reach the Goblin Mines dungeon. The game isn't particularly difficult so if you graphed this game's difficulty that Goblin Mine spike could pierce steel plate. This is overly noticeable when the final boss fight is a pushover. It was doable, but it wasn't fun. The issue this really causes is that difficulty spikes give cause to examine the mechanics **** in the closest detail, in order to overcome the hurdle. You generally don't want that. Once you get to the Goblin Mines, suddenly you become overly aware of the game's real flaws. The characters are mostly automated. You can set general movement and engagement tactics, and you can also pause and micro-manage your mad lads. The definition of happiness is legitimately 'the time before you start to learn where the line between automation and management really lies in Dungeon Siege.' Look it up. And if you find something that proves me wrong, just remember to keep it to yourself. The best victories are the ones Qarren doesn't hear about. But when you start seeing all those times that your heroes stand around doing nothing less than a metre away from where their friend is being slaughtered, remember what I told you. Or when you give specific instructions to your heroes and they simply ignore you outright. Or when you have to pause before attacking anything because the boundary between a monster's hitbox and your own character's, or just the ground next to them, causes your battle to turn into something more akin to a flash mob devised by a paraplegic. Until then, even Oxford is simply wrong in their silly book. If there's also something to say about a story here, I don't know what it is. It's a beautifully renditioned world with stories to tell, but as far as a plot is concerned this b%tch is on molly. Dungeon Siege is a cult classic, and rightfully so. I've never joined a cult, but I'd sign away my soul for this one. The pros outweigh the cons. The unique experience is worth the Lovecraftian hell you make a reservation for. If you don't like it, that's fine. But industry lessons should be learned here. And not just to avoid the Goblin Industrial Complex.. An action RPG that was really great at its time, created a successful franchise and had a lot of fans. I too enjoyed it back then but it was not the perfect 10/10 hit for me. While I still find it worthwhile I also don't think it holds not up to more modern games in this genre. However I do not know how thick my nostalgia googles are so take everything with a grain of salt. It has a fantasy medieval setting. The story is set on the continent Aranna in the kingdom Ehb which was created from a trading post after the legendary Empire of Stars collapsed some centuries ago. Your character is a farmer who is drawn into action as the Krug (primitive humanoids and I would say the Orcs of this setting) attack his village. This is however just a small part of a lager thread to the entire kingdom. The story is decent and delivers enough to keep you going. I must point out that many people including me find the conclusion really weak. In general it has its moments but nothing to win best story awards. The gameplay is better. You have no fixed class. Instead you have 3 stats and 4 abilities. The abilities are melee combat, ranged combat, combat magic and nature magic. These level up if you use them in battle (melee attacks for melee, ranged attacks for ranged etc.) and are connected to your stats. The stats are strength, dexterity and intelligence. All stats are leveled up with enough experience points from all abilities no matter which one you favor / use but the most connected ability is increased at a higher amount. For example if you use melee combat your strength will increase really fast but your intelligence only a little bit. So your magic spells will not be a force to be recognized. It is for you to chose what you want. I always picked an archer (dexterity) with magic as backup. Alternatively both magic stats use intelligence so there is an overlap. Also as per RPG standards it takes longer and longer to level up. You don't need to be good in everything as up to 7 characters can join your party which are controlled by AI. You can of cause make some adjustments to the tactics / behavior. The main appeal is of cause the loot. Like Diablo and later Borderlands it is so enjoyable to find better and better equipment like weapons, armors and accessories. This is done quite well. The gaming world is not separated into smaller conected levels but into huge areas for you to explore. I must admit that these are a bit linear but that was not a problem back then (Final Fantasy 13 was the first time this was mentioned as huge problem but that was far later). The gameplay in general was excellent and praised by fans and critics. The graphic and soundtrack rounded this up as it was also a good presentation. I must also mentioned that I did not have any serious bug during my playtrough which is a plus (modern gaming **** in this regard). Overall this was a great game of its era. I think it was a bit to repetitive after a while but still entertaining. Not my favorite RPG but also a good one. May not hold up to modern standards.. This Game is just the meaning of the word Epic. The Journey in this Game is like listening to Dragon Force.. I love the dungeon Siege series, but this has to be the best one from it. To bad we wont get new ones hope can die last i guess. First Hack&Slash type of game I have played in my past. That's why I think is still a very good game, fun to play and can run on toaster this days :). Pretty cool game with a nice gameplay. Great monsters, and many areas to explore. Back then it was really hard and challenging for me.. Well I have been playing this game around 1 week now, started it on a 1st of september 2015. The game looks very good even for an old game, it has nice music too. I think I would have totally loved this game back in 2002 when it was new. I feel it hasn't aged well it feels very slow and not so rewarding at times. I am in chapter 7 out of 9 at the time of this review, so I can say I have played it fairly enough to give a review about it. Well to begin with like I mentioned the graphics are really nice even for an old game, music is a little repetitive but very well done overall. Sound effects are very detailed, I noticed how they would change according to global positioning. The story is very akward, I mean it's about a farmer that gets news about evil rising and suddenly he becomes hercules... I mean wtf? This game feels alot like Diablo 2 most of the time, one thing I really hate about this game is it doesn't have town portal or I haven't seen it yet but at this height of the game that I am currently at (chapter 7/9)it would be pointless to add town portal. So just to wrap things up, -graphics 7.5/10 -music 8/10 -sound effects 8.5/10 -story 5/10 -gameplay 6/10 Last appeal I rate this game a 7, I feel it was a great game back in the day but it didn't age well and playing it feels a bit pointless at times, too much grinding and little story or purpose doesn't help at all. it is a better game than diablo 1 or 2 but it is not better than other titles from its era like Darkstone, Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. This game had lots of potential and must have been great in it's era but sadly it didn't survive the test of time, I recommend it but only if you love hack and slash games and cant get enough of it, otherwise do not get this game.. I so give Dungeon Siege a 10! I played this game for hours and hours. My husband would have to come collect me to head to bed. Played it more then Diablo even though I loved that one too. I have been looking for years to get a copy and finally found one. I loved them all.. In fact, this game is brilliant in its simplicity. It's just easy, beautiful and dynamic journey through the fantasy world, not burdened by the hardcore role-playing system and mega epic story. You would not believe I was going through this game twenty times.. This game is fantastic and everyone should give it a try. All you need to know is that you can buy pack mules! Why a mule? Why not? Since all RPG players create ""mule"" characters, characters used to store rare/unique items but hardly ever used for game play, hence the pack mule. Pack mules enable players to carry as much as three times of what a game character would be able to carry. Mules can be hired at certain points within in the game; once they are hired they become part of your party of eight characters Still not enough storage space? Hire another, another and another. Players can hire up to 7 pack mules in Dungeon Siege. Here's what the official site had to say about pack mules. From **** : ""Bringing one or more Packmules into your party allows your group of adventurers to be more battle ready by holding three times a single character's inventory for extra equipment, potions, looted weapons and armor, and scrolls. A Packmule will wisely remove itself from a battle scene but will fight by kicking with its hind legs if cornered. A Packmule increases your party's effectiveness and allows you to keep pushing further into dangerous territory as you seek to rid the land of the evil that has besieged the Kingdom of Ehb."". I'm sure many will disagree, but I believe this to be the best in the DS Series. DS 2 just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the story at all. The game was boring and tedious. DS 3, same thing, I just didn't like it. Just goes to show you that sometimes, the originals are the best, and that is certainly true with DS 1, for it kicks major booty. For a game that is from 2002, the graphics are excellent. I personally love the outdoor scenery. It's so vivid and colorful, and was nicely done. I sometimes find myself traveling along and stopping my party just to gaze at the wonderful detailed world. The game has a Night/Day Cycle, weather effects, an awesome sound track and superb ambient sounds. The game world really comes alive. But the best part of DS 1 is the story. It's one of the best I've played in a game, and the narrated cut-scenes are just great. Some like to compare this to Diablo II, but there is no comparison. Although Diablo II is one of the best games ever made, DS is nothing like it, at all. Diablo II is a dark fantasy hack and slash with very little RPG element. DS is an action fantasy RPG. There is much more than just hack and slash in this game. Diablo II gets very boring, very fast. It's just a click-fest with some quests, that's it. Some of the things I love about DS 1 is how (unlike Diablo), you don't need to keep clicking on an enemy to attack. I about wore my index finger out on Diablo II from clicking the mouse so much. The drop system is also good. Not too much, not too little. It's just right. And if you have the stand alone expansion, LOA (Legends of Aranna), the game is even better. The Original Campaign is quite long, consisting of 9 Chapters to keep you well entertained. You will meet and talk to tons of people which have unique personalities. Many are voiced extremely well. The game also has a nice modding community. Lastly, I really enjoy the many companions you can bring into your party. There are many to choose from. Some of them will join you for free, while others will cost you some coin. I'm not sure how anyone could give this game a bad rating. it doesn't deserve it. I for one, have nothing negative to say about this game. It's one of the best out there. I've been playing off and on since it's release and it never gets old. Great job Gas Powered Games! A true classic. 10/10.. Well, graphically this game clearly looks awful now but who cares, it's not about that. I guess the primary problem is now is that while you can see the incredible influence this game has had on others, unfortunately its progeny such as Torchlight completely blow it out of the water now making this feel like just a basic grinder.. This game is easy to learn for non rpg experts, which makes it even more attractive. The game is fun, the graphics are just fine (even its an old game) and the game play is good. It's an easier RPG than others on it's style, so it makes it perfect for a come and go, playing casual. There is little room for exploration on this game, since it's mostly a dungeon crawler, from point A to point B and some very easy puzzles. Overall it's a good game. The real time battles with strategic pauses, makes it really cool and fun to play with. If you feel your party is not balanced or you want to change it, you can train any of the party's components on other magic melee or anything else. there are no classes per se. As for the time of this review, MP does not work anymore, but there is a way to make it work. So in conclusion, a really nice party based Action RPG with tactical pauses on combats. I have to agree with some people, that the game can become repetitive.. I love the dungeon Siege series, but this has to be the best one from it. The game is so simple to understand and had a good story. The graphics may not be the best, but, who gives a crap about that anyways? They were good for it's time. It's a great role playing, action game. Even though the game came out 11 years ago, it's still epic. 10 out of 10. This game set the bar quite high for its day. I can think of few games of its time that were so beautiful. There wasn't much in the way of complex plot I can recall. They let the land tell the story and made sure it could. Sure it was a mindless hack and slash. But that was part of the simple joy of it.. 10. I remember waking up on Saturday mornings during middle school, logging into Dungeon Siege and playing for hours with my friends as we battled through The Kingdom of Ehb. Then one day the servers came down, and we couldn't play anymore. I have so many great memories associated with this game! It's a hack-n-slash classic, which has won my heart and many of my friends.. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Dungeon Siege with my mates over a lan which brought endless fun. This is one of the best RPG's out there. I particularly liked the style of graphics.. One of the best PC RPG games. Non-linear gameplay, story, coop multiplayer, huge item selections, and a huge modding community make Dungeon Siege one of the top dogs in it's class, even to this day. In the wake of the horrible console port they had the nerve to call Dungeon Siege 3, it makes me thankful I can still go back and play this classic on my modern PC and still find mods I have not used yet. For the games sage, released in 2002, it still looks and feels great and is a must for any RPG gamer.. Quite a long and fun game with tons of items, areas and fun to be had. It does lack substantial depth however. Still the graphics are pleasing and the soundtrack is fantastic. The game however did not keep me enticed long enough to finish it and does become a bit monotonous.. I enjoyed this game very much, its probably the best out of the entire series... it is a little bit like icewind dale, baldurs gate, etc... but this one u get guns, u get a large party of heroes, and it just never seems to get old, i just wish it never had an ending. Simple, maybe repetitive, but really entertaining! Just don't consider it too much a RPG.. maybe more like a Beat'em Up xD this for the gameplay... The story is amazing, well built and with a lot of secondary quests. Last but not least, the graphics, we are talking about a 2002 game... and it's great! Give it a try!. I'm sorry but this game just absolutely kicks Diablo II's ass. The graphics are nice looking, gameplay is great and you feel like there is a purpose of playing this, unlike diablo. Huge amount of spells to use and having a party of adventurers to deal with adds to the enjoyment of the campaign. Also an amazing soundtrack to this game as well. I'm not sure how you can say this game is boring without saying Diablo is even worse as the gameplay is similar, but DS is by far superior.","the game does not have a bad atmosphere, interesting role-playing system, but has a rather unfortunate approach to the combat system and low frame rate . the combat is just so...boring. I like juggling all the characters, but the attacking is just poor and the AI is bad ."

936.Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders,"This game is awesome, simple mechanics for you to master and enjoy as you go down the mountain. Trying to beat the challenges in both green and black routes is just amazing and really satisfying. A Gorgeous, Thrilling Ski Adventure – 10/10 Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is an absolute joy! The snow is stunningly beautiful, the controls are precise and intuitive, and the camera adds a cinematic vibe that I personally love. The game truly captures the feeling of skiing, every run feels like an adventure, and the devs absolutely nailed the sense of speed and flow. Sure, the multiplayer isn't perfect yet, and has some connectivity issues, but the core experience is so good that I'm confident the devs will patch them soon.. Taking the addicting formula from the original game (on a mountainbike) and brining a multiplayer experience to make everything even more engaging. The single player experience is still intact, but nothing beats the fun of going downhill against other 7 people.","the single player experience is still intact, but nothing beats the fun of going downhill against other 7 people . the multiplayer isn't perfect yet, and has some connectivity issues, but the core experience is so good that I'm confident the devs will patch them soon ."

938.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords,"The best Star Wars game ever made. It takes everything Lucas created and questions it respectfully.. This would be so great if they had a chance to finish this. You could see that the story should have been so much better. But the gameplay is great and being dark feels so good here with new powers.. This is a classic. I loved playing a Star Wars rpg and the setting and time is great. You also get replay value with the light or dark side options. For the time it came out I don't know what else you could ask for.. One of my favorite games of all time. The story, the combat system, the lore... its all just perfect.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a good game man, the story is unfinished so just slap on the content restoration mod. however everything else is very flawless,. The Game is really awesome, have many battles and semi open-world missions, the villains ares memorables and open a alternate universe to the main timeline of Star Wars.. Much like the first game in the series this is a must for any STAR WARS fan and is a master class in RPG and writing. The stories and dialogue in this game are like no other STAR WARS story even to this day. You will LOVE every second of it. 10.. Obsidian is really good at making games on established IPs even if they get jack for development time. If this game had more time it easily could of been better then the original as is its as good. This game has bugs and feels to me like it needed more planets to explore and more time on that ending but everything else is amazing give it a try.. Obsidian makes everything better.... Thank God Xbox bought the studio & not EA.. We all dodged a bullet... TY Obsidian for KOTOR2,,,,New Vegas,,, & Jade EMpire… **The Fallout New Vegas DLC is still to this day the GREATEST DLC ive ever purchased... It was soooo advanced & was easy to run circle after circle of loot farming... *My 1st SingleP[alyer game(non MMO) to break the 500 hour mark..... In Obsidian I trust!. It's an honorable sequel to the Greatest star wars game of all time. Adds in more combat options, more characters and a new protagonist. A lot of the aspects in the game are like the first but if it ain't broke don't fix it.. Tier 2 + Excellent continuation of the story from the previous installment that goes in a lot of exciting direction + Interesting cast of companions with a great development system between them and the player + Explores the moral ambiguity and potential depth of the Star Wars mythos in amazing ways ? Pacing feels odd, and conclusion is not fully fleshed out ? Game feels emotionally hollow/cold despite the admirable storytelling, though for the most part this fits thematically - Like the previous installment, combat gets boring quickly, though it does offer some fun new mechanics. this game is a perfect addition to those hardcore star wars Fans.... Pros: the lightsaber combat is exhilerating....., The easter eggs hidden throughout the game are awesome.... the character interactions are very inclusive and it makes you feel like your actually involved.... Cons: unfortunatly the game was rushed through development.... so its missing massive parts of the storyline.... they deleted a whole planet from the game.... and forgot to fix some of the in game interactions which hint at the planet...... the ending leaves it wide open for a third game.... but we have yet to see a new game.... SWTOR is not even close to being called a continuation of Star wars KOTOR 2... its a stand alone game and i speak for myself but personally i WANT TO SEE A THIRD GAME.... revitalize this game series guys, we can get our game back guys... they did this for star wars battlefront 3 for the xbox 1... so it stands to reason they can do a new one for XBOX 1.... unfortunatly the issue will be getting disney to allow it from Canon perspective.... they dont have a bloody clue. Personally, this was the First KotOR game I played. I fell in love, even though this is the sequel, it just goes to show how good this series is at immersing the player. I didn't know or care who Revan or the Exile was when I started, but as I played through, it was clear this game, is, just, Perfect. To me, this is this is the definitive Star Wars RPG, so is the game it is a sequel to. It makes you feel like it is an actual Star Wars movie, made by those little geniuses at Bio-ware, you are the main character, whether or not you choose to fall to the dark-side or follow the path of the light is entirely up to YOU. The tutorial planets can get boring, but that's just like the beginning of ANYTHING, just stick around and you will see, the tutorial planets are just the gates to what this game holds. And combat is just scratching the surface, the characters both in this game and the first, have so much detail, and development. They actually have personalities and quirks, you need to get to know them if you are going to use them helpfully. In KotOR II, there are turns between fighters, there is an initiative roll, virtual dice rolls to do damage, see if you missed or just unlocked a door successfully, like any classic game of D&D. All virtual of course, at the players convenience. Just try this game, and the first one too for that matter, if you like Star Wars, and (maybe) are over 10 you will love, or at least, like it. I would just love to spoil the ending, BUT. I. WON'T.. If you haven't played any of the KOTOR games, I recommend you get KOTOR 1 and this game, it's sequel. When I first started playing II it seemed weak. And you could quickly tell it was made by a different company than the original. Some things seem forced on you. But in the end those weak beginnings have great story potential. Depending on which path you choose to follow. . But as the game unfolded I found in some ways II was a much better game. And this from a person who loves the original KOTOR. I especially love how they made the neutral path have it's own special properties and have it's own unique plot results. But mostly how it affected powers differently. Story is still a big thing. The game still has huge replayablitiy potential. It still has great mini games. The companion stories are great. But the best part is you can do what you want, and be your own Jedi. And the game and story feels like it belongs in the Star Wars universe This game is what made people so happy about the potential for a Star Wars MMO. Sadly SWTOR failed to deliver on even half of what the KOTOR series was. Remember many actions have repercussions, that affect story. This game even can have you form romantic relationships with the companions. And depending on how you interact can have some very unforeseen types of interactions. Which can be quite disturbing. But if your looking for a Star Wars RPG this game and it's predecessor is a must have.. The first KOTOR game is cosidered by many to be the best Star Wars game, and one of the best RPGs of all time. Truly Bioware did a fantastic job with that game, but this sequel wasn't made by Bioware but by Obsidian, so you may be concerned that this sequel might not live up to the standards set by it's predecessor. Worry not this sequel is actually better than the first in every way. The story is darker and the characters deeper. The combat is tighter and less frustrating. The voice acting and score are amazing. The graphics are also something I have to give praise to, they're absolutely gorgeous at times, no they aren't as good as todays games and there are some rough areas, but when you remember that this is an Xbox title and not an Xbox 360 title you'll find some truly jaw droppingly gorgeous moments. The only thing I can find that the first game did better is the fact that it was less glitchy, that's right glitches and slowdown are a regular occurrence, but they don't detract from the experience much at all. This one of the best games I'be ever played, and it's the best Star Wars game I've ever played. Here's hoping they make KOTOR 3.. men this game is awese!!! to bad that they never make up kotor 3. the storyline become more dark, good and charismatic chraracter like kreia and a misteryous villain like the darth nihilus one. i am not sexist but, to bad tht the canon chraracter is a woman, the man storyline was more interested when you got atris, visas marr and brianna as main chrararter .. An amazingly fun game with some of the best characters in the entire Star Wars franchise. However, everything feels a little too familiar, and the story just doesn't feel as satisfying as the original. The game also feels rushed and uncompleted, as there were many opportunities to extend the plot which were not fulfilled. Nevertheless, the game is an entertaining sequel and a must play for any fans of Star Wars, Bioware, or generally RPGs.. One of my favorite RPG games I have ever played. The story and character customization was fantastic! I absolutely loved picking my party members for specific parts, and ultimately creating my own story line dependent on my choices. This is a game which has helped shaped, along with its predecessor, RPG's today.. Though incomplete, the game brings with it a unique storyline, fantastic characters and awesome game-play. The storyline is what amazes me in this game as it brings with it a view on the Star Wars galaxy that no movie or book could give. An exiled jedi trying to find his/her way in the galaxy, unaware of a war that occurred in his/her travels, later to find out that he/she is a target for the sith, and on his/her journey to connect back to the force he/she is faced with options that will change the face of the galaxy. The characters' personalities are amazing, each carrying a history that the jedi can unveil. The in-completion of the story is a let down but prays for a sequel. Sadly there is none but I give KOTOR TSL a ten for story, characterization and gameplay.. A masterpiece that I played back in 2004 and a year ago again , pure Dark side this time. Story is great and I just love the characters, especially HK-47, he should had been awarded an Oscar that year! Really a must have for RPG and SW fans.. People are going to hate me for this, but I think this game was better than the original (Flame shield: ON). The story is that you're quite literally, the last Jedi. The game is then progressing around that. But because of this, people are trying to kill and/or imprison you left to right, and the characters, no matter what side you're on, follow. This game had more feats, awesome force powers, more upgrades, and VERY likeable and unlikable characters. Atton being my favorite, and Kreia being my least favorite. The game had new music which I actually uploaded to my mp3, and a big plot twist toward the end. Even though we kinda saw it coming, but it was a blurry line. It may start off pretty slow, but you'll definitely get into it. It has about 30 hours of gameplay including the sidequests! Ever played dungeons and dragons? The board game? The combat is exactly like that, but it does the rolling and arithmetic for you in less than a quarter of a second! The game can also be quite funny too. When you walk in on the Handmaiden, she says she's training as a way not to be bored. Then you can say ""Well you can always play pazaak with Atton"" Then all of a sudden you hear Atton yell at the droid ""What do you mean pazaak? What, AGAIN?!"" The game, I am proud to say, shall always be on my game shelf.. Not as good as it's predecessor, the tutorial section (first two planets) of this game are only worth doing once, but everything else I could do a lot (I've beat the game twice). Once again, It's purely strategic and it shines as an actual RPG (see my review of the first game for details).. This game was an extremely fun game. The mechanics, customizations, and improvement really made a great game. The story however disappointed me, it did not live up to the potential it had on it and i truly wish more time was put into this. This is a good game don't get me wrong but it could have and should have been so much more!! The first Knight of the Old Republic is much much better.",i loved playing a Star Wars rpg and the setting and time is great . the story is unfinished so just slap on the content restoration mod . the story is unfinished so just slap on the content restoration mod .
939.Crashmo,"+Reinvents Pushmo by giving extra dimensions +New mechanics make for more interesting puzzles ~Odd difficulty curve ~Feels more linear - Story telling got worse. Better than Pushmo. Nice graphics, great presentation, lots of new stuff, nice music, and they added save files :D . It's worth it every penny. easily one of the best puzzle games i have ever played, and you get that good vibe. Masterpiece! this game is awesome of most intelligent and fun for 3ds! I really like the serie of Pushmo, Stretchmo and Crashmo. The games is beauty, simple and very fun! Awesome! Thank you Nintendo for make games really fun and intelligent!!. Pullblox was one of the best games, if not THE best, on eshop. Fallblox doesn't match its predecessor's quality, but is still an addictive (and hard) sequel. The physics are completely different from Pullblox- this time blocks fall instead of stay up, which requires a whole new method of thinking. The aim is still the same- get to the goal- but that is now trickier to do than ever. This genius puzzing sequel will bend your mind while you desperately try to work out the solution. But try long enough, and it will come. Levels are very tough, but clearing a level that took an hour to do is so satisfying. Of course, Fallblox is damn addictive as well as tough and the addition of new gadgets along the way help to freshen the experience further yet. Each of these gadgets adds some completely new concept, which results in an even trickier and more confusing fallblox. There's one downside though- there are remarkably fewer levels in Fallblox than there were in Pulblox, AND Fallblox is more expensve. The shorter game may be a result of fewer murals- Pulblox had over 70 of these, but Fallblox has only ten. Murals are very interesting because they are like normal levels, except that they look like pictures. It's a neat idea, so it's a shame there aren't many of them in Fallblox. As well as the main game, the level creator idea from Pullblox is back. This greatly increases the lasting appeal of the game, and pushes your thinking to the limit. But, just like Pullblox, it's lacking in a good way to share your levels online- a scheme like in mario vs donkey kong would've been better than qr codes.. A lot harder than pushmo/pullblox but another great game. I found it a little harder to think in 3D in some of the later levels but if you stick at it you solve the puzzle every time.. This game is one tricky puzzle, but if you never give up, you will always find the goal.This game is like the next part of Pushmo, which now there's another park called Crashmo. Instead of saving these poor kids, you are going to get all 100 birds. That means 100 puzzles for the story. There's also another 100 puzzles, but they are less harder than the story itself. Best of all, you can create your OWN puzzles just like Pushmo. But this time, instead of making only about 90 custom puzzles, you get 100 custom puzzles to create! And if you forgot, the puzzles will be more harder with new gadgets! This game is worth it, and if you LOVE making puzzles AND playing puzzles, then you should try this game.","Pullblox is an addictive (and hard) sequel to Pullblox . fewer levels in the game than in Pulblox, and the price is more expensive . level creator idea from Pullblox is back . physics are completely different from Pullblox ."
94.Dwarf Fortress,"This game should have a better introduction into the game and a longer tutorial, so you better understand, what to do and how to help yourself. I watched a guide on youtube, but this is not fun, to do the same, what someone did on a video. The wikipedia seems to be outdated. Anyway I missed a manual. And this game is only in english, I prefered to play it in german, but there is no translation The graphic is clearly very bad. The sound is good, I like some of the music.. A crazy amount of mechanics and fascinating interactions between them. Either DF is your thing, or it isn't. I know that it isn't mine, although I still appreciate it for what it is.. Dwarf Fortress is getting two reviews in one since I have played the steam and text based versions of the game. The game itself allows you to take control **** of dwarves and your job is to keep them alive and thriving. The progression of the game is heavily influenced by how the players play it. You have to take care of their needs to keep them happy. Your camp can turn into a city and events/names are completely random. For the text based version, it is extremely hard to look at andis very discouraging. You have to get used to it or you can mod yourgame to have graphics. With graphics understanding the game becomes easier. There is a adventure mode that is currently being reworked which basically plays like a RPG. You control a singular character and build up a party. It seems that building forts in this mode is too restrictive. For those who like to build, play fortress mode, it plays as a construction and management sim. The steam version gets a HUGE upgrade! There are new graphics and the controls and UI are much easier to deal with. You also can use your mouse instead of moving cursors everywhere on your keyboard. Management of your fortress is amuch easier task.. First hours be like: what I'm even seeing on the screen? Is that enemy or environment? If this part is fun and you intrinsically want to play the game to get past that part to actually start playing the game (and, spoiler, end up modding the game yourself just for yourself), the said game is a blast.. There are games that are so groundbreaking that they define a new genre that other games emulate for years afterwards hoping to get a fraction of the magic that the original created. Dwarf fortress is one of those games that set the standard for a colony simulation genre that future games copy and rehash. It is a true labor of love and amazing concept that has evolved over time. You can sink 500+ hours and still not fully discover all the secrets the game has to offer. The best simulation game that currently exists and the family behind the development are so open to the game's struggles that you feel like part of the team over the years. It's been an amazing ride so far and I can't wait to see what the game looks like when it finally reaches completion. It will truly be a historic achievement.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Great game. With incredible possibilities. Pixel art sprites from steam version are great. Some systems are bit confusing, but it is normal for game of such kind and possibilities. Real masterpiece.. Insanely complex, insanely rewarding, insanely !!FUN!!. I always wanted to play DF, but I always had a lot of trouble with the classic interface and classic text graphics - I'd rage quit out of frustration. Now with the Steam release, I can't stop playing and thinking about Dwarf Fortress 24/7. AND, I am even able to play with the ASCII graphics now, due to understanding the game. Sometimes I even prefer the ASCII graphics due to readability in some busy scenes!. Complicated, fun and full of surprises. This game is one of the best settlement management sims out there. Each dwarf has a history, tastes and way of life. Even the most peaceful gameplay can become chaos in a instant. Not for everyone, thou.. Incredible rich, complex and involving sandbox/simulation game that got me instantly hooked!. One of the most ingenious games of all time, but a little complicated. Anyway I had a lot of fun.. Dwarf Fortress is a seminal work. Fair warning: at the time of writing this, it still is affected by numerous bugs, some lingering in the code base since many years. And the UI feels insufficient. And despite the graphics overhaul that come with the Steam version, it still doesn’t look like much. But despite all this, Dwarf Fortress is undeniably a 10 for the breadth and the wealth and the depth it offers. There is so much to learn, so much to do, so many details. It’s fascinating.. Common! It`s Dwarf Fortress! ЇLUN KINEM! AAAAAAAAAGH!!! UB BEL DURAD DËNUSH TASHEM AR AMUR WOWOWOWOWO WO WOW OWOWOW LOCUN URDIM ONOL IGËR DUCIM AR SEBSUR WOWOWO WOW OW WOW OW OW WOOOOO MATUL ÓDAD EVON SHEDIM ZOZ LÊGAN NOVAL WOWOWO WOWO WOOWOW WO WO W OW LEGON VÚSH LAM RATH THOL UMOM ÄS SIRAB GATAL WOOW OWO WO O WO WOOWO WO WO WO WOOO UB BEL DURAD DËNUSH TASHEM AR AMUR WOWOWO WOOW O WO W OW OOWO W OW LOCUN URDIM ONOL IGËR DUCIM AR SEBSUR O AKH!. Man the graphics are some of the worst ever...looks like a 1980 game AVGN would rage at. And its too complex IDK what is going on.. I built a dump because there were too many lung fish carcasses everywhere, then I started a death cult at that dump. Meanwhile, my Planter got lost in the mines so a bunch of Hamsters chewed their way out of cages before he could get to them. I don't know what we do with the hamsters. Or why Dwarfs have so many cats, or why there's an option to start a cult at the dump, but this is my new best favorite game ever. And I hate survival/crafting/sim games. But this one just sort of . . . fits in my brain for some reason. So, if you have the mental capacity to juggle millions of insane things at once, and the willingness to fail harder than you've ever failed in your life just to learn how to fish, then buddy, this ones for you. 10/10. The game is very complex and makes you dive deep into the study of how much effort and almost all your life the creators have invested in this game, an incredible amount of mechanics, interactions, an incredible world that generates new story branches, you can write a book for each adventure, thanks for this game.. the best colony simulator game I've ever played, without a doubt this game has a gigantic complexity, where the world is fully alive, civilizations can be destroyed without even being present in the game, which progresses even if you do absolutely nothing , without a doubt it is a game worth your time, if you have the patience to understand the interface and its game play.. 0-pointers are complete numbnuts. Sure, the Steam version needs some polishing still and maybe the interface is a bit difficult, but 0 points because of that? The game itself is one of the most introcate ever made, it is not supposed to be easy. It's the same as someone would rate all Soulslike games 0 because they are hard.. This is a very particular sort of game. It's not user friendly. It's not going to make learning easy. It's not going to fire off a hundred flashing lights a second to keep your attention. But for those who can find appeal in one of the most intricate strategy management rpg, it contains hundreds of hours of bliss.. Best game of 2022 and the past decade. If you played the ASCII version support the devs. If you haven't played the steam version you should!. The best game ever made gets even better with a graphical and sound overhaul on steam. If you don’t own this piece of gaming history you do not know what you’re missing.. I don't understand how can be fun something so complicated, complex, huge and overwhelming.. Unnecessarily complicated and overwhelming, takes too long to figure out to truly be fun. More time consuming than anything, without making much progress whatsoever.. I have only played the game that was recently released, I have not played the previous ascii version. Its a very impressive game considering how small the team is, but it simply is not for me. Its clear that it has been the backbone of other games I enjoy more in this genre (Rimworld for example), but the original is not for me. Its not too difficult, and in quite a few ways I find it easier than other city management games. My main issue is that with all its depth its rather clunky. Trying to optimize a sick base or build walls of the same material just takes too much time. While i see how much is in there, and there are plenty of game mechanics I have not explored, all I see so far is how mundane it is. I'll probably return to give it another shot in a couple months. Its definitely good, but the user experience needs to be improved by a lot. If I want to build 4 simple houses, it shouldn't take me minutes to drag and click on what I need, it should take seconds.. Great version of the game that makes it a lot more accessible. If you haven't played this legendary game yet, now is the time to start.. I do like this game and it can get very addicting. I think it may be better to wait until the game goes on sale. At the time of this writing, I have experienced multiple slowdowns and lag. There were a few times when certain functions would just stop working and would need to restart the game. My biggest complaint about the game is the need to rely on external resources to understand how to play it. An in-depth story driven campaign would help so much to teach Dwarf Fortress to new players. Instead you have to figure out everything on your own. It would not be that bad but the game is horrible at providing detailed information that actually helps in resolving problems that arise in your fort. For example, I was about four hours into a new fort (with twenty hours of overall game experience) when all of a sudden my dwarves stopped brewing drinks, even though I had hundreds of seeds and plants, with a large cavern farm and ensuring none of the mushrooms were being made for food and had plenty of barrels. It would have really helped to have had an AI assistant or in-depth encyclopedia that could have helped identify the problem. Am I losing because of a bug or something I don’t understand? I don't mind losing, but do dislike losing when not knowing how to access the information needed to fix the problem. The devs should check out games like Civ VI and its Civilpedia for in-game help, along with the optional guide AI character that will assist you in the game. Adding those types of features would go a long way with understanding the complexity of the game. Half my game time is me pausing to look up stuff on the wiki or youtube. There are just so many things you are left guessing about. I want to be able to click on an item and have a page show up like in Civ Vi and let me know about the item and how it's used. I would love to see a customizable AI assistant that warns you about problems and strategies to alleviate them. I would say it is fun and addicting but not accessible; it is a very niche game. There is nothing wrong with that but do think it will turn off quite a few casual gamers. You just have to view looking up guides half the time as part of the fun, I suppose (I don’t; I want the game to teach me how to play). I do enjoy playing the game and think it is worth trying out; I just think it may be better to wait a year and when it is on sale for about fifteen or twenty bucks. By then, there should be much more content and patches provided for the game to make it worth the price tag. I really do enjoy Dwarf Fortress, despite its flaws and lack of polish. I hope in a year or two I am able to come back to increase my rating of this game, but for now, 7/10.. Dwarf Fortress is a 20 year old masterpiece that has inspired many games such as rimworld. Playing with mouse controls is now actually doable and they work great. Anyone who has not played dwarf fortress prior to its steam release should do so now as the amount of crap you can do in dwarf fortress is nearly limitless and YOU WILL LOSE, but that's the point of dwarf fortress, losing is fun and you use your loses as a learning experience to try, try, again. One day you will lead the dwarfs to glory, but first you must lead them into defeat.. Yep. Masterpiece. A whole underground world for you to discover. Deep and brilliant emergent game-play. Endless stories unfolding before you once you get past the initial learning curve. Get past it. You're in for something genuinely unique. A true labour of love, nearly twenty years in the making with more is being added all the time. Simply stunning.. Everything from the classic version there is to love. But now with a helpful tutorial for new players and an intuitive GUI and mouse support.. This game is only for intelligent people. If you have a low attention span, I'd recommend the game Call of Duty by Activision.. This is not a game, it's a piece of art, a great experience you MUST live! 20 years of programming, for 20 years it was free, now we have to pay these two great men! Thanks a lot Adams borthers! ****/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress. Dwarf Fortress has long been a fantastic game, and this full release finally addresses what had long been the elephant in the room for this game: the graphics and interface. With this long-awaited update and release the game has become far more accessible and usable. Once again I've found myself loving the process of setting up my forts and the even more Fun process of seeing how it all ends. A must-have game for any simulation game fan.. The best, most detailed and deepest game ever created and probably will not be outmatched by anything for decades to come.. Game has a steep learning curve, but builds fantastic stories of failure. Easily one of the greatest games ever created.. I had long since played the Lazy Newb pack fan bundling of a tile set and utilities for the previous free version of Dwarf Fortress. Few other games I have played were both good a decade prior, and received solid improvements that entire time. It figures that one of the best games this year was mostly the work of two brothers with independent control. The new updates for the paid version prevent the need for a third party pack just to make it minimally viable for a dedicated fan to play. Now, I could see it opening up the game to include those that are only semi-dedicated.. It is my favorite game, it's because of it's freedom, it's deep meaning for every little system.. At first, after downloading the game, everything is confusing, especially the UI, the tile sets, and the mechanics but after that, the game is actually fun as you learn.. The game might be a bit overwhelming at first but once you start to learn the mechanics it becomes extremely fun. The amount of stuff you can do and what can happen in the game is impressive and if you don't feel like leading a group of dwarves, you can always play Adventure mode, create your own character and explore the world. I honestly consider Dwarf Fortress to be symbol of games as a whole. It's stayed just under the mainstream of gaming for nearly a decade and a half, and has built an enduring community dedicated to watching ASCII graphics. I'm not good at Dwarf Fortress. I would never dare embark on an aquifer, and I religiously put points into swimming whenever I play adventurer for fear of drowning in a brook. I don't know how to build a magma pump stack, refuse to touch perpetual motion generators, and cannot understand fortress schematics on the bay12 forum. Losing is fun is a phrase you'll see everywhere in this game, and I think I have my own interpretation of it. You build a fortress. You build some housing. You secure food and drink. You get migrants. With or without the help of external tools, you assign jobs to them based on skills or (more likely for me) based on whatever you need at the moment. You build up more and more. You withstand sieges and raids by fantastical and horrifying beasts. You develop everything a stereotypical dwarven fortress might want. Steel production is a little complicated, but a quick jaunt to the wiki will set you straight. You build a military and maybe subjugate a few towns or launch a couple raids. Congrats, you win. That by itself is a great game. You get to see everything you build come together. Soon enough you've got millions in wealth. With judicious FPS management and enough time, you might see the passing of generations (Although admittedly it takes an insane amount of dedication given a dwarf's lifespan). You find the spoilery parts of the game and react accordingly. You won. But you also have been winning ever since the immediate fear of game over vanished. It's really easy to play it safe in dwarf fortress. Walls are indestructible. So are bridges. Build a simple gate out of the two as your sole entrance and you are impervious to sieges so long as you don't run out of food and drink. Spend the next few decades in-game making art and masterwork furniture if you want. What losing is fun means is that you do as much weird **** as possible and see what you can get away with. Do you want to build a palace out of solid gold? Sure, if you can find enough of it. Do you want to build a magma pump that floods the surrounding area? Sure, if you can provide it enough power to get the desired throughput. Do you want to get into niche industries that aren't really vital like gem encrusting, building a library, or industrialized mermaid ivory harvesting? Sure, although I don't think anyone had a functioning plan for mermaid ivory yet. Thankfully, some simple modding sidesteps the whole ethics issue. I suffered a really big setback last week in my latest fortress. I was trying to build a tower up to max height as a side project using the stone left over from another project, but wanted to modify it partway through to have more staircases up. Unfortunately due to completely preventable circumstances, my dwarves deconstructed part of the floor out of sync, causing part of the tower to collapse on one of my more prominent dwarves. A ton of stone fell two stories, crushing him to death immediately. Seeing their friend and pillar of the community be crushed to death **** morale. Tantrums ensued, probably not helped by the fact that I had a big alcohol shortage due to wasting so much labor on the tower, combined with low water supplies due to a sudden siege. I essentially executed several troublemakers by sending them out to fight a besieging army. Sure, the fortress isn't lost, but my tower project faces a very, very big delay now. Several important dwarves are going to be haunted for the rest of their lives with constant flashbacks and trauma. I didn't get away with it. Losing is fun.. Dwarf Fortress is a really artistic, creative, and fascinating experience which played an imperative part in the shaping of my taste in media over the course of my childhood. It taught me to have a very mindful relationship of the relationship between graphics and creativity. It excited the imagination phenomenally and continuously promised a wonderful and intricate fantasy world. From a purely mechanical perspective, Dwarf Fortress is extremely detailed, which leads to a fair bit of complexity and a steep learning curve. The game is not especially inaccessible, though, because one of the main features of the game is that it makes losing a fun, enjoyable, and rewarding experience. This notion of losing being ""fun"" is one of the central tenants of the game's design, and being exposed to this kind of mindset is a radically interesting domain to consider, especially since it is so often missing from nearly all other interactive media. The mechanical complexity and elegance of the general descent into losing Dwarf Fortress feels like a critical design component which belongs in every game. Aesthetically, Dwarf Fortress has a very unique style; its primitive graphics are made into a sort of art form, and the mechanical density and huge flurries of activities on the screen create a sort of hypnotic experience. The game has very detailed and fun bits of flavor scattered about its randomly generated narratives as well. Dwarf Fortress is one of the best video games of all time for many unconventional reasons, and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.. people jealous because there brains cant comprehend the scope and details of this game it is a masterpiece best game EVERRR AND IMEAn EVER made once you know how to play this game forget about your job wife and kids wont need them not even rimworld comes close!. First you learn the UI/menus. Then you learn how to keep your dwarves alive for awhile. Then you learn how to make your fortress thrive. And then you realize you have to start thinking like a programmer in order to make the game run smoothly/efficiently. Which means you end up relearning the menus/UI all over again. Somewhere along the way, too, you realize Tarn Adams is a unique genius, and that we're all lucky he decided to make this his life pursuit. Perhaps this is a better endorsement: A couple of summers ago, i dropped a couple hundred bucks on a new GPU so I could play The Witcher 3. What did I spend the majority of my time playing instead? Dwarf Fortress.. An incredibly complicated game that is certainly worth your time to master. For the entry fee of free fans of the RPG genre can immerse themselves in an entire world made from scratch specifically for every play-through.. Dwarf Fortress: slaves of armok is one of the most amazing games i ever played, it has huge amounts of replayability, content, and endless FUN that it never ceases to amaze me. being a free game, theres absolutley no reason to not try this, however new players are suggested to take up guides on the official wiki or youtube. you dont really have to be perticulary intelligent to play this, just passionate and patient the game simulates so much things and the amount of micromanagement allowed goes beyond any other game, if you love that, and got time.. you'll certainly never regret trying this. This is one crazy-ass game. You will not learn it by yourself. You will need help. The interface is one of the most insane things that has ever existed, and I, a 5 year vet, still don't know what some of it does. You will need a guide, maybe a friend, maybe the expertly maintained wiki, but do not try to do it yourself, or you will become incredibly frustrated. That being said, once the initial shock to the system is out of the way, WELCOME, to the greatest simulation game ever created. I can't explain it better than everyone before me. The only way to know is to experience. Strike the earth, and always remember, losing is FUN!. One of the worst interfaces in gaming history. This game is pure hype, with too many people who never played it pretending like it is a masterpiece. If only there were more of a focus on the interface, it would be a better user experience. Nuff said.. it is an incredibly complex simulation game where you take control of a population of dwarves. There is no endgame, there are no concrete objectives. You just have to do your best to allow your fort to survive all of the nasty things that can come upon it.. One of the best games ever made. But the game have a very set demographics and is not for everyone. Plus the game have a rly steep learning curve like EVE is a child's game compared to it and EVE is the game that is know to be one of the hardest in the world to learn to play.. The game **** hard. I invested many hours to learn it because people always tell how awesome and complex it is. I sit there with my dwarfs, have no clue what they actually want, the game explains nothing and you need to figure out every little piece of information by yourself. After much ingame time nothing happened, maybe one goblin thief came in and stole something unimportant, whatever. I know the game creates thousands of background story points while creating the world but I have not seen anything of it in my games. I feel like this whole ""complexity"" that people see is just the **** interface. I have given up on it because the game does not give you either challenge nor reward, it just sits there and you whonder what to do with it while trying to figuring out while some people love it so hardcore.. This game is the best game is ever played - and a game really made with love. Yes, its graphics are awful at the beginning, but once you have understood the basics, you'll enjoy this game. You're free to do what you want, and the randomization of the universe causes all sorts of things to happen to you. There's such a diversity mixed with humor and absurd situations (try to read an after-action report), that this game is both interesting and fun. Don't forget : ""Losing is FUN!"". Difficult as hell and unimaginably complex. Dwarf Fortress makes you work for your fun. This is no ""Press X to Win"" casual game. Even the controls and UI require serious research and it will probably be a while until you get a successful fortress up and running. Fortunately, the community is wonderful and there are plenty of well written guides to get you started, but ultimately all the decisions are yours and the successes & failures of your dwarves are ultimately up to you.. FUN A lot of fun in this game. Just CRAZY. Really. There is no other one like this one. I love it because of the huge gameplay, full of surprises, impossible to understand without take it and torn it apart during two weeks, night and days. The wiki is very helpful, as the tuto everywhere on internet (youtube, wiki, blogs). Losing is fun! DF is VERY fun. :). After playing this game for several hours, Carter81's mother was so impressed by my skills that she gave me her phone number, and now I'm his new dad. Thanks, Dwarf Fortress!. .This is simply the best game ever. Whoever says the opposite is a console peasant. I've been playing only DF for 5 years straight and i can't get enough.. Dwarf Fortress is one of the best game experiences I have ever had. Although the very steep learning curve will turn away many players, and the very basic graphics may dissuade others, players who stick with the game will find an incredibly rewarding experience. Dwarf Fortress offers an incredibly deep, albeit complex world that can be enthralling, infuriating, hilarious, and more. The game has two gameplay modes: -Fortress mode In this mode, the player is initially given 7 dwarves and a wagon-full of supplies, and is tasked with creating a new fortress for their civilization. Beyond that, there are few limitations on what the player can do. One must take into consideration all aspects of dwarven life when planning their fortress- or possibly just ignore the needs of their citizens and build a giant statue out of obsidian that cries lava and shoots minecarts full of rocks at attacking armies from its mouth. Fortress mode is nearly limitless, and the graphics can be altered to your liking by simply installing a tileset or graphics set. -Adventure Mode What it says on the tin. Adventure mode offers a very rougelike experience in an open, randomly generated world (oh also you can generate entire worlds with fleshed-out histories of individuals, civilizations, wars, and more) that is once again very deep. The recent DF2014 update has increased the variety of adventure mode greatly, making it another amazing experience. In adventure mode, for example, one could visit the ruins of a previously lost fortress and loot its remains- or become the lord of nearly anywhere you want. I have barley scratched the surface of what Dwarf Fortress offers. I highly recommend that everyone try this game, even if it take a bit of effort to learn it.. A brilliant game with an in depth community, with each new world brings new history and life. The amount of stuff to this game is also amazing, just the whole research part can be pretty fun.. It has its charm, but after playing this game extensively for the last weeks, I have found it to be very buggy in almost all regards. Especially the military/equipment procedure is buggy. Even though it is a free, unfinished game, it is hard to forgive all these bugs, especially when it hasn't been updated in two years. Hopefully the next patch will remedy some of this and give us a less unfinished Dwarf Fortress with more frequent updates.. Dwarf Fortress is a game unlike any other when it comes to its depth and complexity and it is such a unique gem that I have given a perfect score despite a couple of glaring deficiencies and the fact that the game is only roughly 1/3 complete as of right now. Dwarf Fortress is at its heart a procedurally generated fantasy world simulator with two modes of play. In adventure mode you play from the perspective of a single adventurer exploring the randomly generated world around you. Adventure mode is very rouge-like in feel and execution. The second more popular mode of play is fortress or dwarf mode which explores the same procedurally generated fantasy world but as seen through the filter of an extremely deep civilization simulator type game where you control the destiny of a fledgling dwarf settlement. The game models the world it creates down to the individual organs of the creatures which inhabit it. Everything from the motor peripheral nerves, circulatory and pulmonary systems to the indivicual bones, teeth and organs of each creature in the world is modeled and tracked in exquisite detail. Even the personalities and psychology of the individual dwarves is modeled and directly effects how they interact with one another and the world around them. The physical world itself is modeled in similar detail with dynamically generated climates, weather, geology, biomes etc. All of this creates some amazing emergent game play which ranges from epic sagas such as the hilarious tragedy known only as Boatmurdered to player generated masterpieces such as a working in-game calculator created from a complex system of water and gear driven logic circuits not to mention weaponized magma flinging mine carts and crazy doomsday devices that flood the entire region with lava or cave in the an entire city. Having espoused upon that which makes this game so amazing and unique its time to get to the down sides. The learning curve is more like a cliff... that is covered in spikes and has a load angry goblins at the top pelting you with boulders and burning oil. On top of the horrible learning curve is the worst user interface I have ever had the displeasure of using. Both of these problems are somewhat understandable given that the game is currently in early alpha development but they are so glaringly bad that they need to be mentioned anyway. Also as a work in progress the game is very buggy which is actually one of its charms sometimes. Bugs can create some truly hilarious behavior in a game this complex. Another draw back for many is the graphics which are very primitive even after installing the various graphic mods which are a major upgrade from the native ASCII graphics although it makes the game more like reading a book where your imagination fills in the imagery. Despite the circa 1980's graphics Dwarf Fortress will bring a modern computer's processor to its knees with all of the complex modeling that goes on and you need a pretty nice machine to run it properly in Fortress mode. All in all Dwarf Fortress is a unique and amazing gaming experience for those with the chops to tackle the learning curve and the God forsaken user interface. This is certainly not a game for everyone but for those seeking true depth and complexity none can compare to the beautiful and ingenious disaster that is Dwarf Fortress.. Dwarf fortress, one of the most fun and !fun! games ever. It seems that the majority of negative reviews are about the graphics and saying that they din't understand how to play after 5 minutes. I have played this game for a couple of years and i still don't get bored of it. Sure there is a stee","this game should have a better introduction into the game and a longer tutorial . the graphic is clearly very bad, the sound is good, I like some of the music . for the text based version, it is extremely hard to look at and is very discouraging ."
940.Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time,"I really liked this game!! I didn't expect the story to be that dark, and the mini bros are a nice addition to the gameplay!. Somehow this is the funniest yet darkest mario game and it's absolutely incredible. This game is very strange. However,I love the story and characters! Also,game's actions maybe difficult to you.. So, the two-screen feature is really innovative, thanks to the features of Nintendo DS, but there´s a discomfort about the buttons: You need to use all the A,B,X and Y buttons Here are the controls: X - Baby Mario Baby Luigi - Y A - Mario B - Luigi. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the most underrated Mario RPGs. It's way better than Superstar Saga, I don't care what everyone says.. Mario & Luigi partners in time is a bit of a mixed bag. While it's story is quite funny and the writing is still really solid, everything gameplay wise kind of falls flat. The battle system is fun throughout the entire game and controlling 4 characters at once is a unique idea, but the Brothers Items make the game way too easy. Easily the most railroad, point A to point B RPG I've ever played. There are ZERO side Quests in the entire game! How is an RPG even allowed to do that? (And no, the beans don't count) The game is also much shorter than any other Mario RPG, only taking around 15 hours to complete, and there isn't a lot about this game that's very memorable; It's strangely generic for a Mario RPG (with maybe 1 or 2 exceptions). Fine game, and I'm glad I've played it, but there is absolutely no reason to play it again after the 1st time you beat it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Linearity is a prevalent issue, from repetitive field moves to disjointed maps accessible only via the hub world.. By far the best Mario & Luigi game. Original bosses, colorful yet dark backgrounds and story, adorable cutscenes with the babies, and just a solid Mario & Luigi game overall.. I want to like this game but it kinda ****. Just kinda. The bros. items are cool but too cheesable. The art style just looks off like they were trying to enhance the sprites from the first game. I didn’t get interested in the story. Do I even like this game. 5/10. A kind of RPG/platform hybrid simplified to its basic elements for younger players, but the sense of humour and fun presentation may appeal to the nostalgic looking to rekindle the magic of the old SNES days.. Mario and Luigi: Partner's in time is an amazing game. Perfect? Hell nah. The use of items is definitely something i would prefer over how the other games in this series does it. But the strategy that comes with those games are FAR better then how partner's in time does it. The bosses are unique, the cutscenes are amazing. Fantastic game over all!. This was such a wonderful game to play as a kid. It was one of my first ever exposures to a wonderfully crafted story with exciting and absolutely incredible plot twists. For a Mario game, this game really hits the bell for me. I absolutely adore this game even to this day. The battle gameplay is super innovative and really fun as well. Also, the art and graphics are amazing for a DS game! It looks absolutely stunning! This is a must play for anyone who enjoys a good RPG, and especially for anyone who's played the other Mario RPG games and hasn't picked this one up yet.. Really fun Mario and Luigi game! Highly recommend! The baby mechanics are really fun as well! Also, remember all those attacks like fire flower, and green/red shell? Well in this game, you can deal more damage to enemies if you press the X or Y button right before the shell hits the enemy. There's also more mechanics added to other bros attacks in favor of the baby feature. I DID mention fire flower as well, so I guess I'll say what that does in this game too. Well, pressing X or Y instead of A and B makes it shoot higher and get farther enemies..? I'm not 100% sure, so take that with a grain of salt (which I think is the correct saying).. a great adventure all around, but doesn't quite live up to super star saga due to a few issues. special moves are now items, and the babies are quite annoying. there's also some pacing issues. still a fun adventure, but i can see why the remakes skipped this one in favor of the superior ""bowser's inside story"". One of my favorites Mario and Luigi. The pixel design if fantastic with several visual effects. The ways to improve power are fantastic and the story has always some pivoting.. Easily the best in the Mario & Luigi RPG series. Much better than Bowser's Inside Story.. Some visual issues hold it back. Good - transition between lower screen and top screen when controlling the two duos is fast and seamless. Unlike in Bowser's inside story where the transition takes a few seconds - the battles make use of all four buttons which makes it much more challenging, especially the Bros attack. - being able to separate the past Mario Brothers and the present Mario Brothers, and control them separately is pretty interesting. - the partner battle mechanics and puzzles were really creative. Having to hit extra buttons to perform attacks made the gameplay more challenging. - the dialogue is charming and funny as with all the other Mario and Luigi games. - enemies are very creative. Bad - having to buy bros attack means they aren't readily available for me to use if I run out while in the past world. I would have to go back into the future to buy it in a shop. - too much lag before the hammer counter. makes it hard to time the counter - shadows are difficult to see during battles making it difficult to tell which brother the attack is going for. - certain parts of the level is hard to tell whether it is on a higher level or lower level. This probably has to do with the limitations of the DS hardware.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Baby Mario and his friends are forced to flee the Mushroom Kingdom when it’s invaded by an alien race known as Shroobs, meanwhile years in the future the gang use a time machine invented by Professor Gadd to defeat the threat once and for all. Partners in Time is well written, even funny at times, and the combat is enjoyably challenging. Some of the drawn out boss battles are a pain though, and at over twenty hours in length it began to drag a little towards the end.. personally, this game is my least favorite in the series. don't get me wrong i love all of the M&L games! it's just that the basic formula is completely differrent and it worked out for the worst. however, where it lacks in gameplay, it makes up in everything else. if it wasn't for bowser's inside story, i'd say that partners in time has hands down THE best story. the music, OOOH, THE MUSIC. whoever composed the music deserves a RAISE. like, seriously, after playing the game again, i just wanna listen to the entire soundtrack. but enough about music. the game is worth your time, just not as good as the others.. I love the gameplay, story, characters, and the humor of this fun game. Mario and Luigi is truly fantastic. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario and Luigi: Partners in time is without a doubt one of the greatest games on the DS and if you haven’t picked it up yet, you are missing out, it has fantastic controls and pacing and playing as the baby’s are a ton of fun, the puzzles are a great mix of repetitive and new and the final boss kept me on the edge of my sit the whole way though. The length of the game is perfect and it’s got a great sense of humour. Overall if you haven’t played it before you owe yourself.... I simply do not understand the hate for this game. I love it. Being my second favorite of the Mario and Luigi series, it definitely has a lot. The music is phenomenal, especially considering it's a DS game. The story is hands down the darkest of any Mario game, and actually had me trying to guess what to happen next. While the whole time travel thing is a BIT confusing, it still brought the babies, which are a great addition to both the combat system and puzzles. The biggest complaint I've heard is that Bros. items are consumables, but I found that easier to handle than the BP system personally. Overall, Partners in Time is a fantastic entry in the Mario and Luigi game series, with its own set of quirks and humor.. A fantastic game. By far one of my all-time-favorites. The look is so nice to look at and gives you nostalgic chills if you look at it every time. The story is excellent, in my opinion. The gameplay is pretty much alright. Near the end of the game it feels like there was a small lack of gameplay mechanics and new stuff overall, but that's something I can live with. The soundtrack is also really good, especially if you come closer to the ending of the game. The difficulty of the game is pretty good actually. Sometimes it's harder, sometimes it's too easy. Overall enjoyable. I prefer it that you can buy/find the special attacks. I personally really hated this whole ""BP-points""-stuff.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best game in the M&L series. It has the best musics, it has the best story, it has the best mechanics and it is overall a very fun game. Definitely try it out, trust me you won't regret it.. This game definitely has to be one of the most defining of my childhood. This game had just the right amount of challenge to where I didn't have to be so frustrated that I wanted to quit but also hard enough that I wasn't just breezing through the game. This game was so magical when it came out and I still enjoy going back and playing it to this day. Nothing matches the atmosphere, the music, the characters. It was all so original. I hope they one day remake this game just like they have done with the first of the mario and luigi series. The entire story of this game is so rich and original. This will definitely go down as one of the greatest games of all time for me. A fantastic game in the way of story, plot, soundtrack, and battle. This game is definitely worth your money. I'd rate it the 2nd best in the series, behind only Superstar Saga.. Unlike the first part of Mario and Luigi Series... the second game in my opinion is one of the best parts in the **** amazing DS **** soundtrack(especially the Final Battle's **** the story are really ****'s the first time I play a game of my favourite Game Developer (Nintendo) in which i have to defeat not **** **** **** a whole Ugly and Evil alien **** **** the game's finale is really unexpectable and surprising if u aren't spoiled and if u are playing it for first time.... This was by far the worst Mario and Luigi game. The pacing was horrid and they actually make you buy the bros attacks which is absolute bull **** they should've just stuck with BP or magic or whatever. And playing as just the babies is not fun. This is the second game of the original Mario & Luigi Trilogy. For me, all of them were perfect. But some users try to compare it to Paper Mario, even tough this series are a sequel for the original Mario RPG game for SNES, that's appreciable due to its combat system and the original story. Even tough it has continuity despite having a different story and characters. Anyways, this game is the perfect way to make an original story in a trilogy.. This game is amazing and I see the game's amazing story and amazing gameplay. The graphics are great and the music is amazing! This game is a little boring and is strange in the story but doesn't mean the game is bad!. Mario & Luigi Partners in Time's plot is one of a kind. The game has outstanding boss fights, the music is amazing, and a perfect mix of action some shocking moments (I won't mention one big one. Not going to mention it because it would be a spoiler), with light moments of comedy.. Excessively lengthy boss fights ruin what would otherwise be alright game. But although they were the biggest, the bosses aren't the only problem this game has. The game felt extremely linear, both with how they gave you field moves the at the beginning of every ""chapter"" the same exact way every time, and as well with how every single area of the game is in a completely different map only accessible through the hub world. Also the replacement of bros. moves with bros. items didn't work very well. But it also manages some good things as well. The dialog, both banter and otherwise, is, as you'd come to expect from it's predecessors, fairly well written. The story is pretty good albeit a little confusing at times. Other than that this game also lays some groundwork for the mechanics that made it's sequel great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a decent sequel in the Mario and Luigi series, but nowhere near as good as the other ones in the series. The story is weak, confusing and rushed. There aren't many interesting characters. The combat mechanics are clever, but some points in the game are extremely hard and packed with artificial difficulty. It's good for one playthrough, but doesn't have enough appeal for any more than that.. It's not really the best of them all, but it's still decent from the series. Just hang on to your baby self and hop on to the adventure of time. You'll have fun throughout the most of the time played on this game.. This is easily the best game in the Mario and Luigi franchise! The game play aspects are gripping, the switching between bros keeps it interesting and the puzzles make for a good challenge. The only flaw I could find would be the small flaws in the story line but overall a great game!!!. Battling in this game is ridiculously difficult and repetitive. Some of the areas and battles just drag on and on and on. Some enemies can take 50% of your health in one hit, spam over 5 attacks in one turn, and heal like crazy. I don't know why Nintendo decided to make this game so difficult and long. As for the overworld parts of the game, it's pretty fun. There are some interesting puzzles and neat moves the 4 characters can use to navigate around the world.. An improvement upon the first game and probably my favourite in the series although I haven't played dream team bros yet. However I feel like this series will never be worth a 9 or 10 unless dream team proves otherwise.. An amazing entry to the Mario & Luigi series. Its innovative new gameplay, dark plot, hilarious humor, good graphics, and amazing soundtrack makes it a must own experience for every DS owners.. It truly, truly pains me to write this review. I just cannot find it in myself to like this game. To begin, the game just drags on and on in each area and the game is very formulaic. Worst of all, I could not enjoy the combat system: maintaining control over four characters to pull off special attacks is a very frustrating chore. The special attacks have also replaced the Bros. Attacks from Superstar Saga, and each one is a repetitive, pointlessly tedious mini-game that eats up time and makes the battles drag as well as the areas. The game has nothing but padding and I just wanted it to end. Presentation-wise, the game is passable, but nothing impressive. The game's graphics barely pass a GBA title. As for the music, if you were to ask me what soundtrack belonged to what area, I would not be able to tell you. Thankfully, the game's story does have some funny moments: hearing Mario say ""babies"" cracks me up. Overall, though, the story or characters doesn't redeem this game (you know from the beginning everything will turn out well: where are the Shroob aliens present-day?!). As I said already, I hate that I do not like this game, seeing as how Superstar Saga is among my favorite games of all time. There's hardly anything to take away from this game. A poor sequel.. Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is the most beautiful and enjoyable game produced by Mario and Luigi franchise yet. It's graphics may not be totally ranked in the A-team but for its coherent story and interesting premise, it's a big winner for me. With great soundtracks and especially a stunning epic music at the ending of the game.. sorry to people who liked it, but this game was a pain to endure, it felt like a filler episode of a show, and there's soooo much padding. the plot is weak, the development of it is weak, and a lot of elements seem to have been thrown into it just to make it more complicated and pad it more. the ending comes rather abruptly, and a lot of plot threads lead nowhere, they are there just to keep you distracted longer. the battle system, while and evolution of the system from the first game, became confusing, you'll find yourself many times mistaking baby mario or luigi for their grown up counterparts in the battle sequences where you have a milisecond to guess which bro is falling. the enemies have no personality or motivation either. all in all, this is just a cheap sequel to get the franchise going, if you can, skip directly to bowser's inside story, there's no plot on this, you are not missing anything at all I'd bet this was co-developed by ghost developer TOSE. Meh... It's not as bad as Touch & Go, but is DEFINITELY not as good as it's successors. The one thing that makes it good is that it is SUPER difficult. Don't even get me started on Elder Princess Shroob.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is just as amazing as the first game, and adding two more characters, Baby Mario and Luigi, to the mix simply adds to the fun and endless possibilities. The story involves aliens, which I would have never seen in a Nintendo game ever. It has been a while since I last played the game and have forgotten most of the game mechanics, but the turn-base combat system is back and better than ever, with more ways to attack enemies with Bro Items. The humor still exists in the game, and the visuals are still gorgeous.. I absolutely loved Partners in Time when it first launched on the DS way back in late 2005. In creating such a hugely entertaining and deliciously whimsical series of turn-based RPG spin-off's, plucked directly from Super Mario Bros' universe of timeless tales and endearing characters, Nintendo pulled off a master stroke. And at the time, Partners in Time represented the very pinnacle of the Japanese firms seemingly endless creativity and knack of almost Disney-esque quality story telling. Even after all these years, it remains my favourite episode from Nintendo's much loved franchise of 'Mario & Luigi' soft-RPG's, beating the GBA original, Superstar Saga and third installment, Bowsers Inside Story (DS) in the process. But while pipping the excellent Superstar Saga and Bowsers Inside Story to the post is by no means a small feat, for me Partners in Time represents so much more than 'just' the standout title in Nintendo's three-episode franchise. Indeed, as far as I'm concerned, it's also one of the finest handheld games ever made! Period. A bonafide classic and shall doubtless be remembered in Nintendo folklore for generations to come. I wonder if we will be heaping similar praise on Mario & Luigi's fourth instalment, and franchise debut on Nintendo 3DS, Dream Team Bros, say eight to ten years from now? While I doubt it, we must concede that it's way too early to say. Well, for the time being at least. But of this we can be certain; if ever there was a developer armed with the passion, know-how, and above all, unbridled talent, necessary to create endearing, loveable, and genuinely special games that stand the test of time, it's Nintendo. Looking back, I sill adore Partners in Time every bit as much now as I did in back 2005. If not more. Looking forward, I have nothing but the highest hopes for the upcoming Dream Team Bros. Long live Mario & Luigi.. I like this series almost as much as I like Paper Mario, but this one was somewhat underwhelming. The whole time travel scenario is just for show, as the past is just an excuse to throw the babies in the mix. The various time portals are basically the equivalent of level portals, as they transport you to secluded areas which are basically dungeons. There is no open world and you can't explore anything other than the castle in the present, so really, the entire time travel aspect is severely underused. The gameplay is pretty fun as always, and gets challenging later on, but I feel like the 4 button gameplay is a bit convoluted. The battles do get repetitive in the long run. The RPG elements are very light but acceptable for this kind of game. The music is pretty good, has many remixed tunes from Super Mario 64, and some original ones, overall it's acceptable, but not too special. Sound effects are typical Mario stuff, with Mario and Luigi talking in their made up language, which is pretty funny. Overall, it's a fun game, but I don't see myself replaying it any time soon because of the seriously underwhelming setting, convoluted button combinations, and repetitive combat.. This is a really awesome RPG, with great story twists, fun, challenging, and innovative gameplay, good graphics, great music, you really cant go wrong with this game. This is one of marios absolute best RPG games, highly recommended to any DS owner. The game is rather short, but it is an amazing experience, that shouldnt be missed, but any means.. Mario it's a very talented man , showing in sports games, saving the princess a thousand of times , he also participates in countless of racing competition, also maintains his positive reputation against the show off Sonic and heck ! He even has his own RPG. Thats impressive for this mature man, anyway , Mario & Luigi Partners in Time it's a different take and also a very fresh entry on the already huge franchise . The game is overall interesting until the end, but after that start feeling empty and boring. While the take, wasn't that much of a full RPG side I'm pleased with many of the ideas taken from triple A franchise's and the story is great for awhile , however , everything is forgettable after beating the game.","Easily the most railroad, point A to point B RPG I've ever played . the game is also much shorter than any other Mario RPG, only taking around 15 hours to complete . the game's story is quite funny and the writing is still really solid ."
941.Beyond Good & Evil,"I believe this game is an experience. When I played for the first time, I was a kid, and I loved the game since then. Nowdays, I'm 18 years old, and I still loving the game, the concept, the atmosphere... This is a must play for me and for a lot of people who loves adventure games. Awsome. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is something poetic, something wonderful and fascinating, something difficult to explain in simple words. This is a unique work of art, a game that can touch your soul like no other. Let's start from the premise that I can say with confidence that yes! Beyond good & Evil is my absolute favourite video game without a shadow of a doubt. I consider this game as the most underrated game in game history. Because of the love I feel for this game, it is difficult for me to write a review trying to express all the immense qualities that this game contains. The soundtrack of this game are together with the atmosphere and setting the most wonderful thing in this game, in fact this work is composed in my opinion by the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game, a soundtrack composed by unique tracks able to convey unique and indelible emotions to the player. the setting is simply unique and unforgettable, it's almost a mixture between the world of fairy tales and the fantasy/futuristic one. The atmosphere of the game instead is of an absolute calm almost wanting to convey a sense of mystery, immensity, wonder, peace and contemplation. the gameplay is a hybrid that combines stages of combat, stealth and free roaming with the Hovercraft and the Beluga, the best part of the Gameplay in my opinion are the photos, in fact Jade (protagonist of the game) has the ability to take pictures of all creatures of the planet in exchange for compensation in-game. I must say that there is a lot to say I limited myself to a mini introduction of a work in my opinion massive. I hope the game will one day have the success it deserves, as it is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had.. Truly ahead of it's time. I still enjoy the game today. Well-written characters, an amazing story, fun and diverse gameplay that involved combat, photography, driving and a bunch of minigames. It had so much to offer. The world and the graphics are still beautiful today. I played this as a child and even 16 years later, I still love this to death.. No games from this era even comes close to this game. The well-planned and -constructed game gives you both old and new memories for old and new gamers. No reason to play something else, even in 2019. Graphics are of course beaten by now, but the story is what matters, especially in old games, which new games lack very much on. Ubisoft really made a complex story that many developers to this day cant achieve something similar to this game. Three words to describe the game: Story-driven, beautiful and intense. Looking forward to the long-awaited prequel!. if you do not like this game you probably have no soul it's super fun and so well made. The most underrated if not honestly rated game as the story, the gameplay, the design all make this top 10 if not top 5 game of the ps2 era. I first played it on the PC but couldn't get quite into it. But then replayed it on the PS2 and Gamecube and it was seriously one of the best gaming experience of my older days. Really great soundtrack (and that comes from a picky musician), awesome story, really smooth gameplay and enough variety between Vehicular Battles, Battles on Land, Stealth, Races, Puzzles, Minigames, etc. that you won't get bored. If you have 10 Bucks left and don't know what to do with it, get this game you won't regret it.. I can't believe why Beyond Good & Evil didn't get the attention it should've had when it was released. The story is amazing, it feels like a kid's cartoon show. A really good kids cartoon show. The music is breathtaking, and the graphics and gameplay are both solid. This game invoked my inner animal friend, as I went out of my way to find every last animal species in the game and photograph them. Without spoiling anything for you, I implore you try find a copy this game. You won't be disappointed.. This is one of my top 10 games of all time. Everyone should play it. Good mix of gameplay, and a great story. Here's hoping for a sequel. I also reviewed the PC version but had a lot of issues with it. It's not bad but I would definitely play it on console.. A game is not a bottle of wine, and with time it does not get better. Sometimes it takes only a year or two to say, that a game is not appropriate for this time. Having read many reviews about ""Beyond Good & Evil"" and having watched trailers for its sequel I was eager to play this classic. The version that I played was HD remake that was released in PSN for PS3. After playing for an hour I realized, that I had a feeling of my time being wasted, because I just could not get into the game. Don't get me wrong, I watched much videos and read discussions that claimed, that the fans of the original were happy with remake. But after playing dozens of games that were released for the last TEN years (yeah, that's how much time had passed since the game's release date) it is difficult to appreciate any aspect of the game. ""Beyond Good & Evil"" has good story, nice characters, various gameplay, but it is history now. History that I missed ten years ago and can't enjoy nowadays.. Probably one of the most underrated games of its generation. Truly a great classic that deserved more attention. Great visuals, fun gameplay and some genuinely unique characters. A game that was perhaps a bit ahead of its time.. I'm so sad that Beyond Good & Evil wasn't a success when it comes to poor marketing sales. It was the same fate as cult classics such as Psychonauts, Shenmue, MadWorld, and Okami. But when it comes to sci-fi video games, Michael Ancel, creator of the always popular Rayman franchise, set the bar high into a critical darling that every video game has its own side of the story. In Beyond Good & Evil, you get to play a heroic and lovable green-haied reporter named Jade as she and her sidekick, Pey'j are finding out the answers on who is responsible for attacking Hilly's and trying to governed the system for world domination. But now as a photographer, Jade must uncover the secrets and unlock the past as she must solve puzzles, battle countless DomZ, and even earn extra cool items. I think Jade is a phenomenal damsel in distress in Ubisoft's 25th Birthday, and she can do anything whether it's a fight to the finish (don't read this spoiler in the end of the game!) or helping citizens, no one can outmatch her athletic skills and incredible talent. I think Beyond Good & Evil should get a sequel and hopefully as soon as Sony has to make an announcement about the Playstation 4, maybe this is good time to receive a medal of honor for Mr. Ancel. Beyond Good & Evil, Perfect timing, incredible story with voice acting, and fantastic moments. It's one of those games you have to play if you still own a PS2.","""beyond good & evil"" is my absolute favourite video game without a shadow of a doubt . the game is a hybrid that combines stages of combat, stealth and free roaming . the best part of the Gameplay in my opinion are the photos of all creatures of the planet ."
942.Mortal Kombat (2011),"Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition marked the rediscovery of a saga that I hadn't played in years, and since then, it has been thriving. And I'm glad for that!. The story is one of the biggest middle fingers to the fanbase. They ruin the entire original timeline replacing the original story in a way that properly sets up into a **** new timeline. The new stuff they do is absolute garbage and fails to flesh out many characters and when they do, they manage to ruin them entirely. The character chapter system also applies a blatant power advantage for the heroes outside of ocassional cutscene fights. The gameplay is overall decent and has one of the better artstyles the series has seen.. I played most of mortal kombat games and this one always remains my favourite one. The art, the story, the roste, it was all perfect, also the tag team mode was just great, it's to sad that they don't include this mode anymore. The best NRS Mortal Kombat game. Cool DLC characters, good gameplay, not filled to the brim with unnecessary microtransactions, and not an awful story (just has some stupid moments).. A mighty and great game, and the story mode, despite the reservations on it, is distinctive, and the characters and machines, something beyond description, accuracy and mastery despite the lack of combos, and excellent professional map drawing, and it may be the best in fighting games as a whole!!.. Not really much to say other than it's a mortal kombat game. For one thing that can be said in the industry, this is way better than mortal kombat vs dc universe. This game fixed most of the stuff that was present in mortal kombat vs dc universe. I am glad they now show you how to do the fatalities. It is cool they have intros for characters and they have cool different skins for some fighters. Although I noticed some other issues: 1.Once again, there is no single player single fight mode, cmon I don’t want to do a whole ladder. 2. Also once again, you can’t choose what chapter to go on story mode. 3. Even if you are on very easy (which I did for shao kahn in story mode), the AI for Goro, Kintaro, and Shao Kahn will absolutely wreck you. 4. Also, why on earth aren’t they playable? 5. The dresses for the daughters of Shao Kahn are NOT for kids. This game is so fun and here are some fun facts of the game: -this is the first game by netherealm studios after the closure of midway games. -some of the assets and features were carried over to Injustice gods among us -this was the first mortal kombat game to support DLC -originally when the servers for the game shut dow, it was only affected for PS3 so online mode could still be accessed on the Xbox 360. -this game is more commonly known as mortal kombat 9. Note: the only reason im giving a review on the xbox 360 is because I played it through the Xbox One via backward compatibility.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the first Mortal Kombat game I've ever played. I think the gameplay is a bit too slow but it feels very satisfying at times. The story is interesting but nothing special, I like how they decided to reboot the series and make the story more consinstent. But the highlight of the game is the amount of violence and action it has to offer, with the fatalities being the cherry on top. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. I love all mortal kombat since i was little kid. My first game i play when it came out and don't get me stared with Movies. I have all the games and my all time favorite characters and actors is my #1 Liu Kang and #2 is kong lui , and last on is katana and reptile.. I've poured so many hours into this game. I played it a ton at one of my best friend's houses growing up.. As always best fighting simulator. I dont really care about any other IPs in the genre.. One of the best fighting games. With a grate fatalities and fights. 7 out of 10.. I didnt believed in succes of this title. But it is as good as MK2 was back in the days. I just love how good the gameplay is, how well the story is written and how they restarted the series. And I love the gore parts, graphics and everything else in this title. One of the best games ever is back!. Cool awesome and gruesome. I love gruesome and FATALITIES. So, best on in the franchise so far I love it awesome cool its beutiful graphics are awesome love **** was worth it.I play it all day and relax get challenging and train etc. One of the best fighting games in the world.. This game is **** BAD, the graphics are like the new release of ps1 and they can't match their last game which was **** too. All those cottonfarmers that made this ****ty game can just go die in hell, or go work at assassin's creed unity. Go play Dragonball: Xenoverse instead, so much cuuler.. This game is a good reboot for the mortal kombat franchise and in my opinion one of the best games in the series. It has great local and online multiplayer, a decent story mode and plenty of fun modes. I love this game and can't wait for MkX. As someone who loves fighting games this was the first one that i played and i fell in love with it the combos are great,the characters are awsome and online mode is ğerfect.. they have taken mortal combat back to their roots with this game and boy is it great. one of my favorite fighting games of all time. The fatalaties are awesome, the characters have there own unique style that doesn't feel copied from any other fighter, and the story is actually pretty good and true to the source material. I still play this game every once in a while after already putting like 80 hours into the game. this is the game that the franchise needed.. Mortal Kombat is the best game I' ve ever played. From the beginning, MK had a nice gameplay i loved, but now it's something more than that. With HD graphics and classic 2d gameplay, the game can make you see the majesty of fighting. If you haven't played any other games like this in the past, then this game is for you with it's very friendly gameplay, impressive moves and fatalities.. Blood, Gore and Fatalities that is how all people think about Mortal Kombat series. Good, this is trademark of the game, but last parts from the series generally understated positive memories about the game. Too much characters, intricate plot changed game intro Bold and the Beautiful with some blood. Till 2011 Moral Kombat is one of the best fightning games in gaming history. You will never find game like this fightning, game modes, graphics and characters are so perfectly designed and mixed together, that you just want to play it for long hours! Firstly characters. There are up 25 fighters, but none of them are new. You will see old characteristic faces. All of them were that beautifully redesigned from clothes to the moves, so you wont find your favourite you want to play as all Kombatants. Secondly, game modes. Besides standard Arcade and Versus with some nice diversities like Test Your Luck, you will also find amazing Story Mode, which gives you emotions to Hollywood blockbuster measure. Finally fighning. Modern games offer you thousand hit combos which does not give you much emotions just click the combination and then you will see the fireworks. In Mortal Kombat 5 hit combo is long shot. There are many moves but you feel all hits done to your character. And of course FATALITIES!!! After beating fight, there's no way that you would leave your opponent. Everytime, you want to rip his head of or make his arms clap outside the body and now this is mixed with grudgesome X-ray combos. Sadistically Delicious. Assuming, there is no way that you could not play this game. For new players it's a perfect occasion to meet one of most legendary video game series ever. For old confirmed Kombatants it's a beautiful memories set. So FINISH IT and goddamn play this game!. This is probably my favorite fighter of all time. Amazing gameplay and a lot of stuff to do. You have the challenge tower which offers missions to do and there's 300 of them so you're gonna be doing that for a while, and a nice campaign. You can just fight people in Ladder Kombat and is ever so satisfying. The fatalities and X-rays are all good and a few of them make me cringe. If you can get into a decent lobby, online is fun but you need to practice if you wanna stand up to some of the other Kombatants. The only problem I have is you can't just simply go into a 1v1 with the computer unless you're in training mode and you can't die there. Though it's a minor thing, it would've been nice to have the option. Other than that, there were a lot of over powered characters, but this game deserves all the praise it gets.. Mortal Kombat 9 is awesome. Not only is it a great Mortal Kombat game, it's a great fighting game period. It's extremely rare for a fighting game to have an interesting storyline in its single player, considering fighting games have always been more focused on the fighting, rather than the story. But Mortal Kombat 9 is an exception. This game is basically a nostalgic blast from the past with modern day graphics. The story/plot of Mortal Kombat 9 is a retelling of Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3. Having been an MK fan since forever, I was very satisfied with MK9 overall. The only gripe I have is actually a fairly odd one. I am well aware that the MK franchise is mainly known for it's blood and gore, and I will admit, it's one of the many reasons I love the franchise. But, this game seems to get carried away with it. Yes, I said it, for a Mortal Kombat game, it is bloodier then it really needs to be. Usually when I play a Mortal Kombat game and perform a nasty fatality it is simply badass. But with this game, some if not most of the overly done gory fatalities were not very awesome or rad, they were, for lack of a better word, disgusting. That being said, the game overall is an epic and much needed installment in a franchise that has been releasing increasingly poor installments after MK trilogy. If you're a long time Mortal Kombat fan like me, this game is most definitely for you.. As a massive Mortal Kombat fan, and former MK 2 & 3 state champion in the 90s, I have to say that this is a reboot worthy of the Mortal Kombat name. Just a shame they didn't push the envelope a little further and make a few more tweaks to old characters. Hopefully they continue the series along the lines of what they did here, but perhaps this time lose the cheesy one liners and bad puns. Overall: MK is still my favorite fighter series and thank you NetherRealm Studios for bringing fresh life into the MK universe. I really do hope they bring back Nitara & Tanya in the next game.. The best mortal kombat game ever. I made my friends mad in that game and Johnny Cage was so sick to use so pretty much i made my friends quit that game =). If it aint broken don't fix it... Exactly! While the gameplay remains pretty much the same as the older the games, the added violent x ray attacks make it even so much more fun. Based on how i feel, Mortal Kombat isn't 'perfect', but still back to the roots and better than ever for both story and gameplay department!. A triumphant return, I loved the games, specially the fatalities, I missed it since Mortal Kombat 3. Highly recommended. I can't wait for the sequel, the next will the big next thing.. Very poor fighting game. It is much to noob-friendly, and the small amount of combos make this a very poor game, not to mention the boring, personality-less character roster. Only play this if you are a MK fan.. This is the best Mortal Kombat made. The story is pretty good for a fighting game and the gameplay is great. The characters are all unique and fun to play as. There is a load of content and it is probably one of the best fighting games out there.. The game is great and has a strong story. I think this mortal kombat game is the best out of all of them. Cool and worth playing! But although the game at points can get impossible but that the challenge that true TRUE gamers really want.. This game looks good and is amazingly stimulating and fun. The characters have been reworked nicely and feature interesting balance aspects; the levels are also very nice looking. The one crippling feature of this game is the Xbox controller. At higher difficulties trying to perform at the same speed of the ai is nearly impossible because the controller constantly misunderstands what you are trying to do and is uncomfortable. The controls are as old as the super nintendo and that pad on the xbox is just in a horrid spot. I can't even play the game with a stick, it feels just wrong.. Mortal Kombat is a nice videogame saga (for me). But this game really surprised me: good stroy, good gameplay, awesome fatalies (and babalities) and a lot of new mode.. The game's awesome. Its the old school MK. There are some brutal fatalities, and a mixture of the classic moves from original MK. There are in fact hidden characters. The DLC allows Freddy Kreuger. And PS3 exclusive is Kratos from GoW. You also unlock Cyber Sub-Zero in the later chapters. Shao Kahn after beating the game. And there is XBL and PSN multiplayer match. They hid the difficulty options in the options menu so take a look before you start story mode on the default difficulty. Anyway, blows MK vs DCU outta' the water.. I really like this game because it goes the extra mile to deliver an exceptional Story Mode that ties together all of the characters. The cut-scenes in the game provide some back story to the characters and shows how each character plays differently from one another. It certainly isn't the best Story Mode I've ever played, but it definitely is worth taking a look at. The only gripe I have about this game is how broken the final characters are in the single player Arcade Mode. The characters are so powerful that they really feel broken and it takes the fun out of the game. Even on beginner mode I was having a hard time with the boss battles. This game has a ton of modes to choose from. You've got story mode, arcade mode which includes 1v1, 2v2, Test Your Might, Strike, Luck, and Sight. There is also a challenge room which has over 300+ challenges to complete, and some of them are incredibly hard to complete. There are a ton of unlockables in this game too. There are a few hundred items to unlock which include character art, fatalities, alternate costumes, and more. There are so many unlockables that there is always a incentive to keep playing. The online modes are really fun. There are 1v1, 2v2, and King of the Hill modes. I've met some really good people online and some really bad ones. There is a lot of trash talking too so be aware of that. Also, for some reason I didn't need to buy a online pass to play online. Overall this game is great but it is a shame the arcade mode is lacking. It does stay true to the traditional Mortal Kombat experience, but in this day and age it is really hard to play it when other fighting games don't have such cheap bosses.. Take this into consideration, I don't really like fighting games. They don't mentally stimulate me, and they don't fit into my nature. They are fun with friends at an arcade and that's where it ends. Short bursts, I invest time, and I find them depressing. Because my nature hates competition, and a lack of narrative/purpose. And that's why I like mortal kombat so much. It's story mode is second to none. And while it's cheesy as hell, it's also the right kind of cheesy as hell. So that makes it might favorite fighting game of all time. However it still get's a 7/10 because I have to play a fighting game to GET the story mode. If you are a fighting game fan (in general without a bias towards a certain series) Raise the score by 2 or even 3 over what I have given it. It's the best playing version of mortal kombat, and has an incredible level of value compared it's significantly more bare boned competitors.. I thought it was pretty well done, but I'm surprised with all of the tens it's getting. I found the story to be pretty short, although there was a lot of content added through the tower. Graphics are really nicely done, and there's a lot of depth in the fighting mechanics. However, a lot of it is overly cheesy, some characters are extremely bad to the point of never using, and their online system does not work very well at all. It's a fun game that's well executed, but I don't think it was anywhere near perfect.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i like it overall but the story is really boring and the same and the challenge tower is fun for like 30 floors. the multiplayer on this game is solid but some people are just such **** about it for no real reason with their gay moves, but if u get a good game with straight people multiplayey really shines. Mortal Kombat has returned, just as original as the first! The game has barely changed, allowing fans to re-play their all time favourite fighting game from the 90's. New features have been added to enhance your experience. This game is fantastic, and definitely one of the best games of the year. Even if you are not a fan of fighting games, this one may change your mind. New multiplayer features have been introduced, and the story mode combines the stories from the first 3 games, but with a few changes. I recommend buying this game as soon as possible. Sales won't drop quickly!. The grand-master among fighters is back and it dosen't disappoint. It brings new elements to the game and remasters old ones. Its a compliation of all the greatest things MK ever had to offer in one suped up package. To start, the single player is fantastice. It's like acrade nostalgia of trying against all odds to beat Shao Khan at the top with plenty of Kombatants to choose and fight against you won't be left out. The co-op is a great expirence as long as your Kombat buddy isn't greedy in his time before tagging you in. Let's go in-depth a bit. To begin here I'll review the characters. Each Kombatant as they are called is well rendered, well designed and very fun to play as. No two characters are anything like the other though they may have some similar Kombos or special moves but the similiarity there is that they use the same combination. Other than that each character is completly unique and no doubt everyone that plays it will have their favorites picked in no time or already picked as fans of the old game will certainly love this. Next off, the gameplay. The gameplay is smooth and keeps close to the original. The Kombos are the same for many of the characters to give a sense of nostalgia to the older games whilst still adding new ones and more. The Co-Op is great and the Tag-Kombos encourage calling in your buddy to beat the opponent down before they even take control. Online multiplayer can be relentless because if your not skilled enough then they won't hesitate to beat your down and lounge in your blood. That can be the only misleading part about this game but what drives away from multiplayer can be made up in the Co-Op. The controls work well and are very responsive which dosent drive away from the game in a frustrating pit of lag. Next is graphics and design. This game runs the Unreal Engine and it uses everything it has to offer. The graphics are spectatular, the level design takes old maps and reinovates them in a beautiful fully rendered engine and world, and the character damage works very well keeping scars and tears from battle in the location they were recived. The animations are all smooth and I have yet to see any errors with them or the graphics. The art design of this fits what Mortal Kombat has always had, a dark edgy time where the fate of a realm lies in your bloodied hands. The Story mode is most likely the best ever put to a MK game and the art really helps it. The design and graphics create that brutal world where the only kind words you will hear are the sounds of your enemy's defeat. All in all this game is incredible and I more than highly reocomend it. To those who have ever enjoyed an MK game, your chariot awaits.. Its fun, it's great. the story mode is awesome, BUT! but they will throw some of the most **** unblanced fights at you (lui kang vs scorpion and quan chi)... and it will piss you off. other then that the game is near perfect. The fighting is fun, the kombos are easy to remebere, but hard to string toghter.. Better than the last.. 8. Good graphics, gameplay, and story mode. Lots of ways to adjust the battle to make unique combat. My biggest complaint so far is that the AI is overly block happy, and massive barrages of complicated attacks can be blocked by them with ease. I've been playing this game since it's came out, and I have attacks that still have yet to EVER hit anyone because the AI seems to have an autoblock when I use it, which has rendered one of the very few moves the character gets useless. My biggest complaints are the crappyness of modern day controllers that don't allow the game to be played as it should be and the stupid combos that allow someone to play air ball with you for half your health bar. The big reason, however that this isn't getting a ten is because it loses six points for not giving Xbox an exclusive like the playstation got. Edit: Freddy Krueger is totaly awesome and redeems some of the fail of no xbox exclusive character. In fact, it's what keeps it from having a ten.. One thing fixed from previous Mortal Kombat games is that the game is not so tight anymore. It runs smooth and fast like the original. They still have many fun characters and great sound effects. The story line is a little strange but I am glad it was done this way. It was like they rebooted the game. Started back from the beginning. Not only do you have the fun side games that people learned to like, you have the original tower back just like Mortal Kombat 1. So overall a pretty good fighting game compared to the ones they are making now a days.. Being a huge fan of the MK games since the original Mortal Kombat in 1992 I must say that this is really the best Mortal Kombat game since UMK 3 and arguably the best in the series. After a series of good yet disappointing titles we finally get a fantastic Mortal Kombat game. I also thought that most of fighting games this Gen were really bland and uninteresting and as huge fan of fighting games that was really heart breaking for me. But the Mortal Kombat 9 came out and made me realize why I am fan of fighting games in the first place. This game brings back all the classic and great characters from the franchise while ditching the new and somewhat uninteresting characters they also made the game 2D again and this was definitely a right move considering Mortal Kombat games did not seem to click perfectly with the 3D style Mortal Kombat 4 is a perfect example of that. This game also has tons of modes and unlockables for a fighting game that you could spend hours and hours without getting bored. There are modes like Arcade mode with a Single Ladder, Tag ladder and test your might, sight and luck challenges. Than there is a challenge tower with around 300 challenges with each of them being different and challenging in their own way. Ofcourse there is a offline versus mode and online multiplayer which is definitely fun as hell however it could get annoying because of spammers but the ranking matches still hold most of my interest and it is really awesome how you can see the your Avatar posing against the avatar of the player you are fighting online. And most importantly this game has a Story mode unlike most fighting games out there that are just aracade with barely any Story this game has an actual story mode which follows the events of the original MK games from 1 to 3 which really provides nostalgia to long time players like myself and the help the new fans get into the story and characters. The story while being mostly fantasy is really well written and interesting. The game also plays well is also very violent and gory, and fatalities are the best I have seen in a MK game in a long time and it is really pleasing to long time MK fans like myself. The game definitely has a learning curve to it but it is really easy to get used to the game's controls, characters and style for both casual and hardcore gamers, unlike games like Street Fighter 4 where it took a long time to adapt. The great thing is the combos are always listed in the start menu and they are really easy to understand and execute. The Crypt also returns in this game with a ton of unlockables. There are some points to be noted however the A.I tends to be cheap at times specially Shao Kahn in the story mode and I think Crypt could have used some unlockable characters and videos instead of so much concept art. And one more major complaint is not with the game but the 360 controller's awful directional makes it really hard to perform combos at times. That being said these problems barely hurt the experience at all and are nothing to what the rest of the game has to offer. As a huge and long time fan of the franchise I am proud to say that Mortal Kombat is a really great accomplishment on the part of Netherealm Studios. 9/10. This game is awesome. There's plenty to do and the essence of MK series, with blood, savage violence and 2D gameplay is back. The AI is not that good, and X-Ray could take less damage and be harder to do, but Mortal Kombat 9 is fantastic and a must buy for every fighting games fan.. Lots and lots of replay value; impressive graphics; varied online and offline multiplayer support; hilariously cheesy story mode; unlockable content keeps you coming back for more. MK's Challenge Tower is full of inventive, fun missions that really pad the amount of time you'll spend with the game. Relatively small and somewhat unbalanced roster; controls and fighting mechanics are somewhat stiff. Enemy A.I. can get incredibly cheap on boss battles and some random challenges.. Being a mortal kombat fan i decided to get it on launch and to much surprise it's awesome it takes mechanics from the old and updates them and i thought street fighter 4 was good i much prefer mortal kombat. I spent about a solid month on it which in terms of replay if brilliant since they had a story mode put in as well which was an excellent idea it gives you a brief what happened in the old MK games if your new to the series. X-rays made me watch in aw as bones **** and kidneys burst. What a great month it was thanks MK.. This is the Mortal Kombat game MK fans have been waiting for, for everyone else it is a highly polished technical fighter and a great introduction to the series for new comers. Fatalities are gloriously violent, each character feels unique in how they handle and also in their brilliant chracter designs. The story mode is a nice re-telling of the original first 3 games and for a game that often ends with one kombatant dead, the story mode does well not to include any ""Finish Him/Her"" mechanics, this means the player isn't killing every person they fight left right and center. The Challenge Tower and Krypt are great additions that pack out the game with lots of ""Kontent"" and add a real big insentive to replay over and over. It would have been nice to have a ""Konquest"" mode like in previous games, but this is only a small quibble and doesn't affect the game delivering a knock-out experience. A great purchase for ANYONE who likes fighting games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a great game fun combos, fun online and I personally enjoy the new tag team feature. The graphics look great for such a wide arrangement of places and maps. I love the characters such as scorpion, Jax, and Baraka. and finally its fun to play by yourself and with friends. Overall i love this game the only reason it gets a 9 is the fact it does get boring after awhile but that is only one flaw for such an amazing game.. It's really hard to recommend Mortal Kombat. It can be quite fun, but at the end of the day I want a fighting game with depth...MK9 has little depth. No cross-ups due to the block button. Mix-ups are minimal and basically regulated to what the horrendous ""dial-a-combo"" system lets you do. The ground game and wake-up game is terrible and limited. X-Ray attacks range from being well thought out to being absurd in priority with wonky hitboxes. Really, I could go further, but lets just say that if you are a serious fan of fighting games, you probably will not enjoy MK9. I'm sorry, but without a solid fighting engine and mechanics, I simply do not care how many thousands of hours of single player content exists in this game. Is it a step in the right direction? Absolutely. But perhaps it really only seems so due to the fact that the last good MK game came out like 15 years ago. Boon stated that MK9 would be a treat for the ""hardcore"" fighting game **** it's more like a muddled attempt at best.. I've never been one for fighting games. They just never seemed to hold my interest, but to be fair I didn't play that many. That said I can't seem to put this game aside. I'm absolutely in love! Sure there is a fair bit of cheesiness to the game but its all in good fun. Good fun is also what I would say to describe Mortal Kombat as an overall experience. Sure there's gratuitous gore and violence and cleavage, but hey, I'm totally down for that. Another huge plus is that it has been a long while since i've shared the same couch with friends to play a game and had a total blast! And I would be very wrong not to also mention the shear amount of content there is. A complete storyline, the challenge tower with 300 different scenarios, a different end clip for every single fighter on the arcade ladder once you beat Shao Khan (who is a giant dirty ****bird), and various other little bits of juicy fun. The downside is the unskippable story mode cutscenes. Its quite alright the first time but if you quit a story fight and come back you have to watch it again and that gets quite annoying. Speaking of annoying **** you Shao Khan! He is the worst boss ever. The only way to beat him is by being as cheap as possible and not having fun. I understand the need for a tough boss but...really? Anyway an important note is that you can change the story mode's difficulty in the options. Which you will need to do against Shao Khan unless you really want to spend all that time fighting him. And dying. Over and over and over again. What it all really comes down to is a superb game that is just so much fun; except for Shao Khan. I'd highly recommend this game as turdbird is only one bad element among a great many fantastic ones. PLAY IT!!!. Old school Mortal Kombat all over again, I loved this game as a child when I played it on SNES. Using unreal technology was a plus the game looks fantastic, its still hold many secrets and unlockables as other MK's. Its fast paced game play like always and takes a lot of practice and requires skill not just button mashing. It has a descent long story mode, featuring a range of challenges and a place to practice your fatalities. Its smooth clean game play all the way through.. I love this game! It takes me back to the days when I used to play it on the Arcade, and the graphics and gameplay are a sight to behold. I love the responsiveness of the game, and how it is not entirely combo related like MK: Deadly Alliance. I was never good at performing long combo strings, so it was refreshing to see this. I also enjoy the many game modes offered to keep the experience fresh. Pros: Graphics, gameplay, storyline, replay value Cons: cheesy voiceovers (however, the game itself seems to be a great example of hyperbole anyway). Best fighting game to play with someone at your house but not so good over the internet. The game has horrible lag for both the x box and ps3 system. I love how they used so many things from past games. Hidden battles are cool just all around good game.. Mortal Kombat is an amazingly gory intense fighting game! I am and forever will ","the story is one of the biggest middle fingers to the fanbase . the gameplay is overall decent and has one of the better artstyles the series has seen . the tag team mode was just great, it's to sad that they don't include this mode anymore ."
943.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"A very short but beautifully told story about two brothers on a quest to save their dad. The controls of this game aren't anything phenomenal but it's how it all ties together that make it a one of a kind experience that's definetely worth your time.. Story was meh and could have used dialogue. Gameplay was unique played it with my wife. Simple for a lot of people to pick up and play neat game just overhyped. I really don't see what others see in this and my wife feels the same way. There are way better coop experiences on offer.. Probably the most overrated game I've ever played. Non-existent gameplay, the game jumps, leans, crouches, etc. for you, you literally just give directions to the character and use a single button/lever. So lazy of the developer to not include real dialogue but to have them use an incredibly ugly made-up language that sounds like they're speech impaired. The only thing that really stood out for me is the graphics, which still hold up today and are very well optimized, the game can run on any potato and still look good.. Great game. You can tell it was made by a talented filmmaker, because the camera angles are brilliant. The graphics, models and animations still hold up. If you are interested in a chill, less action focused game, you should pick this up.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good co op or solo game the storyline is great and the view structures are great. Brothers was so well done. A beautiful scenery with good mechanics. You use the right thumb stick to move the one of the bothers and when you have to cross both brothers in certain puzzles, it runs very smooth.. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is such a beautiful and magical tapestry of story weaving. The minimalistic design told through imagery, ambiance and music come together to create a gem of an experience. Simply a masterpiece.. Many big budget titles could really learn a thing or two from indie games on the art of telling a story without the need for constant interruptions and cut scenes. One of the best examples of this in recent years is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons which tells a dark, yet moving, tale with a gut punch of an ending. Of course, a good story is pretty meaningless if the gameplay isn’t up to scratch, but Brothers delivers in this department too. The key to the gameplay is the unique control scheme that tasks the player with guiding both brothers at once using the two analogue sticks, as well as R1 and L1 for context sensitive actions. This has allowed the developers to create some brilliantly clever puzzle and gameplay sequences that simply wouldn’t otherwise be possible. Again, this is a fairly short experience but one that’ll stick with you long after the credits roll.. I downloaded this game a few months ago, when it was for free if you had a Xbox Live Gold account. I had heard of it, it seemed a interesting concept, so I played it for a while, enjoyed it's puzzles and gameplay, and simple story got me engaged, though after that session of playing I kind of forgot about it until today, now I finished, and I can say that i never expected such a story, a experience to come from such a simple and short game, it was amazing and surprising, leaving me really touched with the journey the Brothers went through, this game is definitely worth playing.. It's a short adventure/puzzle game about two brothers going out into the dangerous world and bringing back medicine for their sick father. It's fun and all, with frequent creative bits on display, but it's no more than a 7/10 until the last half hour. The ending is esecuted excellently, and in a game this short, that ought to boost its score a point. In short, play this game for its inventive gamwplay and its ending.. I can't tell how much I love this game. Controlling two brothers, figuring out puzzles and watching them helping animals and people. Really cute game. Those feelings... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brothers is one of my all time favorite games. Never have I felt more strongly connected to a game's protagonists; more deeply invested in their fortunes and the consequences of our shared actions; more engaged with the narrative of a video game. I think Brothers achieves a rare and delicate balancing of the feeling of self possession; of action and control that you get from a well crafted interactive experience, in concert with the sense of directed-ness, of being an onlooker swept up in someone else's experiences such as you might feel when reading a gripping book or watching an engaging film. This surely is the gold standard for a role-playing game and there are very few others out there that truly measure up I feel. I enjoyed it so much that after I'd finished I made my own brother play it and sat through watching him play, and then we played it through a third time to find the rest of the easter eggs which were all fantastic!. At first I though this would be a light hearted puzzle game based around the idea of controlling two characters at once, what I got was a touching and dark story of the importance of family cloaked by the theme of death. The game itself is fairly simplistic and short but the characters, story and context carry you through. 8/10. An emotional, fairy-tale story with haunting moments that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled. It might not take long for the credits to roll and it lacks replay value outside of getting all the achievements (an easy task), but it's worth picking up for the gorgeous world, emotional story, and unique gameplay. Controlling two characters can be a little awkward at times, but for the most part it's not a huge issue. The puzzles and platforming aren't difficult but are still fun. If you'r willing to put up with a slower pace than most games offer there are plenty of excellent things to behold in this game. It's one of the most memorable experiences I've had with a video game, as well as one of the most thought-provoking and genuinely mature. It's a game that knows how to involve gamers directly and make us feel. A huge achievement that most game just can't pull off.. Brothers is a short, but worthwhile experience. The first thing you'll notice is the different control mechanics. One never really gets use to them, and you'll be aware of how odd it is the entire play through. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing as it directly relates to the story. The mechanics are an interesting change of pace. The story is touching and interesting, although I was expecting something a little more after all the raving positive reviews I'd read and heard of this game. Strangely, many people reported this as the best game they'd ever played, which is just silly. It is, however, an excellent experience, though short (about 3 hours). I played it in one sitting and I think that's the best way to do it. I found the length appropriate and think if it had been much longer it would have taken away from the game. This is a unique game that should be experienced.. A beautiful, timeless, epic....... A shame that it was just too damn short. This game had many great ideas. Controls/game-play, graphic's, story. Unfortunately to put them into 3-4 hours of gaming doesn't do this game much justice. Conclusion was predictable, really saw that happening from prior rescue. Yet flawed, because rather then making the long way home, it wanted too wrap up quickly. Leaving empty on what could have been greater Wouldn't it have been better having more playtime, the ghost appearing more as a guide, the brothers themselves losing their way, possibly getting split up, open world, more quests.. I am confused how the owl griffon, but a spliced phoenix resurrected? I didn't like the basket ball either.... Cute, but ultimately a bit pointless. For all its arty cell shading and quirky dual controls there isn't really much here to speak of. The story is rather redundant and the opportunity to introduce any engaging puzzles is missed. The ultimate effect is somewhat similar to watching an arty manga film whilst twiddling your thumbs.. I really enjoyed this. I was more invested in the characters in this short game that spoke minimally in a language I didn't even understand than in any of the characters in the entire Fable series I just sunk 100+ hours into. It was beautiful, unique and enjoyable to play. I also want one of those owlcats.. This is what true video game story telling should be. Brothers uses an innovative gameplay mechanic to help the player coordinate cooperation and discovery between the two titular brothers. While others have complained that the mechanic is awkward, I felt that it helped reinforce the challenges of working together and solving problems from 2 different perspectives. Ultimately the game mechanic also helps develop a sense of bonding and loss between the main characters. A short, but sweet experience, but certainly worthy of your time.. A genuinely beautiful game that just takes your breath away many times. Great atmosphere, inventive control scheme (each thumbstick controls a brother), some amazing set piece moments, clever puzzles, touching music, decent graphics for an arcade title and it is incredibly emotional at times. The story is simple but it hits home. We need more titles like this one. Starbreeze and Josef Fares, congrats on creating a unique little gem and I hope you have more in the bag!. An enchanting fairy tale adventure with gorgeous scenery and effective storytelling without using a single line of intelligible dialogue. The dual-stick control scheme is clever, intuitive, and implemented to great effect for puzzle gameplay. Showcases how games can be used as an effective storytelling medium. Reminiscent of ICO. Definitely worth giving a shot.. I want to start out with saying I played this game from beginning to end. I was so upset at the ending that I created an account just to write this review. And it is a very good game so hear me out. When I heard of this game I thought I have to buy this. I started playing and I was very impressed. Some of the scenes are some of the best I've seen in a game. As far as game play it suits the game well. I think it should be easy to tell an epic story. If you say this game has puzzles then you must consider matching shapes in the correct holes a puzzle game. But still, I think the game play suits this game very well. The sound is fantastic, story leading up to the end is fantastic, visuals are absolutely amazing and only get better the further you travel through this game. But that brings me to why I would still give it a poor review the ending. I can't say exactly why I couldn't stand it without spoiling it. I'm sure I'm in the minority here so chances are if you like what you hear so far you will love the ending. If that's the case, disregard my review and buy the game now. After this point is possibly very mild spoiler. So here it goes. To me the ending is much like ones in popular Chinese movies. Tell a great story and leave you feeling defeated. But what I disliked the most about this ending is not only did it make me feel like I ultimately lost the game, it rubbed my nose in it to remind me. I know this sounds hard to believe but usually I like a story where things could turn out either good or bad and it isn't a cliché Cinderella story. It makes it feel more real. I even knew this game wouldn't end up all roses and was looking forward to it. This game left me staring at the screen saying to myself, what was the point of that. To me, you can't go full negative. Give me a major lesson or some silver lining or a word or two of wisdom so I can walk away with something. The ending was so bitter that the only positive thing that happens actually seems painful. Now I know some people enjoy misery and that's fine. Maybe I'm in left field and the true meaning of this game was lost on me. I just don't like walking away from a story with emptiness. Maybe that was the point. It is just my opinion that the ending didn't match the game well at all. Ultimately I have to say I'm didn't like the game. I know negative reviews are seldom helpful, but hopefully this helps some. Thank you for your time.. awesomeeeeee story!!! adventure games had always been my first priority. animation well done! left a mark deep inside my heart. 505 games developers thank you all. moving in the right direction waiting for a sequel :P. I think that this game is truly meaningful. I relate myself to Big brother and Little brother's relationship. It is the best story in a game I have played by far. Hope this will get the game more players. My ehole family almost cried at the ending.. Beautiful game. Those first two words are my review, as this game doesn't need any more. Sadly enough Meta Critic cannot understand that somethings are great enough to be summed up in just two words.. It's been a while since I've played a game as complete as this one. Not only it has a stunningly beautiful setting but the gameplay, story and emotional message are noteworthy.. One of the best titles of the year. I highly recommend it. Visuals are outstanding, story engaging and touching, it manages to be very deep without ever saying a single word. It's not for the kids, since it has some brutal stuff. Art design is one of the best I ever saw (frozen village and battlefield especially stand out). I wish there was more tames like that. The only downfall the game has it's kinda short. But maybe it's how it supposed to be. Lot's of things happen during this few hours. Check this game out, you will not be disappointed.. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt compelled to write one for this game. I just finished it. If you enjoyed Ico, Journey, Flower, Shadows of the Colossus, or any other game that fits this mold of introspective, yet satisfying adventure/puzzle fantasy games, you've got to check out Brothers. It is an adventure game following two brothers on a quest to heal their sickly father in a fantastical setting with the tracings of Nordic mythology. It really is stunning. Small control kinks were not even worth considering in my score, they were so minor and did not distract from the otherwise well executed design and art style. I tend to judge a game based on if accomplishes what the developers set out to do, and Brother seems to have done that in spades. The only complaint I think that could be fairly lodged at it is the fairly short playtime (I beat it in about 3 hours in two sittings) for the price. But, if you're like me, that's really not a concern when the game reaches such lofty emotional and game play heights. Check it out.. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a beautifully crafted game from its design to the music and everything in between. If you haven't tried it try playing it with a friend sharing one controller. The experience I got from that kind of playing was really intense and enjoyable. I could go on with lots of exclamations of how this was a fresh and moving contribution to the gaming world, but nothing I say would justify it so I'd just like to say Play it! The only minor setback was that it could have been a bit longer for an overall bigger experience. This is very minor since the game as a whole will leave you with more than wonder and satisfaction. Again I'd like to say Play it, and be ready for a ride!. Different in a good way: great aesthetics, innovative controls, a both cosy and scary feeling of fairytale far away from Hollywood. Simply a great game!. This game really tugged on my emotional strings, very sad story... with some happy moments as well. Don't read up on the game or just watch a ""Let's play""... you will miss out an a lot of why the emotional impact is so high.. Amazing game. Unique control scheme gives this an edge over must other puzzlers. The relationship between the brothers (and with the player) is established so well that I worry about them when the game isn't even on. I'm about 80% finished and can't wait to get to the end. Outstanding on every level.. Innovatice mechanics, great artstyle, good graphics, amazing story. I don't give a 9 because it was a bit short and didn't recognize my controller. Other than that a definite recommendation.. This game is incredible!!!! The controls were a bit hard to get used to but it was totally worth it! Controlling multiple characters simultaneously makes for some great puzzles and I really appreciate developers who take risks and break rules! The level design was stunning and the story line was captivating. I couldn't stop playing! Buy this game it is totally worth it! Please make a sequel immediately!!!!!!!!!. An truly epic journey through a fantasy world with some simple but cleverly designed puzzles scattered around some magical locations. A unique control method where you control 2 characters simultaneously. Amazing variety of locations and you just never know what you're going to come across next. Just as you think you might take a break, something charming happens that puts a smile on your face and you just want to keep playing. Your heart strings may get pulled on before the end.. No dialogue with a lot to say. Brothers is a single player co-op game which sounds strange but as soon as you play this game you will totally understand. This game would have to be one of the most fantastic games of 2013. It's a short game of about three hours, but it achieves more in that time than other weak titles do in three or four times that length. Brothers tells a gripping story about two brothers heading out on an adventure in order to find a special medicine for their father that has mysteriously fallen ill. During this time you will see some really amazing things but not for shear action packed amazing, but more of an epic sense of awe. Now, this game has some puzzles in it and they are definitely not going to make you think too hard, but that's not where this game gets it's charm. The real innovation to Brothers is the single player co-op that I mentioned above. The controls of this game is like no other game I have ever played. Using one control pad, you control the older of the two brothers with the left analogue stick, and the younger with the right analogue stick simultaneously. On top of the direction, you also use the respective triggers as an action button depending on where you're brother is standing. This feature does not only make the game tricky to control, it makes it a fresh and welcome approach to controlling a game. Some parts will test your brains ability to press the right buttons at the right times and sometimes it will be so instinctual, you wonder why this sort of thing hasn't existed up until now. Graphically, it's no Skyrim, but, the art style that Starbreeze studios have gone for is simply stunning. I played Brothers on my PC and I have never witnessed a game that ran so well. The frame rates were steady and they images were smooth and impressive. Easily, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons gets a 10 out of 10 from me. I have nothing to complain about and nothing more to ask from this game. Put simply, I have never played anything else similar to this before, and I will be sold bold in saying neither have you. If you are wondering if the $15 price point is worth it, my advice would be absolutely. For a small scale release, I think I would be safe in making this my game of the year for its category. ""Brothers, the game that makes Journey a waste of time"" LewkOne (Aussie Gamers). In the few hours it takes to complete, it manages to tell you a really heartbreaking story, without saying a word. A beautiful game, that left me emotional from start to finish.. Simply put, one of the best stories I've experienced in a video game. Beautiful music, pretty visuals, and interesting/unique gameplay made Brothers an absolute delight. A definite must-play.. Brothers does right what others do wrong. It takes you from one beautiful playground, from one unique experience to the next, where other games insert hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay. It's not too long, where other games tire the player and remain unfinished. It awards you achievements for optional actions, not those you have to undertake anyway. It doesn't build the story upon boring dialogue, where other games tell what they should show. At the end, Brothers communicates meaning through its controls. A truly fantastic game!. I don't care about the controls. Any game that takes me on such an emotional journey is worth both my time, money and adoration. Last time I was this touched after a game was Passage.. I did not have any expectation for Brothers. This is a must have game.....Touching story and new gameplay all the time. But the best thing was the ending. Thank you starbreeze.. please do more games like this please.. A beautiful unexpected journey that introduced me to two brothers. They need each other to complete puzzles. In order to save their father they must depend on each other. A game has never pulled me in this well with the story. Woulda went 10 but I wanted one hour of game play.. Anybody who is marking this game down most probably has not finished it or just wants to balance out the score. It is an incredible STORY, cliché but emotional and unique to video game. It felt more like a movie. As for the game play my only problem is the confusion in controlling the two brothers with two sticks but by the end of the game you realize why. The art worlds are amazing it captivates you, the puzzles intrigue you but never frustrate you. The beauty may be in its simplicity, its not very challenging but that is a good thing in this case. 10/10.. No **** but i really like cryin first time in my life its was incredeplide . I have newer playd a game like this woooooow this was a really good expreaince. I'll make this clear: I have only cried twice due to a story. The fantastic Y:The Last Man comic and The Walking Dead Video Game. This game came very close and it didn't have a single understandable line of dialogue. This is a game that tricks you with a lighthearted art design but gets significantly darker every chapter.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It seems like game developers are really starting to get the hang of emotional content. My congratulations to Starbreeze, this game was a magnificent experience. I actually enjoyed the fact that is quite short. Any longer and the game mechanic may have worn thin. As it is, I was deeply satisfied on all fronts. Buy it, play it, you won't regret it.. 9.5 It's wonderfully surprising to play a game like Brothers. Where as the Xbox 360 has become the home of CoD and doritos/moutnain dew, Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons is the little indie darling of the year and a breath of fresh air for the Xbox 360. A playable fairytale, Brothers is as emotionally wrought as it is inspirational and heartwarming. Combing the depth of emotion with a core gameplay mechanic that reinforces the narrative and it's emotional highs and lows is unbelievably genius. Your journey, brought to life by smalltime studio StarBeeze, follows two brothers on an epic fantasy journey that challenges their relationship through perilous trials. A gorgeous score accompanies you on your epic journey composed by Gustaf Grefberg, equal parts chilling and heartwarming. Graphically, Brothers is middle of the road. But its art style, similar to games before it like last year's Journey, is top notch. A living Grimm's fairytale is the easiest way to describe it. The inventive gameplay and mechanics work and keep you very engaged in the action on screen. Controlling two characters at once is tricky, but getting the hang of it doesn't take long. Aside from a few presentation and technical shortcomings, Brothers truly is an emotionally charged experience. It's not as polished as I wish it was, but it didn't distract from the experience. The ending, themes within and visual metaphors throughout your journey all combine to deliver something truly special. This little indie wonder demands to be played. In a little over 4 hours and with no spoken dialogue, the adventure ends and the credits roll. You may think Brothers is a shallow and overpriced adventure. If you believe that in the end, then you're dead inside.. Even before it's magical moment, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is remarkably complex and nuanced game despite it's simple (yet occasionally unwieldy) control scheme. However, after the moment, Brothers cements itself as easily one of the greatest examples of story/gameplay combining to create a ridiculously powerful moment. In one word: Perfect. In this day and age, away from the all the actioners and such, there comes a time when I crave something a bit more in a game. Aside from endless action, and combos, and killcounts, there is a market for titles that give something more games that offer substance, delightful moments that tantalise the senses and mind, as well as the trigger finger, and overall give something way more than the sum of their parts. If you go to the PS3 market, PSN, it is chock-full of these titles (two masterpieces, The Unfinished Swan and Journey, were released last year heck, and ICO is on a deal constantly!) but not the 360 that much (we have Limbo, and Braid). This however, has now changed, with Brothers. It's a third-person arcade adventure with a unique 'gimmick' of you being able to control brothers by the sticks and triggers its tricky and quirky at times, but you will get used to it. The graphics are largely beautiful, stylised in a simple way, yet detailed enough and given a 'look' throughout that compliments the whole game, and also gives the simplicity of understanding the puzzles what it needs. The sound is just awesome, with some beautiful music, wonderfully dramatic and eerie incidental sounds going on, and the creature FX are just brilliant, and well thought-out too. The gameplay follows the same lines as ICO and Limbo, and Journey somewhat too, with the 'gimmick' set in place, yet that's as far as it goes the plot, the very downbeat feel to the game, and the somewhat movie-like 'moments' that crop-up are unexpected, and somewhat utterly brilliant they never fail to amuse, grab your attention, or simply pull you around, and surprize you. I really cannot give-away anything in this game, but it after one action-packed series of events, a slow-paced somber moment came-in, and yet the game did not lose its pace one iota. Coupled also with the 'feel' of the game, and emotional investment (you do expect this), its a well-done turn of events. Naturally, there are criticisms of course. You only have the one single-player campaign for your money, and when that is done, you can only repeat it. The controls can be awkward on occasion, and the camera can maybe betray you once in a while but these are minor criticisms that don't ruin the game at all, and as short as the campaign is, it is far far better than say, a game that will last you 40 hours, but only offers moderate entertainment for the most part, with only a handful of highspots. Brothers is severely brilliant, it gets better the more you play it, and if you don't even play the demo (which by the way gives you 20 minutes of the game) then you're missing out on a superb game. Well worth the £10 asking price.. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is perhaps the most memorable game you'll play for some time. The interesting and sometimes quirky dual-stick control for the individual brothers is a unique and fun approach that can take some getting used to, sure. But it's the winning combination of characters, music, environments, involuntary emotionally involvement and the art direction as a whole that separates this masterpiece from mediocrity. The landscapes are beautifully realised and varied, with context sensitive ""benches"" available in key locations to merely ""appreciate the view"" in most cases. I'd be proud of my work too ;) The musical score is superb and the dialog (for lack of a better word, as no written or real spoken words are ever used) conveys surprisingly ample emotion that when coupled with character animations is more than sufficient to continually propel the narrative forward. One thing that isn't entirely evident at first is the pervasive theme of death in this game. Approximately midway through you'll come across an area that has more than a couple of morbid puzzles to solve. I like my horror and action, don't get me wrong, but something about this zone was just.. eerie. Again, the quality musical score may be to blame here ;) I don't want to give anything at all away as this game simply has to be experienced in full. While the game itself can be finished in a few hours (a little over 3 myself) all of the achievements are for non-essential tasks which can quite easily be overlooked on your first play through. I put off reviewing this game until I'd completed it. Now, looking back, I'm struggling to find any reason to fault it!. Some fairy tales aren't meant for children and not all of them have happy endings. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one such tale. Brothers features a story of loss, adventure, love and eventually a coming of age story. Brothers manages to deliver a solid experience that is wrapped-up in an unfamiliar, but surprisingly good new gameplay mechanic. The story in Brothers is a somber one, filled with a ton of emotion. When the two boys father falls deathly ill they must set out on a wonder-filled journey taking them across a beautifully rendered fantasy world. You'll control the brothers as they travel from a mine inhabited by trolls all the way to a snow top village where you're chased by an invisible giant. Through all of this the two brothers must work together to overcome the environmental puzzles impeding them from their ultimate goal, recovering an item to save their father's life. Visit **** for the full review. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Short, but this game is a masterpiece. Something in this game reminds me Ico. Simply wonderfull, and it makes me realize that is simple to make an epic game with good ideas, and without a huge investment.. Wonderful, touching and beautiful, this game is not long, but certainly worth your time! It reminds me bit about fable, but is of course so much more than that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great game offers hours of game play. It reminds me in terms of atmosphere at ""Journey"". The controls are weird at first but you get used to everything. The graphics are fully sufficient for an indie game (Unreal Engine 3).. Just finished this and it's a must have game. It's fairly short, took me just under 4 hours to complete, but the experience is simply flawless. The game has some truely unique control mechanics and it tells a beautiful story. Visually it looks stunning and the soundtrack is amazing! There are some fantastic moments of joy and sadness in this tale.. This is something new. It's like playing Journey for the very first time. I wouldn't have thought that late this gen a game like this would come out. I say good job to the developers. Stop reading and buy this thing. The less you know the more likely you are to fully appreciate this strengths of this gorgeous, charismatic, refreshing and surprisingly touching piece of fairytelling.. A fantastic game with great gameplay and a touching story, comparable to adventures like Journey. Simply a must have for every gamer! Hopefully we get more games like this from Starbreeze in the future.. A really atmospheric game with cool graphics and a nice story. It was fun to play through. I really liked the emotional aspect of the game and it's not often a game touches you like this one did.. I would call this game whimsical if I could remember the last time a game 'whimsically' stomped on my emotions. It is without a doubt worth your money. Buy it.. I love this **** story is very touching and even the game play is good.I will give it a scor",a very short but beautifully told story about two brothers on a quest to save their dad . controls aren't phenomenal but how it all ties together makes it a one of a kind experience . Probably the most overrated game i've ever played .
944.SoulCalibur III,"An amazing upgrade in every way from SoulCalibur 2 except for the difficulty, this is the closest a PS2 game has ever felt to wanting quarters out of my pocket to continue onwards. The AI is ruthless.. ""Soul Calibur III"" is a very good PS2 exclusive. The game is very similar to its predecessors. But the combat is still great. Additions include three new fighters and a Create-a-Character mode. There are also two new single player campaigns; ""Chronicles of the Sword"" and ""Tales of Souls"". The former combines RTS with fighting matches, while the latter is a story based mode. It's worth mentioning that graphics have improved and game difficulty has increased. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.6 out of 10.. 3 oftentimes seems to be the forgotten SoulCalibur game, mostly due to following the iconic SC2, and preceding the game that featured Star Wars characters, but 3 has a strong argument for being one of the best games. It has its own unique story mode, the introduction of character creations, tons of side missions, tight controls, a great roster of characters, and arcade endings that you can affect with quick time events. The game is still a joy to play nearly 20 years later, and I would love to see a remaster of it.. I played this game SO much, even when i was in college many years after the release, i kept playing the game with my friends. So many memories.. Almost perfection, maybe some balance issues, and not having a good online player mode with great net coding. But single player experience is amazing. Lastly, it is kind of dated in the graphics, so if someone wanted to give it a 8 star. I wouldn't complain. But I really enjoyed it.. My favourite fighting game gets some new characters, a wealth of unlockable items, a character creation screen and a strategy game thrown in. Unfortunately those last two don't really work and the extras all feel like unnecessary window dressing rather than actual improvements. Still one of the best beat 'em ups out there, but not as much fun to play as Soulcalibur II.. ""SoulCalibur III"" for the PS2 may not carry the same weight its predecessors did, but it's still a great system exclusive. Series fans will should find it to be a worthy entry despite the lack of innovation. Just as in the previous entries, this game features fantastic fighters, amazing graphics, numerous modes and smooth controls. I would rate it with an 8.6 out of 10.. After all these years it's still the best fighting game for me. Even after close to 2 decades the gameplay and graphics still hold. This game doesn't age.. BryanM and Th3UniQu3, you both are trash. ''Ridiculous AI and terrible balance ruins this game down to the core. There is no redeeming this piece of trash with it's stupid psychic AI that will never fail to block EVERY SINGLE **** ATTACK you throw at it. 100%. It is programmed to **** you up.'' Th3UniQu3, it is not programmed to mess you up. You know what messes us up? Your comment. Quit hating this game, ****. ''If you own soul Calibur II then don't even bother. This game is just a rip off of both 1 and II. But if you do not then wait until it goes down in price.'' BryanM, this game is not a ripoff of both the past SC games. You look like a ripoff, moron. Like I said, you both are pathetic.. This is the game in the series for those whose biggest draw is the character creation. It has it's own system that works nicely for the series, tons of story content a crapload of characters. Just make sure to research how to avoid the devastating memory card bug.. One of my favorite games of all time, Loved it as a kid, Definitely the best soulcalibur game of all time, from soul edge to soulcalibur 6 has many features and unlockables, they have great decoration within the game, the only problem is that you cannot skip cutscenes, i know some determine your character's fate but the ones that do not, you should be able to skip. Chronicles was extremely irritating to play but you get great satisfaction once you have it completed. I hope they remaster this game some time, maybe even for the ps5.. The best soul calibur back in the days. My boy cervantes still looking sassy. All good.. It's fun but not nearly as good as Soulcalibur I & II also it's buggy and my save file keeps getting corrupted there's a reason it never got ported to other consoles.. Soul Calibur III is the best SC in the whole franchise. Its innovation, graphics, setting, story for each character, a ton of content for singleplayer mode really made this game stand out the most. I remember how many hours I've spent with this game, there wasn't one thing that let me know. A true sequel to Soul Calibur II. The number of characters, costumes, character creation with neat content to it, plenty of hidden characters with their OWN custom move set which for some reason people like to forget about. A shame. It's clear to me that Soul Calibur VI tried to go back to this era and return to its roots but nonetheless I wish they would faithfully remaster this game or bring it for every possible system with an HD support. That being said, this is the best fighting game for Offline content. And the fact that it didn't get the support it needed in its time, just shows how disgusting this overrated tournament community can be. A true shame. Soul Calibur IV and V were a downgrade compared to this. Positives: +Plenty of characters to pick from each with alternative costumes +Branching storyline for each character where you can make small but much-appreciated choices for increased immersion +Character Creation +Chornicles of the Sword where you create your own character and play a mini-strategy + fighting style game having its own story sets and characters. You level up, gather better weapons, unlock characters, currency in the game and much more in this neat game mode +Lots of game modes including Arcade, Survival and a couple of others where you fight over-powered bosses +Music is great +Stages are awesome and memorable minus a few ones +Voice acting is solid, the game can be played with English or Japanese Dub +Combat system is fluent, faster than its previous entry +Unique move sets yet basic/nerfed for character creation. While they can't really go up against the main characters it's a nice addition to the game in order to provide identity to the characters, immersion and offering new moves to the game making some fights be more generic rather than just the super moves of each main character. Completely dropped in future games sadly. +The Menu and the Opening of the game are the best ones in the entire series. Nothing like it anywhere else Negatives: - Some OP characters are not unlockable unless you use a cheat device. It's not relevant or important but it would be fun to have everything available - Chronicles of the Sword doesn't have too much replayability after the initial playthrough. Could've been improved upon in its difficulty. A great fighter for the PS2! This is how you do single player content in a fighting game. There is a whole separate story mode called ""Chronicles of the Sword"" that is unrelated the the Soul Calibur lore to play through, as well as the ""World Tournament"" mode, which is a personal favorite of mine. Character creation got it's debut in the series from this entry, and was groundbreaking at the time, you could invent your own fighter or make a loved character from another franchise as a fighter and take them against the CPU or your friends! The combat is fairly strong, and the expansive cast of characters and bonus characters has yet to be surpassed in the series. A great addition to the fighting game roster of the Playstation 2!. Is the best game of all SoulCalibur series. This game has a excellent history mode, the best of all saga, the form that choose the path based on our decisions, which affects who we face. And not only the main history, all single player mode is very amazing, the mode Chronicles Of the Sword is spectacular, this secondary story mode mixed a RPG and tactics game mechanics with a fighting combats classic of series. The same with a Quick Play an Missions Mode. Also the Character Creation is a something splendid, being a game of PS2. The game lacks a multiplayer mode, though for the time the game has release is not necessary. possibly for a remaster we can have multiplayer.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. It has good visuals for the time and the soundtrack is great, also the game is quite deep, but with such an unbalanced roster all of the pro's soon dwindle. This game is not for those who want a balanced and learn able game. This is for those who enjoy visuals (if PS2 graphics suffice now) and not going far in regards to learning to get better.. Simply the best Soulcalibur game ever made. An incredible improvement that often gets overlooked because ""it's not Soulcalibur II"", when SCIII is actually better in every way possible. From the graphics and graphic design, to the music, story, roster and content. If you ever had to choose between SCII and SCIII, don't you dare to choose SCII if what you want is a game packed with content and nothing but entertainment.. One of the best games in entire SC series! Have character creation have Tales of soul has Chronicles of the Sword and of the best character roster! Debut of cool characters like: Tira,Setsuka and Amy (as bonus character) 10/10. The BEST Soulcalibur out of all the series. It's sad that we will never get a remaster of this game. It has to be done. It's a perfect game. Everything that the original and the sequel gave us was fantastic but Namco and Project Soul were able to make it the magnum opus of the franchise until they made 4 and 5. The graphics were so realistic and sublime. The stages, motion capture demonstrations and fighters looked so amazing. The soundtrack is THE best out of all of the series. I love the soundtrack of the second game but this one was perfect. Forgotten Sanctuary, Courage Ablaze, Time Marches On and Catastrophe are so brilliant I still listen to the soundtrack to this day. The sound is outstanding and the voice acting was so awesome to hear. The gameplay is perfect. So many new modes added to the game gave it a LOT of longevity. The addition of classic characters such as Li Long, Hwang, Arthur and Rock was a brilliant idea. I never really got into the Chronicles of the Sword Mode or the Story Mode but wow the game **** me in so well. The customization mode was amazing and still holds up. It's a childhood classic. It has to be remastered.. There is actually not one single thing I can complain about this game... Maybe it should have more options about the difficulty, like easier ones for total noobs like me. But that is a minor thing.. I played the first SoulCalibur in my Dreamcast many years ago and then when I got PS2 I had to buy this game. This is a great game as well. Loved playing with Kilik!. Soulcalibur 3 has more flaws than Soulcalibur 2, but I love it just as much. This game introduced a new campaign and character editor which extended the replay value a lot for me as a kid. This game is a lot of fun and I can definitely recommend it.. Ridiculous AI and terrible balance ruins this game down to the core. There is no redeeming this piece of trash with it's stupid psychic AI that will never fail to block EVERY SINGLE **** ATTACK you throw at it. 100%. It is programmed to **** you up.. Now, I typically don't like fighting games, but I played the absolute **** out of this as a kid! It's got a great story mode, with each individual character having their own separate campaigns, it also had a sick character editor that I spent hours messing around in, and a range of other modes to play. I really miss this game.... The masterful Dreamcast classic and the multi-console sequel are the most memorable in the once valuable Soul franchise (IV and most certainly V are rather, um, underwhelming in comparison). But despite some minor bugs and PlayStation 2 exclusivity, Soulcalibur III can best be remembered as a promising transition, allowing the player newer characters, newer modes, and a subliminally stellar single player experience. Pros? The adjusted fighting system makes for a lot of depth; Create a Soul is an exceptionally excellent concept; variety of cool characters with unique fighting abilities; variety of content, creating for an unusual amount of replay value; beautiful graphics; excellent controls; excellent visuals, seeing as the stages almost have more going on than the fighting itself. Cons? Minor bugs; some of the content can be disappointing in spite of the developer's care for single player content; no online play, despite coming out in a time when online play was all the rage.. Overall, the game is just amazing to play. Before it's release, SCII was my favorite game, so it had alot to live up to in my eyes. Gameplay/Movesets: I guess I was a little annoyed my favorite character Ivy had lost some of her best moves, but most of them have been improved. The Alexandra sisters are still a little similar but on the whole, the rest of them are very varied and fun to use. Not too difficult to master either if you put your mind to it. Still, not as difficult as Tekken, and more asthetically pleasing. The different weapons each character has really allows for greater diversity than in most games. The fact even the custom characters you create have their own movesets as well makes it even more fun and long lasting. Length: Well, compared to most fighting games, this is packed. I guess its the Chronicles of the Sword that does it. It's basically got so much stuff in it, it's got the life of some RPG's, possibly longer. I play it every spare moment and I've had it for a month, still not unlocked everything. It's the kind of game its hard to stop playing, and one you will probably be playing for years. The varying story paths for each of the characters also keeps you going and going. Serious value for money! Graphics/Music: The graphics are so amazingly detailed and stunning. Playing other games straight after it will really let you apprieciate SCIII's quality. The stages you fight in are all very detailed, with smashing floors and walls, mice, fire and falling pictures. Really is beautiful, the characters look pretty danm good too. Much of the music is very well suited to each area and character, it just adds to the overall feel. Characters/Stories: Personally, I adore the stories and personalities of all the characters in this game. Some seem a little pointless, like Cassandra who is basically a helpless sister of one of the other characters. However, she is still very enjoyable to use. The alternative story endings you can get for your characters adds a dimension other games don't have. A great deal of choice and another level of information and interest for the player. The characters do vary quite a bit, ages and nationalities, even species (well there are monsters too...) All makes for an entertaining game! Modes: The soul arena, with the varying tasks is fun, but there really isn't enough. It was far more fun before. HOWEVER Chronicles of the sword kind of takes over from weapon master mode from SCII. This is the mode where you create your own characters and direct them through another seperate story from the main game. It's strategy crossed with fighting, I really enjoyed this mode more than I expected. It's really more about the battles than the strategy, which made it much less daunting. Creating the characters too is almost entertaining enough to buy the game. I know that seems a bit ott but they are SO customisable you can be tweaking your characters for ages! Then Tales of Souls. The basic story modes. With the interactive cut scenes and varying endings. It's probably my favorite game because of this alone, it really is diverse and fun to play again and again. These are just the main features. The amount of unlockable things and purchasable things is huge. It's really entertaining for a genre thats usually considered quite 2d, this is in the next dimension entirely. Really worth the money and outdoing all the competition a million to one. Truely a brilliant game.. It isn't perfect, but the many game modes and mechanics make it definitely recommendable. You can even customize your own characters! A great fighter that requires patience and strategy.. The best of the series so far: has great single player contents, massive longevity even without versus mode, and it adds at last the character creator, one of the best I've ever seen in a fighting game. It's hard in here to find flaws though and, in general, the main flaw is probably the absense of online feature, and to ""compensate that loss"" they made a lot of content for the single player instead. And we can only thank for that. Other flaws maybe are, actually, the chronicles of the sword campaign: it's not a bad addition but it feels like a rushed strategy mode, and so it can be a bit disappointing. The plot in the campaign also isn't anything special but it's decent and, again, it's more content for the single player and a good practice for you (some bosses takes a lot of time, as they are harsh to beat). There is also a GREAT arcade mode, where you also have paths to choose! Yes the ending often is the same, but the ways to go are many and it can always be different if you really want to. The creator also is vast and offers many combinations, and on top of that you can use both the official styles of the main characters AND original styles made for them specifically. They aren't as strong as the standard ones, but it gives variety and everything can be unlocked by buying them with (In-game) gold and playing the campaign mode (a good time where dlc weren't dominating us....). That's it, nothing else to say: this game alone is gonna last a lot of time and, unless you prefer or only like Tekken (like my pals back then), there's almost no reason to skip this game. Except if you don't like fighting games with weapons.. An incredible fighting game, with incredible features and incredible craft. But, some things are a MESS, like glitches including lost save files. Other than that, this a recommendation for a fighting game fan and a must have for a SoulCalibur fan!. It's technically the same game it was in 1999 and 2003, but that's not a bad thing. Pros: Beautiful graphics; excellent control; lots of characters and combos; lots of playable modes and unlockable content. Cons: Bugs; no online play; Chronicles of the Sword; menu screens take time to adjust to; lots of ""cheap ring-outs""; Character Creation is limited.. Even though it's the same game we've played in 2003, that's not technically a bad thing. Pros: Beautiful graphics; basic controls; variety of characters and combos; lots of unlockables and replay value. Cons: Single-player and multiplayer modes are limited; smaller arenas that result in cheap ""ring outs""; Chronicles of the Sword; main menus are difficult to adjust to at first; no online play.. It's far less breathtaking than its two predecessors, but Soulcalibur III is still a worthy fighting game. Pros: Beautiful graphics; excellent controls; variety of characters, weapons, and stages; loads of unlockable content. Cons: Limited character creation and single player modes; some of the stages are a tad bit small; Chronicles of the Sword; still no online play!","""SoulCalibur III"" is a very good PS2 exclusive . additions include three new fighters and a Create-a-Character mode . the game is very similar to its predecessors but the combat is still great ."
945.NCAA Football 11,"I picked up a copy of this for a dollar and want my money back! Many features are tied to EA servers that are no longer accessible (F U EA) so what you are left with is a game with fewer features than early PS2 NCAA football games. What still does work is a game where everything feels predetermined. The higher ranked team is given a landslide advantage, coach's challenges have never worked for anyone (even when replay shows without a doubt it was the wrong call), and recruiting is just a lot of unenjoyable busy work that does not seem to respond at all to how your season is going. EA has fooled people and/or bribed reviewers and/or broken them by being the only game in town- shameful.. I merely bought this game to complete my collection of NCAA games. Little did I know I would be getting one of my favorite NCAA games yet. It's a nice transition between NCAA 10 and NCAA 12. It features quality features from both eras of the franchise. Although a lot is unplayable now because EA decided to shutdown their servers, it is still a very enjoyable game.. This game delivered on every front. The game play is much improved over last year's version and NCAA continues to make huge strides since since its inception onto the XBOX 360 platform.. Its that time of the year again! What better way to compliment the coming of an exciting year in college football than with the greatest college football game to date? This game is one of the best sports games that i have had the chance to play! The presentation is on par with Maddens and the gameplay is as good if not better. The road to glory mode is fun and will keep you hooked long enough to play all four years of your players college career, and after your done with that player you can make a new one at a different position and the experience is refreshed. The dynasty is good too and will also keep you interested for quite some time, and recruiting is fun too! The online dynasty is awesome too. The gameplay is fun and, for the most part, accurate. But sometimes the AI will make really dumb on field decisions. NCAA 11 does a good job representing each school as well, and i like the different play styles of schools.This game is good for beginners and young ones also, with its one button mode and fun mascot mode. While this game does have a few minor on field flaws i would recommend it to any sports fan, it is well worth the asking price with its wealth of modes and replay value.. In my opinion (and just my opinion) both madden and NCAA r simply tuning out of ideas and i would think that fans would start loosing interest. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Witch is fine i mean as long as it sells who am i to complain. But each new year they're just going to be producing the same game over and over again witch is y i stoped buying football games a long time ago. Yet that being said, there are still football fans that love playing those games so i don't think they'll stop making the games any time soon.. I've been playing NCAA since 1999, (back on the original PlayStation) and I've seen the game have its ups and downs (more downs since coming to ""Next Gen Consoles"") but this is the first year that seems like everything has been improved. Don't get me wrong, not everything is better (hell, the Road to Glory is the exact same as last year) but this is the best so far in the series (as it should be, every year adding to what works and improving/cutting out what doesn't). The game play, as far as different styles for different schools, is excellent. The run blocking has improved a great deal, but it seems like they focused so much on it, they neglected the pass block. Also, the defenders knock down far too many passes, most of them being in a position that an athlete would pull a/several muscle/s attempting to get to the pass. But overall, this game is a lot of fun, even with its annoying bits. If you like college football, you'll like NCAA 11. pretty much same as always, but if you want to experience better gameplay and graphics then it's worth getting. better than madden but i still reccomend playing both. I found this to be a much better purchase than Madden '11. Gameplay is vastly superior, graphics are on keel with Madden, and it is an all around more enjoyable title. It did take a little while to get a firm grasp on the new play calling system (left/right instead of up/down), and i despise the fact that douchie **** Tim Tebow is on the cover, but it is a great game.","the game is a nice transition between NCAA 10 and NCAA 12 . the presentation is on par with Maddens and the gameplay is as good if not better . the online dynasty is awesome too, and recruiting is fun too ."
946.Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Fight for the Future,"Litterly peak. Peak graphics, peak artstyle, peak characters, peak lore, and peak music.. Easily of my favourite Street Fighter games (maybe even fighting games in general) of all time. The controls are snappy, characters memorable, and stages beautiful. The variety in movesets and playstyles guarantee you find a character you enjoy playing. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get into fighting games or is an avid player. And as the cherry on top you get to kill a frenchman.. ""Third Strike"" on the Xbox 360 is a good port. Online play is sturdy and the practice challenges, tutorials, display options and artwork are great. Initially, SF III was overlooked when it first released, but gained an audience over the years. It's the most technical game in the series. The parry mechanic is tough to master and the grading system is demanding. But fans should enjoy the challenge as well as the colorful roster. This entry features unique fighters that never appeared in the series again. Overall, this is a fantastic SF title. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. +Parries +Great art +Great music +Super fun fighting +Easy to learn, but near impossible to master +Best net code on any console game +Everybody playing is really cool and nice -Yun and Chun are really cheap. The GGPO netcode and online lobby system are great in this game. Other fighters should take note of what Third Strike Online Edition does right. I don't consider the defensive Third Strike gameplay to be on par with Super Turbo and SF4 Arcade Edition. It's okay. Just try to ignore some of the terrible generic rap music sewed into this game's presentation.. Having not played this game before I decided to purchase it as street fighter 2's online function is terrible. Having played through the arcade mode and multiple times online against much better street fighter players I really feel as though this one is one for the series fans only as opposed to newcomers who want an old school style beat - em up. The level of skill varies greatly online and there is no way to filter it so that you're matched with same level opponents, instead it's random and more often than not I'm paired with people who are 23 levels higher than I am :(. The actual fighting mechanics of the game are deep and the controls responsive, the parry system adds another level of depth but it will require tremendous amount of practice and time to master this game and the training mode etc do not really explain very well how to do certain moves and combos etc, and I only stumbled upon the parry (not knowing that it even existed in the game) training after hours of play. Overall I definitely think this game is not very welcoming to newcomers but if you put the time and effort in it could be rewarding, but it is a very difficult and frustrating game to master.. SF and fighting game fans altogether will surely appreciate the package Capcom has put into this. This game has spawned a whole new blood of fighters that may rival Daigo but probably just never got to join tournaments. despite being old, it still holds well even today. perhaps even better than some current fighters out there. problem is, despite being called Online Edition, there are tons of problems regarding online such as the matchmaking and ranking. Overall, this is only for the fighting game fans.. Maybe I'm getting old or I've remembered the game with rose tinted glasses, but this game just feels a little off to me. Seems a little faster than the original, and parrying is more a game of chance than skill. It however is still an epic legend that is simply one of the more in-depth SF ever made, but with no real tutorial this isn't noob friendly, in-fact if you have never played this before than I strongly urge you to think long and hard before buying it! Quality game though, just I feel not necessarily how I loved it before.. Very disappointing port: no matchmaking filters online, terrible matchmaking system overall (ranked is completely broke; player match lists are very slow to load and don't give an accurate picture of connection quality or of which characters are banned, etc), no dummy recording in training mode, no input display in training mode, you can't turn the crappy ""VP"" sidebars off, you can't switch back to the classic 3rd Strike menus, and the Youtube upload feature is a joke (240p, can't upload to individual accounts). And on top of that the game is absolutely FULL of bugs. I've encountered at least half a dozen significant bugs in the space of one week.. Ridiculous that this game is getting scored low here, what so the SF4 generation have never seen a 2d fighter before or something? oh dear...... fact is this is the most technical SF ever produced and doesn't rely on the simple button mashing that 4 does - this IS street fighter in its prime. The game takes skill to get something out of it, but the amazing detail, animation and added XBL content really helps you get stuck in. The port is very good overall and has replaced my DC version now, online is a bit hit or miss (when has it never been?) but GGPO does a reasonable job at keeping up but does have issues.. Arguably the best Street fighter ever made. Wonderfully varied characters with equally varied, yet viable, play styles. Great depth due to excellent mechanics and, of course, the possibility to raise your game even further by virtue of the double edged sword that is the parry system. An all time classic lovingly brought back with cool added extras such as Youtube uploading, challenges and a comprehensive training mode.","""Third Strike"" on the Xbox 360 is a good port. online play is sturdy and the practice challenges, tutorials, display options and artwork are great . this entry features unique fighters that never appeared in the series again ."
947.Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The MMORPG like real-time combat is a neat spin on things and encourages different strategical thinking. Characters are a bit dry for a game in this series, but the overarching plot about an evil empire encroaching on its neighbors is good stuff.. I would have given the original for PS2 a 7/10, but this remaster makes significant improvements to the gameplay and gets an 8/10 from me. Only the story and characters remain the same: a tad flawed. Worth playing by both fans and newcomers.. The Story, the battle system and the Characters are all great, except for two, Vaan and Penelo considerably drag down the rest of the cast. Vaan is quite possibly the worst protagonist in the FF franchise and Penelo really doesn't offer anything to the story or party besides being Vaan's childhood friend/love interest. Even with the original game I thought it would've been better had Reks been the protagonist instead of killing him off.. A masterpiece. I usually write long reviews but I think just saying that to my taste It's the best FF Story, Lore and Gameplay and the remaster for PS4/PS5, PC, Xbox, and Switch is doing the game real justice. The graphics and resolution is great, the freedom and free-roaming vibes are amazing, the music like in every FF game is remarkable and great and the story worth re watching on youtube I went and watched it as a movie in 4K and it was amazing, Love it almost as much as I like A song of Ice and Fire (aka Game of Thrones) and other memorable stories. I won't give spoilers but I'll just say that at first I loved the other characters but there's a time when the protagonist says he was running from himself and now become true to himself and I grew to love him as well, all the characters are very very cool and interesting, To sum it up: Story: 10/10 Graphics: 8.8/10 (and that's right after playing VII Rebirth) Characters: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Combat: 10/10 Free Roam: 10/10 The game is a 10/10 and the graphics are amazing they don't look next gen in the sense of what we are used to but the high resolution frame rate and colors still looks amazing I don't care.. Great game, now with new mechanics that really change your gameplay. You really need to think what equips/special moves you need, especially for end game, to build your party. And the 4x speed reeeally makes the grinding sessions a walk in the park, create a tournessol required at least a full day on ps2, now in a few hours you can farm the ingredients.. A perfect remaster for a perfect game! This game is already amazing and the gambit system is already one of the series best, but this somehow perfects it even more! <3. An excellent game. Characters are not all kids for once. The main character, is not the character you start the game with. Once you understand this and how the story plays out, the characters become a lot more endearing. this is not explicitly stated in the game. But once you play into it a ways, you will also realize this. The game has aged very well. Ivalice is a great background for FF games.. It’s everything I want from a final fantasy game. Zodiac Age makes some good quality of life improvements over the original.. I didn't like the combat system and the leveling system. The Ost is beautiful, but that is all.. For me FF12 feels like the game of the empty corridors and characters who don't care for each other, like really all interior levels are a set of soulless empty squares with enemies in it. The towns look great at the first glance, but then you realise that you cannot do anything there: no sidequests, no minigames, no puzzles to solve, no optional characters to obtain, thus loose all interest quickly. Same goes for open areas, they look promising first but really don't hold any secrets to uncover so exploration soon feels unrewarding. I really liked design of characters (except Penelo) but their stories are never to be discovered on a deep personal level (like in prior FFs with cleverly placed sidequests, intermission dialogues and personal interaction cutscenes that don't touch big main storyline), and so you cannot fully connect to them. Apart from that the whole plot is a political sci fi drama observed by your ""don't know what I'm doing here"" main protagonist Vaan. Idea that your hero is a random chap who got accidentally caught up in big political game is OK, but at some point he needed to get special purpose or attachment to more significant characters. I can easily see all royalty related characters waving goodbyes to Vaan and Penelo and the end of the game: ""Thank you for your service guys, it's highly unlikely We'll ever see each other again, bye!"" And yes, often story reminds you a Star Wars fan fiction. There will not be any love stories, challenging friendships, characters origins to be discovered, double agents, characters development and plot twists - yes, all these are cliches that will nevertheless thrill us for as long as storytelling exists. People and their destinies evoke emotions, not solely kingdoms fighting each other for power. Balthier and Fran's introduction (basically Han Solo and sexy Chewbaka) was pretty cool and I expected these two charming rogues-lovers to amuse me with their moraly ambiguos behavior and witty arguments for the rest of the game but that was it, couple of good scenes and basta. No random accounters was a big step forward in the genre, gets high five here. Fighting system is ok, gambits though not nessesary to use until you get deeper into the game are themselves no fun and really rob you of combat diversity, disencouraging you from using different abilities, support magic etc. That's the biggest dealbreaker - because of battle speed you're forced to build these boring gambits and then just watch how they are being executed in battle without your active participation. And of course as enemies change on your way you have to constantly optimize gambits - wich is so tiresome. I prefere to do my decisions on the spot, not thoroughly thinking in advance ""Ok what else would I do if...?"" Licence Board is confusing, it's easy to spend all your points for nothing good till you learn what it's for. Idea that in order to equip some advanced gear you need to get a permission in Licence Board first is irritating. Job System again does detaches you from characters, depriving them of unique characteristics that match theit backstory and personas. Job Synergy is unnessesary headache. And it's easy to constantly forget that chain attacks work only on killing enemies of one type. When FF12 first came out on PS2 I beat it and exhaled Oh Gosh finally it has ended, felt like a lot of work has been put in it and that deservse a big respect, but eventually I got unamusing and forgetable experience. But ever since I was bewildered cause everyone loves it so much and it got highest rankings from Metacritic and Famitsu. Massive respect to all FF12 fans though, maybe be one day I give it another shot and will discover the same joy you guys did, Cheers!. One of the best Final Fantasy. I love turn based FF. Good history, graphics, combat system. A true Final Fantasy game. If you liked to play the old ones, will love this game as well.. If you can, give it a try once its on sale. This is one of the best RPG to get into, even these days XII holds well. The battle system is very dynamic with and without the gambits active (i know, SHOCKING how people tend to criticize that ""the AI plays for you"" instead of just toggle the option OFF and play like a standard turn-based combat if you want to your choices to be precise as such). Lots of classes, weapons, armors, magicks and builds to make. The graphics on the ps2 versions was beautiful and pretty much the best you could get for that time; in the remaster its... fine, the art design in almost everything looks stunning, but what can hold you back if you are more into the modern ultra-realistic type of graphics its the character models, they look too animesque, but since i don't go for that, it doesn't bother me at all. The story, not get into spoilers, reads like if you ask for a star wars fan to recite the main conflicts in the original and prequel trilogy's to a fan-fic writer; it will be too serious for some people sometimes, and it won't get your attention unless you open up to endure the politics of the world. And its a big BIG world that seems so alive and interconnected in an amazing way that we don't see as much these days. Every enemy, every boss, heck, even non-hostile NPC's seems believable where they spawn live, with the weather conditions of the region, like when you visit an area that its completely dry, the mobs that will spawn there will be more desert type creatures that can live in those environment; if you come back later in the game to these same region when the rain season start, all the human npcs won't be there anymore and the enemies that you'll encounter will be stronger and amphibious-like creatures that can live in that conditions. And also if you spend more time inside those regions, the rain can get heavy, turning into a thunderstorm, and you will encounter something really bad.. I thought i won't like this one, but it turns out that i loved it ! Excellent Open World J-RPG. I recommend pick one up lot action and also song beautiful and excellent graphic and good day. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. Graphics are awesome, even better than the original, that were already amazing. That's probably the best part of the game. As for the rest, thos might be one of the most forgattable Final Fantasy games ever. Gambit system is completely flawed, altered status mechanics are unbalanced, specially virus effect, traps just don't work propperly, espers are not charismatic, the story starts promising to be one of the bests stories of all the franchise and then goes worse and worse... It's sad, I really wanted to remember how it was to play a classic Final Fantasy before the XVI releases... I should have tried the 10th.. The game is wonderful, its Gameplay is very fun and despite its history you entertain yourself very well. Geate game. Beautiful music, a lot of main and guest characters, and a big world to explore. I have spent 50 hours on this game and I enjoyed every second of it.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this eleventh game in the series. this collection is great.. Much more enjoyable with a guide. Without a guide, it can be very frustrating but with a guide it’s a 7,8 at the highest. Definitely far better than both 13 and 15 which were absolute garbage.. Tradução para português logo abaixo. This is the remaster to one of the amazing games ever made. To me, the best Final Fantasy. The combat mode é the perfect union between the homesick shift style and the ""modern"" active combat, whose can be still better with the Gambit systems. The 30 marks (quests) extend the gaming time in dozens of hours, which show itself as extremely funs. As the spers, which one with its own exclusive limitation on battle. It has a incredible story, as there's in every Final Fantasy Game. This is a game you'll want to get a platinum trophy, or how we used to say in PS2, complete the Sky Pirate's Den. Português: Esse é o remaster de um dos melhores jogos já feitos. Para mim, o melhor Final Fantasy. O modo de combate é a junção perfeita entre o saudoso estilo de turno e o ""moderno"" método de combate ativo, que pode ficar ainda melhor pelo sistema de Gambits. As marks (quests) aumentam o tempo de jogo deste título em dezenas de horas, que se mostram extremamente divertidas. Assim como os espers, cada um com sua limitação de batalha exclusiva. A história é incrível, como em todos os FF, e cada quest secundária é ""bem paga"" pelo seu desdobrar. Este é um jogo que com certeza vai te fazer querer platinar, ou como era no PS2, completar o Sky Pirate's Den.. Where to start...... main character Who the **** is the main character? is it vahn or that ewan mcgregor sounding guy. Who knows? the story is boring with politics and war which FFXIV did amazingly. I don't even know what the story is about because I fell asleep after the first hour. revenge plot? maybe? the combat is like an MMO that has been developed by the laziest gamer ever because you just push the action button once and everyone fights for you. SOOOOOOOOO BORING. didn't finish penelope is annoying. nuf said.. The game is okay for switch players. :) if you getting lost or something just walking around the map.. I played this game originally on a PS2 years ago. Didn't quite finish it, so I picked the Zodiac Age version up to tick the game off of my unfinished games list. This review is more of an overall review of FF XII, not the ""Zodiac Age"" part. Am a huge FF fan. The FF XII left me wanting more though... The story - a classic Final Fantasy, but the characters weren't really that interesting sadly - the main bloke, Vaan - I didnt really feel a connection to the character. You can obviously focus on playing anybody else as your go-to guy (or a girl) but for me, nobody really held much interest. I was also not a big Gambit & License system fan. It just seems like overcomplicating the mechanics - not making them harder, but making it a chore system that really doesn't need that much tinkering (Had to buy a bazillion gambits, just the vendor click-and-buy everything was such a chore on it's own) I did enjoy my time in the game once it got going though. I put roughly 45hours into the game - doing some random side questing and just exploring around. By the time I got to the end I was a bit too overpowered. I basically did all the end battles on a gambits ON auto battle. My team was Vaan 65; Basch 50 & Penelo 50. Felt really underwhelming, but can't blame the game for this - I think my gambits and team just ended up working perfectly. It's a solid game, but since the FF bar is pretty high, I felt it didn't deliver the great Final Fantasy experience I was after. Probably not gonna tackle the New Game+ in the future.. When does this game get good? Seriously? It boggles the mind that it has a huge following. Do people love the combat so much that they just forget the pathetically boring storyline? I've streamed over 60 hours of this game and people who love it keep going oh this bits boring, oh this bit ****, oh yeah this bits annoying, and its like what do you enjoy about the game? Seriously? I think I'm ready to give up despite probably not being anywhere near the end. Nice music now and again but do not recommend anyone to play, please play Final Fantasy 7 8 9 or 10 if you want to get into the series, and avoid this one at all cost.. Whilst no where near as good as the previous Final fantasy games from 4-10, there's still a really interesting world to explore and an interesting setting to go with it. The graphics are top quality and the gameplay also feels very smooth at times. However when it comes to story it's just average. It doesn't have the engagement or emotion of the previous titles, instead it's just a little too hard to understand and get into. The cast is also relatively weak compared to previous titles. I'm also not a huge fan of the combat. It gets tiring real fast and it doesn't feel right mechanically to me. It also doesn't require very much strategy, unlike the previous games. But the combat does flow well and I will give it that. So overall it's a somewhat decent game that is somewhat enjoyable. It's just not good enough by final fantasy standards.. As always, came here to restore the truth about the game. The score it got on metacritic from professional reviewers and users is way too high, ppl are clearly not obbjectiv about the quality of this game. Graphics : 10/10 For the game age, they are pretty solid. Nothing to complain about. The remaster is also great, i didn't encounter any bug or glitch. Framerates are smooth. Musics : 7/10 Good enough but you won't remember any of them. Fight System : 4/10 Totally bad, it's auto mode 95% of the time. If you don't run away any fights and if you set your gambits properly (the option to make your character behaving depending of what is happening), you won't need to touch your gamepad during fights, even against bosses... You don't need magics, you don't need eons (invocations), you don't need to use objects (most of the time). Well the game doesn't need you at all. There is no strategy involved... well, the worst fight system i saw in a J-RPG... Story : 5/10 Nothing impressive, it is a standard story that we have seen multiple times in video games, movies and books. It's just good enough to make you continue to play the game till the end. Characters : 4/10 Their design is good but there is almost no development for them. Psychologically, there is nothing. Also there is no connexion between them despite they are having an adventure together but still, they rarely talk together and it seems like there is no bond between them. Like a bunch of ppl forced to be together to save the world. Really really bad when you compare them to the previous Final Fantasy games. World : 7/10 Great world BUT places to visit are way too big without any reasons, just to increase the game lengh... Most of the time you will be wandering in the world being a spectator of automated fights. It's a chance that the game has an option to move x2 or x4 faster... I don't know how the players who had played it on PS2 did to accept to loose so much time doing nothing... Well, overall it's an average (+) game and a really bad Final Fantasy... Good enough to go through it but not good enough to come back or to consider it as a classic. If you have other games to play, play them, FFXII is not worth your time.. This game is one of my all time favourites. I was very excited when it became available on the PS4. I’ve been chasing the platinum trophy off and one and the amount of content after the story is completed is fantastic. I really enjoy the gambit and job system and felt it was the perfect way to be creative with combat. The story is great, but in my opinion it wasn’t as good as a couple of the other final fantasy games I’ve played.. Do you enjoy watching a good movie or playing a deep and immersive RPG? Yes? Don't play this game then. I never played the original 2006 FFXII game, but I have played around other 4 FF games (no MMOs) and many others RPGs and JRPGs and I can confidently say this is the worst thing I have laid my hands on from SE. Whereas the artwork and music (this one specially in the remaster, from what I have heard) is fantastic and distinct from previous FF titles, the positives ends there. Playing this game you can already feel the snowball effect that would make FFXIII the disaster that it was, mainly because of the boring story and completely forgettable, arbitrarily chosen and devoid of meaning names (places and characters) that make the boring political story hard to follow, specially when at various points the cutscenes consist of characters exposing plot points or other characters' actions rather than the game actually showing it to us. There's nothing attractive from the story-telling side, not even the protagonist, Vaan, or his interactions with the rest of the cast. The game has different prototypical characters that could interact with each other in many interesting ways, but the game is too afraid to make them talk to each other except when it comes to the soporific plot. Despite this, FFXV surprisingly ripped off half of its core plot concepts from this game, making a weird frankenstein from this game and the original concept of FFXIII Versus. As for the game itself, it can be described as a pointless grind. Yes, the game offers a fast-forward feature for you to skip any dragging moments you want, but that already points out the inherent flaw of the game: you don't play the game, the game plays itself. Except when you need something, then the grinding is on you. You have to spend too much time programming all of your characters' AI (no exceptions) for them to do simple things and then, when an enemy has a slight change in its attacks, like casting different de-buffs or absorbing an element, you have to pause the game mid-fight, change the Gambit system of your characters, and then resume watching. Adding to this, another big problem I have with the characters ""independence"" is that they move on their own once they're engaged in battle, even your leader, which makes them move around and sometimes go into a corner where the camera looks down and impedes you to see anything. This is the usual except, of course, when it comes to bosses: you may feel like you're grinding too much as you kill different basic enemies and they don't even damage you, but suddenly you'll face a boss that kills your entire party no matter the healing counter measures you apply to their AI, after which you'll be staring at the ""Select the new leader of the group"" or ""Your party has been wiped out, select the back up members to fight"" messages as you're left mouth opened and thinking you should just eject the disc and throw it out the window. What's more, when you eventually defeat a boss you are rewarded basically nothing whereas when you defeat a hunt objective (side missions' mini bosses) you are rewarded something, just not anything worth the time you put into going to the locations and defeating the special enemy. I have played a couple of the Souls series games and felt they were not difficult at all, and dying in them felt like a mild inconvenience and not like a time wasting scam. This game's unfair development of battles evokes in me a pure and unadulterated anger, as not only I am removed of any sense of agency one should be entitled to when playing a videogame, but the game also wants you to spend too much time grinding so that you can spend more time inside the menus unlocking things like what objects your characters can equip. If you haven't figured out why, the game actually wants you to do this as to avoid you realising you're not really doing anything except micro managing and grinding. This is, without a doubt, an unrewarding game. Usually JRPGs need you to invest a lot of time but the fun factor never disappears. Dragon Quest XI hooked me for 110 hours, and so did Persona 5 for other 100+ hours. And yes, they are newer games, but I also completed FF X-2 back in the day, a slightly older game than this one, and got the same fun out of it. I am sorry to all its lovers, but with FF XII, I have been unable to spend more than 2 or 3 hours playing it until I got mad or bored and had to stop playing it for a day or two. I usually play games to experience a good story, have a sense of accomplishment, complete challenges that force me to think or be skillful at the game, or for overall escapism. This game has given me none of that in the 20+ hours I dedicated to it. Instead, all I got was an uninteresting story, bland characters, a boring game loop and an unfair battle simulator. If you appreciate your time and like having fun, play any other FF game or any other game at all except this one.. A Masterful piece in the FF Universe, gripping history and fun mechanics!. The job sistem is my favorite part!. The curtain call for the Golden Age of Final Fantasy.Matsuno Yasumi's magical fantasy. Great remaster of PS2 game. I have always wanted to play Final Fantasy XII. After I played it on PS4, I fell in love with Princess Ashe. She was such a great character.. I never got a chance to play FF12 on PS2, so this is my first playthough on PS4. The remastered graphics look great for a PS2 game and it definitely has that look from that generations, which is not a bad thing. I enjoyed the story even though it could be hard to follow at times, only because the kings English everyone uses. The story made more since as i finished it and started a new game+ and watched the intro again, I think i was lost on who people were when i first watched the intro. I really enjoyed the characters and felt they grew close together through their adventure. I like the skill tree/licenses mechanic of unlocking new skills and having to unlock new licenses in order to equip better gear. The Gambit system made this game much faster to play as you can set what you want everyone in your party to focus on when attacking and not really have to do much since its all automated, which adds a different kind of strategy then im used to. I would really like to see square do a full on remake like they did with FF7 and integrate the battle mechanics they implemented in FF7R. The option to be able to set the game speed really made things better because with out that feature it would of been a slog, you move around like you have cement boots. I like the side hunts you can do, i dont like that i have to get the hunt from the board go find the patron who will give me the details, then go find the monster to hunt, then return to patron to receive my reward. way to much back n forth. All in all was worth playing at the 50 hours i put into the game i had a fun time.. One of the best FFs imo. Grown up story. Nice fighting and character development system. I really enjoyed playing again on PS4. Especially with the double speed option. Great game.. if you ignore Vaan and penelo this is one of best rpg s that came out ever. it has best job system in gaming, huge world to explore ,immersive story ... try you will not regret.. It is just beautiful, everything is just perfect, buy it. Also im playing it again for the 9th time.. Though I understand how massive and qualitative the game is, it turned out to be not an interesting one for me. Key factors of every RPG: battle system, the progression system, and the storyline of this game didn't hook me at all for reasons I've listed below. If I have to define this game in terms of one adjective, I will say: ""boring"". But, first, let's start with the things that I do like: Pros: - The world of this game feels diverse, rich, natural, and busy. Nicely delivered atmosphere. Feels somehow similar to world and atmosphere of star wars films, which is a good thing. Nice picture to look at. - Graphics is ok, though the fact that all main character faces look quite similar to each other, like they are all brothers and sisters. :) But, that's ok for the game which was developed 15 years ago. - The Gambit system for coding behavior of non-controllable characters seems very interesting, cool, and new. I like it, why I never met other games that offer such a wonderful opportunity? It's brilliant! - The soundtrack is great, though I haven't played so much time, about 10 hours or so. - You can speed up a game any time u want. Cons: - My main concern is the battle system. Most fights are boring. During them, u feeling like an observer rather than an active participant. The game plays itself :) This comes with a close connection with the progression system of melee characters, which has not any melee specific abilities, like ""Bravery"" from FF7 or smth. U cannot induce non-magic ""fighting"" abilities, u cannot jump, u cannot dodge... all you can do as a melee fighter is select a target and auto-attack, rarely use ultimates. Boring. - Character progression abilities lack fantasy. At first, they gave me an ability which allows me to wear a level 1 hat, then an ability which allows me to wear a level 2 hat, then an ability to wear level 3 hat...guess what happens ****, you guessed that right. Most of the progression abilities seem like they are **** out of the finger. Though mages and healers get their spells and things are not so bad with them, what about fighters? You give them an ability to arm a level N kitchen knife? Boring. - If you haven't got rich English (or Japanese) vocabulary in most cases it will be hard to understand for you, what characters are talking about during a cut-scenes. And it will be hard to dive deep into the nuances of the storyline. Only in general terms. It's like a reading of an English novel. I hadn't got such a problem in FF7 Remake or FF10. Boring... - To load the game, u have to go to the title screen, though u can get there from the pause menu. - The camera behaves sometimes weird when the character is near the walls. - Characters do not change suits, it's kinda weird to look at mage character which is dressed as a knight.. I bought this game years ago and never got myself into it. Now I wanted to give the remaster on PS4 a try and I have to say I m pleasantly surprised and glad that I bought it. To be fairly honest this game is a 8.5 for me. As usual I follow my gut feeling to whether to go up or down and decided to give it a final 8. The world is really well designed. I love the characters and the voice acting is really good too. The story unfolds pretty well and I found it a good bit interesting. The location are nice with a little bit of variety that could be better maybe but is still very enjoyable as a whole. For the engine I can say that the remaster went quite well. It plays very good on a PS4 Pro with SSD. Loading times are very good, only due to the old save behaviour the saving itself takes a bit. I had no bluescreens, frame drops or bugs in my 35hr playthrough (pretty straight, I skipped quite a bit side and endgame content for now). The sound design is pretty advanced and uses surround well. Characters differ a lot and have their individual spirit. You develop by leveling up, getting new items and picking skills on a board according to the job you have chosen. 1st job when you get the character, 2nd job later in the game. You can basically create every possible combination with that. Red/Dark Mage, White Mage-Monk, Mage-Archer, Hard Tank, everything goes and nearly everything seems to be viable. I didnt use any specials or summons (lol me saving for the next game) and still was able to finish the game nicely. Some areas can be a bit though and the game tends to be a bit of grindy but I still think it is okay. If you do some sidequests and farm a bit, it feels not too hefty. Also with x2 and x4 speed mode, its very bearable. What you have to know is that the game uses an ATB styled auto battle mode. You can give manual orders to each of your controlled characters and they will do it when their action bar is ready, while the fight itself is realtime. Also you can use ""gambits"" which basically means you can treat your party as they were AIs, e.g. ""if party member below 50% health use Cura"" or ""if ally died use phoenix down"". You can unlock a multitude of slots and actions which the party will then use. You can deactivate or overrule this at any time. You can also live swap members from your roster of up to 6 people. If you get into this system it feels really nice. The job system can be overwhelming and I hated it the first time. I would just say: pick what you want. You ll get into goal with each build you take. So the straight route will take around 25 to 50hrs according to playstyle. Completionist might be busy quite a bit longer. The game is worth the money and often on sale. Give it a try, I think you might enjoy it. I finally downrated the game a bit because of the long saving times and the somewhat grindy and lengthy areas. Also some puzzles might be enraging without a walkthrough. Some areas are also not very well balanced and (not very often but still) sometimes the save points vary a lot in length. The last two chapter have huge runs to go, so for casuals that might be a small let down but there are at least some auto-saves too.. A 2 solely for fun gameplay but the story is just awful. It's the most boring game and the main character is useless.. The best FF got better, new graphics, new job system, new areas, and new trial modes! This is amazing! A must play!. ","the remaster for PS4/PS5, PC, Xbox, and Switch is doing the game real justice . the story and characters are all great, except for two, Vaan and Penelo considerably drag down the rest of the cast . the music like in every FF game is remarkable and great ."
948.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,"One of the best games everMade. The music the atmosphere the story everything is awesome. The game is made with Love impression. Engaging gameplay, immersive world, and endless fun! A must-play for all gamers seeking excitement and adventure.. Hugely underrated game that feels so much ahead of its time. This game hits you right in the feels with it's story. My only real gripe with the game is that it isn't longer! This is still one of the best shooters and games out there due to the unique and incredible mix of atmosphere, theme, story, and gameplay. It is an improvement from the original in every sense of the way and holds up perfectly to this day. I just wish Max could be happy :(. An absolutely fantastic noir-themed shooter game with an excellent storyline! Highly recommended.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 6/10; Gameplay: 7/10; Atmosphere: 7/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 7/10. This game rocks. Played it in 2024 on my Series X with the disc through backwards compatibility and it played buttery smooth with quick load times. Much better than the first. The story is great, gun play still super fun, better level design, and a very effective atmosphere still. It also knew not to take itself too seriously which I appreciated. There is now a lot of mission variety and different npcs help you fight which I found refreshing and it made for some sick set pieces for the original Xbox.. Better than the first one, has more money behind it. The cutscenes/comics are much better than the first. The gameplay is better too, more fluid.. I loved everything about this game. Rest in peace James McCaffrey, you were the best.. NO HOPE, NO HARM. VOLUME 2. At first I was pleasantly surprised that the game is from 2003 and looks quite nice and quite detailed, unlike the games of that time that were released at the same time (GTA VC, Mafia 1). The faces of the main characters and even the secondary ones look really well-developed and do not resemble something very low-poly without any facial animations. I was glad that this part already has a full-fledged ragdoll; for 03, I think it was very impressive. The plot here is more mundane, as for me, it is shorter than in the 1st part, more restrained and there is no contrast between the events. In terms of gameplay, this is essentially the 1st part, but more polished and refined (probably the headshot system and not such stone bots as they were in the 1st part). The only thing I didn’t like was how bullet time was implemented, for me it’s too fast and there’s no feeling that everything around is really freezing, as for me it cuts down on the very cinematic quality that was shown in MP1. Well, of course, in the end I’ll say that it didn’t quite go over that the appearance of all the characters is radically different from the previous part, sometimes it feels like something is wrong. Otherwise, this is a good, consistent and worthy sequel in which there is nothing superfluous and in fact it does not stand out from the general atmosphere that the developers set in MP1.. One of most pupular noir games in the world. Nice love-story with very short continuation.. Improvement of the first game in nearly all aspects: - better story with emotions and twists - music, and the comic book art design is still great - gameplay polished, 0 bugs now even after 21 years of publishing - more weapons, smoother animations and graphics Classic staple game of the action shooter genre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first part was great. Therefore, I really wanted to play the second part right away. And I can safely say that the second part is just as super positive for me! Only 2 years have passed since the first part. But the budget itself has grown a lot, which is due to the fact that the development company was bought by T2. And it is immediately noticeable that the game itself has become larger. The picture has become much more beautiful, although Max's funny face has disappeared, he still looks great. And the shooting itself became much more pleasant. Also, the mechanics with time stop have changed. Now she was recovering from her slain **** the plot itself is still beautiful. In the game, we are told the events that take place after the first part. In this game, many problems from life continue to be raised: love, death, work and **** gameplay is almost the same. We also run around the location and kill enemies. But in this part we have added another playable character, Monna. Which is nice to play and feels the difference in the game compared to Max **** general, everything good that was in the first part was transferred to the second, but improved and added a little new. The second part turned out to be an equally excellent game! And for me, it was even better than the first part.. Max Payne 2: The Pinnacle of Noir Gaming Excellence. Max Payne 2, released in 2003, stands as an incredible masterpiece in gaming history, its status as one of the best games ever created. Remedy Entertainment took everything that made the original Max Payne great and elevated it to new heights, delivering an immersive narrative, refined gameplay mechanics, and a level of cinematic storytelling that remains unmatched.. This is not a game, it is a work of art full of ART philosophy!! They don't make games like they used to anymore. My first game and don't care about the year it was released, the feeling of playing the game is still incredible and legendary.. One of most pupular noir games in the world. Nice love-story with very short continuation.. greatest series i have ever played in my life. i love this game. i feel lucky because i could play them all.. Just as good if not even better than the first game. Astonishing visuals and level design, and an adicting gameplay... I cannot wait to see what Remedy is planning for the remakes!. ""Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne"" serves as a remarkable continuation of the series, building upon the brilliance of its predecessor. While there's a slight shift in tone with a slightly lighter ambiance, the game remains nothing short of exceptional. The character development, gameplay enhancements, and captivating storytelling continue to shine. One of the standout elements of this sequel is the remarkable character development. Max Payne's evolution remains a focal point, while the introduction of Mona Sax as a second playable character adds depth and intrigue to the narrative. Their intertwined stories create a captivating dynamic that keeps players invested. The gameplay in ""Max Payne 2"" is an improvement over its predecessor. The mechanics are refined, delivering a smoother and more satisfying experience. The signature bullet time mechanic returns, allowing players to orchestrate exhilarating slow-motion gunfights that feel both strategic and exhilarating. Visually, the game steps up its game. The graphics are enhanced, immersing players even further into the gritty world of Max Payne. The visual improvements contribute to the overall cinematic quality, enhancing the narrative's impact. Speaking of storytelling, ""Max Payne 2"" continues to excel in this department. While the darkness may feel a tad lighter, the storytelling is no less enthralling. The narrative weaves twists and turns, keeping players engaged and eager to uncover the next layer of the plot. The emotional connection to Max Payne deepens with this installment. The way the game delves into his psyche and the challenges he faces creates a bond between player and character that's truly remarkable. It's hard not to fall in love with the depth and complexity of Max's journey. In conclusion, ""Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne"" is an incredible experience that does justice to its predecessor while enhancing multiple aspects. The character development, improved gameplay mechanics, and refined graphics contribute to a game that's not only fun to play but emotionally resonant. This sequel maintains the series' high standard and delivers an amazing gaming experience that shouldn't be missed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Takes everything that was good about Max Payne and adds tighter level design and improved mission variety. You put Sam Lake’s face back in and this and it’s pretty close to a perfect game.. Those of us who played the OG Max Payne in 2001 spent those two years afterwards being extremely hyped for the **** it was worth it. Max Payne 2, like its predecessor, is yet another gaming history Masterpiece. Everything that made the original fun to play and exciting, the sequel had it turbo-charged, all of it, and then some. This game was pretty praised for its ragdoll physics back in 2003, some games were starting to use pretty ""advanced"" physics, for the time, and surely Max Payne 2 was one of those. I remember being blown away by the graphics when it came out, and my PC had some trouble running it at pretty high settings, but it was still manageable. In 2023, this game still holds up quite nicely, without any graphics mods or anything, only the usual widescreen fix and...pretty much that's all you need (maybe the d3d8to9 wrapper, included with the famous widescreen fix from ThirteenAG, but I've played on DX8 too, many times, without major issues). Since it's a DX8/9 game (depending if we use any wrapper), it's pretty easy to force insane amounts of Super Sampling AA or Downsampling into this game, and any semi modern GPU will handle it at pretty good FPS, no issues, and you'll get an absolutely jaggie-free looking game. In this sequel we can see how Remedy upped their technology a lot, with the inclusion of actual in game Televisions, which did not require their own separate cutscene, all done in game, something they would continue using in all of their games, such as Alan Wake. It was amazing to just take a break and watch the bizarre yet funny in game shows and follow their ""plots"" episode by episode, and still is today, it never gets old. And the story in this game is one of the best from Remedy, no doubt, unforgettable characters, we keep wanting to know more about them, most are shrouded in ambiguity and that's keep that thriller feel for sure. The story in this game was what surely cemented Remedy's path towards their future, which then we saw with their next amazing game, Alan Wake. With the Remake for these two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, already announced, I look forward to seeing these running on the Northlight Engine and with modern physics, I can't wait, I've replayed these games so, so **** I'll continue to do so, they're simply timeless and Max Payne 2 here is just incredible.. The game is a gripping sequel that delivers on all fronts with improved gameplay, stunning visuals, and a captivating story, though not as good of a story as the original one.. Now here is a really adequate story, not only one of the best love story lines in the game industry as a whole, but also better graphics and gameplay. 10/10. A game ahead of its time, it is the best third person shooter game and it is iconic. Why does reckless killing feel so good? Of course I hate guns in real life but it's fun in the digital world, no lies.... Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. What a story! What a scenes! This game is an art! You should play that if you like story based games.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. The gameplay and graphics have become more interesting but the story is incredibly boring.. What a game, I love the main characters (max Payne) and the ost is very good Story: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10. this game is great, it was the first Max that rockstar put physics in the objects of the scenery and in the enemies. At the time, the physics of this game is what we currently see in Max 3 and it's a game from 2012 10 years ago. Basically an improvement from the original from all aspects, especially gameplay and level design.. Max Payne 2 is a bittersweet experience not only because of its story, but also because the game is just so close to being perfect.. It is a legendary game with police and noir themes. When I was a kid I used to jump around like Max Payne :D It is a more advanced version of the first **** romantic theme of the story did not affect the game badly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Remedy's classic sequel was fantastic on a high end PC. While not as fresh as the original ""Max Payne"", it featured improved gameplay, superior graphics and a better story. Fans of third-person shooters, film noir and action movies should enjoy it. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. The game is short but is quite entertaining and graphics is much better than that of the first part.. This Game Is Very Important Action Game In The History Of Action Video Games. Its a great improvement from the last game and this game is such a gem. The twisted story villain which links it to the first game always keeps you guessing who is the puppet master. The game's graphics is a huge improvement from the last game and the storytelling is as great as the last game. It was the last game in the series that Remedy made before it was taken over by Rockstar.. Sequel to a masterpiece. The game is very good, but the first one was much stronger in terms of plot. It is possible that the main conflict in the plot is no longer as painful as in the first. But still, I was very worried about the fate of Max and his relationship with Mona. In terms of gameplay, I can’t say that much has changed, everything is just as good.. Story: 90/100 Gameplay: 100/100 Graphics: 100/100 Music/Soundtrack: 100/100 Main Character(s): 100/100 Side Characters: 90/100 Regular Enemies: 70/100 Bosses/Boss fights: 90/100 World/Level Design: 100/100 Playability (Bugs and optimization after patches): 100/100 Would I Play It Again?: Yes Where Does It Rank In My Top 500 Video Games of All Time List?: 4 Rating: 100/100. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 9 Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 9 Fun Factor : 8 Environment interaction : 4 Sound effects : 10 Overall Immersion : 8 There's no such thing as a perfect game. nice but not best nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. Perfect sequel to the first game. Once again Remedy proved they are professionals in their field.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game marked me as a child and I have beautiful memories of the game apart from that its playability was the best in its time and today it is very enjoyable to play it. The sequel to Max Payne (2001) is darker and less jesting. The story and the characters are well written. The game mechanics are improved and the atmosphere is equivalently superb. A masterpiece!. Its a game that you can play it on **** not have auto save system so you can feel unbeareable sometimes so if you want to play this game , save your game regularly.. No story has captivated me this much since the original max payne! With DELICIOUS views of new york city, memorable moments, and the heart-pounding climaxes at the end of each chapter are all epic. The coolness & badassness of max payne's character is just icing on the cake, damn this game is addictingly delicious! A well-crafted treat for gamers as they turn on their gaming… Expand. Second Max is very short but that doesnt matter since its full of great moments, making everything what was perfect in the first game even better.. Max Payne 2. The end of an era. Although the series continues, the real end of the game ends with this game. If there is one thing that everyone likes in the Max Payne series, it is that they can reflect the inner voice of the character on the screen very well. Although Max Payne, played unconsciously, seems like a direct action to people, in fact, the character is constantly fighting with his own inner world. Compared to the first game, the theme of love rather than the feeling of revenge came to the fore. This game shows the greatest pain a love can bring. Max Payne 2 is self-contradictory in some ways, for example, it barely mentions the family he lost in the first game in the second game. There are many theories that you can establish in the game, which shows that the events that take place are not clearly revealed. Nevertheless, the Max Payne series managed to be the apple of the eye of most players. It has managed to attract people with its atmosphere, music and philosophical approaches. I hope there will be more artistic and philosophical games like this in the next generation games. Let's close the article with that legendary final music. ****/watch?v=AzsiE44Lz_w. Summary: The fall of Max Payne, indeed. The Good: + The change in the appearance of the characters. Models are more complex than in the previous game, especially in regards to the heads. + Bullet Time effect. + The sound engineer is to be applauded, especially when it comes to vocal effects. The Bad: - Short game's length.. This game is a legend. Very fun and very enjoyable. It's technically a legend for its year of release. And it had a very satisfying ending. Some said it was difficult, but I think it's average.. The story and gameplay are great. You will enjoy playing, you will be happy. Cartoon style narration is great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best game I have ever played. It has an excellent story and perfect gameplay without any important bugs. Must play.. Story: 9/10 The Way story is given: 19/20 Gameplay: 25/30 Design: 9/10 Feelings left after playing: 18/20 Playability(Bugs and optimization): 9/10 AVARAGE: 89/100. Simply the best third person shooter ever made, the story is just a touch inferior to the first one.. Very good game. Incredibly good physics for the time (although they do still hold up today) with the same fun mechanics as the first game. They kept the slow motion effect, and added new weapons, and thankfully removed enemies sitting behind walls with shotguns. The story is decent, but it's enough to keep you playing.. Great improvements from Max Payne 1 all around. Max Payne 2 is a great improvement from the first one in terms of graphics shootdodge mechanics and gameplay in general. The amount of detail in the game is also a great addition. The amount of objects you can interact with is amazing. You can kick around every bin and box, even pizza slices can be shot around. The default difficulty is a lot lower than Max Payne 1, a bit too easy in my opinion. The voices are a great improvement. The random people and enemy you encounter say more interesting things. Also, all the locations are different, and some are pretty cool, such as a place called the fun house, which is like a hollywood mental asylum movie set with a bunch of props. The classic max payne madness parts returns, except the puzzles in these segments are a lot easier than max payne 1. In conclusion, for a 2003 game, this was outstanding.. Trying to improve upon Max Payne was a monumental task but I think Remedy managed to do it. The story is just as well done. The characters are as good as ever. The voice acting was a delight. The graphics have been improved over the original. The clothing detail; hair; gun detail; object detail and ground detail were all noticeably better than the original. They added a few new guns like the MP5 and the AK-47 both of which are fun to use. They did nerf the sniper rifle for some reason. It takes multiple shots to kill an enemy compared to it mainly being a one hit kill weapon in the original. You get to take control of Mona Sax for a few chapters which was a nice change. My only gripe about that was that while I was controlling her Max would not use any pain meds to heal damage even though he had some when I was last in control of him. Speaking of that one other part I didn’t like was that you have to keep an eye on Max and Vinny at different points in what are basically an escort mission where if they die it’s game over. Not my favorite type of mission for sure. I played Max Payne 2 on Linux using Valve’s Proton. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any bugs. The performance was fantastic, which was to be expected with the game’s age. Aside from one short dip to 82 FPS the game was always over 100 FPS. The game has 3 AA options; 3 AF options; and 15 other graphics options. You can manually save whenever you want and there are 10 slots for it. There are also 3 slots for auto saves which the game uses periodically if you prefer that. Alt-Tab works. You can choose from a variety of crosshair options. You can pause and skip cut scenes. Game Engine: Renderware Save System: Manual (at any time) and Auto Settings Used: All Highest; 8x AA; AF; 1920x1080 Disk Space Used: 1590 MB VRAM Usage: 714-851 MB CPU Usage: 10-18 % RAM Usage: 2.4-3.0 GB Frame Rate: 82-144 FPS Like the original, Max Payne 2 rates as an all time classic for me. It has a fantastic story which builds and improves upon the original. The characters are all worth caring about and fleshed out. The graphics got an overhaul. The voice acting remains superb. The music was wonderful. I finished the game on detective difficulty in 6 hours. That’s a tad shorter than the original but it in no way feels rushed. If you enjoy third person shooters at all or games with a strong story you owe it to yourself to try this out. I paid $2.55 CAD for the game on Steam as well as having bought the physical copy back in the day. This game is worth whatever they want to charge, well above the $10.99 CAD it currently retails for. My Score: 9.5/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 5700 XT Gaming X 8GB | Mesa 20.1.8 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 20.1.1 | Mate 1.24.1 | Kernel 5.8.11-1-MANJARO | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz | Proton 5.0-9. I don't remember when I played this version, but after finishing Max Payne I and really enjoying the game, obviously, I would play The Fall of Max Payne. A game that was marked for me, so much that, I finished it twice.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After just completing MAX PAYNE one and two I would say that the first one has a stronger story and gameplay , I am not seeing that makes MAX PAYNE 2 bad just saying that like it you are an action hero Instead of crappy Cup trying to survive, Will an amazing game I would recommend it but You should played on the second difficulty because the default is way too easy. This game has placed a deep trail in my childhood. It is more than master piece than the newer games.. I really love that noire vibe, these characters, one of those games that I will never forget for the rest of my life. This game is a true masterpiece. Great gameplay, story, atmosphere and characters. Can't really forget about this game.. The game maybe old, but in terms of gameplay and story, it's ten times better than most games today. As the first game I played as a child, I have a different sympathy for him. My score for this game is 10/10.. One the best storytellings and gameplays in my entire life I love Max Payne 2 in every way Especially music and Atmosphere. Max payne is already one of my favorite series of games. Max payne 2 had incredible dynamics compared to those years. I think it was the Havok **** story of the game is masterpiece. It is beautifully connected with the first game. I played it again this year and it was an amazing game. I recommend it to everyone.. During my life, I have played plenty of games but this one was the best one. Even today with its great game mechanics it is a playable game and in 2003 people must have been fascinated when they played this. 10/10. The gameplay mechanics are outdated now, the game is too linear, enemies could kill you instantly and you wont even find cover. This gets frustrating for some people. Except it, the game is perfect in every other aspect be it the sound design, plot, gunplay or the maps. All of the missions take place at night and provide you a kind of eerie feeling. I liked it. Perfect alternative for someone who like Mafia franchise.. An amazing sequel to the classic game! The gameplay and story-telling were excellent! 10hrs on record.. At the level of the first, an outstanding game in its plot, in its technical section and most importantly .... BULLET TIME !!. Essential.. Didn't add a whole lot on top of the **** level design on this one is a little off the atmosphere. The best Remedy game to date, from a time when they knew how to make PC games.. Even more amazing than the first one. The kind of surreal parts with Mona were great.. +Story +Gameplay is really amazing. +Diologue +Atmosphere +Soundtrack +Bullet time -Lack of boss fights. - Story is great but not as good as the first one. -I didnt like the love story of this game.. Great sequel to first one with even better visuals and story. You can even play as second character Mona, which was something new.. Great game with great combat, yes the story is short but I think quality > quantity. The first part was with incredibly strong and enveloping atmosphere, interesting and intriguing story. Had Interesting mechanics of focus, that was new for me, and interesting comic-storytelling style with noir music ...it was very-very cool. This game is good too and deserves a very good rating, but it doesn't give anything new, just a story. So I decided to give this game 9 instead 10.. If we compare MP2 with MP1 the first one is undoubtedly better: script, story, gameplay, difficulty. But the second one is just different. It's more about the chemistry between Max and Mona (to be fair I liked the models from the first game), fun stuff and details revealing the mysteries of the first game. It's a very good sequel, a really good one (thanks to ""Poets of the Fall"") but no better than the original game.. The gameplay is pretty good even in 2019, but the story... the setting... the atmosphere... indescribable. Masterpiece ****. Story: Two years past, and Max has been reinstated in his old job as a police detective for the NYPD. Max is called on to investigate a gunfight at a warehouse owned by Max's old associate Vladimir Lem and discovers the place has been attacked by a group of hitmen called the Cleaners. He encounters Mona Sax, who was thought to be dead by Max. Max heads to a restaurant owned by Lem and rescues him from his old foe Vinnie Gognitti; Lem claims that Gognitti is trying to monopolize the black market gun trade and sees Lem as a threat... Pros: • The comic-book cutscenes make a return and they are even better then in the first game. This is mainly due to Remedy being able to afford real actors this time around so the quality it looks better in return. • Max Payne 2 is still a dark game like the original, not as dark this time around, but still quite dark. • Characters are still excellent in this game and many characters such as Max, Mona and Vladimir make a return. Cons: • The story sadly is much weaker compared to the Max Payne 1. As the first game went really deep into the events and actions taken that drove Max to the edge. In 2 it's really just doesn't feel so deep into the character of Max and when it does it's execution comes off begging for more. • The twists as well really don't feel all that significant and character motivations don't feel that genuine and more for the sake of continuing the plot. Gameplay: Pros: • Bullet time and shoot dodge have been improved and feels more powerful and easier to control... perhaps too easy. But it's just a blast mowing down enemies in bullet time and feeling like a one man army bad-ass. • Using grenades, molotovs and even melee has now been mapped to a key of your choice so you can throw/melee much easier now. • New weapons are fun to use and the old returning ones feel great as well. Cons: • Compared to the original, bullet time physics has gotten crazy. You can now literally shoot enemies in the air in bullet time. It's entertaining don't get me wrong, but for a game like Max Payne it's a bit odd seeing it. • The game is only 4/6 hours which is a real let down compared to the first game. You can play the game again on the different ""difficulties"" and unlock the alternative ending. Unfortunately it will probably be even shorter playing it again. • The set piece moments of the game feel more restrictive and less interesting compared to the quick paced gunfights you engage in for most of the game. The escort parts were not that enjoyable to say the least. Sound and Music: Pros: • Voice acting is once again excellent with great dialogue and performances all around. • Music has improved from the first game. There is more of it and it sounds less repetitive which was the problem with the first game. I have to say I love the theme in Max Payne 2. That cello really adds such a grim, bleak, depressing, but deep emotional passion to it. • Sound effects have improved as well from gunshots, weather, debris falling or fire. It all sounds solid. Performance and Visuals: Pros: •This game looks fantastic for 2003. Improved massively from the first game and character models look really good now with properly animated faces and bodies that look well modeled. • In-game cutscenes look a lot better to. Camera angles, animations and audio have really helped them more attractive to watch compared to the few in the first game. • The depiction of New York and the environment is still amazing and it's been improved. You can interact with your surroundings as well. I also love to watch the TV shows that mimic what's going on in the game world and references the other ideas Remedy had for Max Payne's name which is a awesome touch. • Ran solidly and had no issues getting the steam version running (unlike Max Payne 1). Cons: • Had an odd flickering texture, but extremely minor problem. Verdict: It's hard to decide if Max Payne 1 or 2 is better because they both are great third person shooters. Max Payne 2 certainly has the greater gameplay, graphics and performance was solid. However, it really lacks in the deep story from the original which is such a damn shame. But it;s still a great game and I would rate it slightly higher then Max Payne 1. Story: 6/10 Gameplay: 8.5/10 Sound/Music: 9/10 Performance/Visuals: 9.5/10 Overall Rating: 8.7/10. In this sequel, the game is beautiful, fun and incredible. History captivates you, memorable characters and great scenes.. Amazing game still in 2019! This game blew my mind when first released. The story and the devilry of this story mixed with the amazing game play make this a must play. Would be a 10 if i didn't complete it in 4 hours.... More badass Max Payne. Film noir is near perfect here. The story is compelling. Very good!. This game completes the greatest story in the history of video games, while keeping the gameplay fresh, fun and repayable from start to finish. Brilliantly written, with two incredibly satisfying endings, and multiple side characters who are fully fleshed out and every bit as memorable as the variously intermixed TV episodes. It just doesn't get any better than MP 1 and 2 as far as single player gaming is concerned. 100/100!!!. My favorite max payne game this game was so good back in the day it provided such a nice story and gameplay which only a few games did!!. Max Payne 2 is a classic 'film noir' riveting tale about an anti-hero fighting his old demons, recently resurfaced. Technically speaking, the game improved greatly compared to its predecessor released 2 years earlier. This time though, I didn't need to patch the game. It was fully playable, without glitches. The bullet time mode also improved, opening the way to massive combo gunfights along with new ways to rifle your enemies. The game's core resides in its narrative ability to read as a comic book. Just like the first, the atmosphere is insanely oppressive and dark","VOLUME 2 is a noir-themed shooter game with an incredible mix of atmosphere, theme, story, and gameplay . the story is great, gun play still super fun, better level design, and a very effective atmosphere still . VOLUME 2 was released in 2003 and looks quite nice and quite detailed ."
949.Homeworld Remastered Collection,"This has aged fantastically. I picked this up on Epic in anticipation of Homeworld 3 in March, and I'm glad I did. Even by today's standards, the graphics are quite nice. The voice acting is superb, and the story is gripping. Definitely worth a play through, and a testament to the longevity of well-designed software.. Every time when you start a Gearbox game, you have to pray for a miracle for it to work. And it didn't happen. Pisspoor programming from a third-tier dogshlt developer.. I gave it a try, but unfortunately had to quit after almost 10 hours. The original Homeworld was my preferred choice, but it always crashed after a few minutes of gameplay. So I switched to the remastered version which has some impressive visuals, especially in space. However, the gameplay didn't quite suit me. It was very confusing and lacked an overview. Managing the units was tiring, and if you built new ones during a fight, you couldn't group them properly, resulting in throwing them into the battle to their demise. Maybe it's just too complex for me, but I may give it another try in the future.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. The good - The collection comes with homeworld classic. The updated graphics are beautiful. The ugly - Every part of the remastered is built off of the garbage pile that is HW2's engine which is notorious for it's auto-scaling counter-fleets into absurdity (A well known old tactic was to retire every ship in your fleet before starting another mission.) Outright cheating (HW1's engine had the enemy AI scripts following the same rules the player does. This included things like production time & resources available. They have to farm resources on the map to keep up production. HW2's engine gives the enemy AI infinite resources as a default state.) Broken/non-functional calculations for projectiles & formations. (HW1 uses physical projectiles. They are objects that can be targeted if you know how and destroyed. HW2 uses dice rolls to determine hit/no-hit. This renders things like the multi-gun corvette the most viable corvette and anything else a waste of RU. Due to the nature of those calculations, formations do nothing to actively change inbound damage.) Ship hard points - HW1 has hard points for three things - salvage corvette latch points, refueling fighters and draining resource collectors. HW2's engine assigns them to everything rendering repair corvettes useless and drastically crippling the functionality of repair frigates. Ship profiles - HW2's engine cripples the following ships by failing to program their roles correctly. Drone frigates, defenders, heavy and light corvettes, multi-beam frigates, swarmers, advanced swarmers, mine layer corvettes, salvage corvettes, scouts, assault frigates, ion cannon frigates... I could go on but I'll leave it here. Fuel - It was ""kinda removed"" in the most half-baked way possible as several powerful fighter types are deliberately restricted by their fuel pools and required a support frigate for long range deployment. All in all, for a ""Remaster"" it is an abject failure of one of the most beatifically done space rts games ever made all because Gearbox is lazy.. A really solid RTS game. Can guarantee if you enjoy RTS games, you appreciate this one or your money back.. Homeworld is a real-time strategy video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by Sierra Studios. Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives.. Loved the graphics update but even now roughly 6 years after release there are still major bugs in the campaign. There are deep moments in this game that get ruined when the camera ends up facing randomly into space, levels that for some reason your ships can randomly hyperspace on, levels that get stuck and just don't complete, and even after their work to mitigate formations not being in on release still buggy as heck. As of today, if you wanted to go through and enjoy the story properly play it on the original versions or else you risk having the mood ruined by random and difficult to solve bugs.. This is not a ""remake"" this a bugged remake. ships move as if developers were learning how physics works. the interface is so ugly compared to the original, and the classic version is crashing. how come developers can be proud of this ?? script, trigger and timer in missions are broken. ships collide and bug and we can't finish missions. ? the worst remake of all time. I tested the homeworld 2, classic and remastered.. Great remaster to one of the best space strategy games of 2000's. Finished the story of the first one - awesome :) Waiting to have some free time to finish a second one.. A passable remaster but doesnt retain the charm of the original game. While the graphics are definitely better it is lacking the intense and realism of the original game. The camera movements are too quick, zoom function didnt work for some reason maybe because its the tutorial, the texture is too bright. It puts me too much to continue much further. I'd just go back and play the original homeworld 2.. Five Word Review: Slick game made wonderfully modern. Favorite Thing: The modernized UI and controls make it feel like this game is hot off the press. Least Favorite Thing: Difficulty can be a bit all over the place at times. Playtime: 11h Homeworld 1, 14h Homeworld 2 Enjoyment: 9/10 Recommendation: Definitely. I am dissapointed too. I played Homeworld 2 and had good fun. This remastered Version has great graphics, but even on Version 2.1 there are bugs: pathfinding is very bad, often my ships dont attack anything, although there are enemies and they are on attack status. The biggest problem is the lack of good overview and I dont mean this sensor view. Then why do we have such good graphics engine?. Remastered Homeworld 1 straight up does not work, but comes with classic which is damn near perfect. Do not play Remastered Homeworld 1 as NONE of the gameplay scripts are ported, only story critical ones. Bullet physics do not exist in remastered's engine (hw2) and as such every single strategy in homeworld one simply does not work and things like frigates automatically melt when touched. The campaign itself does not work without survival-horror elements like the needleships ramming your destroyers or the asteroids being untargetable in diamond shoals. In remastered, the enemy just lets you win because the scripts do not function in Remastered, only classic. That said, the entire package is my game of the year and I've purchased three collector's editions.. I bought this pack beliving in the steam shop ""very positive"" thing. I'm very dissapointed. This game is not a remake. A remake must respect the basis of the game. It is a plague of bugs. Dissapointing. Most of the comments giving a high score are from fans that really don't played this version. I'm sorry, but it is true.. Mad props to Gearbox for remastering my love for a once-dead franchise. They improved the UI in HW1 along with a wide variety of graphical upgrades. HW2 feels just as good as it did in 2004 when I first felt love for the Vagyr. The only thing missing is Homeworld: Cataclysm, which will hopefully be a DLC in the future.. Homeworld has become an average mod implemented for the Homeworld 2 engine. It sure looks pretty but the game play has took a big step **** single player campaign takes a backseat to the goal of combining both games into a big multiplayer face off. so all the original single player balance has been turned on its head to make the original fleets fit with the fleets of HW2. Add to that the flight and healing mechanics and a pile of other stuff no longer work like they did makes this not so much a remasterering rather a clunky remake. The fact non of the so called critic's even seemed to notice that one of the two playable factions in the first game has been completely removed tells you all you need to know about how much effort they put into their reviews. But what the hay, it sure looks spiffy!! ...I mean that's all that matters right ?..... Since the start of the ps4 and Xbox one genaration of consoles a lot of ""remakes"" have been made but this game has seen remarkable changes that are very noticeable to **** good change was that they added more factions,the lack of factions in the last game was a major problem for **** UI was redone making it more accessible to the different screens.This could have been a ten but twothings stopped me liking it that **** was I had a problem loading it up but gearbox helped me **** other one was the loading was quite slow.overall a great game and a good remake!. Homeworld Remastered is a great return of an already great game. I'm so glad I was able to play the first homeworld and actually get to beat it this time. My only complaint is that after a few levels, Capturing the enemy fleet becomes a priority especially with capital ships. I would literally capture every enemy capital ship and just annihilate the next map. One mission, you have the ghost ship that steals your frigates and higher lvl, I just made a **** ton of bomber fighters and corvettes and bum rushed the ghost ship while leaving the 40+ frigate ships alone and bam.. my Cap of 24 Frigates just turned into 60+ frigates and a few destroyers. Just kept stealing more capital ships on and on and won the game without any effort. Then Homeworld 2 comes along and bam.. punches me in the face and then kicks me while on the ground. I dont get to build my fleet after beating objectives, computer constantly sends waves after waves of enemies while trying to build a fleet. It's a lot more micro managing than the first, but the story is pretty awesome.. Homeworld 2 Remastered is very solid, but homeworld 1 is really broken. I really dont know why Gearbox, changed HW 1 exactly to be like Hmeworld 2. HW 1 was better game. This game got a lot of bugs too (not many in HW2, but half of features in HW 1 dont work, or is pretty buggy. This remaster is not **** in terms of Visual quality, but it is really buggy and Homeworld 1 got game breaking problems.. NOTE: Exclusively about Homeworld 1 Remastered, not tested 2 yet. As much as I love Homeworld the initial release is kind of disappointing to say the least. Many features are broken or just don't exist and even though I'm glad it's not just a fancy copy of the original I can't help the feeling some changes were just wrong. Some of the stuff that doesn't work: - Formations and behavior don't work at all. - Some selection behaviors HW players got used to (ie. selecting all ships of one type in formation with the mothership by clicking only one ship) don't exist - Some 'box commands' don't work/are missing (most notably salvaging) - Ship AI is really lacking so you can't depend on them to make reasonable tactical decisions themselves anymore (ie ships keep attacking a salvaged ship; selecting a sub-optimal target) - ""Keep docked"" in the launch window does nothing - tactical map refuses to open under certain circumstances the actual list goes on but I'll save that for a forum post Once you know how to deal with all these problems the gameplay isn't too bad. Having played the original not long before I appreciate at least some of the changes made but overall it's some kind of a mixed bag situation. Salvaging for example isn't as broken as it was in HW1 but that's only because the ships are simply not worth it = salvaging not worth it (especially if you basically have to babysit your entire fleet) The introduction of the dynamic difficulty (basically determining the enemy's fleet's strength based on your's at the end of the previous mission) should not have happened. Not only was HW1 well balanced in difficulty (if you didn't use 'exploits') but the high amount of resources also means players will muster up their fleet before starting the next mission in preparation and be outnumbered anyways. I'm not through yet but I'm anticipating problems in later missions. Multiplayer is kind of strange. Combining the HW1 and HW2 races sounded nice but they didn't figure out how to handle the differences between the two games. Fighters will build individually or in squads, tech trees, Taiidan und Hiigaran fleets still almost the same, differently working building mechanics.... It's just not ONE game but two somehow mashed together. How about a game mode option for HW1 or HW2 style and build around that? *sigh* .. at least it happened but there is so much not working I hope they pull themselves together, fix all the problems and continue making good HW games like the franchise deserves.. My wish for the last 5 years has finally been answered. Beautiful graphics combined with my student years nostagia is priceless. A small -1 for the price tag, this is especially true for those of us who already own the originals, silly me !! Get it you fools !. This is the Remastered Version Homeworld needed and deserved. While there are a few bugs and lacking features from the original games, it is a really solid and well-done title. Well worth your time and money.. Issue is simply it is too hard without any way to adjust the difficulty. If you cannot get by the 4th mission since the AI throws everything at you including the kitchen sink, why buy the game. In the PC world you have many titles that do not adjust for different gamer levels and just show some pretty graphics. For those people who have a life, are the average gamer who enjoys a nice game, stay away from this game. Nice graphics don't fix game play and you will be frustrated giving up shortly.. This remastered collection is absolutely fantastic. The ships, the combat, the cinematic sequences, the atmosphere, everything as good as the original and a lot more HD. The only nitpick I have is that they could have ported the mechanics of the original HW1 more loosely. The salvage tactics was silly back then and is still silly now.. New players to the game wont know the problems untill you play the classic game. And as this is a ""Remasterd"" title, I will be doing a strict comparison to the original title. I had heard there would be a select few changes to the original game, and that they would all be for the **** largely, that is not what we got. the Homeworld '1' remastered is not the game we were lead to believe it was going to be. while the visuals are great as one would expect them to be, the mechanics fall woefully short of the original game. here is a list of the biggest problems in my opinion. in no particular order: 1 ) support frigates no longer repair units from a distance, and instead take a long time maneuvering around a ship in desperate need of repair, before finding a good spot to fix it from. 2 ) the same for resource collectors who now circle forever to find a good spot to harvest from. 3 ) the difficulty scales with your own fleet power, before there were a set number of enemys in an area, but now there are more or less depending how your campaign progresses. 4 ) the original end credits is not featured in the remastered(which from what I understand is more greedy record label than the fault of gearbox, but its still a problem) 5 ) instead of the awesome tactics and beautiful formations with physics based hit detection, it was substituted for the random number generation of HW2. Any of the changes listed above would be upsetting for long time fans of homeworld, but number 5 is the biggest deviation from the gameplay of HW1Classic. and in it of itself ruins the game, because without this the only thing the remastered has in common with the classic is the title and story. Whatever reason Geabox told themselves to convince themselves that the changes(butchering) to the classic game was okay, was dead wrong. I was expecting two remastered games, not one game with two campaigns. ! award 2 points because it does contain the original unmolested games and otherwise a pretty game to look at, but not play.. I have to agree with the lower scores here. I come from the original series as well and they were awesome. They are still better than any RTS today. The remastered versions however only got a slightly better look and to work on modern PC's. The issues mentioned by those scoring the remastered version low is the issues i see as well, and so i dont understand when people score the RM versions highly. Too many issues and changes from the original games that shouldnt been done because it made the RM versions worse. They look better, sure, but the IMPORTANT stuff was made worse. Graphics seems to be what people rate games for today which is a shame. Back in the day when we ""didnt have"" gaphics - gameplay and mechanics mattered. I hope Gearbox can patch and fix these issues because this should really be bought by every RTS gamer out there, and you can clearly see that even though the game is old, its so good and better than most RTS'es today that it will keep selling for years to come. Patch the issues, and get cracking on expanding on Homeworld and release HW3 in a couple of years. I will buy HW3 if the issues are fixed, new campaign, upgraded graphics engine (not really needed, but would be epic to see the REAL mechanics from the original in a modern engine). I give it 4/10 for fixing the original games to work on todays PC's, and for at least trying to get the best RTS ever made remastered to a new audience, and to us veterans. So 6 points missing for a perfect score because Gearbox changed or broke some vital and great working mechanics from the original versions. Also i think i crashed only once and the performance was decent on max graphics (slight stutter on a rather good PC). Please try again Gearbox. Patch what the community is asking you to patch, and then get busy making HW3. It will take the RTS crown and bring in a lot of money. Just do it right.. I bought the collectors edition of this game because I played the original to death. It looks amazing! It sounds amazing! it is amazing! Did I mention it's amazing!. Aside from the graphics looking a little better just about everything else has been made worse. Formatins don't stick. Units can't be made not to shoot enemy shipts when I am capturing them (stand down is broken). Broken scriping througout. Some missions get stuck with no way to finish them. Ships get stuck with funny jitery movements. Broken path finding. AI seems erattic and with inconsistent rules. At one time research for ion cannons is stated to be available but nothing apears in the research list so you must reload from earlier levels. Many other mechanics have been removed or destroyed like fuel or being able to heal a fleet automatically rather than baby manage each unit. Over all a horibily broken game. Frustrating to say the least. In no way is it the gem the original was. You can tell no love went into this one.. If your looking for an amazing experience, then look no further. Top notch graphics and despite the *whinging* about supposed issues, if the people who moaned over them simply got on with the mission and realize the HW1 and HW2 engines were different so different approaches were needed, they'd enjoy it a lot more rather than crying. If you never played this before, this right here is a great time to get it. And if your an old hand whose enjoyed Complex mod and so forth for HW2, well, it includes classic HW2 so mods still work *and* a mod toolkit for the Remastered version is on it's way. Literally f**kin A.. They killed the amazing original HW1 mechanics. No fuel, insane bullet physics, tactics and formations that dont work. Its almost impossible to play the HW1 Remastered campaing due how bad that mechanic is. A remaster version should preserve the original game mechanics, that makes the original HW1 a true masterpiece. Thats essential. Gearbox epic fail After 20 minutes trying to play the remastered HW 1, i gave up and went to the original HW1 even with bad graphics is far better that this insut that they call remaster.. Great revision of both games to a modern standard, if they get formations working and sort out the balance between the two they get the last 2 points.. 6/10 for Remastered edition. Classics are still the best of the best, but remaster has many issues. It's unoptimized, the game crashes often, HW1 port to HW2 engine was done bad and broke half of HW1 mechanics. I hope Gearbox will take this eriously and patch it soon so it can be enjoyable experience as originals were.. My favorite space RTS for over a decade, now with a new coat of paint, some gameplay mechanics have changed due to engine switch but the story, atmosphere and orchestral score remain the same in the end that is what matters the most to me.. I expect from a remastered a high quality and very few bugs. Too many bugs so far. Homeworld 1 remastered is basically a port of homeworld 1 on homeworld 2 engine, incorrectly tested.. A hack job, that's what this 'remastered' version is. The issues with it? Here is a list: so list: capturing frigates on mission 3 fails to give you back the captured ships. because the physics (ballistic) system is not being used gearbox modified all the unit stats and balance around the RNG system, meaning ships like destroyers are hard countering frigates, ships move weirdly. I did warn people about this change, but everyone said it was not a big deal... now you are seeing the consequences. Multiple queues are limited to 2, this broke balance further in hw1. Support frigates needing to dock with ships means they cannot repair fast nor at long range nor actually support. support frigates cannot hyperspace while carrying strike craft. Formations are completely broken (they are not working at all) this also is because the game is using RNG instead of ballistic system. capturing carriers or alike will not allow you to build ships with them. because they are using triggers instead of game mechanics capturing resource collectors on missions where you have to destroy them, will consider them as alive and keep giving resources ad infinitum to carriers to magically keep popping fighters or frigates. capturing ships sometimes will make them pop out ships from the enemy team (carriers). the special ability keys mostly do NOT work with bandbox selection, this includes salvage frigates (and pretty much means its a pain to use them). because ships aren't taking onto account collision paths on the asteroids missions fighters will not evade asteroids and will get massively crushed. friendly ships keep attacking ships that are already being hold by enough salvage corvettes meaning they often destroy your prey. shift+click for queuing fast 5 on 5 ships does not work. there seems to be an arbitrarily low strike craft build limit active? The UI ships icons are night impossible to clearly identify what do you have selected. the mouse seems to be lagging (is it hardware accelerated?) salvage corvettes suddenly seem able to easily capture enemy corvettes (this is because it seems... evasion mechanics were disabled because they do not affect the RNG system) so they fly linearly and just get clamped easily. salvage corvettes are not showing their capture beam animation. the camera zooming out seems to be limited so much you cannot have a good view of the battles unless you go into tactical view which... tactical view Is broken. the game randomly crashes on missions 4/5 missing select unused harvesters button. gearbox did it on purpose but why research needs to cost resources at all? it could have been left to work just like hw1, this seems to be an unnecessary change.. Brings back the fun of the original with better controls and way better graphics. Kind of interesting how you can't selected the Taiidani to start out with but oh well, I guess the writers of the first Home World weren't thinking of squeals.. While the graphics have been brought up to modern standards, the mechanics (at least in HW1) are a ****. No fuel, die rolls instead of bullet physics, tactics have been completely removed, formations simply don't work, corvettes behave like fighters, and getting units to do what you want them to do is an exercise in frustration. On top of that, the release is riddled with bugs. Not good enough.. This is a brilliant old game with a HD overhaul. And its still a awesome game. There haven't really been any games like this ever since, which is a bit strange. So to see Homeworld come back is just... Epic man... @HWRemastered: The textures and new visual effects are great (""depth of field"", hdr bloom, shadows). I have a GTX 760SC and I've maxed the graphical settings. Impressive. Also, game option: Unit Cap: HUGE Thank you! I like the AI. I play solo skirmish only so that's most important to me. Ships don't get hung up on each other anymore, they move when you tell them to provided they can, etc. That said, this is still Homeworld. It doesn't feel like a new game; it feels like the old game. There's a new interface but it's nothing you'd have to relearn or anything. It's pretty intuitive and you fall right back into the groove. Side note: My build isn't normal, either. Windows 7 x64, Xeon E3-1230, Z77, GTX 760, 32GB. And I'm not having all these problems with ships flipping out, bad pathing, etc. Not in skirmish, anyway. I gave the game an 8 because Homeworld is still classic, groundbreaking, and still holds up after all this time but this isn't an original game. I welcome Gearbox's updated interface - that's awesome. But in the end it's still HW. Which, I suppose is why I got it. It deserved this remaster and I'm glad to see it in widescreen, HD and all that. I haven't bothered with the original versions yet.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the long awaited remastered version of one of the finest if not the finest space RTS is finally here. It has delivered in many ways. The graphics are just beautiful and do the original justice. Space has never before looked so strikingly good. It has some flaws however. I'll only be talking about Homeworld remastered, not Homeworld 2 remastered. First of all. There was the chance to get rid of the tedious resource collecting at the end of levels. they have not done it. Why not is beyond me, since in Homeworld 2, it was already implemented that resources are collected automatically at the end of the levels. To add to that flaw, the resource collectors seem to have gotten the dumb makeover. Maybe it is just my memory, but they really seem to behave quite stupid when collecting resources. On several occasions, they were sitting idle when given the harvest command after they consumed a cloud or a rock, not harvesting any further. Also, they seem to move even slower than in the original HW. In some levels, it took several hours! to collect all the remaining resources. That's not good. They killed the formations which worked perfectly in the original. Most of them just don't do what they're supposed to. This is especially bad in the sphere formation. In the original, you could let your smaller ships enter a sphere formation and with an additional guard command on bigger ships, they would move in position to form a protective sphere around the ship, firing on all threats while moving along with the guarded ship in a perfect sphere. This doesn't work anymore, they just form a small blob flying alongside the protected ship, which renders the sphere formation completely useless. There are also pathfinding bugs. This is especially annoying, when in battle and you order your support frigates to repair your capitals. Very often they get stuck in front of another big ship, waiting for the big ship to move instead of going around, hence, no repairs done. ship lost. I hopw they fix it with a patch soon. Finally, there's the UI. WTF? Is all I have to say about this. It's sad :( To sum it all up: I'm back in the Homeworld Universe, It looks better than ever, but it feels off. Some former key elements are missing, bugs distort the gaming experience, and the UI is terrible. The worst part however is, that it feels slower than ever before. To bring this game to a younger generation who didn't know the original, would have meant to adapt a faster pace. Most of them are not familiar with this kind of slow gaming and it could mean a huge blow to sales if the game doesn't appeal to them. If Gearbox is able to fix these issues, we might have a classic again. 7/10 for now. Homeworld 1 and 2 original offered unique gameplay in a semi 3d setting ( still more 3d than many other games in the RTS segment ) in a visually appealing package along with great sound. While Homeworld 1 has not aged all that well visually, Homeworld 2 holds up to 2015 standards ( and that is vanilla Homeworld 2 original ) Herein lays the problem - maybe. The remastered package is amazing in terms of improvements for Homeworld 1 - but feels rather insignificant for Homeworld 2. - But how much does it matter? - Actually not that much. While Homeworld 1 benefits greatly visually, - its sound remains similar ( i think the weaponsounds and explosions feel a little bigger - but i might be mistaken - its been a while since i played the original Homeworld 1 ) - and its gameplay benefits from a revised UI.... - Homeworld 2 gains a few effects that had been available in various ways via mods. The visual improvement of Homeworld 2 is barely noticable on the ships and models, more noticable on the backgrounds. Cutscenes have been revised and look great - but they did look great to begin with - and the black and white ""kind-of-flash-style"" was more or less ageless anyway. For me - the biggest improvement is the compatibility and ease of access ( like a GoG title ). Even Homeworld 2 original lacked widescreen support and had some serious trouble with todays resolutions. Homeworld 1 wouldn t start at all sometimes. So a general statement about the remastered versions: It is greatly beneficial for Homeworld 1, and appreciated for Homeworld 2. That means that it is WORTH it. However - someone that knows his way around modding and already has certain mods for Homeworld 1&2 ( like UI, HD skinning, shaders, resolution support etc. ) won t find much that amazes him. In terms of performance - both titles run smoothly on low end computers ( todays low end computers ) To sum it all up - Players that do like RTS should get the remastered version. Players that possess the originals can still buy it without regret. Players that do not like spaceships and RTS .... i guess those should not get it.... dahh. Off of the many ""remastered"" or ""HD"" versions that come out lately - this is most certainly one that did a LOT more than just slap HD on an old title. Meshes, textures, balancing, optimization and gameplay has been adjusted to get a product greater than the original.. A complete remastering. All updated textures, sound, and gameplay. The best remastering I have ever seen. If you love scifi games, this is a must buy. Also comes with classic games.. Probably the only PC game I would ever give 10/10 for. If your a old Homeworld fan then you already know what this is all about, and yes the remastered edition lives up to the legend. For any newcomers, this game will provide you with countless hours of PC strategy fun. One of the most epic and memorable campaigns ever orchestrated into a game, worth every penny.. Gearbox have done a fantastic job on this REMAKE. Yes remake - I feel the need to highlight this because allot of people were expecting new ships, complete ","the original homeworld was my preferred choice, but it always crashed after a few minutes of gameplay . I switched to the remastered version which has some impressive visuals, especially in space . but the gameplay didn't quite suit me ."
95.Half-Life: Alyx,"A true masterpiece ..I just recently experienced now on quest 3 and with time for system to catch up to virtual reality requirements and man nothing has been more tense or give fear like this game it is one of best ever and miles ahead of any other contenders.There'snothinlikeit mustplay. Long waited continuation of the famous series. A good project. Enjoyed it a lot. Even though some of the elements were questionable, like controls.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best parts of the Half Life series wrapped in a VR experience. The immersion makes it so intense. The sequence with JEFF had my heart pounding. Nobody does it better than Valve.. It's the best VR game ever, good story and immersive gameplay. Quest 2 runs well with this game.. Phenominal game! Even on a Lower-End gaming pc on medium settings on a Meta Quest 2 around 90-110fps. HL:A looks just stunning.Period. I have NEVER played something which would get close to HL:Alyx. Its just out of its league in VR. Story is awesome scripted with little puzzles and fun and also challenging on higher difficultys. You can play ""Story""-Difficulty which is the lowest but its a bunch of fun nontheless. MUST HAVE if youhave a VR Headset!! And dont even get me started on the mods! Soooo many awesome mods like ""John Wick Simulator"" for example which is a whole freaking game on its own! Absolut phänomenales Spiel! Spielbar mit dem billigsten Setup auf dem man VR zum laufen bringt und es sieht sogar auf low-qualitiy super aus. Auf dem höchsten Qualitäts-Preset ist es einfach nur episch. Hands down, das BESTE SPIEL auf VR.Punkt. Die Story ist fesselnd und herrausfordernd aber es gibt auch den ""Story"" Schwierigkeitsgrad, welcher der leichteste ist und es macht trotzdemextrem viel Spaß! Und dann noch die Mods... Heiliger Bim Bam... Die mods... Zum Beispiel ""John Wick Simulator"" was an sich schon ein eigenes Spiel ist. Absolutes MUST HAVE wenn du eine VR hast! (Im Steam Sale für ~20€ zu haben, aber sonst auch die 60€ wert). One of the best games for pc viar. Powerful and interesting. Opens the game from a new level of perception. Fantastic game. It's worth a try. If you like the previous HL games then you will love this. I’ve completed over 10 times now. Controls are great, graphics are great, story is great. When you play with the developer commentary it gives a great explanation of how or why they created all aspects of the game. I let a friend who had never played the franchise play this on my VR and he couldn’t turn it off. He bought a headset for himself the next day. I’ve not found a vr game that wants me replay it again like this one does. It has a great range of player made mods and stories which are good for when you have completed them all. If you haven’t got it. Get it. Not just the best vr game, but just one of the best games of the decade. The only negative I could even think of is that half life community had to wait for so long to get another game, but I'm glad in the end we got another masterpiece.. Half-Life: Alyx was my first VR experience, so I might not be the best critic for a VR game, but as a Half-Life fan, I have many points to discuss. Environments: From the first scene to the last, the environments impressed me deeply. The initial menu, with the iconic Combine walls dominating City 17, evokes nostalgic memories of Half-Life 2. The game, set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, effectively uses apocalyptic and destruction settings. The attention to detail is simply memorable; every pixel of the scenery deserves exploration. I spent about 12 hours immersed in the game, far beyond the 4-5 hours of story mode, analyzing every detail. The soundtrack is impeccable, perfectly fitting each situation and intensifying the immersion. VR Interaction: As my first VR game, Half-Life: Alyx offers basic and intuitive mechanics, allowing interaction with almost all items in the environment. However, I expected more interactivity from Valve, such as opening jars, pen caps, and pressing buttons on electronic devices scattered around the map. The interaction, although fun, did not fully meet my expectations of a VR game from Valve, which I imagined would go beyond conventional limits, providing greater complexity in the environment. Puzzles: The puzzles are initially very entertaining, reflecting well Alyx's hacking skills. The variety of puzzles, like matching identical symbols and redirecting energy wires, enriches the gameplay. However, I missed a greater diversity of challenges throughout the game. The integration of puzzles with VR physics and Combine technology could have been further explored, offering a wider range of unique and innovative challenges. The energy redirection puzzle, for example, is always different, complex, and challenging, but this quality could be more consistent in other types of puzzles. Combat: Combat is one of the game's highlights, combining hiding spots and weapon upgrades in an intuitive and fun way. The mechanics of reloading weapons and using the environment as cover are intriguing. However, the repetition of combat mechanics becomes evident over time, making it easy once the weapons are mastered. The absence of melee combat was a significant disappointment. Valve claimed melee combat didn't suit the character, but the presence of various objects around, such as hammers and bottles, could have been explored. Additionally, the gravity gloves do not allow throwing objects like the famous Gravity Gun from previous games, which was a missed opportunity to innovate in gameplay. Enemies: The Combine soldiers are terrifying and well-developed. The introduction and evolution of the Combine during the game met my expectations, despite the limited variety. Fighting Combines, from the simplest to the most advanced, was satisfying and challenging. In contrast, the zombies are not very challenging or varied, except for the electric zombie and Jeff, which stand out with innovative mechanics. I missed enemies like the Fast Zombie, which added a level of tension and difficulty in Half-Life 2. The Headcrabs maintain their variants, with two new additions, enriching the enemy variety. The Antlions are fun to fight but too easy. The combat mechanics with them could have been more challenging, including abilities like flying, present in Half-Life 2. The introduction of the Strider at the right moment was well executed, serving as a fitting final boss. Story: The narrative offers a new and exciting perspective, with a surprising ending that leaves any Half-Life fan speechless. The constant interaction with Russell is comedic and informative, adding context to the events between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Alyx's story is a new chapter in the Half-Life universe, providing additional depth to the series' lore without relying exclusively on Gordon Freeman's saga. The well-constructed narrative and well-written dialogues help create an emotional connection with the characters, making Alyx's journey memorable and engaging. Final Considerations: Half-Life: Alyx was a new and nostalgic experience for me. The combination of immersive VR technology with the rich tradition of Half-Life created a unique experience. Despite some mechanical flaws and the absence of certain characters, the game provided me with an exciting return to the universe I love so much. My rating reflects both the nostalgia and the satisfaction of reliving the series I love most. I was very happy to have this experience, and I thank Valve for another memorable chapter in the Half-Life saga. Thank you, Half-Life.. This was my first VR game and I was just blown away by everything about it, the graphics are mind blowing, the story is not perfect but it is very fun, the gameplay itself it's very very good, there wasn't a single second where i wasn't having fun, it is just a perfect VR game in every single way. This game has a universal acclaim. It is one of the most underrated games on this website. this is my favorite game of all time as of June 2024. I can't even describe how good this game is. play it for yourself. if you don't have VR, just play the NoVR mod on moddb.. Anyone stuggling to start up the game after loading screen here is a 100% fix ****/1b-i4nToJ3w. Good game. This was my first VR game, I didn’t regret it one bit. It's a pity that there is no New Game+, but these are my personal predictions. Although the plot is ordinary (in a good way), the gameplay is awesome.. Basically Half-Life 3. I find it weird that Valve makes one of the best games but then just dips out.. The best VR game ever made. It brought back to life one of the most revered franchises in all of gaming. It also finally resolved one of the most painful cliffhangers in gaming history. This is a masterpiece. Also Half-Life 3 confimed.. Best VR game ever, if you have Vr it is must play. Graphics are very beatiful. Bueno... Desde que me compré mis VR, había enfocado este dispositivo totalmente hacia los simuladores de vuelo, sin atraerme demasiado otros **** **** mi caso, sin ser seguidor de la franquicia de Half Life, me ha tocado descubrirlo todo desde cero, con una historia sencilla, de gente ""de a pie"", con un punto de extraordinario. El guión me ha parecido aceptable, y el mundo un poco arquetípico de este género de juegos (futuro distópico). La historia que no deja de ser una Quest, nos lleva a recorrer una ciudad para alcanzar un objetivo final. Punto, no hay más... no se han roto la cabeza, pero sinceramente funciona. En la mayoría de las historias, en videojuegos, novelas, películas, etc. no cuenta tanto el final del viaje como el viaje en si mismo, y aquí se cumple a **** mejor Los gráficos increíbles, el nivel de detalle que te sorprende en todo momento. Desde la bóveda flotante hasta un simple grifo o un cuaderno son de un realismo que asusta. (Imaginaros ya la impresión de las armas o de las criaturas)2: La inmersión. Creo que este es realmente el punto fuerte de este juego, que lleva a descubrir lo que unas VR (y estamos en sus inicios) pueden llegar a ofrecer. Te mete tanto en el mundo que todo el tiempo quieres seguir avanzando y disfrutar de la **** peor El juego, pese a la aparición de enemigos nuevos y diferentes, y que cada escenario es diferente al anterior, se conviertet en bastante repetitivo. Busca items, resuelve puzles, supera obstáculos, mata a los malos y sigue avanzando.2: Es un juego lineal. El juego funciona en PCs de hace 10 años como el mío, gracias a que han optado por limitar los espacios, y hacer cargas locales pesadas para mantener el ratio de alta calidad/requerimientos de hardware bajos. En un momento en el que los mundos abiertos están empezando a mandar, volver a una estructura de ir del punto A al punto B es un pequeño paso atrás. (Retroceso necesario, pero retroceso al fin y al cabo).Conclusión: Dentro de 5 años no se... pero a día de hoy, si quieres disfrutar al máximo de una experiencia de la VR y pasarlo bien, es de lo más recomendable. Well... Since I bought my VR, I had focused this device totally towards flight simulators, without being too attracted to other genres.I was **** my case, without being a fan of the Half Life franchise, I had to discover everything from scratch, with a simple story, about ""ordinary"" people, with a touch of the extraordinary. I found the script acceptable, and the world a bit archetypal of this genre of games (dystopian future). The story, which is still a Quest, takes us through a city to reach a final objective. Period, there's nothing more... they haven't broken their heads, but honestly it works. In most stories, in video games, novels, movies, etc. The end of the trip does not count as much as the trip itself, and here it is strictly **** best The incredible graphics, the level of detail that surprises you at all times. From the floating vault to a simple faucet or a notebook, they are frighteningly realistic. (Imagine the impression of the weapons or the creatures)2: The immersion. I think this is really the strong point of this game, which leads to discovering what VR (and we are in its beginnings) can offer. It immerses you so much in the world that all the time you want to keep moving forward and enjoy the experience.Worst The game, despite the appearance of new and different enemies, and that each scenario is different from the previous one, becomes quite repetitive. Search for items, solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, kill the bad guys and keep moving forward.2: It is a linear game. The game works on 10-year-old PCs like mine, thanks to the fact that they have chosen to limit the spaces, and make heavy local loads to maintain the ratio of high quality / low hardware requirements. At a time when open worlds are starting to rule, returning to a point A to point B structure is a small step back. (Necessary setback, but setback nonetheless).Conclusion: I don't know in 5 years... but today, if you want to fully enjoy a VR experience and have a good time, it is highly recommended.. Ultimately this did very little with the format. It's the biggest game in VR, sure, but can you honestly say it pushed any boundaries? It barely even took advantage of the index controllers, it did nothing with physics like boneworks, and furthermore it did nothing to make a compelling story for non Half Life fans such as myself. Best vr game ever, a must play (i had some fps drops from time to time but that’s a personal issue). very funy guy says the word""half life 2 episode 2 im gordan freman im in the game half life"". i really liked it when i had it but my stupid self forgot lowering game settings was a thing and REFUNDED IT. really good game!. Far and away the best VR game out there. A legit full fledged game that works incredibly well in VR. Most games like this totally miss the mark and are very dull for an entire campaign and their story might only run 3-4 hours as this is a full 12 hour game. All of the gun handling and combat is also top notch as you expect from Valve as well. A must play that is well worth getting into VR for if you have not yet.. I've been waiting for playing this game since the announcement. I finally got the chance to play this awesome game and I immediately started being addicted to this game. I remember that i was really looking forward to the moment when my VR gets fully charged and I could play again. Best experience connected to playing videogames and I'm really glad that they made it VR exclusive.. One of the best VR games there is... this made me begging Valve for more games... Masterpiece, great controls, amazing hud, enemy types are constantly changing, game never felt too easy or too hard nor repetetive!. the environments are easily the best i've seen in vr, you can pick up pretty much every object it looks like you can. the story is good, the shooting is good, although there isn't much weapon variety compared to other half-life games. the puzzles were mostly good, felt like half-life 2 used its environments more for the puzzles though. overall the best vr game i've played, worth the $80 CAD, but probably better to wait for a sale because i got it for a lot less. It's one of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had. You will constantly forget that you're not actually IN the game because the visuals and immersion are so incredible. The voice acting, gameplay, audio and soundtrack, and story are all gripping.. One of the best video game experience I’ve had in my entire life. Great job Valve. Source 2 engine is the next level , the textures , the lighting , even valve new physics are best right now and i hope valve releases half life 3. I have 30h at HLA, and i can say that its the best vr game at all, i played a lot of vr games, but this one was the best, i played it on low specs with low fps (40-50) butit was still good.. This game is a masterpiece Experience like no other else. Absolutely love it.. This is, honestly, one of the best games I could ever have played as an HL Series fan. I wasn't that much a big fan of solo VR games before playing it, but THIS was and is a masterpiece.. Alyx is an OK game praised for being the first and probably the only AAA game developed specially for VR. The graphics are very nice and the use of the gravity gloves is a nice touch, but the genious gameplay design which made Half-Life and specially Half-Life 2 masterpieces is just not there. The story is bland and the weaponry and enemy variety is scarce, there are barely any physics based puzzles (which would have been just perfect for a VR game) and the foes behavior is beyond dumb to make it an easy going experience even in the hardest difficulty. Some physics interactions are cool, like protecting yourself with car doors or any big item to stop headcrabs jumping at you (which once they hit any object they just become ragdolls for a while). I can understand how it is a good experience or how the ending (the only point where actually anything happens) is a great treat for the fans showing a possible future for the franchise. But other than that it has a very basic gameplay with an overly simplistic level design bringing pretty much nothing new to the table while also falling far away from the standards Half-Life 2 set back in the day.. It's worth playing, and probably the highest quality VR title out there, but my experience playing on a Quest 2 was sub-par. I know it's not designed for that headset. 80% of the time the game would run great. The rest of the time it would crash or the framerate would tank (and not recovery until the game was restarted). Date Completed: 2023-09-22 Playtime: 11h Enjoyment: 7/10 Recommendation: Worth playing. This is the greatest game of all time best graphics sound physics enemy design miles better than mw trashfire 2 woke edition. best pcvr game, why, because its half-life, hopefuilly there will be a sequel in which you play as gordon. What a beautiful way to return in this legendary franchise! Such an immersive gameplay that couldn't be possible without VR. I'm happy they tried this option out, despite all the critics saying they ruined it with the VR stuff. Audiovisual masterpiece with heartwarming ending for a long time fan. That's a serious 10/10 from me! Can't wait to give it a another go wireless with Quest 3.. This game is Incredible. I bought Valve index just because of this masterpiece, Somehow Valve makes this game looks too good in VR. The game looks phenomenal that sometime i fogot it's a VR game lol, it even looks better than many flat games. The Audio and physics system are great too.. Best VR game of all time in the best fps franchise. Characters, narrative, art. All cools. This is an outstanding and moving game. It's much more different than many games and movies.. I played on novr but graphics are so good , gameplay is good only issue is money i buy it for 26$ but I dont count money as an negative buy it on sale lol. Easily the best Half-Life game and probably my vote for greatest video game of all time. 10/10. Best VR experiencie so far, most bad reviews is just people criticizing because a VR game is ony playable on VR, or they don't know anything about half life.. This game just don't get full score because I wanted to play it like a 'regular' shooter, no VR stuff. But God... the game is great! And G-Man is a hot grandpa!. Best vr game to date still in june 2023. I played through this game several times.. Every moment in this game blows my mind. All hail Gaben, he hath delivered. I even forgot I was playing a game after a while. It's the best thing that happened to VR since VR Skyrim. Tabii, Half-Life: Alyx oyununun kötü yanlarına ilişkin bir İngilizce inceleme yazabilirim. İşte örnek bir yazı: Half-Life: Alyx is one of the most hyped virtual reality games of recent years, but it falls short in many areas. While it offers a compelling story and immersive gameplay, there are several aspects that are frustrating and disappointing. Firstly, the game is incredibly demanding on computer hardware. Most players will need a top-of-the-line gaming PC to run it smoothly, which is a huge barrier to entry for many. Additionally, the game's reliance on VR technology limits its audience even further, as not everyone has access to VR headsets. Secondly, the controls can be clunky and unintuitive, particularly when it comes to interacting with objects in the environment. This can be frustrating and immersion-breaking, as players struggle to pick up and manipulate objects in a natural and intuitive way. Finally, the game's pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exploration and puzzle-solving punctuated by intense combat sequences. While this can be effective at times, it can also feel repetitive and unbalanced. Overall, Half-Life: Alyx is a visually stunning and immersive game, but its demanding hardware requirements, clunky controls, and uneven pacing make it a flawed experience.. Best VR game ever.... so far! I'm super happy they brought us back to Half Life. Everything is perfect story Graphics control gameplay voice acting all perfect. Borrowed my friends VR to play this game since I'm a fan of Half-Life. Was skeptical about how it would **** this game blew me away! If you have or can get your hands on a VR then this is a must play. It's a shame this is the only truly AAA VR exclusive currently out, but God Damn, there hasn't been a system-seller this compelling since Super Mario 64. It's good to know Valve hasn't given up on game development, or the half-life franchise. Here's hoping this wasn't a outlier.. this is the best. best looking vr game ever AND ITS HALF LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the story is classive valve flavoured, just perfect it explains so much yet also leaves you on such a big cliff hanger waiting for half life : 2077 (realease date) the graphics are just eye candy (if you dont get motion sick) head crabs actually look terrifying now jumping at you from the dark is horrifying now and the ending is just such a cliff hanger there just needs to be a new title in the half life series when a half life 3 comes out the world is going to end. 10/10 best vr experience ever.. Half Life Alyx is more than proof that Valve still knows how to make godlike games. Do yourself a favor, it is worth to buy a VR headset just for this game (sell the headset later if no other VR game interest you). Most overrated game of all time again in VR. Same way people overrate nonsensical art, they overrate this ""game"" only to show their own superiority and ego. No surprise. The Bussiness of valve stands on those people. - shallow story . shalow npc, blabbering all time - shalow enemies, dead in one hit - easy to play/win gameplay - shallow graphic which is ugly as before, wow, 10 years, nothing changed - ""Gabe"" man image of what gabe tumor newell wanna be, but never be. No reason to play this, what keeps it alive is nostalgia. #StopSteam #StopNewell #FreeGameIndustry. This is one of the best VR games ive ever played, the horror part of the game can be way to scary depending on how scared you get playing games, if you are normally scared playing games i recommend you turn on developer commentary.. Whoever decided to make the game for VR, and especially SteamVR developers - just burn in hell pls. I ruined around 8 hours of my life trying to figure out how to run it as with each new method it just spited another error and in the best case showing black screen instead of game (it worked well on pc screen tho, just couldn't do anything). Don't understand why it was a probleem to just make 2 mods (VR and no-VR) so everyone could try it. Valve could focus on a great gameplay/concepts as they always do, instead of just putting the same game into VR which bugged af and even doesn't work. They'll soon complain that no one buys single player games anymore and continue add new hats to DOTA.. Best vr game i have ever played. The story is great and the game is very detailed. You can clearly tell that the developers put a lot of time and effort into this game and truly cared.. This is hands down the best VR game ever to be made. Its as ground-breaking as Half Life 2 was when that came out. It changed everything. And this has changed the fact that you can make a compelling game in VR, a big budget VR blockbuster. The game itself is just perfect. I love the characters, Russell being the standout for me. His witty lines kept me chuckling throughout. But this is what Valve does best. They make amazing games. This is a thing of beauty when you play it. I've never forgotten I was playing a video game before. But this happened while playing this, someone spoke to me while I was playing and for a second I had to work out where the sound came from. It's the first time I've ever lost myself like that in a game. You know what, I'm submitting this review and I'm going to go play some more.. A breath-taking VR title This is so far ahead of any other VR game. Its simple if you have VR and a machine that can play it buy it!!!. Probably the best VR title so far. I'm not going to debate weather that game has exceeded my own expectations or not, but this is a worthy continuation.. The best VR game I have ever played. Its the only VR game I have played where I forgot I was in VR.. The best VR game ever. The storytelling and puzzles are out of this world. It's a lot of horror and the game gives me anxiety but I'm also living actually inside the world, fighting against the monsters and the combine. I have never gotten such experience in any other game.. very interesting plot cool graphics some pluses waiting for half-life 3 continue 10 out of 10. Very good game. Very great interactivity and a lot of player interaction with the world. Good graphics, game design and thoughtfulness.. Valve's still got it! This is a great VR game. It's a great Half-Life game. The graphics are the best I've ever seen in VR. The story is phenomenal. There is more comedy than I'm used to in my half-life but that's not a bad thing. Some other parts are downright terrifying and I had to take a break after. The interaction with the environment is done well, from the way you can place your hands against things to the way you can push around objects. The ending hits like a punch to the gut. Please don't make me wait another 13 years for the next one! My only disappointment is the lack of throwing or melee combat. In a game where you can pick up and throw literally everything around you it seems like a huge missed opportunity.. Masterpiece of gaming Everyone should play just for this. even My **** RX470 graphics card, this game was **** amazing Btw don't use Oculus. worst mistake of my life. use Windows MR or HTC instead. A İNCREDİBLE GAME FROM BEST GAME SERİE. İ HOPE SERİE CONTİUNE WİTH HALFLİFE 3. An insane VR experience, the best by far. HL:ALYX looks like a PC video game, it is insane how they have been anle to create this world where you can interact with everything along with those beaautiful graphics. Valve has set a new standard for VR games,. This is easily in my list of favorite games of all time (no, not just VR-Games). This IS the first AAA VR-Game and can easily hold itself against the best Games ever made. ------- At the same time, it captures the essence of the amazing Half-Life Universe perfectly while also bringing some new aspects to it (like a speaking protagonist, new creatures and of course everything that comes with it being a VR-Game). The Story and especially world-building is (as always for Half-Life) almost perfect, even if in the first few chapters there is not much going on in our main storyline. This, like many other decisions like it, could however be seen as a strategic choice by Valve in order to slowly introduce Players to VR and even Half-Life itself (as it will be the case for many players since the last Half-LIfe is 13 years old). ------- At the end of the day, this game is easily a 10/10 for me and probably in my top 5 games of all time so far.. Half Life: Alyx really shows the potential of what VR gaming has to offer. It clearly shows that there are some experiences only VR can accomplish, and I'm 100% certain it laid the groundworks for triple A VR games to come out in the future. Is it a perfect game on it's own? No. But it does have a unique experience you can't replicate in a non-VR way.. Only thing that can be said Masterpiece. Greatest VR game. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 10 Back ~ ~ ~ ~ ~. I played the game through oculus quest 2 link cable and I really enjoyed **** graphics looked good to me. The music, gameplay, and story were all awesome.. This is the beginning of the greatest revolution in the gaming industry that I have ever seen. The ending is amazing! I put 10/10 without any doubt! This is the future!. So much better than expected – a real Halflife game in every way and also THE best VR-game so far. Absolutely love it. Halflife 3 in VR? Yes, take my money!. One of the best games I have ever played. If you have a VR headset get this asap. It goes 50% off on major steam sales. Gunplay, immersion, graphics, atmosphere, story. It's all here.. Long time ago I was played Half Life-2 and sometimes my hands trembled and sweated. This was amazing game, very convincing and empathetic. Today many games is nothing worth, like new Assassin's Creed series, new Far Cry series, and others... But Alyx! Alyx is super game, very impressive! My hands tremble and sweat again! It's incredible! A rare game today leaves such an impression. Half life alyx.............................................................. Masterpiece. Most innovative game I've played in my life. It was also nice to return to HL universe after a decade.. One of the best VR games I have ever played. But look out for Jeff. He's a mean one.. The best VR game to date and a fantastic continuation of the half-life saga, It's the closest thing we got to a half life 3.. A really amazing experience. The only drawbacks is the price point of hardware which is hardly the games fault in reality. Story is a bit bland but all the ambience and places you visit are well crafted and truly nice to look at.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 8/10 - Very good. (after 27 hours of playing & completing the game) A sensational VR game, it restores my faith in this universe. A slightly horror-like atmosphere, a sensational ending. Fighting with melee weapons is missing. Shooting is very enjoyable, the need to manually reload the weapon is really cool. You can pick up a lot of items and even deflect a jumping headcrab with them, but it won't deal any damage to him. Unique VR experience. I played the game slowly and played with everything I could find. Great graphics and lots of beautiful places. It was a really fun experience to play through this game I was playing VR on Oculus Quest 2 and Samsung HMD Odyssey + (Windows Mixed Reality). At first, it was an amazing game, I absolutely loved it, however, after less than 2 hours of playtime, the game started instantly crashing when launched, saying Timed out waiting for response from mongoose. This bug has been around since the day after its release, and it still hasn't been addressed. I tried contacting steam support however they were completely incompetent and there seems to be no set solution online, only solutions that seem to apparently work for some people and not work for others. Utterly disappointed. Eventually, I just got a refund because after 5 hrs total of attempting to fix this bug, multiple requests for support from steam, all they had to give me was half baked solutions like ""You should remove razer software"" which I did, and it still didn't work and ""You should verify your game files"" which I had already done multiple times and I prefaced the whole interaction saying that I had already verified my files for both HL: Alyx and SteamVR multiple times, they also told me to go into the beta version, which I knew wouldn't work due to their incompetence to fix a single bug over the span of more tha","quest 3 is a long waited continuation of the famous series. A good project. Enjoyed it a lot. Hands down, das BESTE SPIEL auf VR.Punkt."
950.Star Wars Pinball,"If it's on sale for 14 bucks like it is right now. It's a no brainer. One of the big 3 pinball games on switch. Demon's Tilt. FX3 and this. One Day I will buy a switch Pinball cabinet :). A perfectly-good pinball game from the experts at Zen Studios, with Star Wars trappings. Positives: - Great pinball gameplay - Lots of tables - Interesting table designs and mechanics that work wonderfully with the source material - No Grogu Negatives: - Only uses music from the original film trilogy (1977-1983), which feels very out of place with tables based on the newer movies - Sound-alikes are used for most voice lines instead of the original actors, and they just sound ""wrong"" Recommended for: - Star Wars fans who enjoy pinball Similar games you might enjoy: - Pinball FX3 - Star Wars Pinball (Wii U) - The Pinball Arcade. If you love Star Wars and pinball you're in for a good time here! 19 tables provide lots of variety and the sound effects and extra visual effects add a lot to the overall experience. There are a number of novel challenges which help to keep things fresh and everything is very shiny and professionally finished to a very high standard. The addition of minigames as features of some tables is also a nice inclusion. An absolute bargain at 40% off but also worth a full price purchase if you are a fan of Star Wars and pinball games.. Scrapped my old 7 score. I love this game. Not in to Star Wars, borderline dislike Star Wars. I can take, or leave pinball but this game has had me wanting to watch films again that I never liked in the first place and wanting to play pinball. Just an amazingly fun game.. good. great pattern. lots of tables, some of them I knew from the past. Not all of them are good. Good challenge, great theme, miss old school pinball. If you like pinball and Star Wars, this game is as close to perfection as you're likely to get. Playing in vertical mode is a game changer for pinball games, the HD rumble is very immersive, and the value is frankly incredible (19 intricate licensed tables for $30 feels like robbery). The career mode is surprisingly well thought out too. The gameplay is more addicting that you're likely prepared for. After all, it's just pinball, right? Prepare to be wrong. Minus one point for some of the voice acting. Really though, this game is perfection.. Best pinball game for Switch at the moment. Music,Effects,Voices,Graphics,Hd Rumble ... all converge together for an excellent experience","if you like pinball and star wars, this game is as close to perfection as you're likely to get . it's a bargain at 40% off but also worth a full price purchase if you are a fan of Star Wars and pinball games ."
951.Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords,"This game is love on the 2nd sight. In the first sight you will be disappointed by the bad graphics, bad tutorials (which are just videos) and the boring campaign (in the first mission, your ally will win the scenario for you lol). But if you read the manual and maybe a bit in the internet, you understand, that the free games and the AI are the focus of this game. You can set the AI algorithm and the economy bonus/ malus even separately, so I recommend to change only the economy that suits your skill and give the best algorithm possible. The free game is very complex and focus on the big research tree and the modular system to create ships. There are 12 races that are played very differently and you can build one, anyway there should be more races. There are some mods to improve the game, I recommend APT 1.3, that change the research tree a bit, because the AI tends to make some mistakes there. In addition there is the little graphic mod HRG. The sound and music are ok. After loading a game I had a bug with the drawing of the borders and my cultural influence was wrong. Of course this is unacceptable and I lost the motivation to continue","free game is very complex and focus on the big research tree and the modular system to create ships . there are some mods to improve the game, I recommend APT 1.3, that change the research tree a bit . after loading a game I had a bug with the drawing of the borders and my cultural influence was wrong ."
952.Planet Puzzle League,"Both easier and more competitive than tetris. Fun mainly because of the garbage you send your opponent. This game is played for multiplayer.. What gives this lower score than the actual puzzle game really deserves is the lack of depth and originality. The only add-on compared to the other Puzzle League games are items (which, of course, ruins the game in my opinion). Still a good game to bring on the road.",the only add-on compared to the other Puzzle League games is items . the only add-on compared to the other Puzzle League games are items .
953.Animal Crossing: Wild World,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I **** LOVE ANIMAL CROSSING: WILD WORLD!. Good in concept but too much grinding for little to no reward. Move into a cartoon town, swap pleasantries with its animal inhabitants and perform tedious tasks for a slavedriving raccoon. Dullsville.. I feel like this game would have been better if it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather. Put simply, this game is extremely unappealing in 2023. Outside of the graphics, which are awful but also aged surprisingly well for a DS game from 2005, it's just not possible to go back to this game because your town will be filled with **** weeds. Let's face it: If you played this as a kid, you probably haven't touched it since 2010. That means weeds have been growing in your town for 13 long years. It would take a while to pluck them out. I get that this game might have seemed great back when it came out, but it hasn't aged well. Because now there's a ton of weeds in your town.. Pretty much the most basic entry in the series which isn’t a bad thing, WW excels in the villager aspect, the one thing keeping me from playing the game is the graphics, I cannot stand these bad graphics, I know it’s an old game but it just aged poorly. Other than that it’s pretty good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I didn't play this much as a kid, yet the little bit I played was really memorable. I just wish I was either smarter or the game did a better job of guiding stupid players into understanding what you're actually supposed to do in the game.. I used to play this game loads as a kid but when I went back and played it again recently, I discovered it wasn’t very good. I only played the start but it was really boring.. This game is so freaking good that i can only cry every time i start a new town. The intro scene is just so soothing and the experience with the villagers feels so real... Best game ever, no further objections.. copycat but less features compared to anch pros bell system nooks cranny added upgrades town hall services planting cons very few. Comparing Wild World to the other Animal Crossing Installments, this version feels very limited in gameplay, events, and difficulty. Still, it has enough winning touches to play this game in short bursts. Overall, this isn't a game for everyone.. Animal Crossing Wild World was a fan's dream for the franchise when it came out and I loved the original on GC. The idea of being able to play it on the go was something I could only dream about and seeing it come to fruition on the DS was incredible. Considering how early on this came out within the DS' lifespan it is a masterpiece by all means. Graphically, gameplay-wise, technically, and with its music. Stylistic, casual, comforting are the notes that Wild World hits and if you want to just kick back and relax then this would have been the game for you/ I think now, the newer entries in the series would be more suitable, but it is worth saying that this game is a classic and has a special place in my heart. I'd go into further detail, but this game has been reviewed into exhaustion.. Sloppy Compared To The New Versions And There's So Little To Be Done! It's Like, ""It's A Small World After All!"". Hello, I'm Reggie from Nintendo, and I'm here to tell you that Nintendo has officially taken over the world. Under our new leaders, all real holidays have been outlawed, and will be replaced with new holidays such as Yay Day and La-Di-Day. Failure to celebrate these new holidays will result in severe punishment.. I see people complaining about how Resetti screams at you for not saving before powering down. I always liked this, because it made sure that I always saved, because that's how you're supposed to do it. You want to save your progress. I am personally of the opinion that this is the best game in the series.. After Pokemon HeartGold my all time favorite game for Nintendo DS. Spent so many hours catching all fish, bugs and much more.. God, the more i think about this awesome game the more possibility's come to my mind: digging for fossils, go to the housparty of your neighbours, design your own clothes... and, and, and..love everything in this game. Ahh wait there was one thing which was awful: Mr. Resetti!!!. The map is mainly covered up by dirt and there are no holidays. I was less invested in this game than any other Animal Crossing game because of this. Wild World has great dialogue that makes this game worth buying for the price of pretty much nothing it brings nowadays. But what easily makes this the worst game in the series is the fact that MY BOY RON RESETTI ISN'T EVEN IN THIS GAME! WHAT A DISGRACE. Easily one of my favorite characters. Still an enjoyable game aside from that major issue.. Honestly as much as I like new leaf, as well as feel that the features were way better in it, Wild world was a much bigger part of my childhood. It honestly all had to do with the timing of things though rather than the games. I remember all 3 of my brothers and I had a separate animal crossing and we would always be playing together and honestly those times made us so close. It astonishes me that we would milk so many hours out of such a simple game doing such pointless stuff and somehow having so much fun. I really wish there was a way to see how much time was spent in each game on the original ds like there is on the 3ds because I spent so many hours on wild world. This game was a huge impact to see a game shift from a console to a handheld and be this amazing, I was so impressed by this game and it got me so hooked on the series that even today I am still waiting for a new animal crossing game to be released for the switch, please Nintendo. A fun little game that anyone could remember. Sure, in my opinion it's basically just the gamecube one but the graphics are worse but it's still a fun game and with the new multiplayer it makes it a bit better!. Game's beautiful. It doesn't have alot of things or action, but's great. Period. The game's beautiful, just go play it right now! Why aren't you playing it?!. Graphics - 8 Music - 10 Gameplay - 9 Content - 10 Personal Fun - 10 Difficulty - 1 .. What made this game so good, was that it was on the DS. This meant you could go anyway when bored, and just play. Most of the times, it's a great game to distract yourself from your own life (especially if your life was **** and just talk to some humanoid animals, because you didn't have any friends to talk to. Anyways, the main part of the game is to customise your house with furniture that you got randomly (some being rare) and expanding it. Just something you could play to kill time.. Hmm I want to have animal crossing on a handheld. - Said someone from 2005. Well this game wild world will not let you down. The graphics look right the villagers look as cute as the original game was. Everything is great but it's not 100% perfect it's 99.99% perfect.. I may be biased because I've played New Leaf first, but I definitely think that New Leaf is the superior game. That being said, Wild World isn't a bad game by any measurements, but it may be best for people who want to get into Animal Crossing but don't have a 3DS. It's still got a lot of cute and fun Animal Crossing charm to it, but being that it was on an older device than the newest AC game, the graphics and sound quality aren't as good, and I do find some things annoying like that characters that want to fish or catch bugs won't let me talk to them about anything else until I agree to do it and then go find them, especially in the winter when bugs are harder to find. But it's still a cute game.. Still love this game! It's not fantastic compared to the following AC games, but that's normal. I still play it every once in a while, it never gets old. Gotta love the oldskool stuff.. I love the Animal Crossing series but this is my least favourite out of the main series games. If I was writing this before New Leaf I would have rated it a 7 but this is after New Leaf. It has less features compared to the gamecube version which is to be expected on worse hardware. I have attempted to get into this game multiple times but it would start to feel like a chore at just the 3rd day. The town is also way smaller than in Gamecube and the villager limit is the lowest in the series. In conclusion if you have played Gamecube or New Leaf before this game will be a bore. However it is good for things like long car rides.. really fun game, you are given so much freedom to do what you want to do, I just wish there was more to do because the only thing I really wanted to do is go fishing. When I was to lazy to do anything in my world, I would go into this game to get some work done. It gave me the space to create a world that was comfy and fun. Fishing, Fossil hunting, Shopping, Decorating, and hanging out with friends were some of the many things this game offered.. Probably the least likable installment in one of Nintendo's most charming franchises, Wild World simply lacks the variety its best-selling predecessor (and the exciting New Leaf, which came in 2013) and even for its time, is a disappointment for fans looking for more than just running around, catching bugs, catching fish, buying, selling, etc. However, that's not to say the game isn't enjoyable in general, the new spherical landscape makes for a far more original experience and the ability to connect with friends online makes it even more exciting. But beyond that, check out the newest installment if you're looking for an adventure on the go.. Pick this one up if your looking for a open ended laid back game. No action, instead you'll find yourself watering flowers, Fishing, catching bugs, Interacting with your fellow villagers, buying cool items at Nook's Cranny. Definitely worth buying, Really fun. Picking fruit, Running errands, Mailing letters, And even breeding flowers is something you'll be doing in Animal Crossing: Wild World. If that sounds like fun, I'd go buy this right now.. Awesome, funny, charming and fascinating. Every animal has a well outlined personality and their blabbering language is so much fun! The museum, the café, the constellations, the house decorations, the festivals... everything is so inspiring!. This is a great game! The game has hours of amazing content and does a great job of making you play the game almost every day and make every time feel rewarding.. One of the best games on the DS! I have had animal crossing for a long time, and I went through phases of going on it constantly and then stopping for sometimes months or even years. You have your own character (girl/boy) you have your own home, and when you pay of your mortgage you get a bigger house. I think I am on the third biggest house. There are two shops (one clothes one furniture), you get money from giving flowers, acorns, fish, money from trees, and anything you don't want; and so you can buy things from that. There are contests and tournaments, and a sale in each house to buy things from each others houses, you can hook up with your mates, and get mail from places and people. There are about 4 different houses to start off with, but then more people come and leave, and you end up having about 8. After being on it for a long time, you get bored with your village and decide to move, but you basically then start again. When I first got it, I had to buy a new animal crossing because it wouldn't let me log into my account, it was on someone elses random village. The one problem is, is that if you forget to save in your bed, you get a big telling of by a mole! If you get told off about 5 times, he starts asking you to say sorry over 15times, so I suggest you remember to save before turning off!I would definitely recommend this to any child! great DS game!. This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. The music is wonderful, and if you're sick is one of the most friendly games. It has an especial humor and a lot of things to do! It is very relaxing, i can't wait to animal Crossing 3D!. The game is good for a bit before you get bored. The original game cube and the new Wii version are amazing, but the new events and so made it a bit entertaining over the game cube but I was definitely disappointed. When CF came out, I was joyed at how good it was. This one is okay, but never met the expectations I had been holding for a year.. A fun game, with a long lifetime considering how the game changes over time with the ingame clock. What it lacks though is content. The world is very, very small, but the regular events, large amount of items and neighbours, and other random occurring stuff keeps it interesting. The co-op play is quite fun aswell.. So cute, original characters. It is inevitable that the Nintendo team has put years of hard effort in it to make this such a great breakthrough. Very addictive, and you become very engaged with the little lives of the little residents of your town. Very charming. Probably the best Animal Crossing game of them all.. I love this game a lot, but what really ruins it for me is if you don't save before turning off your DS.... THIS F****** MOLE STARTS SWEARING AT YOU FOR LIKE 3 HOURS! It ruins the whole tone of the game! it ****!. This game is centred around taking your time. If you don't have too much time on your hands (like me), this game isn't for you. However, after playing this game for a while I found that someone with a lot of time (and an unhealthy habit of falling in love with video game characters, literally; this game encourages you to write love letters and poems to animals, not to mention some of the male animals commenting on themselve having a groin cramp)this. game is infact quite enjoyable. Bottom line: no violence, no fast paced action; only for casual gamers. Animal Crossing: Wild World is as addictive as ever now that it's in the palm of your hands. Pros: Lots to do, items to collect, and extras/secrets to unlock; Nintendo WFC makes for fantastic multiplayer value; ridiculously charming visuals; funny dialogue. Cons: It's missing a lot of valuable features from the GCN game, such as NES games.. Animal Crossing: Wild World is the first installment on the DS to use Nintendo WFC, the funnest aspect of the game as a whole. Pros: It's Animal Crossing in the palm of your hands; Nintendo WFC makes for fantastic multi-player mode; as addictive as ever. Cons: Eliminates a lot of the best aspects from the Gamecube version, such as features, scenery, and the playable NES titles.. I wouldn't call this game fun but I guess it's ok.. Best if played with a friend, and the more you have on here the more you will play. Colorful and cute, this game is well animated and easy to learn to play. There are tons of things to unlock, as well as items to obtain. It will keep you busy, but don't leave for too long or accidentally turn the power off without saving. They get mad at you and it is oddly funny when they do.","if you played this as a kid, you probably haven't touched it since 2010 . the graphics are awful but also aged surprisingly well for a DS game from 2005 . the intro scene is just so soothing and the experience with the villagers feels so real ."
954.DmC: Devil May Cry,"i like the gameplay of this game,it's feels so satisfying but the story of this game is way out of context original Devil May Cry so give it shot!!. This reboot from Ninja Theory (Heavenly Sword), maintains the crazy wild action from previous games. But it also adds a bizarre style comparable to ""Bayonetta"". The action is terrific and the story is well-told through exceptional cutscenes. But some fans may not like some of the changes. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.5 out of 10.. If you're able to divorce these characters from their counterparts in the mainline series, then this is a rewarding experience. The combat is electric, the RPG elements worthwhile, the platforming surprisingly fun. Some of the humor doesn't land, but the story ends up being pretty good and the game as a whole successfully delivers its own unique style and tone.. This game has some of the worst dialogue I’ve ever heard in my life. Not to mention this game’s gameplay is so boring and basic.. Controversies aside, this game is simply incredible! The combat system is both accessible and deep, the art and graphics are incredible, the story is captivating, and the soundtrack is still insane!. It's really bad in terms of story and scenario, the air of Dante and Vergil is gone,It's a mechanically perfect **** graphics are also average, so you won't grin. The best hack and slash game ever 10/10 Level design is perfect shifting and moving have vivid colors, attacks have a heavy sense of impact, music is top notch, combo announcer is perfect, easy to create a combo, i love how the camera zoom in to enemies when they die and splashes a black bloods this game is just perfect for me, i wish a sequel of this game with the same developer Ninja Theory they did a great Job. Bad game, worse than Devil May Cry 4, better than a big poopoo peepee attack. Really good game but very boring story. Good combat story's is alright but they changed Dante why too much its a shame because they did good with the combat I don't expect any sequels from this one even though they had that cliffhanger with Virgil campaign. Ninja Theory's reboot of DMC is a worthy installment in the series. It's a non-canon entry that fuses a ""Matrix""-like scenario with ""Bayonetta"" type gameplay. If you liked NInja Theory's previous games, than you'll certainly enjoy this. However, the new Dante and silly ""edgy"" adult content may not appeal to everyone. I liked the overhauled combat and the emphasis on a story narrative. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.6 out of 10.. As someone who played the original DMC's, I can assure you that this remake is faithful to its roots. If you enjoyed the PS2 versions of DMC, you will almost certainly like this remake. People complained about Dante's appearance, personality, etc. and I get that, but it didn't bother me. The whole game has a modern Blade/Constantine (the movie) vibe to it, which I thought was perfect for a reboot of this franchise. If you never played the originals, but like games like Bayonetta, you will love this game!. Come on People! This is an great Game and Ninja Theory did an great Job! Great Graphics on Xbox 360 and a great Game!. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 6/10 Technical aspects : 7/10 Repeatability: 7/10. I'm one of the few people who thinks this part is the best. For comparison , after that I tried to play all parts of DMC for the first time and couldn't stand it for more than an hour. There are also very addictive gameplay mechanics and stunning graphics. A bunch of different modes and at least two huge campaigns for Dante and Virgil. The most delicious part of the game is of course the fights. The combat system here literally blows the roof off. The game arsenal is represented by pistols and melee weapons (sword, axe, scythe), and something will appear later. With this set, you can do simply unthinkable things. Thanks to the combination of combat techniques inherent in each individual weapon, you can build a huge number of attacks to fight the enemy. The fights look spectacular, are beautifully animated and are accompanied by bright and colorful special effects. Here I would also like to note the high-quality optimization: the game is not particularly demanding to the characteristics of computer hardware, and it is also perfectly adapted to the control of the keyboard and mouse The best game from the DMC Devil May Cry universe #DMC DEVIL MAY CRY 2 LIFE, Ninja Theory......... First isssue is that this is not a DMC game.. Its a grinfe Americal knock off that fails to emulate the coolnes and fun ofvthe real games.. The game starts out gringey and while itinially the combat feels fun it get boring ver fast.. The whole game is generic and underwheslming.. Whilst the gameplay is still fun, DMC had a below par story with unlikable characters and treated the legacy of the series awfully.. So this isn't Devil May Cry 3, boo-hoo, get over it... The game is fun it it's own right as a solid action game. The plot, while not the most deep or thought provoking (but when has the plot of DMC been? It's all about game play and flash anyway), it still manages to be entertaining, albeit a 'They Live' knock off. The combat has decent amount of depth to it, and some of the weapon switch combos can be downright brutal. While not too many of your custom combos will be terribly execution heavy, some that utilize multiple weapons and keep enemies in the air are satisfying. The fact that the game is a re-imagining of the series, and Dante isn't ""Dante"", people will throw 0's at it like they are playing washers and trying to get it around the pole.. Thanks Capcom&Ninja Theory for forever tainting Devil May Cry. Because of this Devil May Cry 5 looks terrible.. The reboot of Devil May Cry is a very questionable issue that I still to this day don't know why it was necessary. The series might have had one subjectively bad game, but with 4 being a solid and good entry from 3, a straightforward sequel after a 5 year wait was inevitable. Seeing DmC's teaser trailer and design for Dante caused outrage (to say the least) by fans of the series and many were ready to write off the game at launch as another DMC2. Now that the game has been out for a good long time, I can say (even back then and as a fan of the series) that I like DmC: Devil May Cry. Despite the issues it has in characters and development, combat and bosses, I generally liked the Western take of the game that actually did something different. The visuals are actually really great and comparing to the clear and clean textures of DMC4, I prefer DmC's art style for its edgier look. The music is also really freaking good, with Combichrist and Noisia producing nice beats to fighting demons. Although im a **** for the more ""trashy anime"" vibe 3 and 4 gave, I still generally regard the soundtrack as good. The combat is often one of the biggest hot topics for this game. It feels far too easy to string combos and rank too high with little challenging. I suppose one can argue it would allow newcomers to have an easier time with the game and its setup, but veterans suffer from far too simple mission ratings of SSS's even on harder difficulties. The use of Angel and Demon weapons on top of Rebellion and the three guns is a enjoyable system and improves on DMC4 when looking at Dante's setup in that game. Stringing together combos and abilities can be quite amazing at points despite how easy it is to get SSS marks from a few multi group chains. The Devil Trigger is lacking in power and potential: it creates a shockwave that changes the visuals to black red and white impressively and allows Dante to send all enemies in the air, deal far more damage and regen health. This of course doesnt add more moves that DMC4's Dante, thus making it less in depth for combat by a significant amount and also the speed and ferocity isn't felt that 3 and 4 nailed perfectly as Dante. Overall, despite the ease of ranking and certain mechanics downplayed, the combat is great. Enemy variety is decent, but suffers from 2's use of just carbon copies with higher health pools. Only one enemy is truly a challenge while the rest are serviceable but not hard hitting as the previous entries in any. Boss variety is a mixed bag: I liked the Hunter, Vergil, and Lilith but Succubus, Bob Bargas, and Mundus is underwhelming and seem more like gimmicks than actual fights. Vergil's fight is one of the best fights in the whole series thoughand I will argue it is because of how it's paced and structured. Dante as a character is very conflicting to talk about; on one hand he still retains his rebellious side, but he is far more ""in your face"" with it than I would be comfortable with. His lines arent that great and he seems like a punky **** to everyone instead of being a goofy **** that the series is known for. The hair gag was in poor taste and wasn't necessary. Vergil lacks any sort of coolness or caution unlike his version in 3, and Kat's Wiccan attitude isn't really that compelling. Devil May Cry has never been strong with stories or characters, but having a memorable gag or goofy line is far better than a brooding one. The linearity is better than the first few games, as it has no backtracking at the cost of exploration of previous areas. The use of the swinging weapons are interesting, but are just used to get to A to B. Nothing worthy to note there. The missions with keys needed to unlock is great to encourage players, but unfortunately mix up the doors and keys in missions that earlier on you can't access and result in a forced low grade for collectibles. It's a bit of a chore and clearly wasn't in the previous games, but once done you ALWAYS have a high mark. DmC: Devil May Cry might have stupid moments and conflicting implementations, but I still think it's a fun game to play when you see it as a hack n slash and only that. Many will denounce it too harshly for being an insult to the series, but really some ideas and themes really go a long ways in creativity that only the first game had when it came to level design and structure. It's not for everyone, but if you like hack n slash games and not a whiner over petty criticisms on areas that were never meant to be the strength of the game nor its main series, then DmC: Devil May Cry is worth your time.. I've put about 130 hours into this game (more than even DMC 3), getting triple S on all Dante Must Die (the hardest difficulty without a gimmick) missions. Still haven't gotten that for the expansion though, but someday I'm sure I will. Now this is an action game: to have hours played competing with an RPG is deserving of extreme praise. Everyone hates the main character (I think he's a great fit personally), but if you can get 130 hours out of an ACTION game, you really should not care about the story, or characters. The combat is most important. This game's combat is riveting, except maybe against the Ice knights. Fights are just far more intricate in this game than in the other Devil May Cry games. Hitting large groups at once, juggling enemies in the air, dodging in the air, parrying by attacking into an opponents attack. I like the combat in this DMC much better than in the others, but a big part of that is just having an easy to use dodge. Also, as I said, I got triple S (the highest score rank), but what I didn't add is that I did that without a lock-on system. You're really fine without it, unless you love the guns I guess. One thing I should note, and advise about, is that it is better not to figure out the key to each enemy type (I'm specifically thinking about the fat guys and the ninjas). You could just crush enemies by putting your key in the hole, but it is better to let the enemies fight back. Do not always fight just to get the high score, or easy kills. In this way, the game will be significantly more fun for those trying to get fun out of it, and less fun for the rest. Also, make an effort to keep your camera on the enemies, as only the ranged ones attack from off screen. This last thing is a major flaw in my opinion.. This is the best Slasher of 2013. Best gameplay of the series and fantastic atmosphere. One big minus is a characters and story, but story was never best side of the franchise.. I played Devil May Cry 4, but I like to new design of Dante. I enjoy this DmC more, I feel DMC4 a little boring and this is much more fun. The environment design is pretty awesome too.. As a not diehard Devil May cry fan i enjoyed this game very **** best of hack and **** the bad is that the Devil May Cry franchise has never been full hack and slash,had more puzzles and sharper story.I understand that the change of the main characters also brought some negativity,but overall i find this game amusing for me.. DmC is a mixed bag. on one hand, it completely derails all of the fan favourite DMC characters, on the other, it makes the combat fun and engaging. first, lets go over the story, you play as Emo Dante who lives in a caravan, because why not, right? Dante gets greeted by Cardboard Kat, and Dante gets attacked by Demons, so Dante uses Ebony and Ivory, and Rebellion to fight his way out. then Dante meets his twin brother Vergil who tells Dante they should be a team to kill the Demon King Mundus, who killed their mother and imprisoned their father. So Dante goes around doing all the dirty work for Kat and Vergil. Before I continue, can i just ask why Capcom completely uprooted Dante and turned him into a Emo potty mouth **** bag? or why they derailed Vergils character? who barely does anything until the very end of the game? Sorry, but this game pissed me off, the only thing that holds this game up is the superb combat and mechanics, and even that does't compare to other hack'n'slash games out there. Don't pay full 60$ for this game, just pay 5$ or 10$, or better yet, buy the DMC HD Collection, you'll be happier with yourself.. The game looks stunning,Dante is really hot character,secondary characters look really nasty but awesome as well,the gameplay is fun when it comes to fighting with different weapons to extend combos,the platforming could of worked a bit better though.A game you'll probably have a blast with i know i did.. Very addictive combat, if nothing else. If you've played devil may cry 4, or bayonetta, you'll feel right at home with this game. I loved bayonetta, but I have to say, this game edges it out in terms of action and visuals. It is almost on par with arkham city for action. Pros: - The gameplay is sweet. Switching between angel and demon mode is pretty cool, and makes up some really cool combos. The combat is more realistic, too. - The level designs are visually stunning and definitely worth playing through. Limbo is really cool. - Bob Barbas and Mundus make cool villains. - Good story. Say what you want about the characters. They story was good. It clearly rips off They Live however, but it's still worth playing through. - Good voice acting. It sounds more natural than the original, and even as a standalone game, its voice acting is pretty good. Cons: - No targeting system. It's really a pain in the ass when you're trying to kill one demon and end up shooting another. Also sometimes I would be in the air trying to Angel Dash to another platform, but the camera would auto target the demons in the previous platform and I would dash in the wrong direction and fall. - The characters are just awful. The good guys to be specific. Dante's redesign isn't too bad, but what's the point of making his hair black? They didn't do it for Vergil. It doesn't make any sense. His hair turns white in the end anyway. Alright, let's be frank. Dante is a mean-spirited ****, and lacks any charm and comes off as unapproachable. Vergil is a coward, talks like a weirdo and his motivations and goals don't make any sense. Kat is the dullest character (less dull than 4's Kyrie, though) in the game, and her backstory doesn't help make her interesting either. It's funny how we knew less about the classic Dante and he was still likable and interesting, but we know so much about the new Dante and he comes off as dull and annoying. Lesson: sometimes less is more. I think the worse part about the new Dante is that he's a try-hard version of the original. You can see the Ninja Theory was trying to make him appeal to everyone, both the general audience and the Devil May Cry fans, and they fail at it. I think I would've preferred Ninja Theory's original vision of Dante. You know, the really emo one. Just change his look, make his hair white and you could've had an interesting, emotionally unstable version of Dante. It could've been what Skyfall was to the 007 franchise. It's funny because the creator said that he didn't care what people thought about his Dante, but he clearly does and it shows. And Vergil... Oh my god. How can they make a character this bad? - The dialogue is terrible. Dante's interaction with the Succubus was the worst. You know, where they yell **** you"" to each other three times. You can tell Ninja Theory had to completely scrap the idea of a PTSD Dante, and they had to write up something really quick. Only problem is it really shows. The dialogue is at its worst. - Dante's backstory doesn't work. For example, Dante being in conflict with his demon side and his human side? **** it. Let's make him a super-powered nephillim. An angel-demon hybrid. But let's still have him questioning his humanity for some reason. Seriously, Ninja Theory, either you're trying to make him different from the original or you're trying to make him similar. Choose one. Or if you're trying to do both, at least make it consistent. Making Dante a nephillim was pretty creative, but having him do things the original demon-human hybrid is just weird. Also, Dante was apparently tormented by demons. Then why isn't he more like the original vision than the wise cracking, badass classic? Changing Dante's backstory and trying to make him more like the classic? Nope. Just makes the character worse and less interesting. - The ending is **** The conflict is so forced. Seriously, Vergil, who was willing to sacrifice Kat for Dante, tries to kill his brother. Oh, he needed his brother to defeat Mundus but now he doesn't need him anymore, you say? Vergil could've done this whole job himself. Don't bull**** me. He is both ""smart"" and strong. He didn't even need Dante. They just wanted to make Vergil the bad guy and set up a sequel. I mean can you imagine Vergil being a villain in the next game? Mundus was a good villain because they make him out to be an **** throughout the game, but in the end they put a twist in it. Mundus explains his ideals; what would happen if humanity had freedom. And you actually feel sorry for Mundus because our **** protagonists killed his child. Vergil would be the worst villain. He's whiny, stupid and his character traits are more inconsistent than Dante's. Story- 8/10 Main Characters - 1/10 Gameplay - 8.5/10 Level Design - 9/10 Dialogue - 2/10 Voice Acting - 7.5/10 Villains - 7/10 Creativity (As a Reboot) - 4/10 Overall - 5.875/10, so basically 6/10 This game is worth your time. It's not as bad as some people it out to be, but it's not as good either as others make it out to be. But you should definitely play it. Sure, the characters and dialogue are terrible, but there are still good aspects in the game. The gameplay and design are the best aspects. So yeah, give it a shot.. Really enjoyed this, I mean I can get why people were hating the new take on Dante and Virgil, I hated the whole hipster look and attitude and the girl was very irritating. However the fighting system was simple enough to get into but getting more abilities could up the challenge of combo moves which made fighting enjoyable. The last boss **** big time but most of the others were amazing, and some of Dantes dialogue was actually pretty funny, the fanboys will always cry when something in 'their' game changes, I hated this game when it was first announced myself but found it much later on sale a while after it had been out and was very surprised when i played it, I completed it three times and will probably buy it again for the Xbox One. Basically, don't make the same mistake as me and judge the game before playing it.. DmC: Devil May Cry has got to be the worst entry in the series, reboot or not; nothing seen in this game relates to the original series other than character, weapons, items and location names. The story is as basic as any modern day game with no effort placed into it; the characters that are borrowed from the original series have no relation to who they originally were. Dante, or in my case ""Jerry"" as I call him, is more of a lazy character who complains about everything and cares only for himself; Vergil somewhat is like his original but isn't as smart as the original; Mundus, now with a incorrect pronounced name, has been butchered from evil demon to business man whose boss battle is far less entertaining and challenging than the original. Apart from this, Kat, who is new in this game, is somewhat helpful but only appears when the plot needs her. The gameplay is still intact with its combo craziness and honestly, it works here as it did within the originals; the weapons included are at best alright but i rarely use the grenade gun or the scythe. Enemies are mixed to plain boring in terms of attacks; one enemy called the Witch shields herself with a bubble that can only be destroyed through angel weapons and can shield a random enemy should the player focus attention on another threat, it's annoying. Worst addition is the colour-coded enemies, use angel weapons against blue and demon against red, it breaks the combo. Graphics look decent but I've seen better (DMC4); music is usually a strong point for me in a review but just like the story, it's cheap; rather than using official music, Capcom decided to go with licensed music from Combichrist. I'm not saying Combichrist music ****, just using a lot of licensed music in a game just proves how bad the company truly is as well as how lazy they were; I loved the original music from all four previous games. Ninja Theory developed this game for western audience, fair enough, but why change something that didn't need changing in the first place? This game doesn't deserve the title of Devil May Cry; terrible story and rebooted characters but alright if it was its own standalone game with no relation to the Devil May Cry series I know and love. All DMC fans approach with caution; any non-DMC fan may find some enjoyment within this game but overall - 6/10. It's ok too casualized for my taste though, wish we got DMC4 combat where getting an S felt great and wasn't easy as it is here. I also wish that the character wasn't a self insert from the developer and we got the real dante instead.. I went in to this game with fairly high expectations, and i went out satisfied with the game. With some complaints of the weak story, weak characters and such other. But hey, this is DMC we are talking about, since when has strong characters and story been a selling point for the series? The main selling point of this series has always been the fast paced combat and the ability to play the game after your own style. Although they did remove the style system from earlier games, the combat is still very fluid and fun to play. They have added in a fluent weapon switching system (thank god) as i felt the previous system was clunky and hard to switch in combat. I also feel like Ninja Theory did a good move with moving all the combat to Limbo, which allowed some of the best level design i have ever seen in a Hack N Slash game. Dante also moves more realistically in combat compared to the earlier games. Although a lot of people complained that the game is too easy, they probably only played it on Nephilim (Hard) and did not take the time to play/unlock the higher difficulties, because that is where the challenge lies. You can complain about how they changed Dante, Since i played the earlier DMC games, i got very confused when Dante screams ""NO"" when he is thrown out the window. But then again, we play this game for the combat, and they managed to nail that in a good way. Then there is the whole DLC known as Vergils Downfall. I didnt care for the story much, i found the combat system very fun to use. The only major complaints i have about it is that the level design is weaker than the main game, the campaign is a bit too short, only 6 missions, and you cant play Vergil in the Bloody Palace. I would have also loved some weapon variety from Vergil other than just his katana, Yamato. Other than these flaws i found the game very enjoyable, and i am still playing it to this very day. Well i gotta say, i gave it a shot. I'll admit that i wasn't a big fan of the character design changes, but with the new skins you can download i figured heck that's an easy fix. Its the gameplay that cant be fixed though, and it was terrible. I can say, i hate Dante's new attitude, and there where a few key moments where if i where in the room with him in a few instances, for example when he would act like a hard ass to that spray paint girl, who was the victim of sexual preditors and all that, I would have had to wup his ass. I have a pretty short patience for that sort of conduct. Which is why it makes a good bad guy charector, not so much a hero. It reflects a type of insecurity with a person who is struggling with his manhood and feels that they need to prove their strong every chance they can, which are qualities i dont find suitable in a hero. BUT, those things are easy to ignore because their fictional and you can skip cut scenes. It was the dumbed down fighting and rediculous ""alternate demention dreemland"" bullcrap that ruined the game for me. I like having to learn every combo to perfection in order to getting super stylishes and stuff. I DON'T like being given them for using the same move over and over, and then being forced to use certain combos in repition on certain enemies. I felt like i was just mashing buttons most of the time. and WAY TO GO with just trumping stinger with the grappling hooks. Why is everyone obsessed with alternate universes anyway? Screw dreamland. It's too easy to write the whole thing off as just an illusion. They had a good plot with the media being controlled by demons, why didnt they just have the demons manipulating footage and altering peoples memories with that soda and hypnosis, and have everything happening in the drudges of reality, the back allys where people dont go because their so dangerous. I dont know about other people, but my work takes me into these hell pits and dark allys here on earth, and it wouldnt be hard to convince someone they where controlled by demons lol. Thats kinda where the myths and legends came from in the first place. so why muddle that with some fantasy dream trip? Its bad when Men In Black has a better plot that something you've written. and its even worse when you steal the mechanics **** *cough*castlevania LOS*cough* that based its mechanics of off the game that you are remaking, which was the trail blazing bar setting masterpiece written in video game history. And its even worse when you make those mechanics choppy and slow, to the point where the player has to take his time while playing rather than fry his brain creating combos. bottom line, its a fun game. The attitude of Dante will make your blood boil, and the fighting mechanics get a little monotonous, and you spend all of your time in dream world cause demons dont exist in the real world, but all that aside you can have fun playing the game. I'll tell you what, it makes you feal really good at video games though. cause its a very easy game to beat.. This is not a Devil May Cry. NT totally ruined title with this reboot. This game looks like bad parody of original games with poor combat system, bad protagonist etc. I want to forget this shame and I hope we'll never see a sequel/prequel/whatever of this crap.. Simply one of the best Hack-n-Slash games ever made. If you don't like this game, you either A, don't enjoy the genre, or B, you're an old DmC fanboy that has a problem with the series getting a much needed overhaul. Everything about this game is awesome. The art is insanely cool. The music matches the style and pace perfectly. The combat is smart, fun, and challenging (as long as you're playing on the harder settings) and the new Dante is way cooler. The only part I didn't like was the ""F*** You"" line. But other than that I loved the new characters. If you like Bayonetta and old DmC games but aren't a stupid fanboy, you must play this game. I literally have play almost every game in the genre and I can honestly say that this game is near perfect. Ninja Theory hit this one out of the park. I only hope the dumb old DmC fanboys don't ruin the chances of a sequel for us real gamers.. Gameplay 4.5/5 doesn't get perfect score because the lack of a lock on feature other games in series had. Combat had good flow combos were a little to easy to string together though. Boss Fights: 5/5 best boss fights in the series Level Design 5/5 Levels offered a variety of challenges. I love running though the stages as the ground you were standing on morphed and jumped to different locations. Lots of really awesome stage hazards too. Story 3/5 story is decent at best but the story has never been a strong point for this series. Only real issue is the length the game seems shorter then previous installments. Characters 2/5 All the characters are less likable then the previous installments in the game series. I despise the main character and that's not a good thing. They kept trying to mix old Dante's personality with the new version and it was offsetting. The even went far enough to insult their old clients that built their franchise, by poking fun at the old character designs. Difficulty: 3/5 the game was a lot easier then previous games. However once you unlock the mode where you die in one hit, its not so easy anymore regardless of what anyone tells you. overall id say 7/10 I would give it a higher score but -the character design - and the developers attitude towards the old fans left a bad taste in my mouth. I own all 4 games in the series and the reboot.... IF you want to know how id order them best to worst. here it is. 1'st: DEVIL MAY CRY #3 2'nd: DEVIL MAY CRY #4 3'rd: DMC 4'th: DEVIL MAY CRY #1 5'th: DEVIL MAY CRY #2. I'll start with the conclusion: this game's pretty bad. And I'm not even a DMC fanboy... I only got into DMC with DMC3 back in 2005, and I decently enjoyed DMC4. - Story is bland, rehashes DMC3's plot along with DMC1's, and the ending is very similar to DMC4, only with a more negative or neutral connotation rather than 100% positive. Weird inconsistencies that cause the entire story to lose cohesion, such as when Dante's local strip club suddenly has no memory of him, and he's not on the list of approved guests, even though he was there at the start of the game. - The writing is hamfisted and you can clearly tell the game tries too hard to be cool. Edginess. Edginess everywhere: 'f*** you', 'me a God VS you a piece of s***', one boss trying to puke on you while saying f*** you, Bill O'Reilly ripoff calling you a ''little S-word''. Mundus's concubine saying ''the world is at last your b-word... as am I'', which not only makes no sense since she was always his b-word, but her saying that was completely irrelevant to the situation and tasteless. It felt like the concubine was explaining her relation to Mundus to you, which was unnecessary and makes for a terrible script. Devil Trigger gives you red veins and... white hair? What happened to the white hair joke of ''never in a million years''? Blatant fanservice even though the fans were blasted and insulted multiple times by Ninja Theory. - Gameplay has done away with lock-on ","this reboot from Ninja Theory (Heavenly Sword), maintains the crazy wild action from previous games . but it also adds a bizarre style comparable to ""Bayonetta"" the combat is electric, the RPG elements worthwhile, the platforming surprisingly fun ."
