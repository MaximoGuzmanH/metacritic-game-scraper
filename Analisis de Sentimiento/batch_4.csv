106.Persona 5,"Just couldn't get myself into it, the first hours are a pain and the story felt really weird. Seems to be made for fans of this genre. This is the greatest game I have ever played it changed my life + romance Ryuji and Morgana. Want to make friends who all have personalities & back stories? Want amazing perks & combo attacks to take out your enemies? Want to pull out a gun in a knife fight? Want to whip your enemies while dressed in a latex cat suit? Want to have a talking ""not"" a cat navigator? Want to go inside peoples mindscape & force them to have a change of heart in their palace? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. You & your buds go around beating up baddies in their home turf.. Persona 5 was and is easily one of the greatest RPGs, turn-based games, and games of any genre really, to come out during the 2010s. Yes, Persona 5 Royal came out and fine-tuned its formula even further, but I won't hold its improvements against the base game, which was already a complete and extremely satisfying experience. I blew through this version alone three times, and I ""took my time"" all the while. Its music and presentation isn't for everyone, but for those that resonate with it, you'll forever find yourself a dedicated Phan.. One of the best jrpg, and (imo) the best persona of the saga. the story is just amazing, the gameplay is really fun and the graphics are all that it should be. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A sophisticated UI, great music, and an exhilarating combat system. This is a JRPG masterpiece. T a kE Y o uR h E a R T. My first JRPG game and I liked it although my only and biggest complaint is the length. It's too long and gets a bit boring towards the end although the end itself is really good. masterful blend of storytelling, character development, and gameplay mechanics, featuring stylish cutscenes that weave a compelling narrative about a group of high school students on a mission to reform society. The characters are well-developed and relatable, each with unique motivations, while the witty humor balances heavier themes, providing light moments amid darker elements. The game explores societal issues, creating a rich tapestry that invites deeper analysis. Its soundtrack complements the aesthetic, enhancing the emotional depth of both cutscenes and gameplay. Overall, Persona 5 offers a rewarding journey that resonates long after the experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i think persona3 is much better than persona5pearsona5 story **** interesting. In short it is long, drawn out, intentionally designed to be inconvenient, and the easiest game I've played in years that is unfortunately riddled with instances where it undermines its own combat mechanics to get a cheeky party wipe on you as a replacement for a difficulty spike. Finishing the game which I did felt like a complete waste of time since the incomveniences slowly ate away at the joy of playing it to the point I was happy it was done. For me personally this was the first and probably the last game of this franchise I will play and while it wasn't the worst game I played in the last two years, it was definitely the least enjoyable.. Stylish designs, interesting characters, amazing soundtrack, the story just keeps giving and giving, awesome game for almost every platform! Definitely one of the best games of all time. A masterpiece ****, one of my favourites. great story, characters, gameplay and my favourite OST to any game. 9.9/10 (0.1 off cause royal exists). Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Graphics: 9/10 World: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall 10/10. Excellent game, engaging story, gameplay similar to Persona 4, great personas.. Persona 5 oozes both style and substance. I think it is arguably one of the most incredible games ever made. From some of the strongest visual direction and style I’ve ever seen, to it’s mighty soundtrack that is quite possibly the greatest in gaming history; Persona flings you into it’s world from the first second and never lets you go, retaining it’s atmosphere and immersing you entirely for it’s 100 hour runtime. On top of this the narrative is fantastic, with some of the most careful and thorough character writing I’ve ever seen, with a cast so compelling and a set of villains so core to the overall themes of the game. On top of this, the pacing in and between each dungeon is fantastic, everything ramps up in tension, with each next villain enhancing the scale of threat the characters find themselves in. And the metaphors! Atlas know how to utilise symbolism to the greatest effect, specifically the core image of tearing your mask off to reveal your true self - pure genius. Alongside this, the narrative parallel between the mc and Akechi is incredible, and the kind of L and Light dynamic between them really keeps the story tense and engaging and the twists only further cement it as one of the best RPG narratives ever. Outside of this, the combat is addictive, adding enough variety and depth in damage types and movesets, whilst also ensuring it is still approachable and not overly complex. And the level design and layout of each of the dungeons is incredible. Persona 5 is by far one of my favourite video games and I feel it doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. As much of a masterpiece Baldur’s Gate 3 is, I feel Persona 5 is quite overlooked in regards to it’s writing, visuals and combat mechanics in comparison as it is just as influential.. Arguably the most stylish game ever made, phenomenal soundtrack, amazing combat and great voice acting. Story is weaker than the previous two Persona games but everything else more than makes up for it.. Best game I played in a long time. The story, graphics and general design of the game is out of this world. I haven't played much of it, but I've played Persona 5 Royal and that one was brilliant. I'd rather recommend you to play that instead of this, but if you're unsure if you'd like the Persona Series or not this one could actually be a good starting point for you, since it's cheaper than Royal when on sale. Do I recommend you to still get Royal in case you like this game? Yes, since the added Royal content is extremely good.. yuh, it's national wednesday and this **** bangs like my ancestors banged on sum ****. Stylish Game that deserves a unique place in JRPG history. Great Nu Jazz Soundtrack with fantastic art design.. This was my first persona game and I LOVED IT! Art style is so gorgeous, history is deep and entertaining, characters are fun… the only “bad” thing about it is that I think the game could be a little shorter. Anyway, it’s a 10!!!!. unplayably bad with the worst story I've ever seen I actually can't play this game for more than 5 mins without wanting to hang myself. Only suprased P3Fes and P5R. Story was a bit rushed at the end of the main story.. Worst game ever I wake up in the morning happy until I realise the cat exists Morgana and my whole day is ruined :( and the game last 5 years to finish. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Persona 5 is a very japanese game. If you are not familiar with the style, at first it all seems a bit cringy. But you should at least give it a try. Because the story is well written, the characters are likeable and the gameplay is unique. One of the best JRPGs ever released. Overall rating: 9.3.. Pros: -Brilliant soundtrack -Good plot -Gameplay ( if you like turn based system) Cons: -Some characters are poorly written comparing to Persona 4/Golden (due financial circumstances of the company at that moment) -2 monotonous dungeons ( same reason- financial state) Overall game is 8, worth playing but not perfect. It's a polarize game. A lot of people will love it, a lot will dropped it. -- Features: . It's RPG turn based with the usual mechanics (fire, ice, wind, black magic... ) . There will be a lot of reading. Ex: you play like 5 hours without a combat, just reading dialogue and walking through the city. -- Positive: . Relatable characters . Good plot . Hentai potential ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) . Delivers a really good fantasy as high school should be. Who didn't want to be a ""star"" in high school times? Girls texted you all the time, a lot of friends, etc. . The cutscenes in game (when rarely happens) is top level . Sound track is awesome. -- Negatives: . The graphics in the game ****. Atlus could improve a lot in the regard. Almost a ps2 game level =( . The reactions in the game could be improved. If you choose the answer A ou B almost didnt matter in the main quest. . Why is not fully voiced acted? Only some dialogues are voiced (main quest). Lazy Atlus I really enjoyed, but i understand the people that hated.. best anime game. I can't come up with a single bad thing about this game. It's one of the best and most unique RPGs I've ever played, even the soundtrack is worth a 10. It can lock you in like very very few other games can, I literally forgot my meals and went to bed way past my time.. With a stylish band of rogues, Persona 5 surpasses its predecessors in every way.. Game like no other. No other game makes you feel so immersed like PERSONA 5 does. Yeah, i guess its probably not for everyone.. but damn.. even if JRPGs are not quite your thing.. if you learn to love it - it can become one of your most favorite games ever.. I would suggest not playing this game, as it will make you stay up all hours of the night with no youtube.. Beautiful game, incredible, hard to describe, it's been a long time since I felt like this with a game, if you're looking for a quality JRPG to play, you can go with Persona 5, best JRPG I've played in years.. my first introduction to persona, and loved it i wish they could have done more with the plot development though.. This game just made me happier in my life. This game is all you need when feeling frustrating, or sad, or anything at all. It makes you cry, laugh and enjoy. It is my favourite game, by far, after 20 years playing RPGs and more specifically, JRPGs.. Got this game for free as part of PS Plus collection. Sunk 120 hours into this game - that's 120 hours of my life I will never get back. Was it worth it? Emphatic no. Don't let the uniquely designed menus fool you. Dialogue was repetitive. Gameplay was pokemon-esque. Leveling up personas, stats, and social links got old quick. It's gameplay (pokemon-esque) and writing felt too elementary for a game that is rated M. Instead of wasting your time on this life-sim game, go make real connections in the real world.. My only complaint is that this game is far too long. I've got nothing against long games, but near 100 hours is too much in my opinion. If it was a bit shorter I would probably give it a 10, but it started to drag towards the end.. The graphics, mechanics improved far compared to its predecessors, but the characters are far less interesting, and the story goes meh at the end (typical ""oh, you did terrible things, but you're good-looking and have a sad past. we all forgive you"" crap). First persona game in which i actually liked non-playable characters (i.e. doctor, arms dealer, shogi player, teacher, etc) far more than playable characters.. In 2018, I bought a PS4 to play P5. On the night of staying up late to play the finale, at three o'clock in the middle of the night, I watched the finale animation alone and cried into tears.. One of the most fun turn based strategy games ive ever played. Both the combat gameplay and the life management gameplay are fun and engaging. Characters are diverse and interesting. Main plot takes a bit to get going but really gets going in interesting directions. Problem is the main story goes off the rails in the last two chapters and it really drags down the overall experience. Music is awesome. Does allow the underage main character to enter a relationship with his schoolteacher though, which is gross.. a great game, the royal version turned Persona 5 from an 8 to a 10 for, 120 hours that never bored me and when i finished the game i felt so empty tht wanted to replay it one more time. Used to be obsessed with videos on you tube about the game and when I finally got to get a PlayStation and played it, it lived up to the hype. Absolutely love it, it is a masterpiece.. I have a strong love-hate relationship with this game. It has fun style, and plays a lot like a Final Fantasy game. The music is initially catchy, but quickly becomes obnoxious. The game has some long segments between save points, and difficulty spikes in combat can be very frustrating.. Despite my difficulties to enjoy it again, even in 2023, it is still a beautiful experience that I don’t talk about as much as before.. it's just a **** perfect game, probably top 5 of all time. Even better than p4. One of the best JRPG's of all time. Persona 5 was the first JRPG i have ever played and i F**KIN loved it. I played Persona 5 Royal more but i would recommend Persona 5 Royal AFTER playing Persona 5 because you will notice the changes.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best jrpg of today. Spectacular in every way. waiting for the release of 6. I first saw persona 5 when i checked this website a couple of years ago. Upon seeing the positive reviews, I decided to give it a go, even though the gameplay didn't particularly pull me in from youtube footage. I had intended for this game to be my last ps4 game. I was starting to have enough of gaming as a whole, for many reasons. I ended up playing a game so good, that I decided to never stop gaming. it reinvigorated my love for gaming. It is one of the rare games i wish i had not played, because now, i will never be able to experience it anew. Despite being a ps3 game, it surpassed my expectations, and it will be enjoyable for eternity. Best stuff: the artistic vision and unique game design/ui. the awesome music. the loveable characters. the personas themselves remind me of my childhood with pokemon. The things to do in tokyo. What could have improved the game: Joker's lack of voice, absence of character customisation in game - wait its DLC... In conclusion: The game is practically flawless, it kept me fully interested for so many hours, and is memorable and fun. For a month, the phantom thieves became my only and best friends. I don't know how they made the characters feel as real as they felt to me. I give this game a 93/100. One of my favorites of all time I love the characters and the overall look of the game is amazing. Weakest of the persona protagonists imo and the story itself drags pretty hard in places but after replaying it 4 times it still is something I could see myself coming back to.. The best game of all time.‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎ Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.. cant say a good combat mode to fit in a 50h's walkthrough. However, others like music and graphics is so much modern and astonishing.. Great Gameplay the best Soundtrack I have heard in a game so far and fun to play 90+ hours in recommended 100% for everyone. Good story and enjoyable RPG game would recommend and play again. The world's are well thought out and the personas you both get and fight have there own personality. The characters are well thought out with there own storyline and impact on the story. The extra features like gyms, crafting, school questions etc. But my problem is that all the perfecting and stay boost take too long to grind for because you barley get chance to leave Leblanc without Morgana telling you to sleep but good game 9/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Overall very good game. A good mix that pays homage to the older titles, while still being modern Persona. Looks aesthetically amazing, and feels good to play. Music, etc. Is top quality as always. However the main cast lacks in the writing department after their respective Palaces and Confidants are finished. Antagonists are a mixed bag in quality. Akechi is severely underutilized (feels unfinished). Also similar to KH3, this game feels to easy due to the sheer amount of things you can do for battle. Overall good, despite my issues.. The first game I played on PS4. One of the most beautiful games stylistically, with fun gameplay to match. The difficulty is more slightly difficult than in Royal (due to no Jazz Club, darts, billiards and baton pass mechanics changed), making you think strategically both in fights and how you spend your time. While the story’s twists can be a bit predictable from the start, it’s still fun to follow the plot and see where it goes. It’s great for newcomers to the series but I would’ve loved to see a bit more difficulty comparable to mainline.. It's a game that you can play just by purchasing PS5 and becoming a plus member. I can't believe such a great game. I've never thought it was a hassle because it's a fashionable game that eliminates the annoying parts of an RPG game as much as possible. The BGM and the game system are very interesting, and you can gradually improve your status through studying everyday life, relationships and hobbies, you can enjoy the future that changes because you have improved it, and the story is suspenseful but fantasy. It's devilish, spiritual, or fun with settings like those found in funny anime and movies for adults and kids alike. It's like a dream that you can do such a wonderful thing just by buying a PS5. If you haven't played, try it. There seems to be a separate full version, but I was happy with this alone. The full version is what I heard from people who played that new characters appeared and only changed a little.. I am not a big fan of turn based rpg's so I was very hesitant to play Persona 5 but I decided to take a shot and download it. That was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Nearly everything about persona 5 floored me, from the beautifully designed palaces, to the wonderful cast of characters, to the flashy, turn-based combat, to the best ost in a video game ever. I felt every second of my 80 hour playthrough was well spent and I was tearing up at the end, not because the ending was sad, but because I was sad that I wasn't going to spend any more time with the characters I loved in a world I truly cared about. Persona 5 has a few minor problems, but they don't hold the game back from being one of the best I've ever played. Can't wait to play persona 5 Royal when persona 5 is no longer fresh in my memory.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it's different from everything, a good turn based RPG with a really tripping story.. If Persona 4 was already sensational, 5 takes all that and improves a lot. Better looking graphics, a great story with a sense of rewarding your goals, a new reward system for social link levels, a colossally stylish HUD, improvements to battle (particularly in a group) and the soundtrack, as always, sensational. Its only problem is the decrease in memorable moments with all friends together, but even that doesn't change how sensational this game is.. The Phantom Thieves are so god dam awesome, I wish Japanese people were real.. Cutted story, boring sessions of ripetitive gameplay, choose royal edition! It's another game!. Very nice. I like it alot and i think its undetared for how good it is also shush those who have put it as negative.. This game certainly has a strong sense of style. The story is a bit laughably convoluted at times, and combat gets old after while- although to be fair , both of those things can be said about a lot of Anime-esque turn based Japanese RPGs that I've played. Moreover, its the characters you're meant to care about, not the plot so much. So, overall, I thought the combo of life/time management and dungeon exploration to more engrossing than I had expected.. The Persona series has long been a fan favorite but previous games often had a high learning curve especially games like Persona 2 and 3 which were exceptionally difficult games which prevented and scared off potential fans to the series, even the mighty Persona 4 had a high difficulty ceiling but thankfully Atlus carefully crafted Persona 5 to be easily accessible to all player types and that aspect along with a great story helped to create a classic experience for JRPG and casual players alike.. Excellent game. The combat system and the story are well made and let you enjoy the game without making it boring, even though it is a long game (around 60-80h) Don't worry about the name, you don't have to play the preceding titles, since they're all stand-alone stories.. This game made me realize how important a good cast can be, and it got me into RPGS, and turn based battles. The story is great, the gameplay is great, the setting is great, the art style is great, the waifus are great and the soundtrack is god tier. This game has it's issues, but not enough to remove it from my favorite game of all time.. a friend recommended this to me so I spent £150 to buy it even the persona 5 royal already came out and oh my god it was such a waste of time. if you want to play this buy royal the superior edition. be warned though because that game has a ton of pay to win micro transactions and also has and awful camera, awful graphics, awful controls and bad theme.. My personal favorite game ever. Maybe not objectively the best and the fandom **** for it. A great linear story that isn't surface-level and when finished will make you want to play Royal immediately after.. I was never interested in jrpg's until i played this, has to be one of the greatest games out there, if its your first time playing jrpgs this is a must buy game. I cannot understand why this game is so highly praised … there are parts of the game where for hours nothing interesting happening. The combat is so boring and the length of the game makes it even more tedious. After 60 hours I just gave up out of boredom. I never played a Persona game before. Now, it's one of my top 10 games of all time. Maybe the most unique game as well. I didn't expect it to be 80 hours long either. The concept is incredible. The presentation is immaculate. The gameplay is flashy and deep. The characters are like friends. Must play even on a PS5 and in 2030 if you haven't.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is stylish and cool, but its long development time shows in some awful quality-of-life decisions. In brief, sessions of this game often were entertaining but usually ended at some point where frustration with the linearity and info/dialogue dumps forced me to quit and not return for days or weeks. Persona 5 is totally worth playing, but interface and pacing may drive some players insane. The game's good parts have been praised elsewhere, and they are all valid, but personally I find it hard to recommend a game that wastes so much of my time and whose story moves at a Harry Potter-esque glacial pace despite obvious clues.. One of the most memorable JRPGs of the generation. The unique art style and fun gameplay that is based on the Shin Megami Tensei series, of the most acclaimed turn-based games, make it an experience that would turn any new person in the RPG sphere into an aspiring fanatic of the Persona series and open its doors to more games of the genre. The only thing keeping its score at an 8 is its storytelling not being as interesting as the other Persona games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Persona 5 is not the masterpiece people claims it to be. First of all, I need to point out that I played Persona 5 (not Royal) on Playstation 5 as it was included with it throught the Playstation plus collection. I gave it a try on the Playstation 3, however it didn't catch my attention as there was many great release around the same time that made me drop the game about 15 or so hours of playtime. First, I will point out the positive. The artistic direction of the game is still one of the best to date. The menu, transition and animation is top notch and makes this PS3 game puts to shame other games released today on lower end hardware like the Switch. It's very generous in content as over 130 hours is needed to finish the first playthrough. While other games went on the easy route to switch the gameplay to active battle, Persona stay true to it's roots and kept it a turn base combat game Now for the not so good. First of all, while this is very subjective, I hate the music tracks with a passion. Not all of the tracks are hawfull, hoverver, most of them are. Also, I needed to put headphones during most of my playthrough as my wife always complained as she despised the music so much. My second negative concerns the main hero. During the 140 hours played so far, I could not give a $4!& about him. The almost silent protagonist is faced with choices thruout the adventures, but most of the choice given makes no sense. I could not believe how many time I was frustrated as all choice where not one I would make. That is when the choice are not exactly the same as other decisions are like: 1-Yes 2-Hmm. Yes. 3-Yes, I think. I was missing so much the great dialogue options of other games like the Mass Effect trilogy. Also, one of the most stupid thing is that you will be asked several questions at school and if you ALREADY know the answer, you will RAISE your knowledge, but if you don't, the teacher will tell you the correct answer and your knowledge will not raise. My third and main problem is that the games drags for way too long as most of the game feels tedious. It's soo long in fact, they didn't even have the cast read the dialogue. I found myselft even fast fowarding dialogues that seems unrelated to the main story as they where boring and poorly written. I would have prefered a shorter(60 hours) fully voice acted main story with optionnal side quest. Lastly, I don't like the tone of the game, making adults look like they are the villain and depicting japanese culture prone to xenophobism. To me age has nothing to do with how you are as a person, as stupid adult where previously stupid teenagers. I felt awkard playing a game with such ageism. Also the fact that the game is so much ancored in the japanese culture without any taint of any other culture makes me feels out of place. To wraps it up, this game feels like a waste of my precious time. The story should have been told in 30% of it's time and the flow should have been better. Overall, I feel stupid wasting time on such a game and only wished there was more turn based games to fill in the void made when Final Fantasy decided to kill the franchise when they made the game action based.. I played Persona 5 in 2018 and thought it was an amazing game that I loved. However, I dislike the DLC microtransactions in this game.. I have played every Persona since 3, and I would say JRPGs are some of my favorite games. But sadly I am quite disappointed with Persona 5. Don't get me wrong, It's an OK game, but I find a lot of it's flaws are very overlooked. It is certainly a very stylish game, menus are amazingly stylized and while some of the textures are muddy, the overall personality of characters and environments shine though. The music also fits the art style nicely, which really shows an evolution from the previous games which were already quite stylish. But I feel that is the only real improvement. On the downside, From the very start, the game felt slow and meandering, both in its exposition, dialogue and in how much it holds your hand. This isn't particularly surprising for a JRPG, but a lot of the ""social sim"" type activities, and even the battles or ""puzzles"" in the dungeons, feel insanely overwritten and unnecessarily guided. The characters also tend to talk a lot but say very little, with constantly repetitive dialogue that rarely ever really fleshes out any of them beyond the clichés. P4 was very smart in the way in which the dungeons revealed hidden aspects of our party members, making them more human and serving as an introduction, but this game rarely understands how important that is when building a long story like this. Dungeons, while visually improved, are not mechanically interesting, whenever a puzzle is introduced, the game basically solves it for you, never trusting in the player's intelligence. Additionally, the controls and the stealth aspect of the game are very awkward, so these gimmicks play out as badly implemented mechanics that add very little to the game. Moreover, the tremendously restrictive nature of the game always prevents you from feeling any growth, as the battles can either be a complete breeze (done in one or two turns) or go bad FAST. And this structure remains throughout almost all the game (this may have been the same in P4, but i personally felt like I could grind if I wanted and feel a more rewarding progression, while through the first 40 hours of P5, SP is so restrictive that this feels almost impossible). And the worst culprit, the story. Persona 3 and 4 both have twists and turns that, can be satisfying, but end up falling more on the side of clichè. However, this is less of a problem when those games had a less self serious perspective. P5 is always at the edge of something interesting, always toying with the idea of saying something challenging, but it constantly stumbles, stretches and ultimately drops the ball and falls into the clichés again and again, It lacks subtlety to actually explore any of the interesting topics it hints at: For example, It constantly asks if it is really correct to basically brain wash people? But then it shows completely monstrous comically evil rivals, so it can deflect the conflict : These are monsters so, DUH. It tries to be cool and mature, it ends up feeling childish and defaulting to basically EVERY JRPG trope, while taking itself WAY too seriously. There are many more issues with the game, i find, the unskipable repeated sequences (seriously, the post fight animation is 10+ seconds long, and plays fully after each of the hundreds of fights in the game), the seemingly filler dungeons, the often pointless extended exposition, which serves very little narrative purpose. And smaller peeves, such as the impossibility to 100% the game (in one 100+ hour playthrough), questionable treatment of topics, and extreme length of the game just make me think Atlus felt compelled to bloat this game, and never wrote or designed thoughtfully around it. It is possible that many of these problems were present in the previous games of the series but i feel like the run time and the somewhat less fleshed out cast really end up damaging the complete package.. the dialogue choice i love the most about this game: ""I'm a dad"" ""Ryuji is a phantom thief"" ""Beep boop"" ""It's time for button mash"" ""That's the best part"" ""Want me to strip?"" ""Honey I'm home"" ""Something witty"" ""Strip for him Ann"" ""Excuse me while I vomit"". Beneath the veneer of typical urban high school life, a group of teenagers mask their mysterious alter egos, their ""phantom thief"" side. Who are they?. regular visual novel with the worst rpg sections I ever have the disgrace to play. The visuals and music are pretty good, the story is so so, the dialogs are BORING and repetitive, Ryuji being the more annoying always making the same comments again and again AND again, too many times I started reading the dialogs but just skip them because are just stupid and not getting never to the point. I just want to finish it but this crap is ETERNAL now the rpg parts are the worst I've ever seen, the turns doesn't make any sense and you just have to go weak, weak, weak or you are screwed, no matter that the opponent is 10 levels lower than you, he can kill all your team in one turn. The sp is horrible, only in the last stages you can have something to replenish it and for a game that NEEDS to use SP ALWAYS is horrible. There are a lot of instakills too, so if you ha","this is the greatest game i have ever played it changed my life + romance . you & your buds go around beating up baddies in their home turf . the story is just amazing, the gameplay is really fun and the graphics are all that it should be ."
107.Quake III Arena,"I played earlier q3arenaone pc also dreamcast i also played Wolfenstein - EnemyTerritory who using the same engine and feels nearly identy with quake3. what i wanna say is, from gameplay feeling and fairness also from style, skill lvl u can reach and bugs they make this game awesome for me. i still playing this game sometimes and never saw a game again like this. for many years im in hope to see a release who is like quake3arena. there is no any good out there and thats why i give a 9 of 10. also the movement and aiming on the same time is perfectly to handle. its the best made shooter all of time! Doom Eternal is also nearly that feeling like q3 from gameplay for me!. It's alright. I think it's good game but I don't really like this game. Not bad, but I would much rather play Quake 1 or 2 deathmatch than this.. Quake lives in my blood. Multiplayer first person shooter rendered almost unplayable by the fact that the up/down axis of the joystick is reversed from the norm and there's no option to change it, meaning you spend nearly all of your time staring straight up into the air or down at your feet while you wrestle with the completely unintuitive controls. A near-catastrophic omission that ruins what otherwise could've been a fun game.. My first ever FPS... The best there is in my opinion! When it comes to fps you must play quake 3 area. The maps, the mechanics, the game modes... everything was amazing!!. It has become faster and more fun, it has changed a lot, there is no plot in the game now, but this is not a problem, the game has a goal to defeat all enemies in the arenas Weapons from Q2 moved to the third part of the Railgun and the rest and redesigned all weapons The Arenas themselves from the creators of the game are well designed and dynamic, I had fun playing them, I still play it a little The game has models from all other games id: Doom guy, Ranger, Bitterman She looks better Q2,improved lighting textures,models I played with the Ioquake 3 mod which improves textures and other elements even more My favorite weapon: Shotgun, Plasma, Rocket Launcher, Railgun +Highest Dynamic is very fun +Cool,Beauy,Interest,Very Good Balance Levels +Unique Very Fun Gameplay +Beauty Redesign Weapons My Favorite Game 15 Destroyed by Rocket Launcher out of 10). 10000 hours of my life and it is worth it! Gold standard of First Person Shooter!. Amazing game but it loses points as it was meant to be played with the mouse and keyboard on the dreamcast. This becomes a huge limitation for enjoying this game as the Dreamcast controller doesn't have a second joystick nor does it have USB ports. Sourcing a DC keyboard and mouse is not only expensive but you're stuck to the one they manufactured as you rely on the controller port for the hookup. There are a small amount of adapters but that will run you even more money. The game itself is atleast a B+ or A- but only with the proper set up or alot of practice with the controller which kinda takes mulitplayer options off the table.. Controls ****. I think I played more with my cousin than alone. I didn't like this game at all.. Good dumb run and gun fun. Difficult to enjoy online if you haven't mastered some skills and the single player is less fun. I suspect quake fans would prefer the pc version","i still playing this game sometimes and never saw a game like this . from gameplay feeling and fairness also from style, skill lvl u can reach and bugs they make this game awesome . i think it's good game but i don't really like this game ."
108.SSX 3,"Best game every no doubt. I play this game since the last 20 years and will it until i die️ the music, the graphics, the feel of freedom and fun gameplay are unbeaten to this day!. the little banger of its time, this game unlocks unforgettable memories spent trying to beat the clocks and points limit.. ""SSX 3"" is a genuine masterpiece. It might be the best snowboarding game of all time. This second sequel builds upon the formula of its predecessors. It takes place on one gigantic mountain packed with challenges and modes. Also, just like in the ""Tony Hawk"" games, it features plenty of customization options. In addition, the graphics and sense of speed are spectacular. Overall, this is the pinnacle of the series. It's a fast and fluid arcade-style sports game with an amazing level design. I would rate it with 9.3 out of 10.. playing with a friend is simply exciting, guarantees hours of gameplay as the maps are perfect even for 2003 and the gameplay is fluid and simple. The only SSX I've played From a time when EA knew how to make good and fun non-P2W games and they weren't broken either. if you have a ps2 and never played it, i don't know what you re doing. SSX 3 is one of the best game of it's time. It combine racing with amazing tricks and freestyles. Its a game i always go back to and play it with my friends and still have the same amount of fun i had back then. the music of the game is outstanding with all its unique pieces. The stages may not be as many but they re so repayable that make up for it. the more you play the more alternative routes you notice. Its also important to note that all the characters are unique and their interactions unique. In story mode you re racing to become the no1 snowboarder who conquer the mountains. You re also allowed to maneuver your way down the entire mountain and choose whatever path you desired.. Fantastic game with huge free roaming sort of open world area that transforms seemingly into a race or any other event. Controls are perfect, very responsive, pretty arcade like and you can almost feel that snow under your deck. Soundtrack is something to behold, it changes dynamically depending on how high you are, or if you enter a cave etc. This kind of game you could boot up for 10 minutes or 2 hours anytime and you would never be bored by it.. ""SSX 3"" is probably the best arcade-style snowboarding game ever made. It's even better than ""SSX Tricky"" which was also terrific fun. This one has it all! Spectacular graphics, amazing tricks, colorful characters and plenty of customization options. The creators have made one of the great level designs with the massive mountain. The game is highly enjoyable from beginning to end. ""SSX 3"" is a masterpiece and arguably the greatest EA BIG title ever made. I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10.. it is my childhoodgame, and it only bring back amazing memories. The soundtrack, the maps and the characters was all amazing. I don't think that in the future will be out a similar snowboarding game: rush at the max level, playing with a fresh soundtrack and charismatic characters. Best sport game for PS2 ever !. Easily the best game in the series, soundtrack, gameplay, characters, graphics, everything, just GREAT! I've played SSX Tricky and On Tour. I would even argue this game is better than Steep! It's open-world, has cool characters, and even has replayability because even if you ""conquer the mountain"" as one character, you can go back around and do it again as another. I could go on and on about the things I love about this game, so instead, I'm just going to say, BUY THIS GAME, and if you don't have a PS2, XBOX, or Game Cube, GET A EMULATOR. This game is a must play.. The best sports game ever made and one of the greatest video games of all time. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has got nothing on this game. Everything about this game is perfect. This was made during the ""Golden Age of EA"" from 2002-2007. EA may be a corporate cash cow now but back in the early 2000s, they were the game changers. This is one of my childhood classics. The graphics are perfect. The mountain, weather and environment effects are outstanding and so beautiful to look at. This got an Oscar nomination for special visual effects in interactive entertainment as a result. The soundtrack is one of the greatest licensed soundtracks of all time aside from GTA: Vice City which came out a year before. I love the soundtrack. I get so many childhood flashbacks from playing the game and the soundtrack. It means so much to me. The gameplay is what made the game so beloved by many gamers as it was so ahead of its time and still holds up to this day. So much exploration for collectibles and doing BIG challenges on the 3 peaks whenever you wanted. You could buy a lot of stuff in the shop like posters, videos, toys, attire, cards, special tricks, buy and unlock the classic characters from the previous games and upgrade yourself to become SSX champion. It led to so much time being wasted on this game everyday of my life when I was growing up. No technical problems in the game. The controls were tight and responsive. The moves looked awesome and they were cool to pull off. The opening is perfect. It gives you a taste of what's to come when you play. I LOVE the narration to this day. It **** you in and it makes you want to recite it every time you start up your PS2. A 10 out of 10. The best sports game ever. It deserves the recognition it gets.. This game is so much fun. Whether it is the racing or the freestyle events, they are a blast to play the first time, and are a blast to play the tenth time. The races give you shortcuts to discover and really give you the feeling of snowboarding down at high speed. The freestyle events first let you figure out how to do basic tricks, then you'll try to get some bronze medals. As you play more of the game, you will get better and discover ways to get more points out of your tricks. Then you can go back to previous freestyle events (and races) to get better medals. You'll be frustrated when you retry a race for the fifth time, you'll be proud when you finally get that gold medal, you'll be mad at yourself for misjudging a jump and you'll be overjoyed when you finally get that high score. All in all, I enjoyed every minute of this wonderful game.. SSX 3 is simply a top notch game on all fronts. The feel of speed while you race, listening to the music that reacts to your actions.. the lovely graphics that fit perfectly with the game design.. If you have not played SSX 3 then you are missing out BIG TIME.. Aside from Undertale, I think this is the only game ever made and that ever will be made I'll give a 10/10. I can literally say NOTHING bad about it. This game is completely addictive and will have you going back to those Peak Runs, trying to better your high scores. It looks FANTASTIC for a 2003 game and it doesn't look half-bad today, and the soundtrack remains one of the best licensed soundtracks ever (if bettered by anything, MAYBE THPS3 and that's about it) with fantastic tracks like Yellowcard's Way Away, Placebo's The Bitter End, and even a remix of The Faint's Glass Danse. The controls are tight and your uber tricks can be customized to your liking. The boards and equipment you choose, unlike SSX Tricky, do not effect your stats. There are some people who like that and some who don't. I'm fine with it as I only ever chose based on how they look anyway. Overall, it's hard to sum up SSX. Maybe screaming ""M-M-M-M-MONSTER TRICK"" repeatedly will do it?. Still one of my all time favorite games. I used to waste countless hours on this as a kid, and was constantly entertained. I decided to pick it up again, and even 12 years after its release it still holds up. It still is a ton of fun, and I still get a rush from getting massive scores on the half-pipes. Love this game. We need another sequel soon.. I popped this game in the other day to see if it was as fun as I remembered it being when I was younger. It most certainly is. A game doesn't have to really be anything more than fun and no better game can testify to that than SSX 3.. Honestly one of the best games iv'e ever played. This game is so beautiful you'll get lost in the scenery. The Characters a lovable to this day I still love Viggo. The tricks you can pull of are outstanding and just mind blowing. Its. Just. Amazing.. If you have a Gamecube. You must have this game. It doesn't matter if you even like snowboarding, this game is VERY fun. A large mountain to explore, decent graphics for the time, a customizable radio, and TONS of unlockables, this game is too much fun. With lots of places to explore and tons of cool tricks, hours can be spent playing this game trying to get to a new shortcut or even unlocking secret characters and new peaks. Even after a long time this game never looses its fun.. This game is my favourite sports game ever... better than Tony Hawks franchise, amazing soundtrack, open world character customization awesome courses probably my most played game on PS2. This is the best snowboarding game that I have ever played. With the perfect amount of challenge and fluent gameplay, nothing can really go wrong here.. The best extreme sports game in video game history!!!!! Also, the game is very good because of the uber tricks and the best arenas to play in and all of the characters are awesome.. SSX 3 completely transformed my life. I spent 10 hours one time on it, only stopping for toilet breaks. The controls are amazingly simple, the tricks are crazy and you can practically give it to anyone and overnight, they can slaughter you at it. The final race is hard, but addictive! Even now, I STILL haven't completed it. The customizing options may be overwhelming at first, but all worries quickly subside. The courses are also brilliant. Even now, the graphics can hold a candle to some other games. And the music is some of the best in ANY game. JERK IT OUT, MAN! SSX 3 is the best installment in the series, and it is a shame they stopped making them after Blur. SSX 3 is the best snowboarding game, and one of the best overall games, that money can buy. It deserves this 10, No Doubt. Do you see what I did there? Heh.. Even after having played the past two games and being amazed by them I still found this game to add enough new features to hook me up all over again. Would definitely recommend to anyone.","""SSX 3"" is a fast and fluid arcade-style sports game with an amazing level design . the music of the game is outstanding with all its unique pieces . controls are perfect, very responsive, pretty arcade like and you can almost feel that snow under your deck ."
109.Homeworld,"At the time of writing its been roughly 25 years since the original homeworld came out. Its graphics are dated, its controls are clunky, its audio is crunchy. Even with those up front it is still the grandaddy of all space-based RTS games with an appreciable depth to it. A depth that was lost when HW1 was ""Remastered"" in homeworld 2's engine. The classic version of HW1 gearbox packages with the remastered collection is non-functional on modern machines. A different version will need to be acquired elsewhere.. The most special RTS game in the history of game. Real Revolution RTS better than Starcraft. Fun to play, great game for its time, I played it later, and felt it could have more dept though.. this is one of the most definitive RTS games in gaming history. Wanna know why? keep reading. PLOT, SCRIPT, NARATIVE AND WRITING: On the desert planet of Kharak due to a satellite malfunction the people who live there discover an ancient startship in a desert along with a hyperspace engine and a stone with coordinates to what appears to be their planet of origin, called Hiigara carved on it. The Kharakian clans put aside their differences and collaborated to build a huge mothership that would take them to Hiigara. A neuroscientist named Karan developed a system that connected a human being with the mothership as its living computer. Karan volunteered and became the ships living computer and commander. First trials are about to begin, and this is where the game begins and where my spoiling ends. The writing of the game has a poetic direction. The narrator, the characters all feel like they are coming from inside a poem of sorts. This whole direction of narrative is very original and effective in contributing to the game's atmosphere. The voice acting seemed dull at the beginning, but this changed fast. It has a subtle emotional tension that works really well. GAMEPLAY AND MECHANICS: The mothership is your primary base of operations. There you can build all sorts of ships, from the smallest scout to the biggest battlecruiser, but it cannot move and while it is very durable it can't dish out any real punishment. There is also the carrier, a unit that has more limited building capabilities, and the research ships that are used to acquire new units and tech and which you can only have six at any given moment. And now lets see the part of the game that really made it stand out. Its unique, for an RTS, 3D space navigation. Now there is an extra dimension to navigate. This opens up new possibilities in tactics. Send ships, not just around, but also above and under your enemy, a function that i believe was greatly appreciated by those who liked multiplayer. This mechanic is implemented excellently in HW and really works, but it has some minor quirks. You see, to move your unit you can't just right or left click somewhere in the map. You must either select the appropriate option from a menu opened by right clicking the unit or units whom you wish to move and then left clicking on the map, and you must hold shift in order to choose height. Fear not though. The tutorial does an excellent job on teaching you the ropes and the movement system is relatively easy to get used to. There is also a world map mode accessed by pressing spacebar. From there you got an overall view of the entire map so you can monitor various fronts, you can see where resources are denser and your units appear as green dots(enemy as red while color varies in multiplayer). One of the best features of the game is the fact that whatever you have(units, resources etc.) carries on to the next mission. You must be effective in the missions ahead as it would be unpleasant if you have ended up on the next mission with very low resources and with a very small ineffective wing of interceptors vs a full enemy fleet. Missions themselves are very unpredictable in nature, and I wont say more about this element as to not don't spoil them. Lastly many missions will make you fill like you fighting against all odds, and you do. Enemy forces will often outnumber yours quite a bit and you will be like in battlestar galactica, fighting a fierce galactic empire with your small fleet of ships TECHNICALLY, the game was great for it's time, and I believe it runs fine on newer hardware. The music really reinforces the atmosphere and sound is of generally good quality. I suggest you buy the remastered version that comes together with the second game with vastly improved graphics and cut scenes. FINAL VERDICT: A poetic, epic space opera awaits you in homeworld, that is right up there with the best of them. It is also one of the most original RTS games to be released. Get it any way you can.. Although dated, the game is still great. The only time I have actually felt alone by a video game. Fantastic music, wonderful story and fun multiplayer. Very good replay value. A must play for RTS fans.. I like this game ,,, the story were OK , the game-play was good ,,, solid mechanics overall but not revolutionary in any way ,,, i played the remastered version and was a pleasant experience. I won't sit here and say that you're going to love this game simply because RTS games aren't for everyone. I on the other hand love this game. It's one of my all time favourites and sits amongst a select few that I believe deserve a 10/10. The visuals, music, gameplay and story are all top notch. Buy the remastered version.. The most special RTS game in the history of game. I first played this game in 2010 and it kicked ass. Honestly, the gameplay is a little hard to understand and sometimes, takes too much time. but still I should admit that this is a masterpiece. also it's my favorite game. There are times where I think that the current generation of games in going in the wrong direction. Going back and playing this masterpiece tells me two things. One is that at least in one point in time there was a game well worth the price tag. It also tells me that with the remastered edition on the way that we are not totally lost and on a bad path. Homeworld is a gem in a vast and confusing game market. Not many other RTS games compare. It was unique to its play style and shows off a 3D tactical environment. Truly one of the best strategy games ever conceived, In a nutshell and being totally honest Homeworld is a must buy. Its true to the name classic just as much as Halo: Combat Evolved was for the FPS market. Buy it.. I played both of these when they first released. Never came across a game as fun as these since then, Homeworld 1 & 2 pulled me out of FPS game's, fully into RTS game's. So glad to see them get remastered.. One of the most epic and entertaining games ever created. This game (HW 1 & 2 + Cataclysm witch is unfortunately not available in the Remastered Edition) has almost everything. A deep and thrilling story, powerful music and a very unique style of playing. Of course the mechanics are now around 15 Years old, but it is still a true challenger to the modern space setting strategy games. Especially the three dimensional maps require a whole new level of thinking when it comes to strategy.. I have seen the face of God.. And it's in Space. .. This is one of the very first games I ever played and it left such a big mark on me. The music is amazing the game-play and graphics were years ahead of it's time and the remastered version is one of the most anticipated games in my book.. An aesthetic masterpiece, outstanding challege and balance, fantastic and moving story - Homeworld is one of the few masterpieces in gaming history and is an absolute joy to play, and offers impeccable accessibility - I will never forget this game.. Half RTS, half space aquarium, Homeworld is one of the few essential titles any strategy fan needs to have played. Even replaying this amazing game more than a decade later it is still unsurpassed as far as game play, graphics and sound is concerned. The single player campaign is on my list of essential sci fi literature along with Alien, Star Wars and Starcraft. And on top of the spectacular pacing of the story comes great visuals, tremendous sound and tough as nails tactics. At every turn you feel as if you really are way out in space, and some of the scenarios are breathtaking and feel really lethal. The single best feature of the game for me is the fact that all your forces carry on between missions, giving you a chance to plan out your fleet from the start as well as a powerful urge not to lose any ships. Needless to say this is pretty hard to accomplish. On top of this resources are tight as a drum, and you`ll happily fly for ten minutes each way just to pick up a single grain of space dust if you have to. If any negatives can be found they are negligible. However for people unaccustomed to RTS games Homeworld will be very tough to get to grips with beyond the first couple of levels. Even once the relatively tricky procedure of learning how to control your fleet in 3D is done with, the campaign is just unbelievably hard. It is hard in all the right ways though, and doesn`t cheat you. But still I can see it being a bit overwhelming for many people. Secondly, I have also identified a graphical bug which causes the occasional star to stick on the left edge of the view after it should have disappeared off screen. And finally in Homeworld there is a powerful compulsion to remain in each zone until every last resource has been gathered by your slow moving harvesters. This is because you need all of it, and it really does take the odd half hour for this to get done on some levels. And because people complained about it a high speed gathering function was added for the sequels. But this is an artifact of the gaming community in the classic PC era, which was composed of very patient people, quite unlike today. It was expected that games would reward patience as well as skill, planning, overview and tactical ability. Personally I loved it (And I detested the fast gathering in Cataclysm and Homeworld 2, possibly as the only person in the world.) since it gave me a welcome break between the hectic missions during which I could watch the backgrounds and listen to the relaxing music. Anyone who doesn`t need a breather after the intense missions in Homeworld should have their blood pressure and other vitals checked.. If none of this turns you off then go get Homeworld with all appropriate haste! It is one of the most flawless games ever released for the PC. This game is awesome. My dad showed this game to me and told me to play it. I'll admit at first sight this thing looks so damn boring but when you really take your time and play this game, single player and multiplayer becomes a friggen Star Trek simulator, I love it!. Very hard not to love this game. Great game-play, beautiful graphics for the time and very advanced as well. Even today, there is little that can match it.. Homeworld is a marvelous game which aged very well. What really stands out are story, gameplay and music/ sound which create an incredible deep atmosphere which isn't reached by any other RTS till now.. An excellent game with awesome graphics for its day (And even now). The races were too similar for my tastes, which is the only bad point in the game. Great visuals, great SFX, great soundtrack, geat campaign. One of my all time favorite Strategy games, and i think one of the first of its kind. It has its own style and i would go ahead and say even today it could be enjoyed by someone who never played it before. Massively ahead of it's time, and few modern releases even get close to this for it's gameplay. Never playing this game is as much a crime as never playing Deus Ex; it should be taught in frikkin schools.. I can't praise this game highly enough. This game should get 20/20 it is probably my favourite game of all time. BRING ON HOMEWORLD 3. How can anyone give this game less than 10.. first off you have to understand that for its time of release, 1999, that games and especially RTS games were still in the beginning phases of development. that being said, this is an amazing game. i am going to say my only complaint right of the bat. The interface, overlay, and lets face it, is really hard to manage and get used to. right when i started this game i had no idea how to manage the overlay, and it took a long time to get used to it, it is not friendly at all. Now that, that is out of the way i can get to the real game. the strategy, lets first take into account where we are, SPACE. Homeworld is a SPACE game. that's right, tapping into a brand new theme for a game, this is revolutionary, and for me amazing, i love space. and they do it fantastically. i have nothing to say other than that, you just need to play it, NOW. That is if you can find it. I have always thought that this game was underrated, and never got the attention it deserved. so go play it, after you can find it 9/10 -out of this world, literal.... A extremely important moment in gaming history. Relic took the RTS format and added an additional dimension in a space strategy game that arguably has yet to be bested. The singleplayer experience is moving, challenging and memorable. Quite possibly one of the best games ever.. I was waiting for this game some months, and bought it right away after it's release. It's a deep strategy game, with great graphics, story and awesome sound (not only music). Full of that kind of details that make a good game a great one. Unfortunately I have never found again a RTS game like this. Highs: everything except it's low Lows: Sometimes can be slow (worse when replaying missions). I played this game 3 times, that tells you everything you have to know. Absolutely loved this game. The story line was fantastic, tactical gameplay and upgrade systems where also top notch. Not really seen another game of its type since. Really wish someone would bring another game like this onto the market. This is a MUST PLAY GAME for sci fi tactical gamers.. I played it for the first time about five years after it was released, I didn't expect much as the price was pretty low. How was I surprised when the game turned to be so awesome. Great story and the climate, amazing music and art, as well as great graphic. First game to fully utilize full 3d combat and movement in space. And what combat it is! Sure, the controls can be confusing a bit at the beginning, but it's nothing a few minutes in tutorial can't fix. The story is simply amazing. Enthralling, one may say, and If you have a heart somewhere there inside your flesh, you will be moved by it. Maybe even to tears. All in all, amazing game.. This is a space opera. The design is directly inspired by those sci-fi book cover you can find at second hand bookstore, the music is just beautiful and fit so well the atmosphere and the action of the game. For many players, the game looks too complicate as you are dealing with a 3 dimension tactical map, but if you hang on and master it (not that difficult, just need some practice), then the payback is huge. The other thing player find very difficult is that you start a mission with what you had in the previous one (or what you lack of). But there is nothing better to let you feel in total immersion, and catch a COS ""completion obsession syndrome"", where you will try to take over as much as enemy ship before getting to the next level (i finished the game with a hundred ion fregate (at 5fps, back on my p3 667). I played it again, this time on a 1080p projector... wow. Do yourself a favor, buy this game, wait the night to come, put your best headphone, launch the game all lights out, and listen to ""ave maria"".",it's been roughly 25 years since the original homeworld came out . this is one of the most definitive RTS games in gaming history . the writing of the game has a poetic direction .
11.Metroid Prime,"The best game to hit any system in the past few years. No game has captivated me more or been more fun than Metroid Prime in a very long time.. Looks as good if not better than the most cutting-edge PC games available. It's got a unique, cool as ice visual style and a soundtrack that should be winning awards. Most importantly, the gameplay is so finely tuned and tweaked as to be a sublime experience in and of itself.. Unbelieve transition into 3d for this franchise. Absolutely a blast to play through.. Metroid Prime for the gamecube is an under rated classic, not just comparable to the original Super Metroid, but even better.. Whether you're negotiating platforms (made simple thanks to a camera that pans down) or involved in the final climatic battle with Metroid Prime, you always feel as if you're at one with the game. And surely that's what gaming's all about, isn't it?. While hardcore FPS fans might be a little put off early with the amount of exploring that has to be done, those prepared to put in some serious hours will be constantly enthralled as the puzzles unravel. A visual and sonic masterpiece, MP is destined to go down as one of the best computer games of all time.. One of the greatest games of all time. Bravo.. The first person controls work well for the most part, but we just can't ignore a few control issues that crop up at the worst possible time.. While Metroid Prime engages on no level other than gameplay, that gameplay is so perfectly tuned and refined, so continuously evolving and clever that you'll keep playing and playing, even when you're frustrated, even when you're honestly just a little bored with the back-tracking, and even though you don't care about the character or story.. Incredible stages, perfect soundtrack, unbeatable atmosphere, an immersive story and a total revolution to what the saga was at that time, well deserving of its GOTY award, thanks to the developers for this masterpiece!. Not as good as people say, its kind of boring, lots of navigating, the story feels stale, and the gameplay is just okay.. The beginning of the game was good and gave me classic Metroid feels. As it progressed I didn’t find it fun and challenging so much as annoying and tedious. I regret buying this. Boring as hell. Lots of backtracking, repetitive as hell, destroy the enemies, return to the same room later and just do it again and again. It’s boring. Some of the boss fights are slug fests also. Dull.","a visual and sonic masterpiece, Metroid Prime is destined to go down as one of the best computer games of all time . the gameplay is so finely tuned and tweaked as to be a sublime experience in and of itself . the beginning of the game feels stale, and the story feels stale ."
110.Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,"A serious contender to Metal Gear's crown, Splinter Cell's more grown-up cinematic storyline, intuitive controls and realistic graphics made for a high quality stealth-based action game hampered only by a couple of ****; namely the inability to invert the camera and the absence of melee combat which is illogical and frustrating.. A instant classic. I really remember playing this game when I was kid and still loving it today. There are no games like this anymore sadly. 10/10. The game that started it all, still a masterpiece even today. Maybe not as good as Pandora Tomorrow or Chaos Theory tho.. An Xbox classic from 2002. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell plays like a realistic version of Metal Gear Solid. At the time of release, it was the most graphically advanced video game on console. Featuring stunning lighting and shadow effects, ""Splinter Cell"" was the first true showcase of the Xbox's graphical power. Visually, It still holds up exceptionally well in 2019. The stealth gameplay is equally impressive. While it might be too slow for some, the game arguably surpasses MGS and Hitman in stealth tactics. As NSA field operative Sam Fisher, players can utilize numerous abilities, weapons and gadgets. While there may be too many trial-and-error segments, this is one of the best action titles from the early 2000's. I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10. Splinter Cell was one of the great games from 20 years ago. I noticed that this game was on the backward compatible list for the Xbox One, and decided to give it a whirl. It was a great decision, as the game was brilliant back then, and is still fantastic today! I was amazed just how revolutionary it was for a 2002 game. Sam Fischer rocks! Pros- Sneak mode is awesome with lovely use of shadow/lighting Heaps of gadgets to attach to the weapons Incredible storyline- Chinese, Burma, Russian Republics- just like the real world today Michael Ironside voice acting Nice challenge to beat on first playthrough- easy on second attempt Combat is really good for a stealth game Good amount of check points to save frustration Cons- No widescreen support for modern gaming AI soldiers have repetitive patterns and voice acting Jump button can throw you in frustrating directions Game Content- 10 out of ten Fun Factor- 8 out of ten Overall score- 9. OVERALL - 82% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 7/10 I found the controls hard to get used to and couldn't help but compare it to the superior MGS series, but there was a clear developer vision that was laid out in this game and deserved to be successful.. When Tom Clancy´s fresh franchise Splinter Cell was released in 2003, i was totally hyped. With this game you get the full agent stealth action and a real competitor to the Metal Gear Solid series. Everything from graphics to gameplay were stunning. And this game can still hold up today. Get it for thrilling hours of high suspense! I played it on PC too, but the Xbox version is by far the best!. The games aged roughly I want to love it but the games so frustrating that i cant. Its still not bad just frustrating to play a lot of the time if this version had quick saves id probably be more forgiving and give it a 7","""splinter cell"" is an Xbox classic from 2002 . the stealth gameplay is equally impressive . the inability to invert the camera is illogical and frustrating ."
111.Okami,"Beautiful artstyle, running animation, & soundtrack. Unique & fantastic gameplay. Cutscenes are a little long & challenge is rare.. This is such a amazing and beautiful game. The puzzles are uniqe, the exploration is addicting and satisfying, the music is straight out of Japan, and the story has likeable characters and interesting lore throughout. My literal only issue is maybe it could be a bit more challenging, but at the end of the day, this game is phenomenal. Would recommend. Okami is one of the most visually stunning games on the PS2, but the glacial pacing and unsatisfying combat ultimately result in a relatively disappointing experience.. This is a must play game ever in PS2 Platform! Hoping for the sequel, dear CAPCOM. one of the most beautfiul games during the ps2 era.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 오오카미 HD 한국어판으로 출시해주세요! Please release the 'Ookami HD' game in Korean!. Ookami is a very cute game. This game is a welcome game for pet owners. Because the sun god of Japan becomes a wolf and goes on an adventure. He also has a good sense of action and hitting. And to the extent that it is the origin of Zelda's legend, the adventure method is much more than Zelda's legend. I don't know why this game doesn't have 100 Metascore points. I also liked the action using brush strokes.. Truly impressive. Almost a perfect adventure game. +Great Zelda-like gameplay +awesome and memorable soundtrack +nice art-style that still works +tight controls that do what you want them to do +a lot to do +great use of Japanese mythology and culture to create a living, appealing world +varied environments -almost a little too long to the point where some segments really feel like filler -somewhat annoying voices that require some time to get used to. this game is a masterpiece, everyone should play it, and i mean it. it literally made me cry. Oh god I really wanted to love this game. It has no punch. You never have any risk of dying, money is meaningless, and everywhere you walk feels like a MOBA. This is because of the way your character moves, and so everything is just wide ramps and plateaus, which is super boring and uninspired, it doesn't matter if your character and the trees look gorgeous. This game drags so much, and should never be compared to Zelda, this game literally tells you how to solve each puzzle before you even have a chance of trying yourself! It's just busywork! Amazingly flawed game design! The graphic style is beautiful, the characters funny, but god damn does this not deserve all the praise it gets, be warned.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games ever made that's packed with (optional) content, fluent gameplay transitions from puzzle to platforming to just exploring every nook and cranny of an unprecedented world.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT.. Greatest adventure game of all time, this is a must buy for everyone that enjoys games. This is what games are really about. Pure fun. The game has the player controlling the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, or sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series,. Generally there are many nuisances to playing this game here are a few: -every time you pick up an inventory item the game pauses and displays a popup description that you can't skip until a second and a half whether or not you've picked up that same item before. -every time you choose to feed animals a cutscene is loaded that is unique to the animal type you are feeding, this is even a longer break in gameplay and requires you to wait around 5 seconds before you can get out of it. -The combat becomes super limiting in what you are able to do and certain enemies and bosses require you to perform very specific actions in order to deal damage to them and once you figure out their gimmick they become a breeze. The major nuisances: The dialogue would be better if it didn't exist at all and was more of an artistic representation where the environment indicates where to go and what to do rather than some red text that plainly states it. There are certain points in the story where what you're supposed to do is completely incoherent and the developers knew it or else they wouldn't add a ""fortune teller"" so you can pay for the red text that tells you what to do. One point in the game requires you to fire a rotating cannon at a wall to crate a hole but there aren't any distinctive marks for what wall this cannon should be fired at. the cannon doesn't appear to fire any sort of projectile out of it to indicate that it will affect the surface it is being targeted at so I assumed that some sort of cannon ball needed to be located but no, it's just bad game design. Then there's also another point in the game with the Orca and finding a ""whirlpool"" that leads to the dragon temple, the Orca tells you that ""the whirlpool is somewhere in the ocean"" so I ride around exploring the islands in the ocean and when I decide to actually look for this whirlpool instead I waste 20 minutes looking for it because the Orca couldn't be any more specific about how this ""whirlpool"" was to be accessed. What I was supposed to do was go back to shore and talk to someone on a cliff that triggers an event where you draw stars in the sky to create a spiral constellation and spin it to create the whirlpool in the ocean. The entire game and everything you do in it is linear and scripted but the game gives away the answers to puzzles straight from the beginning, the balance of how much information the player should be given to complete a task is very rarely intuitive and rewarding to follow through with, either the dialogue overextends information of what the player is to do or it tells you to do ""step 4"" but completely overlooks steps 1-3 which are seemingly unrelated to step 4. The redeemable qualities of this game are it's art style, the story, cutscenes ,and characters are well executed though don't explore out of the realm of cliche, the fishing minigame that requires me to inject steroids into my left thumb, and some of the objectives/side quests are genuinely intuitive and fun to complete but there's still a lot of missed opportunities to give the player an ""Aha"" moment. This game feels like it was meant for a younger audience at times when everything you need to do is plainly stated (sometimes even several times over) but that would be in contrast with some of the convolution that not even an adult could figure out where or how to progress without glancing over a walkthough which isn't desirable for any game.. This is exactly my type of game, cool animation, something new with the brush control and a nice adventure run around. I haven't played this in years and never will again but couldn't believe the reviews. I was really excited to play it, I played it for about 5 hours the first night and woke up the next day and put it on eBay. It is by far one of the worst games I have ever played. So boring, I like boring adventure games but this was a joke. Annoying character with you the whole time. By annoying I mean unbearable, wanted to rip it from the screen and smash it in. Then the brush that doesn't work very well at all I can't understand the high scores. I gave it a 1 for looking nice but there was nothing else to like for me to rate it higher. Sitting through 5 hours of Hatsune Miku, mixed up with a bit of Hello Kitty and a bit of Hannah Montana thrown in for good measure would have been 5 hours better spent than this. Possibly my least favourite game ever made.. Although this is a beautiful-looking game with an original artistic direction, there is so much that goes wrong; the babbling voices that stand in for dialogue, repetitive gameplay, and constant hand-holding - as well as an almost impenetrable brush system that does not seem to always want to do what you want it to do: I hate the word 'overrated', but this is all I can think about to describe such a critically-lauded, but difficult to love game like Okami.. Such a excellent game with innovative gameplay, art direction, style, etc.... Fascinating, but way too easy. Questionable art style. Couldn't get used to the graphics at first, would prefer a more photorealistic picture.. Okami is one of the best games of its generation and is in many ways ahead of its time. It is very difficult to find games that have great gameplay and also a great story. Okami is one of those rare games that has almost everything I look for, the gameplay is unique and immersive, progression improves gameplay, the story is both epic and intimate, puzzle solving and platforming lends itself to the story . It has fantastic gameplay mechnanics but more than that, those mechanics are well explained by the story and that makes them more satisfying to use. Most games that have magical abilities limit those abilities to combat. In Okami the magic is used more to solve puzzles and interact with the world. Okami has a lot of the qualities that I love about Zelda but it is far from a clone, it has its own identity and is actually better than the majority of Zelda games. Only a few flaws prevent this from reaching a perfect score. Even though it received universal praise from critics it is criminally under appreciated and I think it is a tragedy that I rarely meet people who have played this gem. Do yourself a favor and check it out. In terms of gameplay Okami does a lot right. There are a ton of abilities and almost all of them are fun to use. Like Zelda, it offers a great bend of puzzle solving, platforming and combat. One thing that makes it special though is that just traversing the landscape is made fun thanks to Amaterasu's incredible speed and magical traversal abilities. There are so many cool abilities unlock that I was motivated to unlock new ones from beginning to end. It is almost perfect, My only major complaints are that combat happens in a closed off battle arena instead of in the open field, that restriction takes away from the immersion and the fun of using the environment to your advantage. Another thing that annoyed me is that there are a few puzzles that are extremely frustrating and pointlessly difficult just because of the controls. Otherwise though this game has some of the best gameplay I have seen even to this day. The story of Okami is fantastic, it starts out like a simple fairy tale but gradually progresses into something much more complex and epic. It is funny and childish on the surface but mature at its core. There are many major twists and turns that took me completely by surprise yet rarely did they feel random, almost everything that happens is for a purpose. The story is very strange but for the most part it makes sense and is easy enough to follow. My only major complaint about the story is that there were a few events that seemed out of place. There were also a few sections that were a chore to progress through. Still the story is probably better than any other action platformer I can think of. The visual style of Okami speaks for itself. I can certainly understand why it put some people off but personally I loved it. It is uniquely beautiful and fit the tone of the story well. In an age when 3d game that aimed for realism tended to look quite bad I think this game has aged very well thanks to its clean visual style. Its a rare work of art. In terms of the overall scope of the game, it is full of content. I spent around 70 hours on my first play through. There are many towns, dungeons and regions to explore. Its bigger than most of the 3d Zelda games and probably has more collectibles and abilities to discover as well. You are definitely getting your moneys worth in terms of content. Overall Okami is one of the best games on the PS2 and I would even go as far as to say it is one of the best games of all time. It might be weird but take a chance on it, it is definitely worth it.. If you are about to play this game take into consideration it might start off with a slow pace but once it picks up it becomes art. The game is a delight to play, yes the presentation is gorgeous, yes the music is what you would expect from a mythological Japanese masterpiece and yes the brush is as innovative as the wheel but also the combat feels so satisfying when you get the hang of it, the items and weapons are so inspired and so greatly designed: the lore is absolutely amazing, I spent a lot of time just reading the lore for each of the enemies. So much to do, the world of Okami is so very interesting and beautiful. There is always things to do, like exploring Nippon is one of the greatest points of this game I can write a bunch explaining why this game is a 10 but that would be spoiling and you sir need to get this game and play the over 30 hours it has to offer, that if you are in a rush. Easily a 40 hour game if you take your time.. I had a lot of things to say about this game but can't find the words. I am so glad I can speak Japanese because this is one of the most unique experience I had from a video game*. Still remember the moment when ""The Sun Rises"" played at the final boss fight. I almost cried because the music is so beautiful. *The English version is fine, but you'd miss out on the puns and backstories of characters. For example, Okami can be written as 大神/Great God or 狼/Wolf which is why they made Amaterasu a wolf in the game.. We've all heard about Okami's stunning graphics, unique gameplay, and epic story art, but I believe the finer features of the game are incredibly under-appreciated. Okami's Nippon has been fine-tuned to feel like a real world--one where things happen outside the main character's life, one where people are real people with personalities and lives, one that you want to explore from nose to tail.. Gorgeous world, fantastic story and superbly innovative ""painting"" game play. Running around the vast world completing the main story and side-quests, leaping from massive cliffs and sky-high towers, picking fights with the ""most wanted"" demons, upgrading your spells and unleashing insane combos... It's all too satisfying !!! This game is definitely in my top 5 PS2 games of all time !!!... It baffles me how nobody ever mentions this gem. (COD3 and FFXII definitely hogged the 2006 spotlight). This game is perfect. Best artistic direction, soundtrack, gameplay, level design, chara-design, pacing, scenario, very long but not boring. It was pretty courageous for Capcom and Clover to release a specific games like, it was a time when it was possible. It's a must have.. Until this day no other game has left a beautiful stain in my mind. I remember playing shooters, brawlers, horrors etc, yet it was when I picked up this peaceful, stylish, tough at times and an extremely interesting game that I began to invest myself in worlds where you can clearly see there was heart and soul dedicated to the game. Words can't share how I truly feel, you must experience this game.. Beautiful game a must buy for fans of artistic games. Not only is the art style excellent but the story and game play is amazing and will keep you hooked for hours on end.. One of the best games I have ever experienced in my life. This is not just a game, this is art. Words cannot describe how great and emotional this game is , you have to experience it for yourself. Its a masterpiece. Go and play it , you wont regret it!. Such a piece of art, this game is the best game I have ever played, it is much like Zelda but way different at the same time, it has a gorgeous art-style and since I love cell-shading and Japanese lands combined with art and particles. It's just a gorgeous art to play. The story is amazing, long and touching. The powers are amazing and the music is amazing too. ****/watch?v=UsnJRyTlFb0 just listen to this gorgeous piece and tell me you don't want to play it!. I'm not a Japan maniac weaboo believe me. Yes, the game is cheesy at some points, the unskippable notifications, the intro and the speech voices are a bit annoying. But besides these minor issues, the game is very well crafted, well paced, and it's THE most beautiful and memorable game I've ever played. The whole reason I bought a used Ps2, Totally worth it. (Too bad it was never released on the PC). Also this is the first game I've ever rated a 10.. By far the best game I've ever played in my 21+ years. I loved the gameplay mechanic of the Celestial Brush, the characters were wonderfully developed and each had a unique tie-in with Japanese lore. The art style is unlike anything I've seen before it, and the whole story was at par of an expertly directed film. Definitely give this game a try, you will NOT be disappointed.. ONE OF THE BEST GAME i EVER PLAYED! THIS IS WHY i STILL FEEL ps2 IS THE BEST CONSOLE EVER!!!!!!!!!! From graphics to amazing world , story .. every aspects of this game is just fantastic!!!. Few videogames stand the test of time, and Okami is certainly one of them. Perhaps it's the unparalleled graphics, the unique characters and story, or maybe it's the setting and atmosphere.When people are talking about ""Art in videogames"" I think of Okami. Even 6 years after it's release, not a single game came close to it's vision and magnitude in graphical design, from my perspective. There are games that have better graphics, for granted, but there are few that can challenge Okami's beautiful art direction and visuals. But the fact is that Okami is charming not only in it's graphics but also with it's humor and characters, and especially The little jokes/nuances are very endearing. The game also boasts some of the finest bosses I'v seen in videogames, as well as the ways of beating them. A 40 hour campaign and a vast array of unique locations make okami feel big and full of adventure. The story is a classic ""good VS evil"" affair but not so much that it descends to kitsch, thanks to the brilliant writing and fantastic characters. For me the overall experience was practically perfect. It's one of ""those"" games that you come back to every year and play again, just to remind yourself why you love videogames and also to remember the experience itself, one that will always stay with you.. The best game ever. It has everything: a superb story, wonderful graphics, beautiful, charismatic, a special atmosphere and with a outstanding visual design. It's a game without any obvious flaws. Maybe the difficulty? Bah, for this kind of game, the difficulty is not important at all.. One the most spectacular games I had the good fortune of playing. Every aspect of the game oozes with love. The graphical style is vibrant beautiful in motion. The character design is wide and very varies from each of the world's areas, resulting in very few occasions where you see the exact same enemy. The best part of the game however, for me, is that the story just keeps giving. No more than 4 times, I was certain I was about to beat the game, only to be shown that the latest challenge that threatened the world was nowhere near your final test. Overall, an experience that every gamer should have.. This underrated game deserves all the praise in the world, with stunning graphics, flowing gameplay, story art, and a great main character. Okami brings what a art loving, emotional story lover wants in this masterpiece. The 'REAL' fantastic game i've ever played! Its gorgeous art, soulful music and thrilling gameplay magnetize you into the most beautiful world of games you've ever seen. This game will make your life's most beautiful moment ever!. A near perfect game great story breakthrough gameplay and just plain fun my only complaint is that theres no voice acting just a mumbling sound a must buy!!. Unlike any other game out there, it is truly unique and a work of art. It's an amazing game for anyone. Ignore any negative reviews you ever see about this game, they're always just impatient children who don't want to read dialogue (give me a break!). Okami is the best!. To give you an idea of how good I think Okami is, I compare every single game I review to this game and GTA. Your review must be at least 150 characters long.. VERY good game. Haven't been this pleasantly surprised by a game in a while. Also one of the more recent games that kept me playing late in the night with that feeling of telling myself ""just one more checkpoint"". Very good art design and innovative new ideas for fighting. Great characters and one of the funniest games I have ever played. Also great how much game there is and how they make you think it is over but then add more story. Great value. Few problems are is it confusing where to go or what to do, and the game does not explain some of this that well. This leads to a lot of wandering around. A walkthrough for these parts are a must. Also need more checkpoints in case you don't want to have to play 1 hr+ every sit-down. Also could get a little talkative, without much action at some parts. There are also many problems with how precise brush is. I would make a slash but it would not be recognized for any good reason and this can be VERY frustrating. This was probably biggest and most annoying flaw in the game, the brush imprecision. All in all a great game.. Easily one of the best looking titles on the PS2 ever, Okami is as beautifully artistic as it is innovative. Pros: An astounding amount of depth within the gameplay and storyline; stunning graphics; solid controls; epic soundtrack; funny characters; the Celestial Brush is easy to use. Cons: Easy combat leads to repetitive button mashing; some occasional camera issues.. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Every second of your life that you pour into this stunning masterpiece of a video game is not one second of it wasted.. Simply the best game for the PS2. It has so many twists and turns, hidden secrets, and side quests that **** up your life. Whenever I play a new game its never quite the same experience as Okami The only comparison I can make is with the Zelda series, but it surpasses it in some ways. The integration of brush techniques and character building are unique. The whole experience is absorbing and intriguing. It never gets boring and every environment is fresh and beautiful. I just wish there was a sequal. For me, the best game ever. It's beautiful: just like a living painting; entertaining: the adventure is rich and many characters are to remember (i loved tiny Issun and his taste for busty ladies^^); and offers an original gameplay. Get it if you don't own this masterpiece yet!",this is one of the most visually stunning games on the ps2 platform . but the glacial pacing and unsatisfying combat ultimately result in a relatively disappointing experience . i don't know why this game doesn't have 100 Metascore points .
112.Fallout 3,"It’s a fine masterpiece. So much thought was put into it, and it still holds up today. Best game of 2008 even better than GTA IV. its absolutely insanely fun & i love it! fallout 3 is even further beyond epic. Overall a great introduction into the world of fallout. Not the best story however the gameplay makes up for this.. I can't even describe this masterpiece it's a""must play"" the world the story the combat literally everything 10/10. While Fallout 3 is not the best of the series. It hits so many high notes, it is impossible not to recommend this game.. This has been my first Fallout game and i have loved it from the first **** world building is simply perfect, the moment we leave the vault and look at the desolation around us will remain stuck in my mind forever.Environment, npcs, side quests and Easter eggs all together create an immersive experience that the sequels (exception for New Vegas) have never achieved **** gameplay is quite simple but the characterization of our lone wanderer is very deep and often crucial to success or fail some mission checks, this is a very important aspect of this gdr because our decisions AND abilities will change deeply the story; this is the reason why 1 run is not enough to experience the whole **** map is filled with points of interest and random encounters, I have checked every single icon on the map, every side quest and dlc have been completed and with highs and downs I have never been dissatisfied.Some dungeons can turn out quite repetitive, especially the subways, and the grey palette can accelerate the gameplay fatigue but from we must keep in mind that a post apocalyptic world can't be a colorful place and this oppressive feeling is part of the game atmosphere.. The entire ambience created throughout the settings, characters and infamous radio stations of this post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland are reason enough for every gamer to play this from start to finish at least once. Then you add the revolutionary combat and well... just grab a Nuka-Cola... set back... and enjoy this masterpiece.. This open world game was so much fun. It got me hooked on the fallout series. The fallout games weren't as fun as this one. But I love the open world. Absolutely phenomenal! the atmosphere and map is damn near perfect. the only real down side this game has is the story.. an excellent game that knew how to adapt in an acceptable way the world that Black Isle presented to us in Fallout 1 and 2, although they did not know how to adapt things like the crudeness of Fallout 1 or the humor of Fallout 2, leaving a strange line between both games, The lore on the other hand remains almost the same, although here we begin to see problems that we would see later, it is clear that Bethesda does not understand that Fallout is a world that progressed with the aesthetics of the 50s and was later nuked, even so the entire section Playable is good, the map is very large, it is even larger than the Mojave or Boston, the new enemies added by Bethesda such as the mirelurks are good, the map has many locations full of content, the aesthetics are good for being from 2008 , the story is somewhat weak, being like the first two, you have to look for a MacGuffin and the story advances from there, definitely a good game that does not deserve all the hate it has today just for being from Bethesda. Fallout 3 was released in 2008, developed and released by Bethesda Studios. It was directed by Todd Howard, produced by Ashley Cheng and Gavin Carter, and designed by Emil Pagliarulo. I played it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14, and I was immediately captivated. I thought the world felt so desolate and dangerous, and it really captured the post-apocalyptic feeling it was going for. I also loved that it was set in the greater DC area, since I live there. In this review, I will discuss the alarming disparity between the political messaging in the game and the alarmingly popular interpretations these segments have in its fan community. Fallout 3 emerged with the cancellation of Van Buren, which was originally intended to be the third installment in the Fallout franchise and set to be developed by Black Isle, but was shut down due to financial reasons. Bethesda purchased the rights to Fallout 3 in 2004. The game was created with a team of around 10 people. It has very mixed reviews among Fallout fans; the general consensus seems to be that New Vegas is the best of the 3D games (Fallouts 1 and 2 had a top down, isometric, turn based combat style) followed by the third installment, then the fourth, and then 76. A lot of New Vegas fans prefer its less restrictive play style. For example, every New Vegas NPC is killable, while Fallout 3 has a number of essential characters that can not die. I will admit that I only prefer 3 for nostalgia reasons, but it’s still my favorite regardless. Seeing as the turning point in the game’s history was a nuclear resource war, it's no wonder every game has myriad political themes and recurring undertones. The two major actors in said war were China and the United States, so one can imagine how people could easily misinterpret some of these same messages to reinforce their existing biases. As a result of this, one can easily begin to notice a phenomenon that is in no way unique to this one community; many popular interpretations of the game’s messaging fail to recognize basic political satire and instead become what the game is making fun of. The most infamous example of this phenomenon can be seen in the final act of the game’s storyline. The player character aids in the reconstruction of a pre-war robot to help in the upcoming assault on a massive water purifying system that is currently held by a rogue remnant sect of the pre-war government. This robot, called Liberty Prime, has a couple dialogue lines that it cycles through while it hurls miniature nuclear bombs at the various levels of defense en route to the water purifier. These lines include “Embrace democracy, or you will be eradicated!” and “Democracy is truth. Communism is death.” This surface-level irony, which makes fun of the fact that neither ideology survived the near-total destruction of the planet, coupled with the fact that it is canonically later revealed in the franchise that Vault-Tec, the notoriously evil pre-war conglomerate responsible for the franchise’s iconography, persuaded the US government into launching the first nuclear strike, would seemingly make this very difficult to misconstrue. However, you might be surprised at what the widely-accepted interpretation of Liberty Prime is. A cursory search on YouTube reveals videos like “Liberty Prime’s Best Moments” and even “Liberty Prime for President”, suggesting that people did somehow manage to miss the point. Another example of this phenomenon can be seen, unsurprisingly, through players’ reaction to the Fallout universe’s closest thing to an allegory for racism: Ghouls. Ghouls are humans that have been disfigured over time, giving them a zombie-like look. There are feral and non-feral ghouls; the former will attack the player character on sight, while the latter are just as likely to be hostile as non-Ghoul characters. However, again, a YouTube search reveals comments like “No wonder they commit 57% of the crimes in the Wasteland” and “Crime statistics are a thing.” This shows that not only did people fail to not be racist in a fictional setting, they also mapped their real-world biases onto a nonexistent group of people, which is an extreme reverse case of “bleeding.” Both of these examples would almost certainly alienate potential players from the game, which is a shame, because if one only interacted with fan content like this, they would get a very skewed representation of what the game actually is. I would still recommend this game, though it might be better for the sake of new players if they just stick to the game itself and don’t seek out outside opinions on the content if they would like to keep the best possible perception of the Fallout universe. I think the way the game itself tackles these issues is very nuanced and thought-provoking, and has very relevant real-world connections, but you would never know that just from watching fan made content.. Fallout 3 is hilarious, surprising, offensive, expansive, and rewarding in all the best ways. It gives the player a sense of unparalleled freedom that changed the way I saw games when I played it for the first time back in high school. I still play today, in my mid 30s. They just don’t make games like this anymore. Fallout 3 and New Vegas will always be on my shortlist of favorite games of all time.. When I comes to Fallout 3 you could say that the game is a desolate waste where there is nothing for miles. And in a way that is the hard truth of the atom bomb, but it doesn't make rhe game that good due to a lack in resource. Another difficulty of Fallout 3 is the hardship of everyday life, and struggle of survival. The problem with that is it makes adventure in the beginning, impossible, without a visious dog or a mole rat munching on you every mile. Fallout 3 can only be found as a good game but not a great one.. one of the greatest games of all time. had everything and deserves its current goat status. Arguably one of the best fallouts in the series paving the way for first-person mode of the games fallout 3 makes leaps and bounds from its predecessors and was ahead of its time at release. Still holds up today when I go to play through it now. This one is definitely worth a play.. Fun but ultimately quite hollow in terms of just how empty the map feels and how light it feels with lore. It's revived the franchise but a shell of what it was.. Does its best to bring a setting into the Oblivion engine. In the modern day, it suffers from being an infinitely inferior version of New Vegas.. Fallout 3 features a unique and engaging story with a darker atmosphere compared to Fallout 4. I prefer Fallout 3's story, even though Fallout 4 offers more freedom. As an RPG, Fallout 3 excels. However, I don't recommend playing it on PS3, as it tends to crash every few minitues after installing the DLC 'The Pitt'.. Graphics (5/10) Really bad but it is 16 years old Gameplay (6/10) The combat is repetitive and gets boring Music (8/10) The radio system is a really cool and unique feature Story (8/10) Really good world building with interesting characters however there is a very clear good or evil factions. This game is way ahead of its time but the graphics are so outdated. Could be 10/10 if remastered. I will dump my entire life savings for a remake please todd howard the [Speech 100%] man. Best game ever Todd take my money and make new one will buy all DLC xDDDDDD. Insane on every level at the time of release. Still holds up in nearly every aspect other then the gunplay and graphics.. What an adventure it was, finished in 50 hours, the game just doesn't let you walk away from the screen, the atmosphere is unique, the multitude of locations and stories behind them is cosmic and damn good. I played it for the first time and if it weren't for the other games I have to complete I would probably spend the second time in this adventure. On the downside I will include the main storyline which is terribly weak. There were 5 story dlc's released for Fallout 3 and unfortunately only 2 of them are noteworthy:Point Lookout and The Pitt. The next ones are boring and deviate terribly from the climate. That's why Brothers of steel I simply didn't finish because it bored me to death.. It's alright, but itI'm kinda mixed on this game, but it's still a fun game so I'll give it a 7/10 for now. This game has many glaring flaws that it makes it really hard to recommend, but if you can look past those flaws, there's still some fun to be had. Let's start with a few, shall we? 1. This is NOT an RPG This is my biggest problem with this game. Unlike it's successor(not it's distant ones, I'm talking about Fallout: New Vegas), your choices doesn't matter in this game. And the choices are often ""Do you want to be good or bad"" decisions. And they don't even affect the world that much. You don't get looked down when you nuke a **** town by other town residents. No one even mentions it, like wtf? There's also absolutely no complications, it's extremely basic. The game doesn't understand that not everything is black and white, most of the times its grey, it doesn't make people think about their decisions they make. It's like asking someone if they want to kill a dog or save it. It's not deep at all. Also the stats you put into a character because at max level you can literally get a perk that almost maxed them out for you. Then what's the point of making us choose what our character excels and struggle with? Terrible game design choices. So if you are looking for a real RPG experience, DO NOT play this game, it will heavily disappoint you. Go play Fallout: New Vegas if you want that. 2. Terrible story and quests I don't know why people praise the story of this game, it is incredibly mediocre and unengaging. Like I said earlier, this is not an RPG game. Which makes this problem even worse. You feel like you're watching events unfold instead of participating in the event in the first place. It feels like you're not the main character, your dad is for some reason. The script is incredibly underwritten, it feels more like a mediocre drama than the game of the year. The voice acting reflects this as well. The characters are so boring as well where you really don't care about their troubles and themselves. Why? Because of the world that feels lifeless. It's a snoozefest sometimes to go through the dialogue. That's my main problems with this game. I'm not counting technical issues as that's pretty common for a Bethesda game. If anyone needs a good modding guide, you can comment below this review, I'll give you the link to one that I used to get it running pretty well. The gameplay is also kinda alright but it's still good imo, but it's still worse than Fallout: New Vegas. The only thing that the game really excels in however, is the atmosphere. It's really well done. Too bad the world feels lifeless due to bad quest and game design even though it's great to look at (especially with mods). TLDR; It's an alright game. You'll have fun with it if you look past its flaws. But don't set your expectations too high and don't treat it as an RPG. If you're not willing to mod the game, then don't buy it as you may face a lot of technical issues. I still recommend Fallout: New Vegas more if you haven't played it yet. Play that game before coming back to this one, or you may lose interest in the Fallout franchise.. Fulfilled every fantasy I've ever had about scavenging and surviving in the post-apocalypse. Perfectly combined retro sci fi parody with a horrific vision of the darkness in humanity. The action became redundant after I maxed out all of my weapons and stats, but the quests, characters and locations remained imaginative throughout.. By 2024 standards, I think Fallout 3 can sometimes feel a bit ""of its time,"" for lack of better terms. However, this game is still a solid romp through a post-apocalyptic open world that still holds up. I don't have too much to say about Fallout 3 - most of its mechanics work well, and where they falter is mostly due to the fact that video games at large have come a long way since 2008. But the fact that I still enjoyed playing this game for about 30 hours, even over 15 years after its initial release date, speaks volumes about its quality and legacy. At the very least, it will likely provide up to a few dozen hours of open-world goodness that later games provided more of, and serves as a game that focuses more on the role-playing elements than its sequel did. And even if that aforementioned focus ended up making the shooting mechanics a bit lacking by modern-day standards, I think that what this game does right allows it to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its sequel.. Now this game is a great game because the atmosphere is perfect in this game and the gameplay is actually fun to play and it won’t bore you that’s for sure so if you don’t have this game already buy it it’s good and you will enjoy it. The start of Bethesda and their Fallout games. Fallout 3 is a phenomenal achievement. Paved the way for New Vegas to be as successful with the community as it is. BGS made one of the best RPGs of all time.. **** masterpiece i got this game for free from epic games u sould get this game till 24.12.2023 5pm cet. My first AAA game. I started playing it ten years ago and replay it every year and each time it doesn’t get worse, you notice more details and feel that this game was made with love.. Peak fiction Zenith of the medium Loved the atmosphere The lore The side content was awesome i completed all the side quests. Absolutely idiotic and very childish writing. Story line is atrocious and has a hole the size **** Canyon in it. Combat was ok for the time, nothing groundbreaking.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bethesda's first entry in the Fallout series is mostly a success and undeniably a bold, intricate, thought-out RPG title. Focusing on the positives, the Wasteland makes for an engaging setting, especially when first starting out; I was constantly intrigued by the grotesquely mutated enemies, the memorable yet devastated landmarks, and the wide variety of interesting characters. Every person you come across is well-written and well-acted, making the desolate world feel truly alive. Within the writing specifically, there is plenty of humor and creativity. Every RPG mechanic is fully fleshed out, with many different possible character builds; making progress through leveling up is consistently rewarding and fun. The graphics are solid for the time, even though lighting can be an issue. The core gameplay is a mixed-bag for some; with the VAT system, melee and ranged combat feels strategic and cinematic; without the VAT system, all forms of combat feel clunky, imprecise, and unpolished. There are plenty of bugs and imperfections, an inevitability with Bethesda at the handle, but most are minor and even add character. I personally found the looting and inventory management enjoyable, while others may disagree. Strangely enough, where Fallout 3 feels truly lacking is in the narrative; the main campaign is rarely surprising or interesting, and it's over far too quickly. I personally wish that there were stronger motivating aspects behind the main quest and that it explored more of the sizable map. I had much more enjoyment simply fleshing out my character and exploring the Wastelands aimlessly. Regardless, a good Fallout game, a great Bethesda game, and a true gaming novelty.. For me probably still the best post-apocalyptic RPG ever, sad it's still a little buggy.... It gets an extra point for the lore and side content Main game is pretty 5 out of 10. Fallout 3 is a great game, despite its flaws, the music, atmosphere and exploration make it one of my favorite Fallouts.. Still has amazing RPG elements. The capital wasteland is awesome. One of the best stories in gaming back when it was released.. why the hell would i ever play this buggy, overblown FPS game with half-assed RPG mechanics, when i can just go play New Vegas and have an objectively better experience? no really, why? what reason is there for this game to exist anymore, when everything it does has been done 100 times better by other games?. It's an FPS game with an appealing atmosphere, but it feels somewhat lacking in certain aspects.. An absolutely fantastic game, i loved it when it was released. It gave me so many hours of pure fun.. Easily the best game Bethesda has ever made. This is a fantastic game with fun gameplay and an engaging world and interesting characters.. Masterpiece. I play this game every two or three years; i envy those of you whom have never played it, since you can experience this atmosphere for the first time.. This Game Is My All-Time Favorite Video Game, The Reason Why This Is My All-Time Favorite Video Game Is the Setting Of Nuclear War Aftermath Survival!!!! I Grew Up As A Teenager In the 1980's, and As Anyone Who Ever Lived In the 1980's Will Remember the Greatest Fear In the 1980's Was the Real Possibilities Of A Nuclear War With the Soviet Union (Russia), So There Was This Fascination About What Would Happen If There Was Indeed A Nuclear War and How Would We Survival....From All the Movies and Music and Pop Culture Of the 1980's Already Ingrained Into Me From Growing Up In the 1980's, So the Setting Of This Video Game Fallout 3 Just Made Me Super Excited About This Video Game, I Had Never Seen or Heard Of Fallout, Or Fallout 2, Or Anything About Fallout Prior To Ever Playing Fallout 3, So I Knew Nothing of the Lore Of This Game Prior To Playing Fallout 3!!!!! The One Lore That Absolutely Surprised Me About the Game Was That It Was Taking Place 200 Years After the Nuclear War??? To Me I Would Have Made the Game Start Out Only 50 Years Max After the Nuclear War So There Is Always Fresh Content To Add As Far As Content To Add, Where As If Its 200 Years After the Nuclear War Its Pretty Much Over With As Far As Gameplay Survival Story Goes....2nd Thing That Surprised Me About the Lore Was That It Was China As the Enemy Nation and NOT SOVIET UNION (RUSSIA), Im Sorry But Any Developer Who Makes A Post Apocalyptic Nuclear War Game That Grew Up In the 1980's SHOULD KNOW TO MAKE SOVIET UNION (RUSSIA) AS THE ENEMY NATION NOT CHINA!!!!!!!! Those Were the Two Main Lore Items That I Actually Question As To What Were the Developers Thinking When They Made the Game As To Why That Was Used As the Lore.....I Have Literally Played 1000 Hours In the Game Since It Was Released In 2008, My Main Game Play Through I Played 700 Hours From Start To Finish In A Complete Game Play Through In 2018, I LOVED THAT!!!! The One Thing I Had Wished In the Game Was That There Was More Questing In the Game, While the Story Was Good, I Wish the Story Was More In Depth and Was More Complex Questing Like In Fallout New Vegas, As Far As Im Concerned The Only Thing Bethesda Had To Do In Fallout 4 Was To Improve On the Questing Aspects of the Game and Not Make It Into A ""Settlement Builder Simulator"", I Hope Bethesda Does Get Around Into Making A Remake of the Game Fallout 3 To Better the Visuals With Better Technology, (Unreal Engine 5)???? I Love the Whole Lore Of Being Stuck With the 1950's Technology Developement in the Game Lore, But Sometime I Wish the Lore Would Switch It Up To the 1980's Pop Culture!!!! If I Was To Make A Fallout Game I Would Make It With the Lore As Exactly Of 1980's Pop Culture, With 1950's Technology Stuck In With Soviet Union (Russia) As the Enemy Nation With Only 50 Years Having Passed By After the Nuclear War Aftermath, and Make the Game With Actual Factual Historical Pop Culture References From the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, 1980's Along With the Music Too.....What I Would Do Is Have Different Sections of the Map Devided Between Different Cultures From the '60, 70's, 80's etc. Honestly Because Bethesda Has Fallout and Elder Scrolls IP, That Means Bethesda As A Workforce Are Way Too Small Of A Company To Be Able To Handle Making Fallout and Elder Scrolls CONCURRENTLY!!! Which Is A Major Problem If Fallout Is Only Being Released **** Once Every Ten Years Or So, Fallout and Elder Scrolls NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED CONCURRENTLY AND THEN STAGGER THE RELEASE DATES FOR EACH GAME By 6 Months!!!!!! There Is No Way A Game the Size of Skyrim Should Take More Than 4 Years Tops If You Have The Adequate Workforce, So You Need Seperate Teams To Make Elder Scrolls and Fallout CONCURRENTLY AND TAKE NO MORE THEN 4 YEARS FOR EACH GAME!!!!. Best part of the series and one of the best RPGs ever. Just satisfying to listen to the great songs in the in-game radio and enjoy the apocalypse. Overall rating: 9.3.. This game is easily one of the best fallout games, enjoyed it a lot and it honestly has the best map!. Fallout 3 Fallout 3 Fallout 3 Fallout 3 Fallout 3 Fallout 3 Fallout 3. In my opinion, this game is still superior to Skyrim. It's a fantastic post-apocalyptic RPG with that Bethesda-style freedom and storytelling that everybody loves. Go anywhere, build your character, loot and explore. Become a hero, a mercenary or a heartless murderer. Fallout 3 has its fair share of bugs, glitches and visual limitations, but it's still a must-play for fans of massive open worlds that will take you hundreds of hours to fully experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Best game of all time! Best narrative storytelling! Best Music and Sound! Phenomenon gameplay VATS System! Enormous game, incredible in every way!!!. Amazing game growing up for me. It was the first time i could find guns enjoyable in a RPG. The shooting wasnt great but you worked with it.. The third best Fallout of all, after Las Vegas and Fallout 4. With rich dialogues and captivating story, where decisions have to be careful because it has consequences at the end of the game. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 7 Music: 7 Story: 7 Total: 7.50. Played on Series X with backwards compatibility. I finished this game way too quick. There is much more to do. I had fun playing this game :). One of the best games to the series and an All-time Classic. Also, the last Decent Fallout Game!. Another Bethesda game with no soul. Cleared all story and DLCs, love only radio in this game and aesthetics. Hopefully this gets remastered someday so I can dive back into the gritty dark world of post-apocalyptic DC.. not the goat fallout game but its up there. revolutionized open world rpgs and still holds up to this day. the real great stories i think are in the side quest. the main quest isnt as good as nv. but still one of my all time fav games.. This game has a cool atmosphere and theme but that's all I really like about it. It's main story is very weak and way too short, although the dlc's do make up for this. The characters are somewhat good but mostly forgettable, and like all Bethesda games its very bug persistent. The dlc's do somewhat make this game better, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted too unfortunately.. There are features that come to mind when it comes to Fallout. Nothing less, no more. The dark theme is a bit annoying, but of course it would be absurd to be chirping after nuclear. However, they could not achieve that balance. I think it's better to play NV and 4 instead. But maybe you can really like the story. Then this game would be very good.. OVERALL - 94% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 8/10 Probably the most realistic depiction of nuclear fallout of any game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fallout 3 was the long awaited return of the post apocalyptic role playing series that had been locked away in a vault for over 10 years. Under new developer and publisher, Bethesda, the series was changed to a first person roleplaying game with heavy emphasis on real time combat. It was critically acclaimed at the time but has since dwindled in reputation and I can honestly see why. I first played Fallout 3 in 2008 and had honestly never played a game like it. I played it very consistently on Xbox 360, not doing much outside of exploring. This is why I never beat the main quest until now. Upon playing it, I definitely wasn't blown away. I played through this game the day after I beat Fallout: New Vegas and that might be the worst thing you can do if you want to appreciate this game. It's by no means a bad game but with a mediocre story, less interesting environment and worse combat than New Vegas, I have little reason to go back to this one. Fallout 4 may have even less roleplaying elements than Fallout 3 but at least it offers me things that New Vegas can't such as building settlements and the vast character customization. Sadly, despite it's obvious quality, I can't see myself revisiting Fallout 3 very often. I beat this game in November of 2019.. Fallout 3 is a masterpiece. Fallout 3 is a open world role playing game set in a post apocalyptic Washington DC with a retro futuristic style. The main quest is great and the side quests are also great.. Fallout 3 does an excellent job of telling it's story, add a good amount of content to keep the player going, and adds so much re playability. It's truly my favorite in the series.. This game is incredibly buggy. But I think anyone who knows anything about Bethesda knows that their games are complete bug-fests. Now with the obvious out of the way, I honestly have only done a full play-through once, I have tried to play through the game over, and over, but I can’t bring myself to do it. The beginning is really boring. Most side-quests weren’t interesting to me. And near the end I just wanted to finish the game. And especially now that time has passed, this game has not aged well, even though Fallout: New Vegas which uses the exact same engine and with almost the exact same mechanics still somewhat feels fresh. I would give this game a 5 if the game wasn’t so buggy. But since it is 4/10.. Took me forever to play this back in the day on my Xbox 360 but damm. 264 hours i invested in this gem of a game.. This game is fabulous. If you haven't played it, you should. The gameplay is top notch. However there are some minor problems that keep it from being perfect. They are strictly related to the nature of a console based game. If you want the very best experience and mod options play it on PC.. Excellent open world, fun story and an overall great RPG. The music is also amazing and weirdly works perfectly for destroying mutants and raiders.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While I did enjoy parts of this game, one thing that quickly became very obvious was that this was a dumbed down and shallow action-oriented world compared to the bizarre worlds of Fallout 1 & 2 which were ripe with black humor, cultural references and moral ambiguousness. Bethesda essentually made a sci-fi action rpg and placed it within the Fallout universe, while ignoring many key concepts of what was defining elements of Fallout in terms of storytelling, dialogue and style. As part of this, different factions, groups and characters were reimagined in a way that I do not consider to be coherent with what was presented in the original games. All in all, it is obvious the target group for this game wasn't fans of the original Fallout games, but rather fans of Bethesda games. If playing Fallout 1 & 2 was like reading a captivating russian sci-fi novel, playing Fallout 3 was more like watching a hollywood action movie.. Fallout 3 started of very well with high potential. I instantly became addicted to playing and enjoyed it right up until near the endgame which was when I realized how incredibly short the main story is, then there's the side missions which really aren't that interesting to play as well as that they aren't worth the rewards. This really took the fun out of it for me. I got tired going through the same formula. So after I finished the game I uninstalled it. To me Fallout 3 is good but forgettable at best. I really don't think it's worth all the praise.. Top 5 games of all time hands down. The characters, quests and enemies are absolutely endless. There’s so much content, but it never feels like filler, just hundred of hours exploring and discovering every inch of what this game has to offer. Best.Game.Ever. My favorite game of all time. Gameplay, characters, and the world is so interesting. I lose track of time playing any fallout game, but more so in this one. This game is phenomenal. If you see it, pick it up immediately. No sec","the world building is simply perfect, the moment we leave the vault and look at the desolation around us will remain stuck in my mind forever . the entire ambience created throughout the settings, characters and infamous radio stations of this post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland is reason enough for every gamer to play this from start to finish at least once ."
113.Gears of War 2,"A great sequel just as good as the original Gears of War game in almost every way. Gears of War 2 is an utterly stunning game. It improves the originals gameplay and improves the story from the original.. I like this game on insane its frickin good and very hard anyways buy it u wont regret it. oh my god. This is, for me, the best game in history. I have so much memories with it, playing it at my grandmas house, now playing it at my house, the story is PERFECT, just what i love. The gameplay is great too. Didnt really multiplayerbut it wasnt an issue.. This game is my favorite game. It's so good that I can't help but finish playing it..

To me this is the best gears game but ironically is my first gears game before i play gears one.. Not a step up or down from the 1st game , a great continuation . Added more weapons , vehicles , executions and enemies . The story develops well and so do the characters . The violence and graphic scenes are all still there and even more glorified but not overly done to the extreme , just enough for Gears . The thing that makes this stand out is the start to finish War story that takes you up and down more than once with a large enemy force always on the horizon and feeling like you are playing a vital role in the war. Great development of the series. Still the same variety in the gameplay, decent story with dramatic moments, great unique design work. This part lacks in sounds and music aspects compared to the original, but it is ok.. Maintains the series' strong gameplay but doesn't distinguish itself significantly.. Great game to play on split screen. And just a good game even after all these years. That was at first part, but in second part all simply better.. This is by far the best game in the series. Multiplayer was amazing back in 2008 and the campaign was mind blowing at the time. Replayed this game recently and was shocked how well the graphics held up after all these years. Would highly recommend giving this game especially if you're looking for a fun couch co-op game (hard to come by these days).. My favourite instalment in the series and one of my favourite games of all time, it’s definitely the best couch Co-Op of all time, loved playing this with my brother on the 360 and again on the Xbox One.. 7.1/10 Story: 7.5 Gameplay: 6.5 Game mechanics: 7.5 By the second game, the story was starting to come together, and finally, the scenery changed. Gameplay would've been better if there wasn't any input lag; funny how Xbox claims FPS boot is enabled for the game, but there is input lag. For some of the missions, the mechanics were interesting, especially during one where there is a hail storm, and the player has to maneuver around it. The submarine mission was great too.. Gears of war 2 for it's time amazing very enjoyable to play. I love the Story and the gameplay. Highly recommend! You can get this game on the cheap now, it's a absolute steal for the price. I decided to go back and enjoy it again on my Series X which led me to finally giving it a review.. Incredible sequel to a great game, a lot of the scuff at the edges of the first game are smoothed out and refined here. The characters are more vibrant and there's more variety in gameplay. the plot is more off the rails though, in good and bad ways.. The best gears of war, chad characters, great difficulty, great gears of war guns, good history line, great scenarios, just amazing. A must-play. A game where you shoot monsters with your cool big ass gun, thats not everything that this game has to offer, i am only saying that because when i hear that i immediately get turned off, but this one actually does it well and is really good not gonna lie.. Hands down my favorite story game ever. This was the first video game i’ve ever played and the whole story is amazing.. more harder to complete i had problems with the final boss but was a good ride all the way through. The best experience you’ll get by gears of war. Yes I’ve counted also gears of war 4 and 5. Gears of war 2 manage to maintain the destroyed beauty style present in the first chapter of the saga with a incredibly increased level of lore exploration thanks to the document around the map. An experience that every gamer has to do. A Great all around game, the most fun i have had in game in a while. The action, story and gameplay were all great and stepped up from Gears of war 1. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After the first part this game feels so much better, as it has some pretty interesting story. The game aged pretty good and looks amazing on series x. It's a lot of fun to play with friends. The AI is **** though. Gears of War is famous for a reason. It engages in, both, great single and multi player.. Make a revolution like Gears of War and you probably won't be able to make another one for a while. However you can refine and improve what you've already done: Gears of War 2 in a nutshell. A product that has left its mark on video game history. Although Gears 1 created the universe of the series, it didn't do much to produce a substantial lore and background info. It was Gears 2 to delve into the background of the in-game universe, which I think it did well. There is a deeper and more credible writing of both plot facts and background and characters. It's not only because of better characterization and writing of characters and dialogues. Stuff like Private Carmine's first day on the battlefield, Dom's desperate search for his wife Maria, the ""way"" locusts sink human cities and ""how"" Marcus and his squad will fix that, give dynamism and turning points to the plot, making it a daring round trip ride with a epic breath, which Gears 1 was not. I guess wanting to avoid a plot overload and making a later chapter explain stuff, some questions are purposely left unanswered, which I found a bit irritating but it makes sense, as long as the answers will be there and will be credible. Gameplay was improved and expanded. Characters movement is still clunky, yet smoother than in Gears **** cover system has also been refined and smoothed. What used to be design naivety in Gears 1, the Crimson Omen as player health status and the grenade launch system, have been transformed in Gears series hallmarks. More weapons, more enemies, and generally quantity goes hand in hand with quality. The meat shield mechanic is an interesting addition varying gameplay although less often than usual as killing downed enemies is priority. Like Gears 1, the game is violent, with a high gore rate and a wider range of executions on downed enemies adds up to fun. Enemy AI is still good, however it looks less aggressive than before: I've rarely seen locust drones launching fierce assaults, flanking and force to dislodge from cover. Only some enemies do that, like the Bloodmounts, but they are designed like that. The gameplay still ensures very engaging shootouts and level design is great and improved for the most part. Sometimes the player can still choose different paths for reaching the level objectives. Squad orders have been removed as in fact they were of little use. Squad mates now crawl towards the player character to be revived after being downed and can revive each other on their own - a huge improvement. Checkpoints placement is better than it was in Gears 1, for the most part and a ""Normal"" intermediate skill level has finally been added. In general, the game is more enjoyable. Too bad the final boss isn't much of a challenge, but it's still better than dealing with RAAM in Gears 1. And now the bad. Despite difficulty re-balancing and better checkpoints placement, many checkpoints are still misplaced out of badly design, making the player repeat boring parts after reload. Some parts remain too difficult because of poor design. Difficulty discrepancies are more negative than positive: the player cannot be downed and revived in ""Hardcore"" or ""Insane"" skill levels, and on the latter squad mates must be revived in time if downed or they will die and cause a game over. A more harmonized and less punitive system would have been better. Allied AI does not behave properly: sometimes it goes forward alone and gets downed, or it stays behind and does not help. Sometimes it just gets stuck for no reason. The game is actually more buggy than I expected, not to the point of game breaking, but I expected more polishing from a 2008 flagship exclusive AAA title. Sometimes I wonder if Bleszinski played the whole game before release and I don't know what's worse: he did not or he did but he was ok with this stuff. Graphically, the game is much better compared to Gears 1. A deeper understanding of Unreal Engine 3 allowed improvements to almost everything: characters, weapons and scenery objects models, besides environments visuals and facial animations. At the time, simply outstanding. It was certainly one of the best graphics back in 2008, probably the best on an Xbox 360 video game and still holds up as a very good looking game to this days. Frame rate performance is pretty solid. The sound component is great too and keeps up with the visuals. Gears of War 2 is a great sequel. An good comparison in matter of great sequels could be made with Uncharted 2. It may not have made the history of video games like Gears 1, but, while without flaws, it largely improved it and it remains a milestone of the genre and one of the most important video games of that time, symbol of such a golden age.. You can’t beat GoW2. This game did such a good job following up the first and it’s story hits so hard and has such good emotional beats. Yeah, this game is the ultimate couch co-op bros night game. Yeah, it’s like a B action movie set in a post apocalyptic sci-fi world. And it embraces those things so perfectly and knows what it is. But on top of that the story has heart and great characters, and man this game has an emotionally devastating moment. I can’t praise this game enough! If you have game pass, play through the gears series ASAP!. Sensational game, very fun, with a fantastic game play and enemies controlled by a very good Artificial Intelligence. With good balance between enemies, there are no characters that are bullets.. An amazing beast of the 3rd person shooter from amazing Epic Games of Xbox exclusive franchises. An improvement over the first game in every way possible, Gears of War 2 is definitely the best game in the series. It's a ruthless game, full of violence, gore and action. The story is pretty interesting for the most part, nothing special but it does depict the atrocities of war very well. The gameplay is enjoyable, it's a brutal fast paced cover shooter with a good amount of creative weapons to use. The dark atmosphere sets the tone of the game perfectly, and it can be quite scary at times. There are many different areas that you visit throughout the campaign, and each area looks unique. Last but not least, the boss fights are jaw-dropping! This really is an Epic game after all. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. An excellent game, although old, it plays well, a good main character and an excellent storyline. classic...i had so much fun in this game a great TPS... this franchise is one of my favorites. Another perfect GEARS GAME! The story the combat the characters are amazing like always this the most action experience what I ever had long long time.. Gears of War 2 is a great sequel to a great franchise that really **** you in.. Gears gets improved in every way possible. Better controls, better graphics and textures, better soundtrack, better gameplay. Definitely one of the best games of Xbox 360 and definitely worth it to play in 2021. Must play.. EN: Great fun. The campaign is fantastic, much better than the first part. ""Horde"" mode is great. Very good game. SRB: Izuzetna zabava. Kampanja je fantastična, dosta bolje od prvog dela. ""Horde"" mod je odličan. Jako dobra igra.. 1/11/21-1/17/21 100% Complete 4/5 Stars Pretty great! Marcus Fenix and crew are still fighting the Locusts, this time a bit more underground. The combat was a bit of a slog for me, it takes me a while to get used to the Gears-style shooting. But there were some pretty epic and memorable moments and at least one bit where I laughed out loud. Really awesome scenery, too! I like how they keep coming up with neat ideas for Locust vehicles/creatures and enemies to fight. The voice acting and music were very well done. Lots of gruff grumbling, but there is really nothing else that would fit this type of game. Looking forward to the next entry.. It is a great game, its campaign is one of the best, if it is not one of the best in the gears saga, its horde mode is something meh, but I lay the foundations for the horde mode of gears 3, which in my opinion is e best horde mode. This game is amazing! It keeps the near perfect playing style from the first game while also coming up with new creative ideas. It also greatly improves on the weakest part of the first game: the story! Can't wait to try out gears 3 for the first time soon!. The story between Dom and his wife Maria is really touching. And the hidden story between humans and locusts is profund.. A very good game! Maybe one of the best Gears. Despite the great similarity with the predecessor, the game adds some news in the gameplay: new weapons, new moves, old weapons but with different mechanics. As far as for the plot the game has improved a lot, even with regard to the depth of the backstory. So I recommend this game to those looking for a TPS done well. This game is one of the best titles on Xbox, and in the whole in history of video game world.. ---{Graphics}--- ☐ You forget what reality is ☐ Beautiful X Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{Gameplay}--- ☐ Very good ☐ Good X It‘s just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{Audio}--- ☐ Eargasm ☐ Very good X Good ☐ Not too bad ☐ Bad ☐ I'm now deaf ---{Audience}--- ☐ Kids ☐ Teens X Adults ☐ All ---{Difficulity}--- ☐ Just press 'W' ☐ Easy X Significant brain usage ☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master ☐ Difficult ☐ Dark Souls ---{Story}--- ☐ No Story ☐ Some lore X Average ☐ Good ☐ Lovely ☐ It‘ll replace your life ---{Game Time}--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short X Average ☐ Long ☐ To infinity and beyond ---{Price}--- ☐ It’s free! ☐ Worth the price X If u have some spare money left ☐ Not recommended ☐ You could also just burn your money ---{Bugs}--- X Never heard of ☐ Minor bugs ☐ Can get annoying ☐ ARK: Survival Evolved ☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs. GREAT GAME WITH A BADASS SLAP CERTIFIED Story: 8 Gameplay: 8 ost: 9 Characters: 10. Gears Of War 2 is just an awesome video game, and the best shooter around. The storyline is pretty mean, and the suicide by Tai really added to the effect of how badly they were torturing people. Is amazing. Great buy. Masterpiece. Excellent game, honestly. Graphics 10/10 Story 9/10 Characters 10/10 Gameplay 9/10. Gears of War 2 is a must own for any Xbox 360 owner. It's full of emotion, cinematic moments that will indeed shock you, and still has multiplayer that's just as fun as the original.. This sequel to the first game of the franchise is a successful upgrade despite it looks like the previous one in many aspects. There were things that had a lot of potential but weren't exploited at all, so despite Gears of war was a good game there was something missing. However, this second part improve those weak points and brings to us a more enjoyable experience. This time, the story and character's background are given more importance, what makes us feel more into the game. In addition, there are moments where we won't be able to disconnect from the game due to excitement of some moments of the plot. Game level design is much more worked out as there is a much bigger variety of environments. Each level feels like something different where we'll have to face different challenges, there are also many events that will change completely the gameplay and will make the game to look fresher. Despite i consider Gears of War 2 a substantial improvement, there are some mistakes that haven't been learnt. For instance, the lack of variety of weapons still and there are not good bosses neither. So there are still things to improve to look after in further games of the saga.. In the middle of revisiting the single player campaigns of this series, my memories had me convinced that the first Gears was better than the second. I'm not so sure that's the case. While I'm not a fan of vehicular segments being shoehorned into sequels to ""give variety"", the developers did a great job of making many unique environments that give this sequel a refreshing feel. The story continues to be a hokey B-movie horror/action hybrid, but it works with the absurdity of the world that's been created. It's gotten me excited to push forward with the rest of the series as I work towards Gears 5.. You want a good sequel that reminds you on how amazing the first one was or even better, than this is the game for you. Gears of War 2 goes all out with this one by taking the fight to their house after the events from the previous game failed. Revelations are revealed and hearts will be broken, the magnitude of this game was so much bigger than the previous one that it might be my favorite one out of the whole series. Although I gave the first Gears a 10/10, to me I think that this story is a lot better than the first. Couple of moments made it feel like it was a horror movie which made it even more intense that I thought it was going to be. Did have some slow moments or moments that I think could have been done differently which sometimes did take me out of the experience but other than that, a near damn perfect sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.. All them goddamn years and still the best gears game, top notch character development and story arc, graphics ahead of its relative time still holds up today on xbox one x at 4k, extreme atmosphere of war, better than most actual war ganes.. Gears of War 2 was bigger and more badass in almost every way. The multiplayer, when it worked, was absolutely fantastic!. Horrors of the COG and Locust war are felt throughout this somber and deeper narrative than the original.. A legendary game and the pilar for the genre with great graphics for the time and excellent gameplay.. Awesome game with an interesting story, very good characters and great shooting mechanics. The dark atmosphere sets the tone of the game perfectly, the boss battles are epic and the action is very good, the best game in the Gears of War series.. The atmosphere is INCREDIBLE! The game has a very good combat system and it is the number one game to play for Xbox 360. I wish they made a remaster of this one as well because it is incredible. Number one game for Xbox 360.. The sequel of Marcus Fenix and delta squad's journey is amazing in everything. A crazy and violent game that brings us to the heart of the enemy, the home of the Locust Horde, and it has some of the most epic scenes and moments of the franchise, a **** must have.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. It's just Gears of War again but with better graphics, sound, and enough new features to make it a must-play Xbox game.. Simply amazing, wonderful, epic, exciting and fantastic story. Very good gameplay, frantic action!. Maybe I’m a little biased because of the nostalgia factor, but damn I played this game a lot, and it was sooo worth it. This game is god !!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!¡!!!!;!!;;;;;;. summed up in 2 words this game is beautiful !! everything is impeccable the best game in the saga and the xbox !!. Gears of War 2 - one of the best exclusives of Xbox 360 and Microsoft in general. Having played a game in 2019 I can hardly believe that it left 11 years ago. Not many games can give such balanced action travel today. The 2nd part is also the indicative sequel, Gears of War 2 as the sequel likely only of Uncharted 2 is better. Yes a game looks good on Xbox One X, but after all there is a wish for a full-fledged remaster as with the first part. The plot **** became deeper. A gameplay in general of 10 of 10, an action from 3 persons I did not see so big variety in genre games long ago. On an equal basis with Halo the Gears of War series is the main exclusive of Microsoft for many years.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gears of War 2 takes what Gears of War did amazingly and manages to do it even better. Without taking into account the obvious graphical superiority in comparison to its predecessor, everything, from the level design and the gameplay mechanics, to the story and character development, excels the quality achieved in the first installment of the Gears of War franchise. The level design in Gears of War 2 feels like it was made with a refreshed, more interactive and immersive formula. The campaign provides a wide variety of mission types, the majority of them with unique mechanics that will allow the player to experiment a far more enjoyable story mode with better engagement between the player and the environment around it. The characters, while still having the same super strong, alpha male attitude seen in the first game, show more emotion, making it easier to sympathize with them. The story is also more compelling, dramatic, and deeper, as it takes the narrative design presented in Gears of War even further. Some of the cutscenes in the game offer a better knowledge and backstory of the main characters, the enemies and their leader, and the war itself. Gears of War 2 should be an example to game developers of how a great sequel should be done. The higher-quality graphics, its better-polished gameplay mechanics, better level design, better writing and overall better direction are more than enough to consider this one of the best games available in the Xbox 360 catalogue.. Great sequel, many improvements in the game excellent multiplayer, introduction of many options like horde awesome. I have just recently completed Gears of War, the first one and my goal is to play all of the Gears of War franchise. This is just the 2nd one and I will keep continuing to play them all. Gears of War 2 feels like a much better game than the original. It also feels much easier, it seems like they knocked down the difficulty settings quite a bit. Personally I kind of liked it though because it allowed me to play the game as a little bit more of a run and gun rather than the cover shooter that its suppose to be. I enjoy a fun shooter campaign and the Gears franchise seems to be a well-made shooter campaign. I am having a fantastic time with the franchise. As I’m playing these games, I can’t help but appreciate what Gears have done for the Genre. Who knows without Gears, there may not have been Uncharted or if there was. It may not have been as good. The game itself has aged very well. The shooting works great, honestly, for an Xbox 360 game, I was impressed with how it looked. Sure its a dark and grimy game but it still looks good. I thought the first Gears game aged well and I think this game is even better. The Gears can be picked up for cheap and I highly recommend it.. ""Gears of War 2"" is one of the best video game sequels ever made. An improvement over the original, it's a great title that ranks up with ""Modern Warfare 2"", ""Uncharted 2"" and ""Halo 2"". Story and character development are secondary to the exhilarating action. It's one of those cases where bigger really is better. Both the campaign and multiplayer were expanded upon and improved. This is arguably the best installment in the series. It's a true action classic that I would rate it with a 9.5 out of 10.. Gears of War 2 has a lot in common with its predecessor, but the new environments, darker storyline, and epic scale certainly have a lot to offer fans. The new weapons, melee attacks, and co-op options make for a campaign that you'll want to complete a number of times, and the new multiplayer modes give the game variety and longevity. Simply put, Gears of War 2 is a superior shooter that no action fan will want to miss out on.. Just like the first game, this game has a fun game-play that kept me invested for a while. But it had an uninteresting story and it eventually got dull.. development team did a fantastic job adopting the Gears of War series fantactic.. Gears 2 accomplishes what a true sequel should. More guns, more characters, best story in the series, better graphics and better gameplay, though Gears 3 steals the crown in that department. One of the best 360 games on the market, and one of the best games of 2008.. Perhaps GoW has suffered from the passage of time. Performance in this game is TERRIBLE. It seems that video has priority over game controller... sometimes I press the weapon trigger and it doesn't respond at ALL until the enemy has moved into my kill zone. Enemies who move closer than ten or twenty feet? Forget it. You're toast. Time delays for interactive response come in several seconds' duration when they should be less than 0.1 seconds. The story is great, the video is good, but the performance is unsatisfactory.. The start of the game felt awesome. I thought I would give it 10/10. But I am stuck at 3/4 game and it got too frustrating that I cannot complete it. There was a stupidly designed boss fight that took me 3 days to kill. Just after him game followed with another bad section. Game does not tell you how to survive and solve some situations. Several times it was necessary for me to watch video guides in order to proceed in game. Now I don't want to start the game all over on low difficulty only because some fights are badly designed. There is a difference between a good challenging game and a stupid one.. It is one of the best game on xbox 360, the reason why you wanna buy this console. Good graphics despite many years since release, interesting story and i think it should be the last one from gears of war. 3rd part is like reheated pork, get easy money from fans.. Gears of War 2 took everything that made the first game good and improved on it in almost every way, but there is some caveats to be shown that hold it back from greatness. The first improvement is a better campaign with a story that is far better told even though it doesn't answer questions that I think it should explain in order to not have books and comics fill those gaps. The emotional moment of Dominic and his wife Maria is still one of the most powerful moments in the series and I do generally love (and cry) when he shoots her out of mercy. The moment to moment events (like the giant worm to the razorhail rain) are improved to provide variety and challenge that isn't complex, but still interesting that it's more grounded than say Uncharted with the way it uses puzzles. The new enemies on top of old and the addition of new executions make the experience far better than previously and it feels so good to decapitate a Locust grunt still with the Torque Bow. The multiplayer improves initially but then becomes almost disastrous after the last patches went in. It uses the same setup of modes and mechanics like the campaign (just with a choice now to equip one of the two main assault rifles). The game uses P2P but the connection (prior to the major patches) were stable and better than the first game. Unfortunately, just like the first game did, the major sweep of patches over certain guns not only change the multiplayer, but also the entire experience in every other avenue of the game. It becomes very inconsistent and the toxic nature of players reached a new low, turning off potential players for the series. To some, it was still the best multiplayer of the series. For me, it was no different than the first with a bigger sin of allowing bots in the matches and have absurd amounts of accuracy and network glitching that sometimes made them more powerful than decent players, ruining matches if a person lagged out or left for the bot to take their place. Horde mode is a cool concept but very half-baked on execution (which would be fully realized by 3). You go through 50 waves of enemies and use whatever you scavenge to survive each wave as enemies increase in numbers and modifiers. Scale that with difficulty and the need for team members to contribute becomes a main prerogative. Unfortunately, it makes enemies far too strong in later waves and can cause frustration when players wipe and come back in without the weapons they scavenge to survive. Despite the issues, Gears 2 still proved to be a better game to come out of Gears and it's what truly set it on the map for greatness. If the sequel could improve on it even more, than there's no doubt it will be solidified as a great game. And that is what happens for Gears of War 3.. The sequel to one of the most popular new IP of the console was obviously very expected, did they improve the formula or just re hash the same game ? Technically Epic continued to push forward the boundaries of the 360 hardware with astonishing visuals for the time, it runs flawlessly and impress you as soon as they got a chance. The art direction is more varied than the first game and some of the boss are very inspired. Concerning the gameplay the TPS formula is better executed and the game will offer a great variety of situations so that you'll never fall in some routine. The cinematic realisation is also a great ""Waho"" factor that will rhythm your playthrough in the most positive way. The only bad thing is that even in the hardest difficulty the game is not challenging. The story is way more detailed than in the first game which is very good, I finally care about Marcus and the gang they stopped being just random badasses (for the most part), the global story is also more incentive and now I do care about winning the fight against the locust, and also I want to have the answers to some questions raised by this opus. The game is still predictable but still huge improvement in this section. Shamefully the campaign is still way too short (5-6 hours) and it's not with the very rare online activity that you will find today that you may prolonged the experience. In conclusion Gears of War 2 is better in every department than the first game, the predictable story and very short length are the only things in the way of perfection, still for the handful of $/€ it cost today it would be an error to not play it if you like the action genre.. One of the best games on 360. Probably one of th",Gears of War 2 is an utterly stunning game . it improves the original gameplay and improves the story from the original . it's so good that i can't help but finish playing it .
114.SoulCalibur II,"Graphically this is an absolute masterpiece, I mean it still looks unbelievable in 2024. The gameplay is lacking however. I find these fighting games dull and repetitive. Yes there is a story mode, but it still just the same old fights. There are so many moves but you end up just repeating the ones that work, again and again. Not for me.. Hella fun. I could never get the practice in to fully enjoy it though. The 'Weapon Master' mode is very difficult however. This is one of the absolute champions of Gamecube fighting games, right up there with Melee. Boot this game up with friends and have a great time.. A model SoulCalibur game in terms of mechanics and unlockables, the ai still has that classic Arcade ai difficulty at times but it definitely doesn't hamper the experience that bad.. Grate game when i was a child i played a lot with my family and the Graphics still holds up til this present day. Soul Calibur 2 is the quintessential GameCube fighting game. Excellent graphics for the time. A tightly balanced roster. Great fighting modes. A solid amount of single player content, with a lot of unlockable content. Weapons that offer different perks or weaknesses help keep the game fresh. Every version is top notch, but I only really grew up playing the GameCube version.. just the best of them all,played as link the whole time rofl the best character. A newbie to a hardened fighter can pick up a controller and get in on the fun right away. The character's ease of control varies based on their size and technique. The best type character for a new player is one with attacks for both far and close ranges. Soul Calibur 2 has so many hidden extras that it will be a good bet that all the features will not be unlocked within a week. There is a role-playing mode, various challenges and the ability to purchase over 200 different weapons for the characters. Players are sure to be kept busy for quite a while.. By itself, it is a amazing game, but once you compare it to Soul Calibur 3. There is no competition. Also, despite the gamecube having better graphics and links, the gamecube controller doesn't feel right.. In my opinion the best soulcalibur and one of the best figthing games, character selection is amazing with link which i adore and lots of classic soulcalibur characters, this game is amazing playing in the gamecube with a friend and spending the night on it. Had so much fun on this I hope other people will enojoy this game as much i did!. Looked better than the PlayStation version in every way shape and form this great. This game is great and it's also part of my childhood. I first got the game back when I was 10 years old and I got it because link was in it which I found out from a Nintendo power magazine. Me and my twin had to BEG our mom to get the game because it was rated t and we thought it would be as bad as super smash bros melee in which that game should've been rated e 10+ but back to this game. When we got the game, we were beginner fighting game fans and we usually button mashed but then we got better at the game and we also liked more characters. I like characters like raphiel, nightmare, and kelik. Lastly, looking back, we didn't know how innovative the game was but looking at it now, I can really see how it's a masterpiece. It's got 3d movement, it's very cool to fight with swords, the guest characters are cool, and it's also fun to ring out the characters.. I spent many hours on this as a Kid. It includes Link which was very exciting at the time. A fun, accessible but also in depth 3D Fighting Game with a lengthy single player storymode.. The art direction, the music, the character designs and most importantly the fighting 10/10 for sure it's not just a good fighting game but a fantastic game overall whether it's alone, with friends or playing competitively this game is a blast even in 2020 no GameCube or PS2 collections are complete without it I highly recommend it download Soulcalibur II HD online if you don't have a GameCube or PS2.. Best 3D fighting game of the sixth generation of gaming hands down if only we could get a Switch port.. An amazing fighting game that looks amazing even nowadays. Highly recommended.. Easily one of the best fighting games available. Great game for anybody who enjoys a brief but engaging story along with one of the most memorable and fluid multiplayer experiences even to this day.. This is a sequel that does the franchise justice! This game plays just like the original but is still fun as hell! the weapon master mode adds a fun and long-lasting single-player mode. If you haven't tried the original game on the dreamcast, you should definitely give this one a try. And if you ask me, the gamecube version is the best version, because it has Link! :D. Graphics: 9.5 Sound: 9.0 Gameplay: 9.0 Fun/Story: 8.5 A very good game, with nice graphics and nice gameplay. The presence of Link helps to shine even more. Recommended.. I have played a lot of fighting games, the best one is Super Smash Bros. Melee. This one is a very close second but I still feel that this game is really great. Graphics are good for the time, characters are great, and the music makes chills go down my spine. This game makes me feel like I'm going straight into battle and might actually might die. Soulcalibur as a series is somewhat of a forgotten Gem, the fist game of the series is a good game but I rarely hear about people who played it. For some reason all the other games in the series have some sort of cameo in there games. Link was in the gamecube and Spawn was in the Xbox release. I liked that there were different characters in both copies of the game, small differences that make a the experiences different for the players of the game. Regardless of the lack of story line and lack of interaction in regards of other types of fighting, I really do like this game but I only like this game out of the series. The third game is cool I guess but the fourth is not good and only really has some customization in it and some online play. The series needs to take a page out of MK's book and stay to there roots. Yes I know that MK has made some games but they were only because of the story they were trying to tell. In the end Soulcalibur II is awesome and if you like Link trust me this is the best cameo ever. Never played the Xbox version but I probably would feel the same, I highly recommend on people playing this gem.. As far as 3D fighting games go, this is as good as it gets. Soul Calibur 2 is an amazing fighting game, full of challenges to conquer, characters and weapons to unlock, and stages to try out. The mechanics are solid, the music is great, and the characters are well designed. The best part of this game is the inclusion of Link as a playable character. If you're a fan of fighting games, don't miss this one. It's one of the best.. Amazing graphics for the gamecube, balanced fast and fun gameplay, great charisma of the characters, master of weapons mode, duration, great extra stuff like photos, artworks or videos, the addition of Link. This game doesn't need more.. This is the second best fighting game on the Gamecube, only behind Melee. Gameplay and graphics are combined to form one of the most exalted entries in the series and rightfully so. Having tons of content surprisingly packed into the adventure and a varied cast of characters (including an awesome Link), this is a must-have for the Gamecube that will provide endless amounts of fun.. This is, in my opinion, the best fighting game of all time. The ammount of modes are wonderful, the gameplay is excellent, and the game looks great. There are loads of content to unlock and I love playing it still. This is one of my all time favorite games.. It's been nearly a decade and this Soul Calibur is still the best by leaps and bounds. My friends and I still play it since the rest of the franchise is made of dress up games.. One of the best games of all time. The gameplay, sound, and graphics are great. The characters are awesome. Link is a worthy addition to this game. There are a variety of modes.. One of the best DC games ever get one of the best fighting game sequels to date. Pros: Excellent graphics, sound, and control; likable characters; lots of easy-to-learn combos; lots of single-player and multiplayer modes; Link is the best of the trio's exclusive characters. Cons: No online play.. Easily one of the best fighting games ever. Pros: Beautiful graphics; variety of characters and weapons; variety of modes; Weapon Master; Link. Cons: Lack of unlockable characters and content.. SoulCaliber 2 is new and ultimately one of the best games for the gamecube. The characters are attractive and this game boasts great graphics, with extremely fast moves. The story mode will keep you well entertained, whilst there are many different modes on the VS mode to keep you playing with friends and family for hours on end. There are no flaws with this game, the reason for failing full marks is, when you play the game, as you will see, it just seems to be missing something that you can't quite put your finger on.","ai still has that classic Arcade ai difficulty at times but it definitely doesn't hamper the experience that bad . ai has a tightly balanced roster. Great fighting modes. A solid amount of single player content, with a lot of unlockable content . ai has role-playing mode, various challenges and the ability to purchase over 200 different weapons ."
115.Pro Evolution Soccer 2,"Winning eleven 6 is the best football videogame EVER. Best balance between simulation and arcade.. Mqde mu turn my back on fifa. I tried a couple fifa's in the years after, but I stayed with PES.. The negatives first: no real names and teams and crazy bad commentary. The positive then: everything else! This is no doubt the best football game for the PlayStation 2, much better than Fifa because the gameplay is so much more clever and realistic. It's easy to pick up and play, but it gets even better when you learn the special moves. This game is deep, much deeper than the shallow gameplay that Fifa football games have to offer. Even the graphics are fine for a game this old! I still play this game today in 2017 because they just didn't make a better football game since this one.","this is no doubt the best football game for the PlayStation 2 . it's easy to pick up and play, but it gets even better when you learn the special moves . it's deep, much deeper than the shallow gameplay that Fifa football games have ."
116.Mass Effect 3,"Sure, ME3 definitely has shortcomings. The sidelining of certain crew members can be distasteful to some, and the ending itself was quite shallow for such a deeply complex narrative with a whole host of potential variables individual to each playthrough. Yet, I personally cannot bring myself to let that massively detract from an otherwise fantastic game. The story up until the climax is enthralling. The character dynamics, cinematography and writing are arguably the best in the series. The gameplay combines elements from the first 2 games to create a satisfyingly air tight cover shooter that allows for multiple play styles. And I’ll also give a honourable mention to the sound design; The Reapers just sound exceptional! In 2024, I’d be dishonest to myself if I gave this game anything lower than an 8 as a complete package with all the DLC. On the other hand, it’s an entirely different story if you’re playing without the DLC; It’s a much different, much inferior game at that point. Theres so much here that makes it far from mediocre. It’s simply another fantastic Mass Effect game that I think 100% deserves to stand on the pedestal with 1 and 2.. Mass Effect 3 is a disappointing ending to the Mass Effect trilogy. While it is competent, it lacks the highs Mass Effect 1 or 2 hit. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. SCORE: STRONG 9 = 9,7 MUST PLAY GAME, good lore/music/story. The Mass Effect Trilogy are one of the best games ever made. Underrated gem. Started out as a rough game but it only got better as the devs added more content to it and patched the rough edges out.. The cover-based shooting and ability combat is better than ever. The story is bleak, but hope shines through in spots to set up some incredible set-pieces. Many of the decision-threads set up all the way in the first game wrap up in bombastic fashion. I didn't hate the ending.. ME3 is very similar to ME1 and ME2 but very different. the gameplay loop is much less confusing. shooting feels the best in trilogy. weapon variety feels limited since many good guns are expensive and locked till late-game. the story feels standard and not as daring as ME2 but the expansion on the geth-turian and krogan-salarian conflict were very good. the ending was slightly confusing but I understand it and I like that there's many implications between the possibilities and that there is no standard ""best ending"". I love the Mass Effect series. It's by far my favorite gaming series. Even though the RPG elements were neutered after the first game, I still love the following entries. What really, really got to me was the ending of Mass Effect 3. Specifically, it's 20 minutes or so. It's not that it boiled down to choose your own ending 1, 2, 3, 4, (red, blue, green, shoot the space kid), it's that it was absolutely awful in my opinion. The free extended ending DLC missed the point entirely. I didn't need an explanation orthem to expand on the meaning of each ending. To me, it was obvious without the extended ending DLC. I needed a great ending to an amazing series of games. I don't feel like there needed to be 100 different endings depending on the choices you made along the way. 1 amazing ending could have been enough for me. 3 or 4 different amazing endings, even better. Easy for me to say, I know. But 4 trashy throw-away endings in a game so rich with story & lore. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but at the time, it was heartbreaking. And in the moment, it nearly ruined the series for me. A long time ago, I just compartmentalized the whole thing. There is Mass Effect 1, 2 & 3 over here in this box, & the last 20 minutes over here in this box. However, to me, it's still a stain on an otherwise amazing series. A skid mark on the tidy-whities of gaming. In my opinion.. Immersive Story I loved everything about it - Bioware at its prime ! Can only recommend !. This game started me off waiting 15 min ( AT LEAST AS I UNINSTALL BEFORE IT ENDED), it could be longer, before I can jump into action. When a game has such a terrible cut scenes it is always an indication that it is a bad game. Made worse when they are unskipable as that show that the devs only wanted to create false playtime and waste people's time. ( to be fair, many games were made that way, and not to be repayable and infinite fun, that is because they are empty) Review from ME1 I played 3 hours then switched to Mass effect 3, to see if anything good can actually be learned from how bad the 1 started. To not waste my time. Perfect, as it did save me time, which I uninstalled before playing ( after choosing "" jump into action"") i had a 15 min cut scene without gameplay. Very unlikely will I ever reinstall this games and recommend to anyone.just the mentality of bad unskipable cut scenes is enough.. ME3 at the moment, with 30h played is my favorite Mass Effect. Ive already played 1 and 2. 2 dissapointed me quite a bit, I dont understand all the praise it has, like me3 is lots of times better on all aspects. Ive rode lots of comments saying that the ending is crap and it may be. But as I said im having a blast with me3. And you get to see both ur babes Ashley and Miranda. Oh and ofc Liara.. They've destroyed the series, I was so disappointed when I saw the endings. It was all wrong. I would give it a zero but with respect to the previous games in the series, let it be 5. Mass effect 3 is my favorite game of the trilogy Hold on put your pitchforks down Mass effect 3 has the best story and character moments in the entire trilogy All except its final hour And now after all the extended dlc the ending isn't that bad Kheela selai. Mass Effect 3 starts off in a rather interrupted way, and in a way ends the same way. Not to say ilk of the rest of the game, but when you compare the beginning, middle, and end, the middle is by and large the best part of the game. This makes for a strong disconnect when it comes to talking about ME3, and really where the key problem lies in it. Everything about the middle of the game is fantastic! The continued character and world building, the established character dynamics, the choices you make from previous games effecting outcomes in this game, and really just everything working together till the finale. It really says a lot when the discourse of the end is the biggest thing people remember about the series, and while I keep trying to think of strong moments in the game I keep thinking back to how the ending was. Mechanically everything works better than ME2, but the payoff pales in comparison to it's predecessor. this is actually a near perfect end to the trilogy. Near perfect, didn't stick the landing with that ending and with some of the motifs present in the game (that goddamn trauma child), but what an experience. Despite the ending, a nearly perfect send off for the trilogy, especially with those incredible side missions and DLCs.. Good gameplay, let down by very questionable story. It's not just the ending. Weird character arcs that throw away personality traits from earlier games. Multiplayer was fun and funner than the base game.. Mass Effect 3 is one of the best Sci-Fi RPG’s ever made. As good as both games before it. Great atmosphere, Story and Characters.. Final Thoughts: Mass Effect 3 eclipses its predecessors with epic story beats that converge the biggest conflicts bubbling throughout the series into emotional rollercoasters. Characters shine with crackling chemistry and random conversations provide smooth development and excellent pacing between big moments. Gameplay is further refined, keeping what works and ironing out the kinks for an action-focused adventure, an adventure amplified by gorgeous visuals and a tone-setting soundtrack. It’s sad, however, that from a beginning that sets a galactic apocalypse with such fantastic force and characters that can more than handle the weight on their backs, the ending feels like a completely different team of writers took control…writers that had absolutely no experience with the series. Rendering every choice the player has made moot and betraying even its core story, Mass Effect 3 ends on a bitter, unsatisfying note to what’s largely been one of the best sci-fi RPGs to hit gaming. For the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: ****. Great game, loved it and a great ending to a great trilogy of great games, recommend it.. Doesn't hold up to the other Mass Effect titles due to the game being far too linear and a terrible ending.. Wooo! What a ride, what a ride. Now, this is a game. An absolute fine piece of work. The finest series and science fiction story I have ever experienced, easily. Has its flaws at times, however, but the characters, the music, the simple but satisfying combat, the thought-provoking ending and philosophy of the reapers and cyclical civilisation is incredible. I played this after playing the nightmare that is Elden Ring, and it really opened my eyes as to how superior story-driven experiences are. This series is probably going to be well remembered for many years to come, just like the legend that is Commander Shepard. I doubt any sci-fi production in movies or games will top this series for maybe even a decade or more! Thanks, Bioware for the memories.. Greetings from Lithuania. ""Mass Effect 3"" (2012) is a superb game for everyone who enjoyed the previous two installments. Maybe it is not as addictive as Mass Effect 2, but it is a superb game in every direction, with amazing story, great game play, great RPG elements ant etc. There are some issues with controls in close combat, but those are mind issues in comparison to a whole view - a SCI epic on biggest proportions. I do loved the original ending, never played alternative one. Overall, ""Mass Effect 3"" is a great game and a great conclusion of a saga. There will be a new one, sure, but this installment is the culmination, and it is worth every minute of it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I honestly think this game is actually great, the gameplay mechanics are exceptional, the different types of ammunition and weapons make the gameplay feel fresh and rewarding, without ruining the pacing. Story-wise it does have some flaws but for most of the time it's pretty interesting, and it has some fantastic moments. Most characters are likeable and charming. Even though the game lacks some RPG elements, like every other Mass Effect game the characters are the highlight of the game. And about the infamous ending, it's indeed quite rushed, but it didn't ruin my experience, everything else in this game is very good and that's all that matters. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 9 Story: 9 Total: 9.00. Falls short in some regards but still a great game. As part of a trilogy it does enough for me.. A well done game up until the final hour of the main story. ME3 had me believing I was playing one of the most dynamic RPG's I've ever touched until none of my actions mattered in the end.. I honestly think this game is actually great, from the fantastic shooting mechanics, to the spectacular cutscenes, and the great characters. The ending is indeed quite rushed but it didn't ruin my experience, everything else in this game is definitely good.. The commander's journey ends. Shepard has accompanied me for a long time and again and again. With part 3, the trilogy comes to a worthy end for me! story The reaper threat has arrived, after you could still prevent entry in the Arrival DLC in Mass Effect 2, the galaxy-wide threat has now arrived. And this feeling of doom runs through the entire game, it puts you in a position to make every possible effort to take down the Reaper. This very action-packed and warlike scenario is staged by breathtakingly good missions. It's about the solution of ancient conflicts, the alliance of the individual species ... the creation of a common armed force to prevent the destruction by the Reaper. Bioware has told a very exciting story, which in the end leads to a door 1, 2 or 3 decision, but personally I am compliant with the selectable outcomes. Only the representation, albeit understandable, of the last part of the anti-reaper weapon takes a lot of getting used to (catalyst). Once again, very strong dialogues are created that really take your breath away (Tali and Legion, Liara, Javik DLC, etc.). The bond with the characters is only strengthened and you just have the feeling of fighting for something together. Gameplay The best gameplay in the trilogy. Very strong combo game play, many different skills and occasional skill options. A lot of weapons, mods and upgrades as well as some armor are fun for every tinkerer. It could have been deeper, but that was enough for me. The shooting around of biotic abilities combined with the very well-functioning squad game play is always new fun. There are also a lot of missions, although unfortunately a few of the side missions are limited to pure scanning. Here I would have liked more staging. The constant growth of the war assets makes it clear again in which position the galaxy is and must be in order to exist. graphic Atmospherically, musically, and staged simply breathtakingly. The many cut scenes in the last mission alone still give you massive goosebumps. Conclusion It is very important to play DLC again. The Citadel DLC in particular is one of the best DLC that has ever existed. But Leviathan is also very instructive. One can only thank Bioware for this trip! 10/10 crew members.. Did the ending fall flat? Yes. Doesn't mean it was not a great game. Dexter, GoT are a vew examples of horrible endings but overall still great series. This game is still great. Me personally, I don't play multiplayer so I could care less of those issues.. Undead saves entire galaxy from an attack of space shrimps, just right after being called crazy for believing on space shrimps. The ending pissed me off at first, but after all these years I now feel satisfied after finishing the whole trilogy over & over again. It’s the Mass Effect trilogy, so of course it’s still gonna be a great game. The last 20 minutes doesn’t decide the other however many hours before it.. Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition Go google pictures of Mirandas butt Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter of Sheards story youre off to end the reapers, this race of beings that threaten the existence of the universe as you know it… I didn’t play the original version, but here in Mass Effect 3 you have the option to play RPG style or action style… as someone that played the last 2 games I love the choice aspect of this series so I chose to mainline the story with the rpg elements here.. choosing my dialog.. unfortunately though the game doesn’t make it hard for you to just b line to the end in about 12 hours. Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great. I give Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition a 7.5/10. Honestly up until the last 20 minutes this is obviously the best game in the trilogy. All the relationships you spent hours cultivating make for a lot of emotional moments and honestly if you pick the red ending... it makes the most sense. Yeah it's not great but overall I'm not gonna over penalize this game over the last 20 minutes it goes from an easy 10 to a 9. I'm rating this with all Dlc's included and with all Dlc's it's nothing but an exceptional game. Everything from the story and the scenario, the incredible cast of characters and their motives and its superb stand out moments which very few games can rival. The gameplay is the best in the trilogy and its soundtrack is brilliant. The ending may be a little underwhelming but the extended cut improves it massively and stops it from being bad. If anything the extended cut made the ending go from bad to somewhat decent. And then you have the DLC's with the citadel Dlc being the standout one and the others all being decent side stories. The citadel DLC was totally amazing and a great send off to the trilogy. The trilogy as a whole is probably my favourite video game of all time. With all 3 games it remains one of the best gaming experiences I've ever experienced and I've played through it at least 3 times with an incoming 4th with the legendary edition coming out.. ""Mass Effect 3"": Amazing game, it provides an amazing experience for the player. 7 out of 7. Played it on Xbox 360.. OVERALL - 80% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 6/10 Regardless of this games' downfalls explained multiple times in other User scores, I had a fun time playing this. Less clunky than previous instalments and crisp graphics.. Combat is easily the best of the 3. Played with extended cut ending, sure, wasn't the best ending in the world, but it was fine. Story throughout the game was top notch.. While yes, The ending truly hurts the games use of replayability, everything else I thought was truly excellent. From it's combat, to it's characters, and some scenes that truly tug at the heart strings. It might not be a flawless conclusion, I still think it's a fantastic installment.. Now that I've seen all the controversy around the world with TLOU 2 I thought maybe I will review a game that I played a long time ago and was kind of divisive. The only issue with this game if my memory doesn't fail was the ending that's it. Unlike the other game. Well so I will say this: The trilogy as a whole is one of the best in gaming history yeah the ending could have been better and give better choices to the characters at the end but the game still was good and I think Bioware after this game started to walk his decline road and became the company we all know now. Yeah I played DA Inquisition it's not that great and then Andromeda and finally Anthem. A linear experience with a garbage ending. I had high hopes after 2 but this game made me lose trust in game devs.. Really loved this game. Story goes in interesting directions to say the least but the core gameplay and character interactions still stand as the strongest in video games.. Mass Effect 3 is the best part of the series, and even the ending of the trilogy cannot prevent it. First of all, I don 't understand how the ending of the trilogy can ruin the impression of a series of games that take from 120 to 150 hours in total. Second, the main plot at Mass Effect 3 turned out to be as good as in the first part. In 3 part we solve the most important problems of the universe, finish the stories of all important characters. We get answers to almost all questions (except dark energy, which was forgotten at all. Although there were a bunch of references to her in Mass Effect 2). I can even say that I liked the ending of Mass Effect 3. The final with Extended Cut isn 't that bad. Yes in 2012, not many would agree. Apparently, emotions took over. Mass Effect 3 is the best space opera in the gaming industry, the crown of BioWare creation. And just another example of video games being art, too.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: AWESOME. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. absolutely **** game had to reload hours of progress for a mission I don't want to. Continuing from the events of the previous game Mass Effect 3 opens with the Reapers attacking Earth and, having narrowly escaped with his life, Commander Shepard yet again finds himself as humanity's last hope for survival. Series veterans will be instantly familiar with the games concept in which a series of core and side missions can be accessed from the Normandy's galaxy map. This time around however it is not just a case of recruiting allies to your cause. Depending on how each mission is handled vital resources, such as fleets of warships, can be gained to aid in the final battle against the Reapers. As has always been the case many of these missions allows for a great deal of freedom with a number of, sometimes very difficult, choices being afforded to the player. The series strong combat remains virtually unchanged from the series second entry and still plays like a simplified version of Gears of War. Responding to audience criticisms a number of features have been tweaked however. While the popular Mako may not make a return the weapon and armour customisation has returned and the dull planet scanning all but removed. For the first time in the Mass Effect series multiplayer has also been included. To be honest it offers only a minor diversion from the main campaign with only one mode (imagine Horde mode from Gears of War or Halo) and six small maps to play in co-op with up to three other players. Since the playing multiplayer aids in preparing for the Reaper assault in the main game however it is worth investing some time in. And so to the much criticised ending to the game. In my personal opinion some of this criticism is justified as it certainly leaves several plot holes and very much jars with the philosophy of Mass Effect. A few fans have certainly gone overboard however as when you consider the huge influence you are able to wield throughout the game the disappointing final ten minutes in no way spoils the 20+ hours that come before or the epic series as a whole.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even years later folks agonize over this game and rightly so. When you take ME2 and combine it with ME3 you get perhaps the greatest gaming experience of all time. UNTIL, you get to the last 15 minutes of ME3. I can’t comprehend how the same team that made these great games decided that this was the way to end it, nodded to each other, and said it was good to go. It still baffles me. It’s probably not the worst video game ending of all time; but it’s certainly the worst video game ending of all time for a game that was actually good. Nobody who loves these games, this lore, this universe of gaming will ever get over it. When I did my last replay I stopped before the final mission, I refused to play the ending. But still, this is an incredible game, you just have to ignore the last 15 minutes and pretend something else happened inside your brain. EA daggered BioWare and ME:A was a mediocre, soulless slog, but really it’s the ending of ME3 that ended it for us all.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mass Effect 3 is a villyfied game just because of one thing: its ending. I think it is a bit unfair to the game, the ending can't destroy the whole game experience even tho it was the close up to the whole saga ( which is why it is so hatred ). If we don't take into account the ending, this game is an improvement of what we saw in Mass Effect 2: combat system, space mining, graphics, variety in weapons, etc... The game could perfectly be a 10/10 , but as I said: the ending is horrible. It's just so mad but at the same time appreciable because of the risk the developers took ( it went wrong, obviously ), maybe it was an original idea, maybe they didn't know how to finish the saga, anyway, it's a really good game with non deserved ending. It still is a ''must game'' for me.. Mass Effect 3 shows **** with less careful than its both predecessors, whether for being a mere recicled most of Mass Effect 2's style. for having notable falling of frames on multicolored and multieffected moments, for having even more bugs, mixed with game's epilogue that doesn't gives same power of choice as on previously games. But for keeping immersive, holding, funny, with the best saga's playability and with most of the story still good, makes which game doesn't need being perfect at all but satisfying or at minimum understandeable to ending the trilogy, and ME 3 does it.. To start off, I'm going to mention something that has been said a hundred times before; the ending was weak. For all of the effort and time that I (and many others) have put into this trilogy, the ending should and could have been 100% better. However, during my current play through of the game and its DLC's, I realized something; despite having a mediocre ending, this is one of the greatest experiences in gaming. I have to say that this game had a lot of good improvements over the last two. The ability to have a serious melee attack was nice as was the ability to jump over gaps. The amount of weapons to choose from was also a nice bonus, and the customization of said weapons just added to it. The combat is improved slightly over the last game, and feels smoother and faster. The characters are back and look better than ever. Honestly, this game still holds on a graphics front today. One of the features from the last game that I'm glad they got rid of is the scanning of planets for resources. Yes, you still have to scan, but you don't have to go to each planet one at a time. Instead you scan while flying the Normandy, and if something comes up, then you go to the planet and scan it. This, despite the ending, is one of the greatest stories of all time, and just proves how good Bioware used to be.. Like most people I thought this game was just brilliant apart from the terrible ending from which we deserved better after playing all 3 games. But It still deserves a 10 because of the sheer scale and the amount of enjoyable hours I've sunk playing it.. I just finished playing all of the Mass Effect games. The first time, I let the council die, destroyed the collector base, romanced Tali, miss all of ME3 DLC, and chose the synthesis ending. This time I saved the council, kept the collector base, romanced Ashley, and chose the destroy ending. I actually don't dislike the ending as much as a lot of these reviews do. I understand why people did not like the way it ended with three choices, but it actually makes more sense than they think. One thing life has taught us, is that you can make all the right choices, and still not have control of a certain situation. The reviews here make the mistake of assuming humanity should have 100% control over their fate because they made the right choices. While the choices they made did have consequences, such as being able to save both the geth and quarians, cure the genophage, etc, we must realize that we were never in complete control over the fate galaxy. Meeting the construct, TIM, it is he that has complete control. He is the catalyst, he has made sure the cycle has continued for millions of years, and only through his decision can it be broken. A threat that is as powerful and ever lasting as this one, is not going to be ended without some hard choices. I thought it was extremely fitting that the cycle was ended through the one who started it. The choices we made allowed us to get this far, and we must choose between the three ways that TIM believes will end the cycle. I found the emotional pieces very moving, and I thought they did a great job of wrapping up the personal endings for each character. The only thing I wish, is that after you get the ending that Shepard is alive, that there is more than just him breathing within the rubble. Mass Effect still remains my favorite games series of all time up to this point.. /sigh/ Move along, there's no charm or sci-fi here. While Mass Effect 3 is an undeniably fun game it's not a worthy conclusion at all. The fact that the clunky but sincere sci-fi of the original is unashamedly traded in for a full-blown action game is not what breaks the game. As I said the gameplay is fun, but the story... the story is just dogsh#t. I'm sorry, but it's true. I still enjoy the first 2/3rds of the game to a certain extent, but by the finale Mass Effect 3 completely crashes and burns and its clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing.. For me this game was a major betrayal. I loved Mass effect 1, even its issues had a certain charm to them. Mass effect 2 was more polished and created a much larger universe to be in. Both had amazing characters, cool ideas, and had me thinking ME would be the next Star Trek type of scifi. The world felt like somewhere you could really hang out. And it had challenging ideas about humanity and diversity and extremism. Mass Effect 3 was awful... it was dumbed down, the story felt U.S Ra Ra, and overall it spat in the face of its previous fans by giving them a really terrible pay off. What should have been an epic climax was instead a wet fart. Its not just the ending that **** by the way, the whole campaign was poorly constructed. It felt like a whole other series. It was more like Gears of War than the Mass Effect RPG I had come to love. I like to pretend that there never was a third game so that it doesn't taint the other two.. While Mass Effect 3 is a mostly well done game, and completes the long running trilogy in a mostly satisfying fashion, the **** fact is that the absolutely terrible ending completely ruins the entire Mass Effect Trilogy in it's entirety, which is very sad, because this franchise deserves to be remembered, but this absolutely horrendous ending nearly, just nearly altered that. Aside from that though, ME3 is a good enough game worth a playthrough.. I'm not sure how Mass Effect 3 received as much acclaim as it did. It looked liked this game was created by a bunch of Gears of War developers working a second job. The writing was even worse.. 7/10 too much space and bad ending, nevermind the 50+ hours it took to get to it. THOSE 10 minutes ruined gaming for me! Also I'm a little salty because Metacritic censored me on my ME2 review! Censor this, metacritic! (_)_)::::::::::::::::::::::::D. A royal turd encrusted with old age in the hot sun would provide more entertainment than this abysmal, untested insult to the name mass effect. Having played one and two, this one is utterly unplayable due to bugs, horrific map design, and an ignorant philosophy toward difficulty.. I will admit it, I was one of the people that didnt like the ending of ME3. But still I didnt make a great deal about ir, obviously I wished for a Fairy Tale ending where everyone is alive and all its happy, but it didnt, oh well. Minor and sutile improvements, Horde like Multiplayer, intense campaign, eve",the story up until the climax is enthralling . shooting feels the best in trilogy . weapons variety feels limited since many good guns are expensive .
117.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"If you ask me, this is the best mgs game in terms of gameplay. There are millions of ways to kill enemies and it is incredible and fun. The story has a lot left to be desired, though.. The gadgets and cutscenes are still decent to enjoy with. Being the real and last of Kojima's tactical espionage experience,he deserves a salutation.. It was the most annoying and boring platinum in my gaming life. PROS: it's one and only - stealth gameplay. They made it really cool with dozens of nuances, not only hiding behind enemy's back like it's done in many games. CONS: (1) The plot is really bad, it has some cool stuff inside, but overall it's awful. (2) Too much slow motion that means nothing in cut scenes. (3) Even after 10 years after release the game has some bugs including critical ones, when the game hangs with spinner after/before mission, so I need to close it and restart. This happened up to 30 times within 160 hours of gameplay. (4) Open world makes no sense at all. (5) There are 50 main missions and 157 side missions, so to complete everything, you need to play most of those 50 main missions for 3 times: first just to complete, second to get all tasks done, third to make that mission with S rank. So it's really repeatable. And completing 0 and 46 mission for 2 times each, was so annoying. (6) The game forces you to make everything with stealth and not killing anyone, so I developed all non-lethal weapons till that moment with boss fight, when I realised that I do no damage to the boss at all, so I needed to wait some time and gain some money to develop high damage weapons. It's idiotic. (7) I laughed my pants off when I was fighting one of the bosses, and in the cut scene 4 tanks and 2 helicopters did no damage to him, and then I kill him with shotgun and shoulder rocket launcher.. A far less linear experience than previous entries that offers what is still arguably the deepest, most satisfying playground in which to play.. It's an incomplete game and the latter half of the game is clearly unfinished, but it's got the best and most addicting gameplay of any MGS game. A must-play for fans of the series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I thought the beginning of the game was boring, but the customization options made the game much fresher than Guns of The Patriots. The ending was also very original and had a major plot twist.. I've now finished every Metal Gear game since MGS1 and I'll admit I have a rocky history with this franchise, but I have to say, this is one of my very favorites. Historically I've always been conflicted because I love the stories but I've always found the gameplay to be frustrating, especially when playing the first few games. But MGS Five has taken those usual hills and valleys and flipped them upside down. The gameplay succeeds in being much more modern and manageable without losing that unique Tactical Espoinage quality its always had. This really shines during the stealth segments, and the game is truly at its best when you're crawling around, scoring silent headshots and ducking one close call after another. But as fun as all of this is, it's dampened slightly by the obvious fact that the story isn't nearly as crazy or Kojima-like. My understanding is that Kojima left sometime during production but I don't know when or what they finished after he left or any of those details - you can just tell that some of the plot doesn't have that special insane quality you're used to in a Metal Gear game. In fact at times it seemed like there was very little story at all and the focus remained strictly on completing missions, although I know now by that killing a certain scantily clad NPC, I may have inadvertently eliminated some of that story myself. All in all Phantom Pain had very different highs and lows than what I'm accustomed to for this series, but as someone who ultimately favors gameplay over story, the good outweighed the bad enough to make this my favorite Metal Gear game ever - except for Revengeance.. This is peak Metal Gear Solid. The most creative stealth shooter I've ever played. Its innovative. It's rewarding. Its strategic. It's over the top. It's just fun. Play it.. The game was good, but had a lot of annoyances that I just didn't like. Mainly the credits before every mission bugged me. At the begining of every mission you get informed who appears in the mission and because of that... the credits often spoil what the mission is going to be about. Also the lack of David Hayter in this game, I didn't care for, nor did I care of how the game relies on audio tapes to tell the story. I suspect it was mainly due to replacing the VA to an movie star actor had a lot more to do with that than they let on. Gameplay was engaging, and the story progress was good. However, was disappointed in some plot points of the story. The story, overall, feels incomplete. And with Kojima no longer connected with this IP or Konami and with Komami basically turing it's back to video games.. looks like this is the end of MGS....even with the resurgance of remakes.. As a first time metal gear player, I do admit the story is confusing at times. But ill be damned if the gameplay and characters dont make up for it.. The Gameplay is so addictive, in my opinion this game is still the best stealth game you can found in the last 10 years. However the story is not that great until chapter 2 where things start to connect. All The characters are so good, this game need a real finale. But overall it was an amazing experience, Love you Hideo Kojima. another masterpiece from kojima-san. this piece, completes the circle of the long lasting story which continues like a perfect cycle. every moment is so well thought and designed. music and wibe is something you may never have experienced before. and the story brilliance has a lot of shocking surprises to witness. you will understand after the game. I was truelly shocked and adored Kojima's story telling skills after the ""paramedic thing""... great job.. The gameplay and the visual are fantastic even though i wish there wouldnt have been more variety. the story is just mediocre. I am very disappointed. Game is unfinished storywise.. some missions are so frustrating, I had to retry like 50 times. In the end I felt that this game was not worth starting. It just goes to nowhere.. Metal Gear Solid 5 offers well-balanced gameplay with challenging stealth action and interesting gadgets. The story is engaging, especially with the evolving relationships between characters. However, it's very disappointing that the story feels unfinished. Despite this, the quality is so high that it leaves you wishing for more.. I thought the second game in the series was quite good, and really enjoyed playing the remake of the first game on the Gamecube. In comparison, this fifth game was just horrible, I only played it for a few hours.. There is no doubt that this game from the franchise showed a deeper and new-game experiences that brought many new and fun mechanics. However, the game lacks in certain aspects that make it difficult to fully enjoy it. One of the major drawbacks of Metal Gear Solid V is the sprawling open-world map. While it offers breathtaking landscapes and a vast playground for espionage, the sheer expanse can sometimes feel eerily lonely. The vast stretches of terrain between missions can be desolate, making traversal a bit of a drag for those looking for constant engagement. Besides those small details, the game's exceptional storytelling, innovative gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for any fan of the stealth genre or the Metal Gear series.. The game is great for its story (even not finished because of Konami) and **** the development of weapons,items etc. is veeery slow.Also how the hell can Snake not climb rocks?Like wtf whas Kojima thinking at this time?They can't develop a grappling hook mechanic?And some missions tasks are so hard,i must watch from YouTube tutorials how to achieve them.This is why i gave it a lower score.Maybe Kojima didn't get the time from Konami to develop the ideas he was having.. It's not unfinished as Kojima has reiterated multiple times. It's a true masterpiece. The best gameplay of the series with some phenomenal cinematics and Quiet is a great character. Kojima never misses.. This game is trash. I can't believe I wasted 40 hours of my life completing ""Chapter One"" along with a bunch of side ops. Kojima is a pretentious director who created an early stealth game back in the NES days and a PS1 game with a bunch of cut scenes before those were a thing and has been riding this crap for decades. This story is so silly that I laughed out loud a couple times. It is really embarrassing that the gaming industry props this crap up. It makes gamers look bad when they point to games like this as art. This story is like an edgy Saturday Morning cartoon but makes less sense. The villain is a burn victim in Lone Ranger cosplay who spouts the usual cliches with some hackneyed contrived BS mixed in. I guess the gameplay can be fun but the game is too long with too many filler missions. You literally repeat missions in the campaign and people are just OK with that like it's 1993 or something. The open world is fake too. It is just military outposts connected by roads. You're a ""special ops"" soldier who can't even scale a small ledge because that ledge is basically an invisible wall. If you want good stealth then play Splinter Cell, Hitman, Deus Ex, or Dishonored instead. Stay away from Phantom Pain. Don't be another simp for Kojima.. must admit, I was rather disappointed. I requested a copy of this game because it was rated 10 out of 10. Boy have I been disappointed. The missions are boring- 1 after the other the same playthrough often at the same location you visited just hours before. Controller options are clunky. D-horse: right just slide to the other side of the saddle and no enemies even think to wonder why a saddled horse is wandering into their highly fortified area and the constant Hyah Hyah Hyah every 10 seconds is sooooo aggravating it makes me want to throw up. Like_who even rides a horse and constantly screams Hyah Hyah? (absolutely no one who has actually ever ridden a horse) Mission goals (except for the primary task) are hidden until you achieve them.. Wow- rescued a prisoner but there were 6 others I didn't locate hiding in dark corners in hidden areas sooo too bad you're only getting an E-rating on mission completion and if you missed that random blue-print in the bottom left corner of a dark room oops your mission ops will cost more than you thought you'd earned. Not to mention if you accidentally run into a sniper capable of spotting your crawling thru the underbrush on a dark night you get to here someone screaming SSSSSNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE at the top of their voice before you can hit replay and every time you achieve less than an excellent rating you have to sit and take random criticism hoping you'll do MUCH BETTER next time. Yep I keep hoping there's something better in this game and I'm gonna find a reason or excuse for powering thru all the multiple aggravations and the boring repetitious play besides just blowing up things and murdering random people.. Sadly, playing this game makes me feel like a big boss, because it stinks and is boring. One of the best gameplay systems ever in video-game history. Super satisfying, engaging and creative. The story, albeit incomplete & confusing, is not bad and the supporting characters are interesting and memorable. But my rating is solely based on the gameplay loop, the missions & some story beats. Not to mention, the game has high replayability value.. amazing game and masterpiece the gameplay and graphic are excellente the story is good. Mid, good gameplay and sandbox but the story and the missions are unfinished and bad.. Has anyone else actually played all the way to the end? The sandbox gameplay is fun but the overarching plot was made up by that one kid from your elementary school class who said he can’t show you the alligator in his locker or his dad in the cia will kill both of you and make it look like an accident. One of the greatest games ever made.. Amazing gameplay let down only by 2 things; its lack of act 3 and a true ending and david hayter not voicing snake. While i like sutherlands toned down performance and maybe a somewhat wise choice considering the games “ending” revelation which wouldnt make sense for hayter. I. LOVE. IT. the only problum is you go to Mother Base but there is nothing to do, and I hate that ugly ""Devils Horn"". One of the most satisfying open world games every made. The only fault is that I wish there was more. Also, Kiefer is great but I miss David Hayter. It's just not the same snake without him.. played.. Definitely not as good as Metal Gear Solid 4, but ok overall. Something about this game feels very disconnected and the story feels like an afterthought. Like a series of online missions with way too many mechanics added in to feel like a true Metal Gear Solid game. Not Kojima's best work and definitely a struggle to get through while staying engaged, but fun to play the odd mission before turning it off out of boredom or frustration.. The level of repetition here will have you burnt out in this game within the first hour. Essentially keep visiting the same few maps with a different objective each time. There also seems to be a story somewhere in here, but it's so lackluster and threadbare that you'll be playing for the gameplay alone. Spoiler alert, this game plays like it's on the PS3. Stiff movement and controls break any sense of immersion you feel. Also the empty, open worlds offer nothing of interest but eye candy. Overall this game is such a disappointment and glaring step down from the established franchise. Finally, there's no true ending. It was cut content, so that pretty much gives you an idea of what you're getting here as far as quality.. I really enjoy this game but be honest game was not complete specially at end. I have to start praising the incredible optimization of this game with extremely beautiful graphics, which runs on machines and consoles that just by looking at it, one is surprised to see that it runs on lighter devices. The script is great, especially the voice team and the game's memorable characters.. Its honestly pretty good!! I dont like some of the missions and the gameplay is kinda confusing. But the story and game in general is great and I am thankful for Hideo Kojima for creating the Metal Gear franchise!. This game is pure immersive sim. Anything you want to approach, can be approached in almost infinite possibilities. I absolutely adored this game, from its side content, to the main story. Everything feels amazing to control aswell, and the game doesn't fail to succeed at base-building either. As base-building can sometimes be considered tedious, it feels like you are the (as implied) big boss at a building company. This game's story, the bosses, and consideration put into the game is all truly something to marvel at. However, since Konami did what they did, I cannot put this game any higher than an 8. For more context, just search up why Konami fired Kojima after MGSV.. Good game form **** bad it isnt fun.Looks awesome and very indepth but theres no fun.. incredible masterpiece story 9 gameplay 10 sound and music 10 graphics 10 kojima 10 this game is art. loved this game. the gameplay of mgs5 is smooth and responsive. the stealth is a bit hard but when you complete it you feel rewarded. the story of this game is lackluster though. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a action-adventure stealth video game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. + Good Graphics, The Cutscene looks great + Best Gameplay of the series - Boring Story - Skull Face Is A Weak Antagonist - Wasted Characters - There's nothing to do in Mother Base and it is boring to walk around it - Repeat Missions - Some Main Mission feels like side missions - Repetitive Side Missions - Clunky Boss Fights - Boring Open World - Fighting the Skulls are Clunky and Annoying. I love this game since childhood and amazing graphics and lot action and amazing graphic and good day. Good story with a good plot twist at the end. Graphics look better than some games released today. Some of the best third person gameplay ever. Tons of weapon and tool variety giving the player lots of different ways of approaching a mission. Cinematography is 11/10 I wish we got that ""mission 51"" to probably conclude the story. MGS V is great, but it isn't classic Metal Gear. It's more like a Tom Clancy open-world game. On the plus side, ""Phantom"" is packed with content. It has amazing graphics and a good story. But the TV episodic structure doesn't work. Also Kiefer Sutherland is more Jack Bauer than Big Boss. Kojima made a big mistake replacing David Hayter. I also don't like that the backstory is revealed through audio cassettes. Some fans will appreciate the emphasis on gameplay over cutscenes. Despite the flaws, the game is great. I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10.. I've never been that big a fan of the Metal Gear Solid series - I found the controls clumsy, the one-false-move-and-you're-dead trial and error formula exasperating and seemed to spend more time watching the games than actually playing them. This is still true of certain sections of MGS V but the more open world approach eliminates the worst of it, creating a sort of stealth version of Red Dead that makes for easily the best instalment in the franchise.. 9, its too hard to explain. The Phantom pain is more than just a game, it's several years of waiting, speculation and broken promise. The whole behind the scene story with Konami, the missing chapter 3 and the promise of an uncompromising story that never happened... MGS V features the best TPS gameplay ever, a veritable sandbox of infiltration in a world so empty... But despite all that it's one of the games where I had the most fun. This game cannot be rated for my whole experience. Play Time : 213h. this game is plain sttupid and really horrible, i can not understand how this crap could be liked by even a single person ?????. Best MGS after Snake Eater, more open ended infiltration make MGSTPP the best MGS, story wise snake eater still hold the crown, but gameplay this topped snake eater. Creative, Intense, and Fun, Makes you want to keep on playing to upgrade you stuff, story I kinda tuned out though. To make one thing clear: 0 point reviews are mainly ""sponsored"" by opposing industry which is why they are mainly pointless. Some of the 10 point reviews may be ""sponsored"" too – but in case of MGS V 10 points are fully justified from an objective point of view. Simple as that. A modern classic as for me.. Pros: - Amazing visuals. - Perfect performance (locked 60fps) - Gameplay is refined and satisfying. Cons: - Open world feels almost useless in the grand scheme of things. Empty aside from a few wandering animals and outposts. Makes travelling between objectives feel like a chore. - Story is very barebones. - The whole mother base thing is a cool concept but doesn't really bring a real benefit to the gameplay. This game is not bad. If you enjoy Metal Gear or stealth, you'll enjoy what this game has to offer. Smooth performance and great visuals complement the satisfying gameplay. However, the empty world, barebones story, and somewhat unnecessary mechanics (Mother Base) make it feel like it is FAR from its full potential. MGSV: TPP is a game that I found myself enjoying at times, and forcing myself to play at others.. This game affected me so much that I had to change my channel name. Now it's Furtividade Explosiva (Explosive Stealth in portuguese) because the game is about stealth but I always **** at it and would end up getting found out and blowing everything up after an hour or two of dying, LOL! But the unanswered question is: How did Quiet, who was sent to kill the Boss twice, suddenly fall in love with him? Anyway, the only defect of this game is that Quiet looks exactly like my ex-wife!. I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS FRANCHISE , MY FAVORITE GAME FRANCHISE and MY FAVORITE METAL GEAR. As a metal gear fan, the series ended at peace walker for me. Why Hideo Kojima decided to replace David Hayter with Keifer Sutherland will always be a disappointment for me. If I wanted to read an audio book then I would.. This is Konami’s best swan song ever! Gameplay, setpiece, story, everything about this game is feel like is incredible as hell. This game is definitely a 100% masterpiece.. I love this game and since day coming out back day and amazing story and amazing graphics and control speak u for mission cool and good day. Good story. Great missions. Cool environments for the sandbox approach. Weapons and items available are a lot of fun.. i always loved the metal gear saga there is no game i hate (except metal gear survive i don't even want to try it) i love everything about this game there is nothing wrong with it it's perfect. ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ BRO I WANT TO **** WITH QUIET SO HARD. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Flawed masterpiece. This is as good as it gets when it comes to stealth gameplay, some really cool ideas and huge scope of the game, but it does feel unfinished. I guess Kojima had too big ambitions on this one.. What are the best game? Please have a video game. Smooth and intuitive. Excellent graphics and great usability. Story left a little to be desired. Would have loved to see episode 51 finished and included. Still it's a masterpiece!. Great game of the new generation, mix the good stealth with all the classic and memorable gameplay.. 9/10 I really enjoyed this game. This was my first entry in the Metal Gear universe and I was in love with it. The open world worked fine for me, the story is very well written and the mission design is just amazing. I loved every single time that I had to prepare myself to go to the open world according to the mission that I was going to do, taking different equipments and weapons throughout the game. Very good game full of weapons, enjoyable looting system, buddies are great, missions are fun to play and you can easily spend more than 100 hours in this game. I strongly recommend it!. I have so many contradictions with this game. For one side is one of the best gameplay that i have ever played in a 3rd person shooter game in my life. The story has ups and downs but its cinematics are incredible and the scenes are incredible(Thanks Kojima). But at the same time, the structure of the game is so strange for a Metal Gear game. Is an open world that should have been a linear one, it doesn't make sense the side missions, the time you spend listening to a cassette everytime you want to understand the story and the fact that every character has a good construction, has his moments, and the main character is like a dumb guy that does'n talk near the entire game. So disappointed for that one. Screw the bad ratings, they are mostly hate on konami for the game not being finished! if you want an unforgettable experience with 1000 reasons to keep playing, this is the game for you! everything about it is almost perfect! gameplay, machanics, graphics, building mother base, characters, stroy, soundtrack, it is simply perfection in many aspects. it even has a story towards our society and the world itself- i can´t praise this game enough and i played thousands of games in my life. 5 years later i still get chills if i watch trailers or listen to the soundtrack. just another true masterpiece from Kojima, not finished but who cares?! play it, and you won´t be disappointed.. Good stealth game(but you can play it without it sometimes which is good.) But the story should've had a little more cutscenes. That is about it. For now i'm still in the middle of playing it so I will see if my opinion will change. But if not this review will stay the same.. If you love stealth games, this may be your favorite game. The gameplay may be a bit difficult to pick up at first, but once you do, then you’ll come to really love this game. The core stealth gameplay consists of a large number of moves and gadgets that allow for experimentation and freedom of gameplay. This was the game that got me into the metal gear solid series, and might get anyone else into the series as well after playing this. The only thing that doesn’t work about this game is the second act and the ending, but these are very minor grievances due to mgsv’s focus of gameplay over story.. very good missions, well done combat system and good graphics but the open world feels dead and can make you melancholy. the gameplay is so much fun. so many ways to go about and amazing how all systems interact. Game is ok at one point but then its absolute unrealistic garbage. Imagine things happens like when enemy sees you and shoot you threw tent and your tank flips over a fist size rock u get nerve break down.I really tolerate game bulls*it but this one got it to the top!!!!!!!!!!@. I hate the mission select format it kills all immersion , this isn't a metal gear game that i loved through childhood.. Core gameplay is incredible. Hands down the greatest and deepest stealth game ever made. However its confusing story, disturbing cutscenes, rather ugly aesthetics, and horrific fantasy elements rip it away from being a legendary action game.. Amazing game. Awful story. It story feels rushed. Very **** disappointed the final act is missing. The way Konami treated kojima was horrible **** Konami. But this game deserves game of the year and is one of my favourite games over the last decade. Not the Metal Gear Solid send off I was hoping for tho.. The only reason it’s not a 10 is because a big portion of the ending is missing, all thanks to Konami.. This game is really great and kept me into the story. Sadly the story is not complete but for what it has it is quite the journey. It is unfortunate that the game could of been even better for Hideo's final Metal Gear game but, that would of just made fans' motivation to tie him down to it even more vicious.. I love the game. Its almost perfection from Kojima. The only reason it is a 8 and not a 10 is the game is unfinished due to Konami. I knew a lot about MGS5 long before I started playing it. I have played all games in the MGS series including the portable Peace Walker, and I have delayed my MGS5 playthrough for several years after the initial reviews. Despite being a great open-world stealth action game, with flawless game design and military aesthetics, the game was said to be clearly unfinished, so I decided to skip it and not get myself disappointed. But a couple of months ago I picked it up in a sale and finally decided to check it out. And oh god it is bad. The gameplay is enjoyable, yes, but what happened to MGS? Where is all the story? Why is Snake so silent most of the game? Why do the story missions just repeat themselves? You just feel like the devs had no time or money (Kojima? No time? No Money??) and they just ripped cutscenes and turned them into cassette messages. The new villain Skullface has no backstory or motivation except some anger against the English language (what?), colonel Volgin from MGS3 is back from the dead (what??), a naked sniper deprived of words can shoot a jet with a sniper rifle but can't write something down with a pen or kill a crippled wounded guy in a hospital (what???), a lot of useless hassle with kids that has no resolution whatsoever, and I can go on and on. The game literally ends with nothing as the final act with Solidus and a big mech is simply missing. That is clearly not what should be in an MGS game. Basically, it is just **** - gameplay with little to no consistent story. And it deserves half of a score.. For a little background, Metal Gear as a franchise is a stealth game where you play as different special operatives all with the codename ""Snake"", with a mission to infiltrate some location and destroy some superweapon that is called ""Metal Gears"". From this basic premise though, series creator Hideo Kojima, despite his many Hollywood troops and gratuitous scene selections still manages to tell a compelling anti-war narrative in which a player has the choice to either slaughter his way through a base, or spare all of their foes. Motivated by the writer's desire for the player to understand the consequences of nuclear war and its horrors, which the Metal Gears are analogous to in the plot. What is most interesting to me about this game is how much it contrasts many of the other game franchises with similar demographics. Games such as GTA, Far Cry, Just Cause, and others allow the player to fulfill a fantasy of being a Hollywood action hero that gets to destroy buildings, commit gratuitous acts of violence, kill NPCs for no reason, and it all be framing you to be this ""badass"" (For lack of a better term). Whereas this game takes the same Mature rating that all of these games have and makes the arrogant kid who picks it up because he wants to play something fun sit with the consequences of his actions as the Narrative reminds you of your ""sins"" (A term the game uses throughout its dialog and is the central theme of one of its soundtrack pieces literally called ""Sins of the Father""). It is admirable how well the writer understands and wishes to subvert his audience. Furthermore, the game incentivizes pacifism over gratuitous violence while also making it far more difficult. If you go through a mission without a single kill or the enemies never detected you at all (avoiding any confrontation at all), you get an S score, and the characters of the game congratulate you on a job well done, whereas those same characters will talk negatively if you score any less. I think this helps to add dignity to the human persons in the stories, even if they are just expressionless grunts. Overall, the gameplay alone is so good, that regardless of how bad you feel playing through the story, you need to play more of it. Almost as if the game is the drug that keeps you hooked so the writer can prove his point. On to the Narrative review. The story is, on the surface, a simple revenge quest. You are the leader of a mercenary company, and your base is destroyed by a mysterious rogue operative, and it is your job to avenge your comrades and get revenge on this mysterious man. So, you travel from warzone to warzone, witnessing the horrors of war (and for some players who elect to, participate in them), in search of this mysterious man. The game is incredibly well-researched. Since it takes place in 1984, the game brings light to actual conflicts that occurred, in particular, The Soviet-Afghan War and the conflict in Angola-Zaire. Using a bit of parody, it shows the inner workings of the ""War Economy"" and the military-industrial complex as you see how these nations interact with certain mercenary corps and how the powers of the world promote this. But most compelling with the story is the aftermath after you achieve the revenge central to the Narrative, you receive the thematic thesis that the main character has. All of your allies feel completely distraught after losing their reason for being (The aforementioned revenge), but your character explains that he wishes to turn his mercenary corps into a nation of soldiers with nothing left to fight for. He understands that revenge would never fulfill him, only by building something greater than himself can he cope with the tragedy of all that he has done and all that he has lost. This is a very unique approach for a game’s revenge quest, especially compared to something like Just Cause 3.. Masterpiece gameplay, disappointing story, but it's worth a playthrough just for the gameplay.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot o","there are millions of ways to kill enemies and it is incredible and fun . the story has a lot left to be desired, though . it's an incomplete game and the latter half of the game is clearly unfinished . it's the best and most addicting playground in which to play ."
118.The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,"This is my favorite of the original dungeon format Zelda games. Its the first Zelda game I ever 100%ed and there was never a dull moment. I was never bored, the bosses are great, and I'm a psychopath who likes motion controls. I do understand that others don't agree and I personally don't like the story which is what brings it down to an eight. (I don't really care for story though). Some of the best dungeons and bosses in the whole series but falls short due to being painfully linear, aswell as motion controls being a pain and causing dread when considering a replay.. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is, in my opinion, the worst Zelda game I have played so far. It's super linear, the gameplay gets sometime really boring and the world building is horrible, since you have to go to the same 3 places multiple times without anything changing much. Despite this, the story is pretty good and the finale is definitely the highlight of the game (Skyward Sword went from a bad 6 to a good 6 for me). Overall, Skyward Sword is fine. There are some serious issues that affect the experience, but it's still a good game. 6,6/10. It says something that this is the only Zelda I've played and haven't finished. I loved energy and dialogue in the beginning, but at some point this game felt like a slog and I couldn't finish it. Very high quality game nonetheless. An underrated Zelda game, there are some gameplay issues, but the game has a lot to offer.. Amazing game. So nostalgic and love the open world feel with character depth. Something so simple about sky-loft but also so interesting at the same time. Love this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Freaky Really freaky Extremely freaky In a way that you could think that the 75 words are to much for the freaky game. An underrated Zelda game, and perhaps the last good one to ever be made. The new Zelda games Breath of the wild and Tears of the Kingdom don't compare and lack soul. This game followed the Zelda formula and had a decent story, music, and gameplay.. Skyward Sword makes me sad. This is my least favorite major Zelda game excluding the Gameboy/spinoffs. The directional sword-fighting mechanics are gimmicky, and don't add nearly enough value to make up for the annoyance of its additional complexity. The UI is one of the very worst I've seen. The controls are a mess, and to simply look around with your character requires you to hold down a button before using the thumbstick. The gameplay itself is mired in a series of increasingly obnoxious and unintuitive puzzles that bring the game to a screeching halt. A lot of the puzzles are tied to the aforementioned directional sword-fighting. For example, to defeat eye sentries you have to move your sword around in clockwise circles so they get dizzy. How are you supposed to know this? Luck, I suppose, or looking up a guide like I did. The beauty of Zelda games has always been the simplicity and intuitive nature of the gameplay, which is an RPG distilled to its core elements, with ideally nothing needing an explanation. If I have to look up something, it has failed. There's also far too much talking for a Zelda game, and having to speed through badly-written dialog. There are lots of little annoyance as well that aren't really worth going through, like automatically warping you out of a dungeon without asking if you're ready to leave. It all points to an amateurish team being in charge of this great series. I guessed correctly that Miyamoto wasn't involved with this project. This doesn't feel like a Zelda game.. I don't actually know why the hate and the disparagement at this title. Have one of the best histories in all Zelda games. It is the game with more content before Breath of the Wild and Tears od the Kingdom. Have one of the best graphics and art, with a beautiful and colorful world. And the biggest and more complicated dungeons with a deep design with Twilight Princess. For me, it was my best experience in a Zelda game added to Twilight Princess. Skyward Sword is a very good game but so underrated.. I love this game because of flying around and the end boss battle. It was really hard and I needed like 5 attempts. And I love the way how the relationship between Zelda and Link is.. One of the greatest stories ever found in a video game. Gameplay is genuinely delightful. Have you ever wanted to wield a sword against monsters, well you can have that feeling in your living room. I spent day after day standing in front of the TV in swordsman stance swinging my wii remote and saving the world without tiring. Play this game. You won't regret it.. I don't care about the motion controls or Fi or anything petty like that. We can praise the game for its visuals, unique story, or amazing soundtrack, but at its core, Skyward Sword is a game that is tedious and hand-holdy. Zelda is a series founded on exploration, and I'm not just saying that because I've recently 100% completed Breath of the Wild. In fact Skyward Sword does everything right that Breath of the Wild may have missed. However, that comes at the cost of doing everything wrong that Breath of the Wild did right. Even the older and more linear games that people are so fond of still gave you a sense of adventure. And it's absolutely baffling that such a wonderful new open world in the sky is the most restrictive the game has ever been. The game's boss battles and side quests feel like padding. There should be no reason why I should be required to fight the same boss over and over! There is not enough variety in the game to warrant doing that! And because of the motion control gimmick thrown in there, the enemies now take really long to defeat, which feels like an artificial level of challenge. The game discourages you from using your abilities to its fullest and puts you into a box. This entire game is repetition, hand-holding, and padding, and the story isn't nearly strong enough to make up for that! To give credit to the game, the Dungeons are among the best designed in the series, and work well with the tools you acquire on your journey, but that same care wasn't delivered to the other 3/4ths of the game.. Skyward Sword deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest games Nintendo has made.. This is the best Zelda game with the first real relationship between Link and Zelda and has grat gameplay story and levels. While motion controls may not be for everyone, Skyward Sword is arguably the best demonstration of what the Wii is capable of. Combat is overhauled to be the best it is in the series, with each encounter feeling exhilarating and unique due to not only the increased variety of techniques Link can perform but the added variety of enemies as well. Motion controls themselves are fluid and responsive, for both combat and for other uses such as aiming items such as the bow, allowing for added precision not found in other LoZ games. Dungeons and puzzles are consistently interesting and unique without overstaying their welcome, and the different overworlds the game offers are vibrant and compelling to explore, particularly thanks to the game's presentation. The water color style is breathtaking and feels like a perfect combination of WW and TP's art styles, and the orchestrated soundtrack made up of both old and new tunes is perhaps the best this series has to offer. While the story is pretty run of the mill for LoZ standards, the characterization is also the best its ever been in the series, from main characters like Zelda or Ghirahim to side characters like Groose to even the random townspeople in Skyloft. The game's main bane is its repetitiveness, as plenty of main story quests will have you backtracking to areas you've already explored which can lead to later parts of the game feeling monotonous. Furthermore, while the combat expansions are great, they also lead to combat taking longer to complete which may overstay its welcome, particularly across longer play sessions. Skyward Sword is a great game but also one to take your time with; trying to blast through the game will quickly reveal how repetitive the game can get and diminish the experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Skyward Sword is very fun but not as good as twilight princess in my opinion, but still big recommendation.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brilliant game. The pacing is lightning quick, the story is mind blowing and beautifully presented, art style is colourful, and most importantly, gameplay is fun and challenging from start to finish. Enemy encounters will keep you on your toes, puzzles are clever and fun, the motion control takes some getting used to but it won’t be long before you’ve mastered it. it is in my top 3 Zelda games of all time and one of the best games money can buy.. I love this game. Its a Zelda experience you cant get anywhere else. Its perfect story-telling and overall perfect working world, makes it my favorite zelda.. Literally my favorite game ever. The bosses are elite, the areas are the best out of any zelda game ever, and the way that they intertwine the areas is absolutely fantastic. The only complaint is that stupid pumpkin carrying side quest and the violin on which **** soo much you might as well skip it.. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword may be over 10 years old, but this does not stop it from being one of the most revolutionary games of all time. Taking advantage of the Wii MotionPlus controls, Skyward Sword gives its players a whole new way to pilot Link and direct his sword movements, ramping up the immersion of the previous games by ten-fold. During combat, players can swish their Wii remotes and the weapon will follow, cutting down any one of a wide variety of enemies that get in Link’s way, or simulate the wing flaps of a bird as they soar though the vast skies on the back of a crimson Loftwing. Movement has also been improved, with Link being able to spend recharging stamina to jump, sprint and climb his way to victory. The controls aren’t the only magical thing either; this game incorporates a huge selection of breathtaking landscapes, dungeons and realms, with beautiful graphics sure to captivate the eye and transport the player to the world of Zelda. These places are explored bit by bit, and always seem to have further to expand the next time you return to them, capturing the vastness of this universe. Skyward Sword has many a fun dungeon, utilizing all sorts of puzzles with ranging levels of difficulty that are sure to keep you engaged and entertained throughout. These dungeons are spectacularly topped off with diverse and interesting boss battles, all challenging but possible, perhaps with a little aid from extra health. All the while, the player is accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack, featuring some of the familiar and usually intense themes combined with memorable and enchanting ballads that bring a whole new feel to the game Skyward Sword is a sizeable game, with around 40 hours of exciting playtime for the main story, and 60 if you’re compelled to achieve 100% completion. Along with Link’s main quest, it features many side missions for the player to tackle, and a chance to revisit the dungeon boss fights in a high stakes one life only situation. This game is story driven, but that doesn’t prevent it from appealing to people who want to replay something again. You could dive in immediately if you wanted to challenge yourself to the fastest time, or give it a few years so it’ll feel brand new. Expanding on the overall lore of the universe, Skyward Sword brings the beginning of Link’s adventure to the table, introducing diverse and interesting characters that aid you along a wonderfully crafted journey, sure to keep you eager to find out what’s coming next Overall, I think that to this day, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an amazing game that engages and entertains both long-time fans of Zelda, as well as new players being welcomed into the series. If you haven’t already, I’d highly recommend checking out this game as I think it’s an experience to be remembered.. My favorite zelda game and my favorite game of all time, history is perfect. My other favorite video game of all time. The story is just incredible, I love the gameplay with the sword, art directionis wonderfull and bosses are great.. The only Zelda 3d game I couldnt finish. Skyward sword is a great game shackled by unresponsive controls.. I absolutely love this **** motion controls worked well for me, I loved the feeling of slashing through monsters. I really likehow they managed to make every area feel different everytime we have to return.. This Zelda game is a work of art, it has probably the best story in a Zelda game ever, it has incredible puzzles using the motion controls and great boss fights too, it has its flaws like backtracking a lot and people had issues a lot with motion controls, but i didnt had any issues with that, overall great game and great Zelda title.. The game is not that good, since its more of the same stuff from older games, Zelda needs to redefine itself... its pretty much the same story, the same characters with different controls and dungeons. There are no towns and NPC's are scattered in small areas. It kinda feels...small with little life. It's not a bad game, but definitely one of the weakest zelda games. My individual score is 75 - 100. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. hands down the best zelda game ever made, best dungeons best music best sidequests best combat, everything is the best. a masterpiece and I loved the controls, very intuitive, nintendo gave quality!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite some flaws consisting of the game being sometimes too linear, the start of the game taking too long and fighting demise 3 times- it is still a very good game. The dungeons are all mostly great and has some amazing bosses. My favourite dungeon is the sandship dungeon. The 3 distinct areas are all quite fun to explore but the some part of the level can feel quite linear. The items and combat is fun as per usual but the using the Wii remote to aim does get quite frustrating. The open sky world is fun but not much stuff is to do there. Overall an excellent game with some flaws.. Another beautiful looking Zelda game that lacks the darker edge of the best instalments and so I personally prefer Twilight Princess - which you can also play without the expense of buying a Motion Plus, unlike this.. Everything is good. Story, battle system, dungeons, all is good. But optional mission is few. Anyway, The Legend of Zelda skyward sword is my one of best games.. The motion control gimmick works fine but its hardly a brilliant addon. Other than that, the game design of skyward sword is not innovative. Which is a problem already but in many ways I find the game design here to be a step backwards. TP and Windwaker were more open than Skyward Sword in many ways, and had better designed and less obnoxious tutorials. Some of the dungeons and bossfights are good but overall this is my least favorite zelda game by a mile.. This game has Groose. No other Zelda game has Groose. Thus Groose. Need more Groose.. I mean it's a tloz game so i don't have to explain anything just play it.... The Story is reale nice its The best wii Game Ever The movement is reale Nice. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is just a masterpiece. There is nothing else that needs to be said.. Skyward Sword is a great game. Despite the controversy, I really enjoyed the gameplay with the motion controls. They were working incredibly well. As for the story, it's one of the best in the series and the first on the timeline. The world is amazing with ineresting characters,very greatly desinged dungeons and a lot of secrets to uncover. It's one of the best games on Wii for sure.. Genuinely an atrocious Zelda game, an embarrassment to the franchise. This game is defined by the word boring. The repeated sections and the uninspired dungeons drag on for the entire experience. For each interesting or compelling moment/enemy encounter there are at least 5 which are boring. And Fi, just the worst!!!!!!! The only positive thing to say about FI is that she made me appreciate tattle more in ocarina of time. Comparing the two would be like comparing the heat of a hot stove vs the sun. The characters here are lifeless (except for groose) your bird companion feels like a glorified vehicle, and your sword won't ever shut up, it's exhausting. Like I said however there are some real highlights here, including the Buddhist inspire ancient cistern and its boss, the pirate ship that switches from the past to the future, and Girahim. But these good ideas don't make up for the pacing and the rest of the problems. Underneath these problems there rests a good game, but **** is more fun to think about and remember then to play that's when there's an issue. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of Zelda's greatest masterpieces with a captivating and gripping story, telling a story of various characters including our beloved Master Sword an amazing game no matter where, in the sky, in time, between the shadows of twilight, or even between worlds and oceans. .. The sword is always linked to the Hero's soul. The best story driven game of the saga with endearing characters, delightful music and beautiful visuals. Simply put, this is the best Zelda game and one of the best games of all time: the dungeons are all masterfully crafted and incredible to complete, the boss fights are epic, the orchestral soundtrack is enchanting, the art style is easy on the eyes and helps make up for the wii's lack of power, and the story is the most interesting Zelda story to date with high stakes and lovable characters. Play this game!. Skyward Sword is the Wii game people have been dreaming about ever since the console was announced. The use of motion control is intuitive and interesting, and makes this one of the most unique and legitimately groundbreaking (if not, THE most) Game of the Year candidate of 2011. It's another wonderful entry in a legendary franchise with some actual challenge on the table as well.. It's almost impossible to believe this game came from the same studio as Breath of the Wild, and the older Zelda games. It's the absolute opposite in terms of quality and breadth of content. All this talk about how Skyward Sword HD fixes everything and makes it a truly amazing game is mind-blowing, almost as much as this game getting good critical reviews even on the original version! - Yes, the motion controls are terrible. I played maybe half way through the game with them before switching to a pro controller. There's a novelty to them, a small spark of joy from mimicking the action in the game, that quickly wears off after doing the same action 2 or 3 times. The sheer unwieldy inaccuracy of them is such a slight against every minute of gameplay it's crazy to think they thought this is how they should ship the game. The fervor around motion controls must have been so high during this time in the studio. - The motion controls are only a small fraction of the problems this game has though. And the alternate controls, while better, are still clunky enough to put them below any of the other games in the series. - Backtracking, padding, and repetition. Backtracking, padding, and repetition. Backtracking. Padding. Repetition. AHHHH! There are three small zones to explore in the entire game basically. And you explore not once, not twice, not three times, but four times! At least! They shuffle some rocks around and say, ""Hey! Doesn't this feel like a whole new area?"" No. No it doesn't. You fight the same main boss at least three times, in the same arena, only getting another annoying gimmick each time. And spinning your stick around to perform an action is cute the first 5 times. But it just makes every movement through the world tedious after 20 hours. - The **** underwater stuff, especially the tadpole minigame, is just the valley of bad game design. Everyone has always hated underwater levels, so they decided to make one of the biggest most tedious ones possible for their game. Why? This whole experience has made me wonder if reviewers actually played through the game, or just wrote a review based on what they thought fans wanted hear about a Zelda title. I'm just dumbfounded.. You can tell the old legends of Nintendo no longer input into these games.... ocarina of times gameplay and control mechanic (and every thing else) is so much better. Consistently interrupted by f'king everything wanting to talk to you and you cant skip.... ever. Controls are pretty shjtty, when fighting difficult enemies the control from the wiimote is good but not good enough... plus it recalibrated every time you use an item (slingshot etc) so if you pull up your slingshot while aiming the mote and the ground it will be centre on the screen meaning you never have a defined centre instead itas always recalibrated messing up your orientation, a 64 controller is superior in every way... though the kids that dont know any different will refute this.... cuz kids. It Zelda and I love it.... it just does not live up to the standard set on the 64's Ocarina of Time or even Majora's Mask. The old boys have left the building and as everything in the last 20 years... quality of everything has dropped a hell of a lot.... and this/nintendo didnt escape the quality drop.. No left-handed support in a game where the main character always was a lefty.. A LEGENDARY game for me, I played it wen I was 9 but didn't completed it. This summer I got my Wii and i almost cummed. One of the best games of its times.. Skyward sword could potentially be a solid game. Unfortunately, it is often held back from the wii motion controls, which sometimes are not responsive to your actions.. This came when Nintendo had started not to be really serious with their major releases for domestic consoles (as opposed to only for the handhelds). The GameCube age, an age where Nintendo tried to be very serious as they had with the N64 before that, taught Nintendo a stern lesson about the dangers in, let me repeat myself, being serious versus lowering their target and aiming at the mass of players. The Wii generation is where they enacted what they had been taught by ""the market"". They did it with Super Mario Galaxy, with the Mario Kart series' instalment, and they did it with Zelda. Firmly lowered the... requirements to play, and I am not talking of hardware requirements. After the misunderstood masterwork Twilight Princess, Zelda has luckily gone back to its identity and spirit with its Switch instalment. Those two games are where I suggest to you to begin if you want to approach the series. Then would come the two very good ones for the Nintendo 64. Then the 2D ones. Skyward Sword being the single one to studiously stand clear of, ever.. This game is good, not great. Pros and cons from top to bottom: #1. Con: The world design **** - I expect something reasonably open-world from Zelda, but this is more like a hub with three mega-dungeons tacked on. Link finally gets to **** long as he stays in his closed-in cloud land and only enters the ""regular"" overworld from above. #2. Con: The story forces you down a linear path with a load of backtracking. In one open lake area, I was forced to do four different things in **** to the wrong area at the wrong time and you'll just be sent away. Sad! #3. Pro: The motion-control sword battling is pretty great. Some consider it too puzzle-y, I thought it was fun and this is the closest thing you'll find to a full-fledged motion controlled swashbuckling adventure on the Wii. #4. Pro: Possibly the best soundtrack in the series. #5. Con: The swordless scavenger hunting sequences with one-hit deaths are a pain in the rear. #6. Con: I hate the sidekick, Fi. Worse than Navi, for real. #7. Small Pro: the story is pretty entertaining, albeit with some weirdo characters in the mix. Replay value: The game lasted about 80 hours for me, maybe more like 65 for most folks...I doubt I""ll ever replay this game, it's too big and too mediocre, I could see myself playing the first 10-20 hours again. Dollar value: I'd pay around $40 Canadian for this game.. This game ****. In 2011 this game was not good, but now it's really not good. The motion controls are gimmicky and when the game isn't holding your hand it's super cryptic. I hate this game. Critics compared this game to metroidvanias, this is nothing like a metroidvania. this game makes you revist locations over and over agiain because the devs were lazy.. Awesome game when it comes to the main story. Could've had a bit more side content.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is for you if you: - Love a good story - Love beautiful art directions - Love epic music - Love Zelda games - Love video games - Love fun. An amazing game, with an epic soundtrack, great graphics, and amazingly accurate motion controls, this game is a must play for anyone who wants to get into the franchise.. Sometimes I feel like this game is actively trying to get you to stop playing. The opening lasts literally hours, the overworlds are the most linear in Zelda history, the dungeons, while sometimes clever, give you the answers to all the puzzles written on signs. The main companion, Fi, constantly jumps out to either tell you information you just saw in a cutscene, or information that was just told to you by another character. When she's not doing this, she's telling you that your hearts are low, your batteries in your remote are low, to take a break, or to use the dowsing feature again. Items will remind you what they are each time you reboot the game, the motion controls can be unresponsive, and the entirety of your adventure spans 3 bland locales that you have to revisit twice each. I found playing this game to be more of a chore than anything.. This game is amazing and epic. One of my favourites games of the Zelda series and chronology. The beggining of Link's journey.. Skyward Sword is not just a game, but an experience. The crown jewel of the Zelda series, a mixture of creative dungeons, intuitive gameplay, and hilarious characters, this game gives us a story that is unforgettable. The age features a beautiful soundtrack, with an art style that immerses you in the world, which flashes the power of the Wii without trying to do too much. A must-play for anyone who owns a Wii.. This game has a few flaws, such as some repetitiveness in revisiting areas and the high frequency of motion controls, but overall the game is still amazing. It's soundtrack is outstanding. So too is its story. The game has good dungeons and some very good bosses, albeit some weak ones. The environments also have a good amount of variety, whilst there are only 4 main areas each one has their own smaller divided areas involving something interesting. The art style is also really nice. Overall I'd give this game around 9.6/10 which rounds up to 10/10. I had a ton of fun playing this game and I'm looking forward to the HD version.. I am giving this game a 10 to counteract the person who gave it a 0 out of 10 in the hopes of counteracting the good reviews. I actually think this is like an 8? But yeah thanks.. The Moderate Relevance of Zelda Skyward Sword is a boring game. Certainly not worth buying with current prices or re-buying on Switch. The game is designed for the creators' idea of what an emotionally fragile person is. You are constantly led by the nose constantly given opportunities to save. Enemies are slow and infrequent. The difficulty slowly and nonchalantly inches up whenever it feels like it, never making any daring jumps. The motion controls are the least of this game's problems. Take them out, and it's still a **** game that doesn't want to be played- it just wants you to be done with it so it can be relieved of its duty.. I remember a small but loud group of hater trashing this game at release cause the poor chubos had to wave their arms a bit, but clearly the majority of sensible people could see this games greatness. Skyward Sword is up there with the best Zeldas IMO. I loved the controls , loved the combat , puzzles everything.. It felt like Zelda..Only issue I had was the outdated visuals , but it the Wii , everything looks outdated.. I wouldn't have enjoyed this game if it hadn't been my first Zelda title. I enjoy it but the controls are extremely flawed, The story is slightly tedious but will keep you playing.. Best zelda game ever, its a strange mix of wii sports resort, metroid, chibi robo, animal crossing and classic zelda.. I found Skyward Sword to be a very satisfactory Wii game, as well as one of the better Zelda games that I have enjoyed playing. The controls is, of course, the most immediately recognizable difference to past 3D Zelda games, and also the most divisive. They are very heavily reliant on the Wii MotionPlus motion controls, introduced in later Wii controllers, which means that everything from sword swings to bird flying is controlled with your very own wrists. This method of control takes some getting used to, and I would argue that it thereby contributes to the game's slow start, but ultimately, the dynamicity of motion grants a new edge to combat and traversal, previously unseen in the Zelda series. It's not perfect by any means (thrusting feels as awkward as it sounds), but I think they were right to commit to it fully, rather than have it in the backwater, like Twilight Princess. The game's graphics are absolutely stunning for the Wii, with impressive geometry, and a high level of polish. Even here there are imperfections, though: the mocap for the cutscenes can look unfittingly goofy, and I personally did not enjoy the paint-splatter effect that is used to mask low-poly models in the distance, but over-all, it's extremely impressive what the Zelda team managed to achieve on this lower-end console. UI design is solid, and i particularly appreciated the option of a less intrusive in-game interface, but for how good the menus were, I did not enjoy being booted to them every time I collected a material or bug in a new area. It's also probably worth to note that the in-game pointer is similarly controlled by Wii MotionPlus, which makes perfect sense, but may still throw off players used to the snappy Wii pointer in other games. The dungeon and world design is better than ever for the 3D Zelda series, in my opinion, with thoroughly explored mechanics, and neatly condensed areas. In contrast to many of the past games, the items gained in the game's dungeons are constantly used throughout the entire adventure, which means you'll have to get to know your entire arsenal to combat all the puzzles and foes that the game throws at you. This makes you really appreciate them more, especially with the addition of optional upgrades at the smithy in Skyloft. While on the subject of upgrades, I have to say that this game really nailed the sense of progression that many earlier titles lacked. You gather materials and bugs, buy and upgrade your gear, and increase your power at a good pace, while the challenges also get harder. Skyward Sword may be the only Zelda game where rupees, mostly, feel worth something, even trumping Breath of the Wild in this regard. There are plenty of shops and minigames to spend them at, and you have the ability to acquire a sizable wallet to store them in, so you don't have to watch a gold rupee go up in smoke. In the later part of the experience, you start noticing the presence of filler content. Areas and enemies are commonly reused, and you'll have to bear a few instances that add nothing except time. Luckily, most of the filler is still competently made and fun, but it is noticeable, and makes the game lose some of its steam at the end. The story is the usual, quite s","the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is, in my opinion, the worst Zelda game I have played so far . it's super linear, the gameplay gets sometimes really boring and the world building is horrible . despite this, the story is pretty good and the finale is definitely the highlight of the game ."
119.Mario Kart: Super Circuit,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Unsurprisingly this is my least favorite game in the Mario Kart franchise. I find it impossible to control on both original and newer hardware, it's close to impossible to 100% it, and the computers are unbelievable aggravating. This game has nothing good going for it but I understand how revolutionary it must have been at the time to have Mario Kart on the go.. the graphics are bad and by the time this was made mario kart 64 and mario kart double dash already existed for mario kart you need a joystick to move for the snes there was no analog stick but just put this on a different console with a joystick or just the ds for crying out loud.. This game is like Super Mario Kart but just a tiny bit better. This game thought that 2d Mario Kart games would still be good when they're so overrated. Critics also for some reason think that this game is better than FREAKING MARIO SUNSHINE. WHY? Art style is great though.. This game is hard, and I have nobody to play this with to distract from the pain of learning how to handle the Karts. It's not the game's fault, it's probably mine, but this was still a rough patch that I hit.. Very under rated title in the Mario Kart series, the gameplay is tight, the balancing is good, the tracks are awesome, and there are plenty of them! While many complain about the drifting not being perfect, that is because they are used to modern Mario Kart, don't let them weight this game down!. This game is very charming and all but I have to say that it is horribly frustrating. I have placed hours upon hours into the game and I struggle to get over how unfairthe game can be and many old mariokart issues that had not yet been fixed like have to reply tracks you lose in. because of that my opinion is horribly mixed but still sits at about a 5 or 6.. I found it kind of fun when I first played it but it’s aged kind of bad and you can beat it pretty fast I don’t know why it’s ranked so highly but I do like some things the controls are nice it’s nice to pass time and also nostalgic. I admittedly have a bit of nostalgia with Super Circuit, but I feel it hasn't aged well. The driving mechanics are a little awkward, though the gameplay is fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent game, I wouldn’t have thought I would be so addicting before getting my hands on it. These tracks will not be forgotten with great art and great music. And it all fits into the very palm of your hand.. i think this is the worst Mario Kart game but its not that bad for gameboy advance and its actualy a great way to play Mario Kart on the go. It is super mario kart in game boy advance. I don't think it was a good idea but it has its good things. A lot of fun but ultimately lacking in content. Clearly outpaced by its future iterations.. Mario Kart was never really designed to be a single player experience, but it's a fun little diversion that's well suited to the pick up and play sensibilites of a handheld.. While this is certainly one of the weaker Mario karts, it's still a banger. The game is beautiful and all it's 20 tracks are great. The character roster is small but it's a good one, though I wish it wasn't the same as super Mario kart's. My only real criticism is the fact that the controls aren't great. However, once you get use to them, they're fine.. Overall - 6.5/10 Difficulty - Upper Medium Platform - PC Replay Value - 7/10 Gameplay - 5/10 Hours Played - 15 hrs Extra Notes: I never played multiplayer so I only had singleplayer. It was still fun and surprisingly challenging.. With the passage of time, we cannot consider it as one of the best Mario Kart. It has good gameplay and tracks but with graphic errors that affect gameplay. Entertaining but until then.... Again, I bought two GBAs and shared with my whole dorm and they were crazy about them... I can still say that this game is okay, but this is the only Mario kart game I didn't have fun with. First, the controls of the GBA can be slippery as can be, making it hard to drift properly. Sure, there's great tracks like sky garden, cheese land, and ribbon road, but I like the remake version in Mario Kart 8 DX way more since the tracks in this game is just flat. They didn't change the character selections, and the battle mode just isn't fun. It's great that they brought all of the SNES tracks back into the game, but that's only the good things I can say about this game.. This game is... Pretty good. The handling is FAR better than Super Mario Kart, but I'm not too sure about Mario Kart 64. and that's basically all I have to say on this game. it's pretty fun, but pretty bland and generic and really doesn't deserve to be the highest rated Mario Kart game on metacritic.. i would give this a 23% It is just a bit lazy the graphic i know they can do better they have done better graphic before but they just decided to be lazy and they do not give you a lot of option. it is a colorful game but at times it can be irritating. Why the hell is this game the highest rated Mario kart on Metacritic? I don't like this game that much. This game impacted the series the least, had the least amount of replayability and was overall my least favorite until Mario Kart Tour released.. Simple controls. Fair AI. Good - the sharp turn signs really helps for first play throughs. I could pull off drifts without having to play through the map many times - when a shell comes after me, it hovers behind me for 2 seconds giving me a chance to counter it with a shell or star - tracks are really well designed. They feel fun. - CPUs are fair, and well made for the most part. - mini turbo was simple but effective. Bad - hard to see some boost stripes on ground. Loved this game as a kid still play it on my computer so much fun I love the tracks. While this can be considered the worst and most boring Mario Kart Game of them all, I still appreciate that (at the time) it was a portable version of Super Mario Kart/Mario Kart 64 which it kind of is since there's alot of retro tracks. overall the tracks are great along with the characters but the controls are a bit slippery.. Mario Kart Super Circuit is a solid translation of Mario Kart on GBA. The only real complaint I have is that the controls are a little too slippery, but once you get the hang of it, it's very fun. Just not the best Mario Kart game.. The courses are good, sure, and this being the first portable Mario Kart definitely is worth noting. But that doesn’t change the fact that the controls are way too hard to handle. That, and it seems like they tried using models from Mario Kart 64 on a platform that supports 16 bit gameplay, creating visuals that are just too hard to look at much of the time. I’m not going to bother reviewing MK Tour, it’s just too awful to even pay attention to, but from all the titles I did review, this is the 2nd worst, with a 4.16 out of 10.. **** a truly wonderful experience. Not only is it a fun Mario Kart with sharp controls (When you drift) and challenging gameplay, but it's also portable! Mario Kart Super Circuit feels right at home on the GBA, and has become one of my personal favorite games on any handheld. The tracks, while not all that diverse in terms of themes, have unique layouts, with each having little secrets and techniques to help you win. Some of my personal favorite tracks include Cheep Cheep Beach, Sky Garden, Riverside Park, Cheese Land, Ribbon Road, and Yoshi Desert. Speaking of tracks, this game has a whopping 40 tracks in all, a number that as of this review no Mario Kart title has topped. The game's characters each play differently, with lighter characters like Toad being able to easily take corners and accelerate quickly. Heavier characters like Bowser are slow to accelerate and are more slippery to control, but once they get going(especially Bowser), they REALLY get going. This game has great single player, but also a fun multiplayer mode as well. Link up to another GBA, and you've got **** battle mode! While it is a bummer that Battle mode cannot be played alone, that doesn't really detract from this game as a whole. In conclusion, I highly recommend anybody with a GBA to pick up this game immediately. You won't regret it.. How does this game have one of the highest scores of any Mario Kart game? This game did nothing to enhance the Mario Kart experience from Super Mario Kart on the SNES. There's only an equal amount of playable characters and they're not even as interesting as cult classics like D.K. Jr., and they also cut Koopa Troopa from the game, marking this as one of the only times the turtle has ever not been playable in Mario Kart. All the tracks look and feel the same, the controls are messy and annoying, and just like in Super Mario Kart the AI can rubberband thus making any progress you make short lived and frustrating to keep. This is also one of the glitchiest Mario Kart games out there. Overall, just a boring and/or frustrating experience, and a worthless entry into the Mario Kart subseries.. one of the best titles for GBA :) Played hours and hours, tournament after torunament with no sign of boredom. Great in every aspect :). This was my first GBA game, and boy is it fun! The tracks are creatively thought out with power-ups in well thought out spots. You can race as all your favorite Mario characters in free race and cup modes, which is like a tournament style mode, where placings net you points, and the one with the most points after four races wins the cup. I like this iteration a lot better than the SNES Mario Kart, and I think this game is simple yet zany racing fun that is accessible to anyone with an interest.. This game would bump up a whole 2 or maybe 3 points if the drifting wasn't the most uncontrollable thing on the planet. It's like every time i touch the steering wheel i fall off, Jesus Christ! Other than that, the tracks are kind of at their most boring in my opinion. Sure, it has upsides. I think for a GBA the graphics are pretty decent. But this whole game is like driving on slippery ice!. How is this games reviews so good? This is literally the worst Mario Kart I have played, and I have played all of them except for Double Dash. Easily has the worst controls. It introduced random into the character selection menu (which otherwise is the exact same as MK64s) so it gets a 2 for that, and Ribbon Road & Cheese Land are pretty cool.. **** game is great, it’s MARIO KART, but why does Metacritic call it the BEST Mario kart game?! Still very good though. The final Mario kart that is SKILL based.. Hey, all! Scott here, and this game having the best score out of every other Mario Kart game is an absolute felony!. Mario Kart: Super Circuit is better than it has any right to be. While it can't produce the 3-D course geometry of its predecessor, it stands as a far stronger vision of 2-D, flat-plane kart racing than the first game in the series. There's a good variety of tracks, including some unlockable courses, and a good soundtrack. The visuals don't hold up so well, especially when played on a large screen via Wii U or emulation, but this is still a solid first handheld outing for Mario and friends.. If you ignore the fact that everything is flat, Mario Kart Super Circuit enhances the SNES version and includes all its tracks as an unlockable, to make that entire game obsolete. Still a fun, portable game.. A great game that you should try out, Heck I still have fun with this game today.. Surely the worst Mario Kart game by today's standards. Graphics are bad, controls are even worse than original, and it hasn't aged well, despite original is so old. Looks decent, but it isn't.. This is a fun game with some unique track themes and good music for the GBA, it has a plethora of issues. The controls, while better than Super Mario Kart, aren't very good, the item distribution is unbalanced, and the rubber banding has returned from Mario Kart 64. And the biggest problem, this game copies nearly everything from Mario Kart 64, and that includes items. There's barely any originality in these aspects. But despite this, Mario Kart: Super Circuit is still a decent game. Definitely try it out if you want a game to play on the Game Boy Advance.. What an addictive game during my childhood! The music is very catchy. Nostalgia has brought me once again into this state of excitement and awe considering this is my very first Mario game experience in my younger self days on some 12 years ago. Although the graphics design looks raw and is not one of the company's best efforts that made them very popular during those days but still this hasn't stop me from finishing this awesome game! The game belongs to the list of those predecessor installments that to this day has contributed vastly to the Mario games' recent popularity and fortune within this generation. Rating: 4.5/5 -> 9/10 stars. I would say this is the worst Mario Kart ever produced. Its just so bad I can't even play it due to it being bad.. 9.0 - Created the basic structure for multiple Mario Karts, including Mario Kart DS. Kept the classic style that was on the 64 and improved the graphics drastically, as well as made its own style of tracks with soundtrack that is now iconic.. This is a pretty rough game. The controls are not nearly as precise as other entries in the series, which can ruin a racing game with just that. Visually it's not bad for the GBA, but it's frustrating to play.. This game is a combination of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64. It has the same general gameplay and track design of the original game, but the character models, sounds, and items are reminiscent of the N64 game. I like the soundtrack, contrary to what others say about it. The tracks, while flat like on the SNES, are fun to race on. Coins also make a return from the SNES. There is local multiplayer with one cartridge, 40 tracks, and a lot of challenge. You're getting the full package with this one.. The game does lack variety and the courses are generic and standard mario kart tracks but everything else ranges from okay to good but this game isn't memorable.. I need more! I cant get enough of Mario Kart Super Circuit. The best game of the series. I love every course, aside from some of the poorly designed SNES tracks. The controls are difficult to master, but very smooth and responsive. I love this game miles ahead of any other Mario Kart.. This is the closest Mario Kart game you'll ever get to the Game Boy Advance. To these people who hate on this game, please don't because there won't be any more games like this on your Game Boy Advance. With Super Circuit, it remains being the best Mario Kart game on a classical handheld.. I actually think this game has the best graphics as a GBA game, and I really like the tracks, like Rainbow Road, Ribbon Road, Cheese Land, and Sunset Wilds. I honestly think this game is great, even though it's 15 years old.. Unlike what some others believe, Mario Kart Super Circuit is actually really fun and enjoyable. If you differ, that's entirely OK, but I say it's great! ;). It's not the best Mario Kart game IMO but it is one of my favourite Game Boy Advance Games I've ever played. The Graphics are great for the GBA. The courses are awesome especially Snow Land. Boo Lake and Riverside Park are okay but a 10/10 for the design and visuals, and I hope to see in the next Mario Kart 8 DLC. The character selection is the same from Mario Kart 64 which is okay. The controls are good. Mario Kart Super Circuit is not the best Mario Kart game but you should definitely get it soon because it's worth playing and adding to your collection and if you hate MKSC or any other MK Game, you're BEYOND silly as JB.. There is absolutely nothing good about this stupid game. The tracks are lame, the controls are messy and very hard to control, characters have nothing special because they **** and the music is simply horrible. Overall this game is a monstrosity to the gameboy and not even worth a rent.. Am I playing the same game as everyone else? I am? Why's this so overrated? It feels clunky, the sounds are weird, handling is awkward, what's so amazing about this??? Easily the worst game in the series. People are giving this trash TENS. I gave this game extra points because it's a Mario Kart game.. My least favourite Mario Kart besides the SNES. But it's an okay game. The graphics are fine. The quality is horrible. The character selection is the same as the N64. The tracks are good but flat. Mario Kart Super Circuit isn't ""that"" good but it is worth getting to add to your Mario Kart collection.. I mean, there are good courses... to remake on newer consoles.... The game's controls are slippery, and the graphics are horrible. The Game Boy Advance sets this game back far. Don't play it unless you're a hardcore Mario Kart fan.. Game: Mario Kart Super Circuit Genre: Racing Developer: Intelligent Systems/Nintendo System: Gameboy Advance (GBA) Total Score: 81/100 Value Score: 8.1/10 • Story: */10 • Characters: 9/10 • GamePlay: 8/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 6/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 7/10 • Replay Value: 9/10 • Player Value: 7/10 Pros +More characters than the original SNES version +Includes a whole new set of tracks along with the SNES version's tracks +Music has been remixed for the extra tracks +New modes such as Quick run which enables customization of races and vehicles and VS mode which allows multiplayer battles +Addition of backgrounds in race tracks adds a nice touch to the visuals Cons -Extra tracks missing obstacles makes it seem like it was a rushed idea and very empty in design -Due to the GBA sound card, most of the sounds seem a bit off and sometimes some voices do not work at all or some sounds do not work. -The lack of the feather ability makes some of the extra track shortcuts seem useless. This is a pretty enjoyable entry for the series, it sports some nice graphics for the GBA. The control takes some time to get used to, but it's pretty good when you do. The tracks are fun and there are some great ideas. It's a barrel full of fun and while it is one of the hardest Mario Kart games, it's definitely a great one.. Maybe I just need to get used to the controls, but I found Super Circuit to be probably the worst game in the entire Mario Kart series and it seriously shocks me to see that this game got the highest score on Metacritic out of all the Mario Kart games. I mean the game is not bad, but it just fell flat for me and it kind just feels a bit dated for it's type of game. Pros: -Atmosphere and character selection is fine. -The graphics are done well...well probably about as well as the GBA can handle. -Item selection is fine, the **** bad. -I like that they brought the courses from the original Super Mario Kart. Cons: -Steering controls felt gimmicky which was bad for the loads of sharp turns this game had. -When you had no coins, there would be this annoying and repetitive beeping noise. -There is a delay when you run into a banana peel or a hazard like that where you would just shake a bit continue a little and then spin around out of control which is STUPID! -Like MK64, the Time Trails are very strict on how you can save the ghosts, like on Boo Lake if you bump into just one small edge of the stage it will immediately prevent you from saving the Ghost. -I didn't like Luigi's voice or his winning pose (I know, very nit-picky of me) -Also Nit-Picky but seriously, another giant Cheep-Cheep floating over the celebration stage. I am so glad they too that stupid thing out of Double-Dash and Mario Kart games beyond that. -Credits are un-skip-able, which is annoying, especially when the credit music is crap when compared to MK64's amazing credit music. Overall, This is a Mario Kart i'd probably would say to skip unless you find it for a great deal.. This is the worst of the Mario Kart Games. The graphics ****, it's so hard to steer, and I hate that there's a limited number of retries for the Grand Prix.. For that time, it was the best racer on the GBA for sure and was hell fun. It was not easy to get the best ranking on all cups and the tracks were good and short, so doing a cup on the go was ok. However the controls were hard to handle and you need time to learn them, so there is a learning curve and beginners should have got a hard time. But the amount of what you can do was really surprising!. Such an underrated game, It has some of the best courses in Mario Kart history and it has 40 different courses. With that many courses you can play this game for hours.. I really LOVE this game. I played this game every single day and never got tired of it. Mario Kart Super Circuit is just an amazing game. Score: 4/5.. Mario Kart Super Circuit feels like a buggy mess and it goes on for 10 cups making it by far the longest and (at least in my opinion) worst Mario Kart game.. While it is like the original, the original has not aged the best. The controls are floaty, but it is Mario kart, but only a decent one. The tracks are good but not great, in fact everything about this is only okay.. Even after Mario Kart 7, MKSC still has a lot of extreme fun. It has 40 tracks, more than any other game in the series. What's not to like in a racing game this good?. This game gives you 200%: 100% is a game of its own, with its 20 original courses, the other 100% is a remake of Super Mario Kart; fantastic and a timeless game that has high replay value. Mario Kart Super Circuit is truly a redefining game on the GBA. Pros: Fantastic graphics for the GBA; lots of characters, tracks, and options; lots of single-player and multiplayer value. Cons: The controls are a tad bit tough to adapt to.. I was surprised at how much this is like Mario Kart 64, what with the position of the camera. Featuring decent graphics and a boatload of courses, this one will keep you on the road.. It's ""almost"" all the fun of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 right on your GBA. Pros: Excellent visuals and control; some of the best graphics on a GBA ever; single-player and multi-player mode are a blast; variety of characters and tracks. Cons: It can feel a bit repetitious, especially if it's the only GBA game you have.",unsurprisingly this is my least favorite game in the Mario Kart franchise . i find it impossible to control on both original and newer hardware . this game is like super mario kart but just a tiny bit better .
12.Grand Theft Auto III,"The best part of this game is you can complete missions in different ways. Something you rarely can do in later titles. Otherwise, this game aged like milk. To be honest, I'm not even a huge fan of GTA 5 or the modern GTA games although I did have some fun playing them. However, this game is many of the bad parts of GTA condensed. I remember people thought it was cool to play a criminal back in the day but I felt like I lost IQ points after completing this game. This game just leans into it's horrible game mechanics instead of trying to hide them or fix them. No wonder most people just use cheat codes and go on rampages. It's the way to have fun with this game.. GTA 3 was a genre changing game, that showed Rockstar was the best in its craft.. THIS GAME IS BROKEN!! This game is sp far beyond modern day standards that it makes it at times unplayable, but just like Vice City and San Andreas, this game has a level of Video game randomness and funniness to keep it relevent today.. This game awesome and one my childhood game and recommend get it in store and good day. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rockstar North's masterpiece is a PS2 classic. It's a revolutionary open-world action that spawned imitators. Released in the early 2000's, the game pushed the boundaries of adult gaming. You could say it was the video game equivalent of ""The Sopranos"". Overall, it's a 9.6 out of 10.. I remember watching my best friend play this game when it came out and being mesmerized with how badass and innovative it was. Taking control of a character who commits crimes for the mafia and other gangs… and you’re the protagonist? Blew my mind. Playing this game now… it was nostalgic for me. However, I realized quickly that GTA III probably ranks at the bottom of the series (not including GTA I or II). The graphics are very block-ish with some rendering issues that show throughout the game where textures struggle to blend in time with the frame rate. The controls are also something that, while you can understand over time and grasp quickly, they could be much better. Here are my bigger gripes with this game. One, Claude can’t swim? So any time you may accidentally drive into the water or mistime a jump, you’re dead. Which brings me to the second flaw: if you die in a mission, you don’t get to retry that mission. No. You wake up at the hospital (or police station, if you’re arrested), and you need to backtrack to the source of the mission and do it all over again. I found this to be very time-consuming, and I’m so glad they fixed this in upcoming games. Overall, this game can be fun - whether you want to play the story or cause mayhem for the thrill of it. I think GTA III is a really good game, but not as great as I remembered it being as a kid.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a must play, hands down original og.openworld GTA ****'s simple, yet sophisticated.. my first GTA, a classic, a banger, I love it!I miss this generation!The hardness of the missions, the incredible story, a crazy open world!. This game was an industry changer!! In 2024, I don't understand why this game is shaded when compared to Vice City & San Andreas. Even with a silent main antagonist, it takes zero away from this experience. Skip the ""definitive edition"" version. This original version just has a certain character when played in its original form. The ONLY knock that I'd give, are certain ""quality of life"" controls. Otherwise, don't short this game.. The first time I saw Grand Theft Auto III, I realized two things: One, I absolutely had to buy a Playstation 2 - just to play this game. Two, this game was unlike any I'd ever seen before, and was going to change everything (this turned out to be pretty accurate). While it hasn't aged that well, due to the improvements with how open-world games are made (framerates, draw distance, etc.), I'll rate this on how I considered this when it released, as I feel that's only fair. The open world of Liberty City and its different areas, each populated with both civilians and members of certain gangs or criminal organizations is a stroke of genius. It makes the world feel alive and reactive to your presence. If you're at odds with that gang, they open fire on you upon seeing you, and this can negatively affect your ability to complete missions if you have to travel through enemy territory. There are a lot of different ways of making money - driving taxis, completing jobs for criminals, and delivering emergency vehicles to the crane by the docks - and, while the only way to spend your money is on armor and firepower, back then it didn't really matter and was a lot of fun. (I mention this because with more recent iterations you can actually buy other items like clothing or vehicles). The voice actors list for this game include Joe Pantoliano and Michael Madsen, among others, and they actually did a great job portraying their respective roles. While the silent protagonist is meant to portray the player (you), this was later changed in sequels to give the character more agency in the story (more impact and so they would seem less like a doormat). The gameplay was decent for the time (but it did improve with every iteration), and despite some missions being more difficult than others, the entire game could be completed without the use of cheats if you actually put forth an effort. There are a number of games that have changed the landscape and, without a doubt, GTA III is one of them.. Very good, 4th best gta in my opinion .. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. I think I did the hard part. I finished GTA 3 on playstation 2. And while I was playing on the computer, I only completed the first missions of the game and left. So I finished the game for the first time. But man. This game is torture with a controller. It's also funny. Sometimes it made me laugh so hard. Positive aspects of the game; 1_) Being the first 3D GTA game. 2_) Increased diversity compared to the 2nd game. 3_) Music. 4_) Dark atmosphere. 5_) Driving is fun, but the physics engine is a bit problematic. 6_) Some characters are funny. Bad aspects of the game; 1_) As I said, the physics engine is a bit bad. 2_) It is difficult to aim with the controller. 3_) There are no pins on the map. 4_) Some missions are very cruel and unfair. This is what I have to say. If you are a patient person who loves difficult challenges. This game is for you.. It's a bit poor quality compared to today and there are bugs, but I rate it according to the old times, but it's still a good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. pretty good. Great game. The game that re-defined the open world genre. Grand Theft Auto III can show its age in many places. From the clunky controls to the simplistic story and the mute protagonist, it can be hard for as modern gamer to get invested in a game like GTAIII. But for me, there is just something about this game that I absolutely adore. Liberty City feels sleazy and dirty. The mission givers are all thoroughly entertaining, albeit a little shallow. The driving is zippy and fun. Fair warning, this game is very challenging and its mainly due to the clunky controls. But if you can look past all that, there is just so much groundwork laid in this game for future open world games that its legacy alone speaks for itself. One of my favorite games of all time and one of the most influential games to ever grace our presence. Official score- 9.5/10. Never beat this one but I’ve gotten damn close so I think I can give it MY proper rating. Vice City was my 1st played GTA but this one was soon after. This game was pivotal in revolutionizing sandbox games but it’s really not good even for its time. It’s clunky, the protagonist is silent for some reason, and the soundtrack doesn’t come close to VC or SA. I’ll beat it one day, don’t really want to. Haha. GTA 3 is the first open world game to do it correctly. It's a shame that this game still hasn't received a worthy remaster.. Worst game ever made, and It's by the idiots at Rockstar Games. I don't understand how any one could even give this garbage score at all. It's so bad a d such a garbage.. What can i say that has not been said a thousand times. Despite its obvious old age and crappy graphics, I have such good memories about it.. Inevitably a little simplistic and crude compared to the later incarnations and some of the missions are frustratingly difficult thanks to the combination of dodgy AI and vehicles that are far too fragile, but it was a game changer at the time and was the genesis of the modern sandbox game.. One of the most revolutionary games of all time. A groundbreaking masterpiece. Set the bar high for the rest of the gaming world. As much of a classic as it gets.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. This was my introduction to the GTA series. I enjoyed the story & characters. I also liked just driving around and reeking havoc on the civilians.. The best game for the PS2.Still fun to this day destroying cars with rpgs and causing chaos.. Building upon the openness of Driver 2, this game redefined what an openworld game could be. This game is one of the most important games in history. I can't call it a masterpiece because it is heavily flawed, but for importance to gaming alone, this deserves a 10/10.. Es un hermoso juego, lo he completado en PC y Android, ambas son buenas experiencias, pero cuando decidí completarlo en mi vieja PS2 fue aún más emocionante. El juego tiene esa baja resolución típica de un juego del 2000, pero muchas cosas como la dificultad, la estética oscura no hacen más que notarse aún más. La dificultad en sí, es un juego difícil, el GTA con la campaña más difícil, debido a sus misiones cronometradas y largas persecuciones, sin embargo, si se lo domina bien, es una experiencia más disfrutable que frustrante, que no es una dificultad del otro mundo. La selección musical es hermosa y contribuye a sentimientos de acción, emoción, pero también de tristeza y soledad, debido a la frialdad del protagonista. En definitiva, un clásico que todo jugador debería probar al menos una vez, debido a que aún con su envejecimiento, puede suponer un poco de reto, por su conducción torpe y simple, o el regreso a un GTA más simple, alejado de toda mecánica secundaria lo máximo posible, y centrado en ser un juego que trajera la revolución del mundo abierto a la industria. It is a beautiful game, I have completed it on PC and Android, both are good experiences, but when I decided to complete it on my old PS2, it was even more exciting. The game has that typical low resolution **** from 2000, but many things like the difficulty, the dark aesthetic, only stand out even more. The difficulty itself is a challenging game, the GTA with the hardest campaign, due to its timed missions and long chases. However, if you master it well, it is a more enjoyable experience than frustrating. It's not an otherworldly difficulty. The music selection is beautiful and contributes to feelings of action, excitement, but also sadness and loneliness, due to the coldness of the protagonist. In conclusion, it's a classic that every gamer should try at least once because even with its aging, it can still provide a bit of a challenge, whether it's the clunky and simplistic driving or the return to a simpler GTA, stripped of all secondary mechanics as much as possible, and focused on being a game that brought the open-world revolution to the industry.. no its not just good like its not just good as i thought that this game was supposed to be, i dont like the game as much as someone else does so i give this game this exact rating as it it showing here, i am not a pirate btw. GTA 3 was a groundbreaking achievement in gaming history that was so fresh. It blew everybody's mind back in the day.. ""Grand Theft Auto III"" revolutionized the video game industry with its introduction of the 3D open world. At the time of release, it was highly controversial since it allowed players to engage in all sorts of major criminal activities. Nevertheless, GTA III was a huge hit and has been named one of the greatest video games ever made by several critics. This is a satirical action-adventure influenced by Hollywood mob films. It's a tasteless guilty pleasure meant for a mature audience. Great wicked fun. Despite its flaws, this is the first GTA that set up the template for future entries and inspired countless of open-world games. I would rate it with a 9.6 out of 10.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 8. grandfather of open world games, truly amazing and has a charm to it that will never vanish. This game is awful. GTA3 is one of the most boring, unplayable games out there and it does not deserve the score it has. If the game was really a 10, it top GTA4 and GTA5 but it fails to put a dent in either of those games. Would not recommend. The original open world sandbox game. 21 years after it's release GTA III holds up and is just as playable today as it was then.. I am SO glad that this game (PS2 Version) is available on PS4! I enjoyed every bit of it, even with outdated controls. Gameplay, Challanges, everything. The case when the first real try is not a mess, but a huge hit. Truly the origin of the future best seller of the gaming world. once again this game has a cool premise and atmosphere, and bunch of other cool stuff, and the music/radio stations are one of my favorite things about the game.. but there's a inconsistent difficulty yet again, and also yet again it caused me to never beat this game.. I guess maybe the older a GTA game is, the harder it becomes... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My first game couldnt beat it cause i didnt have a memory card feels bad still a masterpiece. This game is a groundbreaking game in the gaming world. I remember my brain stopped the first time I played it. I don't remember any game I've played before that gave me so much freedom. And the graphics, oh my god, my eyes melted when I saw the graphics of GTA 3, which had spent my life with NES games until then. The game I begged my family to buy a ps2. Generally speaking, it is not the strongest game in the GTA series, but we have to accept that it is the game that started the legend. As I said, the graphics are very good for its time, the gameplay is also the same, even today I think it's still comfortably playable, the scenario is not very good, it's a classic revenge story, but because Claude is a total dull, he can't make us feel this feeling of revenge. Other than that, freedom, stealing cars, entering cheat codes, and attacking people are all as expected from a GTA game. I think it's a game that everyone should experience. The missions are generally pretty easy and short with a few exceptions. So I suggest you give it a try.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Groundbreaking game and decent storyline. Would definitely recommend for those who haven't played a GTA before. GTA 3 Is Actually A Really Fun Game And It Has Really Really R E A L L Y Good Graphics And Sound Quality. Good Game Overall, 10/10. Seriously fun. Finished the game for the first time (with no cheat codes!) in 2021. I loved the simple story and the variety of missions. Learning how to navigate the map by memory is really enjoyable and proves you don’t need an in game map / full navigation system. This game doesn’t try to be overly realistic and the result is pure fun. I wasn’t expecting to enjoy playing this game so much and I can’t quite put into words what makes it so good.. very good and fun game, especially the main characters voice acting. violence is very good too.. The game is so good, that other games feel outdated, what a big step for the game world. And the world was never the same again... That is what should be said whenever talking about GTA3.. One of the best PS2 games, besides being my 4th Favorite GTA, Bad Musics and Final Mission. In 2001 the game is mostly a masterpiece but I'm judging it now in this current date it didn't age that well but it's still okay although the movements are very Clancy and the camera and the shooting don't work smoothly the driving is also kinda bad the car lose control quickly and it explode quickly, the story is a joke but you play as silent character what do you expect, it can be fun for some reason it deserves a 5 it's a fine game.. The game that changed the open worlds Even with a mute character he has an incredible story for his time, with many things to do and fun missions gta iii is the game that everyone who played the first gta wanted for the saga. this is one of the games that moved this industry forward. Nostalgic game :))))))))))))))))) I want to go back to that time :))))))))))))))))))))) It was a revolutionary game of its time, and Rockstar owes it I love this game. Most innovative gameplay compared to GTA V. I've played a lots of GTA games including GTA Advance, GTA CTW, GTA VC, GTA SA, GTA 4, GTA 5, but I can guarantee GTA 3 is the best of them all.. Obviously, we need to take Metacritic's ""must plays"" with a grain of salt. I don't care about whether a game was influential, I care about whether it's enjoyable to play now. I played the game to 100%, I did everything. It was certainly fun overall, but I wouldn't recommend it to the average player. The game has aged, if you want to run around and wreck havoc, play GTA V. There is no reason to come back to III, unless you want to sit in your car and listen to Chatterbox FM. In that case, it's understandable.. Wow I cant say no more ! I love it , absolutely stunning, best game everrrrrrr!. Grand Theft Auto 3 will always be a classic that has flaws. Flaws that it’s predecessors fix. And yes Vice City and San Andres are better games, but there is just something about the simplicity of GTA 3. It’s one of if not the most innovative game of all time. One of the most influential games of my life. I love this game 10/10.. When I was younger GT3 blew my mind when it 1st came out. It was my 1st experience with the GTA franchise and the game was an amazing product for it's t's time. I still play it every once in awhile.. Grand Theft Auto III is the only 3D open world game that started it all and it’s a revolutionizing gamechanging masterpiece.. I know that this was one of the gtas and one of the most important games in the world, but unfortunately it has aged a lot, not only in the graphics that were a little out of date for the time, but also in the very slow and primitive gameplay. In addition, he is very difficult, seriously, he must be one of the most difficult gtas I have ever played, missions like ""bomb base 2"", ""expres 2 go"" and ""SAM"" are almost impossible and I couldn't finish this game without codes.. Story - 7/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics - 7/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Levels - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10. GTA iii was a revolucionary game, except, it didnt aged too well. The game has an ok story, the driving system is nice and the graphics were the best of 2001, Claude is a cool character even though he doesn't talk, makes him look cold. But, playing it in 2019 is a bit weird, the combat is very hard, and the car is very weak, still, a great game.. Having escaped from a prison transport Claude soon gets back into a life of crime and seeks revenge on the former girlfriend that betrayed and left him for dead. As a game Grand Theft Auto III certainly has its flaws’, including fairly poor controls as well as some horrendous difficulty spikes. At the time however the open world of Liberty City was simply astounding, never before had a game offered such a detailed playground full of so many activities to participate in. Nearly twenty years since it's release the influence of GTA III on gaming can still be felt.... This game established a genre, and for that it deserves a great amount of respect. What's more, it has held up reasonably well and is still fun to play today. That said, there are a few shortcomings that are worth noting. Often, these make the game a mixed bag. The world is a joy to explore, but the plot is meandering and unexciting. While the game features an all-star voice cast, the script doesn't afford them much of an opportunity to show off their skills. The in-game radio features an impressive amount of content, but the sound effects are oftentimes grating, with shouting pedestrians and engine groans often making for a cacophonous experience. The layout of the game's three islands is enormously memorable, but this may just be a side-effect of the lack of a map screen, meaning that players are forced to memorize the layout of Liberty City's various streets. The controls work quite well while driving, but the on-foot controls are a frustrating mess, particularly during combat. This game laid the foundation for what would come after, and for that it remains a giant. There is still a lot of fun to be had here, though it is located more in the random chaos that can come from toying with the game's dynamic systems than with the simplistic and uninspired missions. Give the game a shot. It's worth your time. Just tenure your expectations. Later games in the series would do much to refine the formula established here.. This GTA game is definitely better than GTA IV and this deserves a better user score than IV. The controls were really better than IV and the missions are much fun than IV and the characters are memorable just like San Andreas, V and Vice City. This game is amazing... The best part of the series, the atmosphere of real city. The main character is like a hipster, but in fact it is a very charismatic character.. Grand Theft Auto III is an extremely ambitious attempt to bring the series' ultraviolent mayhem to the 3D world for the first time. In 2001, no one yet had really tried making a game like it, with the exception of Driver, which was an intense chase game with less grandiose expectations for itself than GTA III. You play as the silent Claude, a recently escaped prisoner who ends up taking all sorts of dirty jobs around town. Even though Claude doesn't say anything or really have much of a personality (I suppose you get to choose what kind of person he is), the other characters in the game do. Most everyone you meet has a few screws loose and is up to no good. The darkly humorous exchanges you'll have with these characters adds to the atmosphere and style of the game. The main premise of GTA III is that you wander around a living, breathing world in which any car is free for you to take (though not necessarily with the blessing of the owner or police). There are no rules. There are a lot of different vehicles in the game, and they all drive differently as well. You can drive a blazing fast sports car or a dangerously heavy-duty fire truck (with which you can spray out fires, or just harass pedestrians with the hose). Almost everything is fun to drive, thanks to a solid physics engine. Your car will realistically spin out of control when a cop rams you, and when you're going fast, you FEEL it. Even if you're going for a relaxing drive across the incredibly immersive city, cruising is still fun thanks to the ability to listen to a variety of in-game radio stations. There's hip-hop, 80s pop, classical, and more, and a lot of the stations are straight-up infectious. Listening to talk shows or radio DJs is hilarious, due to the care Rockstar has put into the pervasive satire and dark comedy of this game. I found myself laughing a lot when I first started playing. The game does irreverence perfectly. GTA III has missions scattered around the city for you to find. Most of the missions involve driving around town, often killing rival mob members. While the third-person shooting mechanics are much more difficult and clunky than most first person shooters from this era, the ridiculous, over-the-top violence makes it tolerably satisfying. You can easily dispatch other characters into bloody corpses on the streets of Liberty City. If you lose all your health, you end up outside the Liberty City hospital - a nice touch. This game is full of little touches that improve immersion. While the game's missions are straightforward, there's a lot of freedom when it comes to approaching them. You may choose to kill a target with a grenade... but then there's the Uzi... or perhaps, just run him over a few times for good measure. The game gives you multiple options, and the missions are usually a lot of fun (especially when they involve explosives). The unfortunate aspect about the missions materializes when you fail them: you are forced to find the mission giver again, and go through the entire process. This starts to get annoying quickly, especially as many missions will have you driving all over town. The missions are hard enough that you will be going through a lot of retries to beat them, but luckily there are nearly always multiple missions to choose from. Another problem with the missions is that you frequently need to quickly get to locations that aren't on your map. A paint shop that disguises your car is extremely useful when the cops are on your tail, but where is that shop again? Leaving these locations unmarked makes these situations frustrating. The amazing thing about GTA III is the freedom. The tools it gives you to cause mayhem are varied, and you can get pretty creative with all the options. Sure, you can go to the gun shop and buy something, but you can also equip your car with a bomb. Maybe you feel like stealing a vehicle and throwing it into a trash compactor. The game continually reveals differing means of destruction, and then let's you use them as you like, even if you have no goal in mind. If you really feel like being a productive member of society, you can charge cab fare to take people to various locations or put out fires with a fire truck. This truly is an open-world video game. Besides your chaotic influence, computer-controlled cars will ram into each other, gang members will start shooting, and the game generally does a fantastic job of convincing you that it's real while making fun of the real world at the same time. Rockstar created a dense, smart, cool, and awe-inspiring world with Grand Theft Auto III, and it still shows today.. The game that MADE Rockstar into what they are today. It revolutionized the fantastic open world sandbox gameplay that Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64 did three years before this game came out. It also led to the GTA clone genre. The graphics and environment looked so mesmerizing back in 2001 but wow they didn't age well. I loved the radio stations Flashback 98.3 and Game FM. The sound was pretty good. Very impressive actors and actresses doing fantastic voice acting that would significantly improve as the series continued. The gameplay needs no description. It's so influential and mind-blowing. The story was fantastic. I did like Claude. He was strange yet captivating because he was silent and a criminal but he was also a messenger boy. Tommy Vercetti would blow Claude out of the water in Vice City the next year and so would Carl Johnson in San Andreas. I adored the vehicle missions, import garages, hidden packages and rampages. It suffers from many flaws: weak soundtrack, useless map, no map menu in pause menu, woeful frame-rate and slowdown and poor aiming controls. Every game that followed from this one would heavily improve and the flaws would be gone. A classic which paved the way for even better games up to GTA 5.. This game started the whole open world craze and the level of what you could do in this game at the time of release was crazy. Cheat codes most def bring the level of this game to super easy but at the same time super fun. After getting this pain-in-the-ass **** to start, the ass pain didn't stop. The resolution was garbage and alt-tabbing out of the game took forever. I installed the silent patch and some other gameplay fixing mods. Now the pain can stop. For now. The story: A guy named Claude gets shot by his girlfriend while robbing a bank. He's arrested but breaks out with his boy 8-Ball. Claude works up the ranks trying to make money and find Catalina. He works for the Mafia, the Yakuza, and others. He eventually finds Catalina and shoots her down out of her helicopter and Claude walks off with his new girl, Maria. The gameplay: Some clunky driving. Horrible driver AI since they crash into you constantly because they switch lanes with no warning. Bad Shooting. The game is heavily outdated. Most missions suffer because of this. It's either the driving or the Cartel mows you down with their M16 that will kill you in a literal second. The graphics and cinematics: The graphics in GTA 3 are meh. The game is 15 years old (holy ****) so the graphics aren't going to be that great. Even though, the game still looks good. If you get the resolution fix mod, the game looks less pixeled and you can experience the game PS2 style. The cinematics and cutscenes are alright. Although it feels really awkward when Claude walks into this guys house, he tells Claude what to do, and Claude just nods his head after doing so. Claude has no real interaction with characters, which makes them feel flat. Only in missions where two other characters interact, is where the dialogue writing shines. Soundtrack: Most of it was awful to me. I'm the type of guy that can listen to mostly anything, so that's a lot. I liked Game FM and Flashback. The Jamaican and classical music didn't fit the environment and got annoying. Even on stations, I liked, there were only 6 or so songs. So you're constantly hearing that one song that goes ""We're gon give this all that we gooot, keep on risin to the top!"" and it gets really annoying. Most of the time I actually just listen to Lazlow talk about stupid ****. The missions from hell: The last about 10-15 missions are so ball burstingly hard, I almost skipped this game and went to Vice City. -Donald Love's Missions - Liberator Save some old dude from Cartel. Sounds easy until they tear you apart with M16s. Donald's Mission - Waka-Gashira Wipeout Kill Kenji, a leader of the Yakuza gang (also the guy you worked for) to start a gang war between Yakuza and cartel. You can't leave your car (since it's a cartel car and your identity will be revealed if you leave) so if the car is on fire, it's over. They shoot at your car with M16's which will destroy it in seconds, while you must drive by ONE GUY and if you fail to hit him, it's over. Donalds Mission - A Drop in the Ocean. Pick up some packages that a plane drops, while each package gives you one star. There are 6 packages. The boat controls are clunky and the water feels really weird. And when you're driving to the paint n spray (THAT ISN'T MARKED ON THE MAP) you're getting rammed with FBI cars and SWAT trucks. Donald's Mission - Grand Theft Aero Guess what, that last mission didn't matter. It was just a decoy, lol. Drive to another island you've never seen before, then drive back to the other island and kill Cartel members armed with M16 that will kill you damn near instantly. They're hiding around tight corners and the **** aiming doesn't help. The rest of Donald's mission isn't bad, Akuza's is though. Akuza's mission - Bait You drive around the new island, leading Cartel death squads to a Yakuza hid out so they're killed. Yeah, except the Yakuza are garbage and you have to kill them yourself at the death squad, or else they get away. Akuza's mission - Espresso 2 Go! One of the hardest in the series, trust me I've played them all. You drive around THE WHOLE MAP in 7 minutes. AND THERE IS NO FULL M","the best part of this game is you can complete missions in different ways . the graphics are very block-ish with some rendering issues that show throughout the game . the controls are a bit clunky, but overall, the game is fun ."
120.Rock Band 3,"Rock Band was Solid, and Rock Band 2 was great. But Rock Band 3 is something else. The guys behind Harmonix really knew what they were doing when they were behind the computer on this masterpiece. With the introduction of the keyboard, a more family friendly marketing and style, amazing list of songs on disc and in store, and more to the franchise than any other game had to offer, Rock Band 3 just may be one of the greatest music rhythm games of all time. Guitar Hero may have came first, but Rock Band was always better in every way. And that is more than evident with this great game.. The most impressive aspect of Rock Band 3 is the degree to which it blurs the lines between videogames and playing instruments for real. The pro modes for drums, keyboard and guitar/bass (requiring the pricy Pro Guitar controller - essentially a real guitar you can plug into your console) really are just like playing the real deal, so if you want to get into things to such a level then the game is powerful enough to offer you that option. As a game, it excels also. There are a myriad of modes to work your way through, both single and multiplayer, including comprehensive practice modes for each instrument, and with over 4000 downloadable tracks to choose from there's enough content to last you a lifetime. I'm still playing it after almost three years, at least. Of course, the most fun to be had is with a group of friends all playing together in the same room, but the experience is only slightly less satisfying when held online with internet people. It's difficult to see how Harmonix could have improved upon Rock Band 3 in any way - it is the ultimate refinement of its genre. The game is so definitive that they've stopped making Rock Band games and are now making one based on Fantasia instead. The best music/rhythm videogame.. This game is truly the game for any rock, metal, prog, alternative, hell, this is the game for music fans in general. First off, the songlist. I think everyone was sold on Been Caught Stealing and Free Bird, but let me go a bit further. There's pop-rock(Paramore), alternative rock(Queens Of the Stone Age), classic metal(Dio), heavy metal(Avenged Sevenfold), emo rock(H.I.M and Slipknot) and classic rock(Jimi Hendrix) among so much more. And if you don't like any of them, buy Rock Band 1 and 2 which had superior setlists and export them. ...Wait, why does Hysteria freeze the game? And Countdown to Insanity? Ahem. So the game isn't short of flaws. World Tour has been unfortunately replaced by Road Challenges. Play several setlists well with special requirements such as getting perfect sections or keeping Overdrive going to score spades for Bronze, Silver and Gold... things. Medals? They don't look like 'em. This game could've used World Tour. REALLY. Another problem is the lack of game modes. As I said, Road Challenges are the main game mode, and Quickplay accompanies it, as you'd expect. But there's... nothing else. You just expand your fanbase by completing 'goals' and once in a while, unlock cutscenes. Unlocked the final cutscene where your band gets tired of it all and fakes their death? Break continuity by immediately playing H.I.M in Heebie Jeebies. Hell, once you've finished the cutscene path, you HAVE finished the game. This game is amazingly fun to play it just could've had more to do. Graphics 7.5 out of 10: Not anything special, really just RB2 with a bit more polish Sound 8.5 out of 10: RB1 was a 10 for this, RB2 a 9.5. Seems like they ran out of good songs halfway through making the game. Amy Winehouse? What? Controls 10 out of 10: The pinnacle of control revolutions. Like RB1 and 2. Y'know. Gameplay 10 out of 10: Amazingly fun. Replay Value 6 out of 10: ...until you've had enough for a day, that is. Overall: 8.8 out of 10. Rock Band 3 is very easily the best music game ever made. Why? The reasons are endless. The new keyboard controller, along with backing vocals, means up to 7 people can play at once. While the keyboard isn't always the centre of attention in most songs (sometimes only making a brief appearance), it is still a fun addition and can actually teach you to play keys. There is also the opportunity to invest in the pro guitar controller, which for the longest time has been the genre's biggest gripe. Why don't you play a real gui..WHAM! It is the next best thing to learn to play bar tutoring. There's thousands of songs to play (which is all fully exported from previous titles) which can range from pop to death metal, from the 50s to now. The range is simply unrivalled anywhere else. And combine that with a smart menu design meaning finding the songs you want isn't a chore, you got a game that is as close to making you feel like you're playing in a band as you can get. Whether you're playing alone, with friends, online or offline, real guitar or plastic controller, 4,000 songs or just the 83 on-disc, just know that you absolutely must buy and play it if you have even the slightest interest in music games, music or just gaming in general. The more you put into the game, the more you get out.. This is SO much better than Guitar Hero. These guys aren't soiling the series by releasing 5 games in one year. Plus, the music is fun to play, and this game really packs a punch. It's also easy to get addicted once you start playing. The songs are good, and so is the downloadable content. Even the venues and backgrounds seem realistic, and the graphics are pretty good, even though that's probably not why someone would play this game. Overall, great set lists (especially downloadable content), good graphics, and really fun. This game gets a 10 out of me.. This game is fun and great songs. You might want this game and get instruments. It is like a family game and the price is right. Also i wanted to see if i could get the rating to go up, but i meant everything i said.. Yet another great effort by the guys at Harmonix. While many would argue that the rhythm game market has slowly began to shrink, Harmonix are making a quiet riot (Spot the nod to a certain band?) and a lot of people are starting to take notice. I've been a big fan of Harmonix ever since Rock Band (the original) and an avid player. I personally feel that while Activision sold out with Guitar Hero, Harmonix kept it innovative and fresh. On with the review: Gameplay (7/10): Harmonix managed to make the singleplayer of Rock Band 3 better than that of Rock Band 2 and the original. They've trimmed the excess fat and made the game linear without cutting out any of the good parts. It plays well but once you've finished it, it struggles to keep you entertained. Graphics (8/10): The graphics for Rock Band games have always been cartoon-y, and in most games people would laugh it off, but the great part about Rock Band is that it doesn't take itself seriously, and for that reason the graphics are good enough to enjoy. They won't hurt your eyes while playing (Although some of the backgrounds have incredible levels of strobe lighting that can be very distracting), but all in all they are sufficient. Sound (10/10): This is the reason Rock Band excels in what it does: The quality of every instrument comes through in the tracks, and most of them have been recorded to such an efficient level that its like you're listening to an MP3 track rather than playing it through a game. There is no distortion or problem with any of the tracks, and they are crystal clear in their delivery. Simply amazing. Multiplayer (9/10): Increasingly, playing with other people has become the mainstay of Rock Band, and let's face it, why would you play on your own when you can jump online and complete any song you like, story-mode or quickplay, with up to three other players? It makes the whole experience feel more enjoyable and there's few things more gratifying than finishing a song and seeing your band manage 97%+ all on Expert. The Quickplay mode is surprisingly long-lasting and even now (Having the game for over a year) I still enjoy playing online with people across the globe. Lasting value (9/10): This game really does have so much to keep every type of player interested. Just want to sing I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones for a bit of nostalgia? Hit Easy mode with the No Fail Mode and wail to your heart's content. Feel like getting some practice in? There's plenty of tutorials for every single instrument to hone your skills and make you the player that you want to be. Just fancy making your character look like a proper rocker? Hundreds of clothing options are open to you to customise to your content. Or are you perhaps the kind of player who won't settle for second best, and wants to 100% every song on Expert? Hiscores for every instrument and every song with detailed tracking give you the choice. With constant unlocks to make the game fluently develop, a strong online fanbase and a constant flow of songs for the serious fan, Rock Band will drag you kicking and screaming back again and again. Any small flaws can be overlooked because - Take it from the guy who spent a long time getting to a proud 6th in the world on Stand For Something by Skindred once upon a time - this game is addictive with a capital A.. Rock Band 3 is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Harmonix did a fantastic job on this rhythm game. The song playlist is huge; most of my favorite metal bands were on the Rock Band Network. I frequently play this game with my friends instead of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. Overall a great music game; I really couldn't find that many things wrong with it.. Harmonix has done a great job. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the game does not remember your previous option settings. If you prefer full chord numbering or breakneck speed, you must reset those options every time you start the game. Pro guitar/bass is great. I am playing it with both the Mustang and the You Rock Guitar and am learning to play real songs! The training sessions are very well done and Harmonix continues to support the game with great weekly DLC.. The best music game ever made. Harmonix have proved that they can still make fantastic and engrossing music games. My only complaint with this game is that there are way too many songs from older generations. A teenager such as myself, only know about 9 out of the 83 songs. Which is pretty sad, I know. This game on a song list stand point doesn't appeal to teens as much as it did with Rock Band 1 & 2. I also don't like how they stole away the hole ""world tour"" mode. You don't feel a sense of progression in the mode. Regardless, it is still the best music game in my opinion. It's a lot of fun with tons of modes, customizations and instruments to use.. To be honest i haven't played or own this game yet but if its like and or better than the second Rock Band this one is something to put on your wish list for sure.. Ok Pro mode is the next great step in the music game genre. That said, the game itself is great in every standpoint, except the music list, I felt like the 83 tracks on this game were a little stale. Maybe 10 of the songs were anything i was remotely interested in playing, porting my old music over fixed that problem though. All the minor changes in my mind are what shines the most, dropping in dropping out mid song with no penalty, pausing rewinds the track a few seconds. not having to make money to buy clothes, the list goes on, its a fun experience right out of the box , none of this grinding through the story mode too unlock songs, all around i am enjoying this experience very much.. I was looking forward to this game and really wanted to like it. It doesn't even seem like it was made by the same people who developed RB1 and 2 and that's a huge disappointment. @ First of all, this game crashes a lot, not just for me but for quite possibly the majority of people. I play online a lot and I haven't run into anyone who hasn't crashed yet. There are two kinds of crashes. One is at a particular loading scene with roadies pushing crates. It will completely lock up your system and you'll be forced to power down. The other is the game closing itself randomly. One second you're navigating or playing and the next you're looking at your dashboard. I don't know if there are any plans to fix these bugs but I don't understand how the game was released in this state. This couldn't possibly have been a surprise to the developers. @ Secondly a lot of personality was taken from the game, especially in the way of characters. Character names are no longer seen online. They don't get introduced at the start of a session. You can't create an attitude for them anymore either. The animations look stiff to me. They also have a lot of bugs. @ Onto gameplay. RB3 doesn't have any real objective or direction like the previous titles did. World Tour is gone so now the 2 main modes are quickplay or challenges. The challenges were the worst, least played part of RB2 yet they decided to run with them. They tried to put a new face on the challenges by giving them a tourlike roadmap and instituting a spade system for doing well at each 'mission' but the whole thing is only 10 sections long. Also, you will find yourself sacrificing high scores in order to successfully complete a lot of them. This should have been a side gig next to World Tour, it feels like a lazy replacement. @ Competitive modes have been abolished. And for what reason? I have no idea. I think a lot of people were expecting an improvement in score duel, like normal note highways, but they completely got rid of it. At some point a meeting took place where they all decided it was a good idea to remove this classic feature. I'm still scratching my head. @ No fail can now be used throughout the game to finish songs, unlock achievements and post scores to the leaderboards. No fail is certainly great for parties and fine if you want to play through a song that you know you can't pass but that's where it should end. Rock Band 1 was the most successful of the series and there was plenty of failing. Most people think they want something for nothing but when they get it, the perceived value is low. Trying to beat a song is a powerful motivator to play more often. Killing incentive is not the answer to lagging sales. @ The music video modes are blinding. They come up often. Granted they may not affect everyone negatively but there are an awful lot of people complaining. There should be an option to avoid them and it's hard to believe this didn't occur to anyone during playtesting. @ The Endless Setlist. I don't know why they bothered to include it without World Tour. The point of World Tour was to unlock the Endless Setlist, get your icon and acheive ""Immortal Status."" But now you can play through the ESL right from Quickplay without unlocking it. You will not get an icon when you're done. Makes sense, I guess since you can play with no fail on and literally not have to do anything except for hit ""next song."" @ The setlist. A lot of people are going to say that's a subjective point. There are definitely a handful of incredible songs in this game. The rest? Let's just say that finding a 83 songs with good parts on guitar, bass, drums, vocals AND keyboards must have been an extremely difficult task and it shows. Better luck next time. @ That brings me to the keyboard. I'm mixed on this. A new instrument is fun. On the other hand, it's not so fun when you have a massive amount of DLC and only 80 songs have a part for you to play. Additionally, keyboard parts tend to have lots of dead space. They're often used as accents to songs. The Doors DLC is very good for keyboards, we'll see what else comes down the pipeline. â. This game was a HUGE letdown, i love the second and i gave it a 10/10 for its amazing set list and how realistic the tabs were. The only thing that is good about the third one is for how realistic its tabs are, and how many song are available for download. I bought the pro drums for 130 bucks and they would randomly fall apart, and hit notes aromatically without me even playing them. I sold them to gamestop and i got a new one, and i got the same problem. Right now i am heading to gamestop to get as much money as i can to get for this worthless game.. Rock Band 3 has one big selling point: the ability to play a guitar for real. Without it, it's really little more than Yet Another Rhythm Game. All of which makes the lack of pro guitars on release a bit mysterious. Several weeks till the semi-real Fender Mustang Pro, and unspecified months till the much-anticipated stringed Squier... The keytar is available already of course. Yes, the keytar. RB3 has apparently sold terribly badly considering all the hype. It's not too hard to see why: yet another rhythm game but with a really really hard pro mode that you can't even use fully yet, and is only usable if you fork out well over a hundred pounds? I suppose that might sell. I think what Harmonix have tried to do is amazing, if only because it's risky and experimental. If only the release of the game hadn't been so chaotic.. This is the music game that the genre has been waiting for and the possible savior that it needs. Taking the only good part of Guitar Hero (the drop in/drop out) and improving it, then adding keyboards, harnony vocals from The Beatles Rock Band and getting rid of that repetitive World Tour Mode you have the apex of rhythm gaming. I'm not going to mention Pro-Guitar although it's a very interesting idea because I have not played it myself. But even without it this game is a must have if you have any interest in this genre. I will say that Pro Keyboards while supremely difficult are quite well done and fun. This will be a stand out instrument once more DLC featuring this instrument is made available (such as the upcoming Billy Joel stuff). They have taken the challenges of Rock Band 2 and worked them into a very endearing set of challenges to make up a tour that should take you about a week. This mode is complete with videos that for the first time feel like they give your band members a personality. These are hysterical the first time you see them and you really start thinking of your characters as a real band. Not only that but everything you do even when you just mess around playing songs in the quickplay mode it counts towards your band progress and unlockable clothing. There were a lot of complaints about the setlist early on mostly because the bands for the 2000's were not really well known, but most of those songs grow on you if you give them a chance. That is the beauty of Harmonix games, they can turn you into fans of new bands and show you that there is more to music than your own jaded point of view. For example you do discover that Amy Winehouse despite her personal problems is talented at what she does or that Metric have a really great sound. I think that all the positive reviews from critics and players alike is proof that this is a great game. I know the genre has suffered from over exposure and the fact that in general a rhythm game is just trying to hit the right buttons to play the song the best you can. However, Harmonix have taken that as far as they could with this edition. There are a few things that could've been better, but they are minor and do not affect the fun such as when you have more than 5 or more players you still only see 4 on the screen or that in all instrument mode which is the mode that is required to have bass, guitar and keyboards on a song the vocals are not scored. But this game is about the fun and easy to use interface. If you have an open mind this game will make you happy.. Great Game, but still hase it's bad moments. Music selection is awesome, and the keyboard great, but the presentation isn't as good as Rock Band 2. I also dislike the camera changes and how they don't go very well together. Singing is great. Exporting Rock Band 2 songs is available, but **** because some songs aren't there. But it's just rock band, so I will have to give it a 9/10. While the music genre is arguable falling in the past year, Rock Band 3 has shown that it is still fun to play. The menu system has been given a fresh new look that is much easier to understand and navigate, and the fun of grabbing friends and family to play the tunes you love is still as strong and now easier to get to. The real disappointment is just how similar the game is to its predecessor, Rock Band 2. The gameplay and the visuals are the exact same, not to say that those are bad things though. There are two new additions, keyboard and pro mode. I did not have a chance to use the pro mode, but i did use the keyboard/keytar. It works, but the whammy/overdrive buttons are awkward to use. In all, this game is still fantastic, but its pretty much more of the same thing. But dont we all need more Rock Band?. What do you need to do to experience the newest experience in music games? Buy more expensive instruments (or at least add-ons). In a dying genre, how long do you expect these to last you? The keyboard is nice and works well, just granted that playing 20+ keys on a 5 color track may want you to go pro from the start. They did not release the ""real"" pro guitar on release day, holding off for 2011, but the other guitar is nice and MIDI capable, but still, it is a bit of a surprise the Harmonix held off the release of the squier, but that will be out soon enough. Overall, this game breathes new life into it, but still, with a dying music genre of today, this may the the first, and last game to use these features.. Flawless rhythm game. Interface is outstanding. Game runs smoothly. Adds keyboards and pro guitar ... if you're into that kind of thing. I'm a little disappointed that you must pay to transfer songs from Rock Band 2 (since I already have paid for that game) but so it goes. Not sure where Harmonix can go from here. This is the evolution of rhythm gaming.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. To be brief, this game is a masterpiece among the video game industry as well as the music. There is so much to do here, from diddling a keyboard on pro mode, confusing your hands on pro drums or just simply singing back-up for one of your friends. If this is were they end the series then they will be ending on a high note. ( Unlike some companies). Everyone has talked about how the rhythm gaming genre has been in slow decline for years, but fortunately no on at Harmonix took these claims seriously. Rock Band 3 innovates that game in nearly every way possible and includes nearly all features that fans have requested for years. The biggest innovations are the addition of keys and Pro Mode. Keys(a 2.5 octave midi keyboard that can be played sitting or as a keytar) adds the last traditional rock instrument to the mix. With keys and harmony vocals(as first seen in The Beatles Rock Band) you can now have up to 7 players simultaneously rocking out. Pro Mode is Harmonix's response to the ever present question, ""Why don't you just learn to play real instruments."" Playing Pro Mode on Expert, that is exactly what you're doing. You're playing the actual guitar, bass, drum, and keyboard parts. While not as flashy, the new song management system is crucial for Rock Band players with hundreds of songs in their collection. Also handy is the ability to save custom playlists. The song selection is a great mix of classic hits, new stuff, and deep cuts. The only cons I can see: 1. A few songs from RB1 and RB2 won't transfer into the RB3 library. 2. Gone are crowd-singalongs for RB3 on-disc songs. 3. To get the full Rock Band experience you need to spend a lot of money to get a pro guitar, keys, drum cymbals, and all the great DLC that is available. All in all this is a landmark game, and the pinnacle of the rhythm gaming genre.. Rock Band 3 is a shining example of innovation at work. While the competition has focused on incremental upgrades, Harmonix went all out with their newest game. There are an array of minor changes that can be expected in a sequel, but the true star of the show is the keyboard and pro modes. Keys add an exciting new instrument to the mix and are a blast to play. There are a handful of boring songs, but all in all, it is a refreshing addition to rhythm games. Pro mode turns Rock Band 3 into less of a videogame, and more of an instrument to learn how to perform real music. There are extensive tutorials that lay a strong foundation for anyone who is serious about learning to play for real. Due to hardware delays, I have not had a chance to play with the pro guitar, but I am very excited to get my hands on it in the future. I know that most people who play rhythm games are not interested in learning how to actually play music, but I must applaud Harmonix for having the boldness and bravery to go forth with the concept. Rock Band 3 transcends videogames and becomes something much more important. In twenty years, you will read an article in Rolling Stone about how a popular musician was inspired from playing Rock Band 3.. Well on the surface rockband 3 exhibits some pretty impressive features, which for me personally was a big selling point of this game . However the aspect of the game I found most disappointing was the fact it is simply the same as rockband 2. I can't help feel that I have been parted with my well earned cash for a large expansion pack. The keyboard is a welcomed edition but not something that has got me excited about the game.Also the career mode has been improved and on my play through I thoroughly enjoyed it but the setlist just isn't as expansive as past iterations of the series. Thank god you can import songs. The pro guitar in theory is a very good idea but for me I would prefer to buy a REAL guitar and get proper tuition. Overall I'm a little dissapointed with the game in that it's rockband 2 with a different box art. Guitar hero springs to mind unfortunately. If you are desperately seeking a new music game then perhaps this is for you but if not I would stick to rockband 2 and save your money for something with more substance.",rock band 3 is one of the greatest music rhythm games of all time . it blurs the lines between videogames and playing instruments for real . the game is so definitive that they've stopped making Rock Band games and are now making one based on Fantasia instead .
122.Viewtiful Joe,"One of those games much beloved by critics but I have trouble understanding why exactly. The platform element is simplistic, the fighting although smooth and accessible is little more than two button-bashing and the boss fights can be infuriating. Sounds good on paper but It's not much fun to play in reality. And that name is *awful*.. Possibly the best game ever made, but lord can it be difficult. If you’re a casual gamer, do not bother. If you’re a hardcore gamer looking for originality and a challenge, it does not get better than this. I have to give this a mixed review for me personally though because the difficultly subtracts far too much from the fun. The fact that there are grading systems means the difficulty did not have to be so insane to begin with.. Viewtiful Joe is a very demanding game at times that requires a lot of skill and known how about the game itself in order to fully be enjoyable. The combat system takes a lot of practice and some getting used to, but soon enough battling in fast forwards and slow motions feels more natural and even more satisfying when pulling them off. The game can still be somewhat tedious when you don't know exactly what to do or how to defeat an enemy quickly, but half the joy of the game is learning how to take down enemies fast and looking Viewtiful while doing it! Overall, Viewtiful Joe is a very refreshing experience that many gamers looking for a little more action in there life should look into.. ""Viewtiful Joe"" is a side-scrolling beat 'em up masterpiece. It ranks with ""Resident Evil 4"" and ""Killer 7"" as one of the must-own GameCube games from Capcom. The game's unique visual style is a blend of 2D and 3D. Gameplay is simple, but filled with plenty of various challenges. Fans of ""Bayonetta"" and ""Devil May Cry"" will love every minute of it. I wish a third installment would be made with the RE Engine. Overall, I would rate ""Joe"" with a 9.2 out of 10.. This game is amazing! Probably one of the best beat 'em ups I've ever played. The action, writing, characters, levels and even the graphics, everything is very over the top and exaggerated. But the best thing is that it just fits perfectly! The gameplay also helps this ""anime-feel"", since you really need to know what you're doing in order to get to the ending and it's just nice to pull a good tough combo or figure out how to defeat a boss. Also, there are some very good unlockables here! Few things annoyed me, though. This game is brutal and that's ok, but some parts felt like it was brutal for the sake of being brutal. That ""boss gauntlet"" is just bad design and what's up with the final episode? Everything in it is just repetitive and tedious. In my opinion, the devs got lazy after the fight with Leo. Other than that, GREAT game! Play it NOW!. Viewtiful Joe's core gameplay is similar to a traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, up, and down on a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge—which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies' attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack.[7] The player has certain number of hit points in the form of ""Life Marks"" located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage. Health can be restored by picking up hamburgers.[8]. f you have a gamecube, then there is no excuse not to own this game. This is by far one of the best game of that generation. Henshin A Go Go Baby! @ Capcom please bring a HD Port. Not since Jet Grind Radio has cel-shading melded so perfectly in this game's ""movie world"" environment. It's a comic book you can play and a great action flick peppered with humor and innovation. Viewtiful Joe redefines the side-scroller genre and gives future games. Top 10 game on the Gamecube! This game has beautiful graphics as well as Amazing controls. This is one of the funnest games of all time and it also shows that 2d side scrollers are not over yet!. This game is still in my top 5 favorite games all **** story, the action, the tight controls, the gorgeous environments and over the top feel all contribute to make this game an absolute must play!. A 2D scrolling beat 'em up Viewtiful Joe is absolutely fantastic when in full flow. Leaping around defeating enemies ranging from killer robots to missile firing helicopters utilising Joe's superhuman abilities is what gaming is all about. In fact the core gameplay is so good that its even worth putting up with the extreme difficulty spikes encountered when tackling one or two of the bosses. Unfortunately the final section of the game is totally ruined by the creators decision to bring back each of said bosses one after the other with no check points in between. To this day I have never completed the game as a result but I'm still glad I played it.. This game was okay pissed me of tho. It's really hard. C.. This is an original game but some of the controls were too complex to be fun. Many people will never complete this one as some of the later stages were hell. Repeated attempts and long breaks in gaming (years) will not have you wanting more Viewtiful Joe. Beat'em ups or button mashers should have more fun things to do and collect and leave you with pleasant memories. This is one case where the sound, attitude, and exploding cartoon graphics, main character's voice and higher difficulty made it very annoying and ultimately loses most of its replay appeal. This game wears on you. The character of viewtiful joe only runs through and kills people and there is no personal touch to this one. It starts out fun, but fastly becomes an annoyance to play like many B-grade Sega Genesis games of similar style (comix zone). **** does not motivate me to keep playing year after year I can't give it a score in the green zone. This one would best be a rental or a cheap purchase even though I did not experience any bugs and the graphics were nice. Its playable but not a classic.. A great beat em up. This one is still fun to go back and play through every once in a while. The time effects (speed up, speed down, etc.) are well implemented and provide a unique experience that you're not going to find in another game, as well as having stunning visual effects.. Viewtiful Joe blends console sidescrolling with 3-D visuals, making for one of the best games of 2003. Pros: Beautiful graphics elevate its immensely unique console sidescrolling gameplay; kick-ass special attacks; lots of unlockables. Cons: Some repetitive combat and boss battles.","""Viewtiful Joe"" is a side-scrolling beat 'em up masterpiece . it ranks with ""Resident Evil 4"" and ""Killer 7"" as must-own GameCube games from Capcom . gameplay is simple, but filled with plenty of various challenges ."
123.Hades,"very cool roguelike, that might have rekindled the genre. cool interactions with the characters and awesome soundtrack.. Sassy dialogues with the gods, fast-paced hack and slash, beautiful otherworldly art. Hades lets the player explore the many layers of hell via Zagreus, the son of the Greek God of Death. Godly powers, relationship building with quirky characters, and magnificent visuals make this roguelite a truly enjoyable experience. Love the little variations in each run, they make it truly deep and never boring!!. Hades is definitely one of those games that's hard to put down. With its fast-paced combat, rich story, and the allure of trying to escape the underworld, it keeps players coming back for more. The roguelike mechanics, where each run offers something new (whether it's power-ups, enemies, or dialogue), make it incredibly replayable. Plus, the characters and their development make you want to see how the story unfolds as you progress. The way it mixes challenge and narrative is a big part of what makes it so ""addictive."". This game excels in many areas, starting with its stunning visuals. The art style is captivating, making every moment a feast for the eyes. Gameplay is another standout feature. The sheer variety of tools at the player’s disposal is impressive, and everything feels well-balanced. There are countless wacky builds to experiment with, and while some are more effective than others, none feel outright bad based on my experience. The boss fights are, for the most part, both enjoyable and challenging, adding to the thrill. The soundtrack is another highlight, complementing the gameplay perfectly. As a rogue-lite, the game also offers immense replay value, keeping players coming back for more. However, not everything about the game is perfect. My biggest gripe is with Elysium. Everything about this section is infuriating—the weapon-wielding enemies you have to kill twice, the suicide bomber carts, the massive carts that relentlessly chase you, and especially Theseus. If Elysium were removed entirely, the game would instantly be 25% better. On a lighter note, Asterius could really stand to take corners less sharply when charging. Another drawback is how the game feels when played with a mouse and keyboard. While it’s definitely playable this way, I’d strongly recommend using a controller for a smoother experience. Lastly, unlocking certain elements in the game can sometimes be a tedious process, as it heavily relies on RNG, which can test your patience. In conclusion, this game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys rogue-lites, action games, Greek mythology, or a combination of the three. It’s a well-crafted experience that shines despite a few frustrating elements. P.S. A special shout-out to the game's portrayal of the gods. Their bipolar nature is hilariously accurate to the mythology. One moment they’re cheering you on and showering you with boons, and the next, they’re trying to kill you because you favored another god. Then, as if nothing happened, they’re back to supporting you. Whether you find this fickle behavior annoying or praise it for its faithfulness to the source material, it’s undeniably memorable.. Unfortunately, it wasn't my cup of tea, but it's a very well-made piece nonetheless. Even someone who hates log-like, like me, is advised to try it. It's worth it.. The best rogue-like I've ever played. The game-play loop is fantastic, the action is fast paced and satisfying and the build variety is great. It also has a solid permanent progression unlocks, unlike some other games of the genre. The heat system (optional increasing difficulty) is also very innovative. My only, minor, complaints are that enemy variety does not change even on high heat levels (except the main bosses ofc), so on my 100th run (16 heat all weapons) it had started to get a bit boring. Also, it would have been nice to have a dedicated caster weapon - which I think is planned for Hades 2. Still, I managed to platinum it in about 110h, and none of the trophies felt like a chore - so it was highly enjoyable.. Hades is a standout among the best games of the last decade, and what I consider to be the best roguelike. I currently have about 260 hours logged and have obtained 100 percent of the in-game achievements. I wasn't all that invested in the central narrative, but its cast of endearing characters, enthralling music and addictive gameplay made playing through it a joy from start to finish.. a roguelike classic with a very beautiful soundtrack, as well as fun gameplay. my brother gifted me this game and only 6 days later he passed away due to cancer. played it in his memory and holy **** what a slog. the gameplay is so rudimentary is makes mario bros look like last of us. the story makes no sense. i dont even think hades was a character in the game. also i see so many people hyping up this game but my brothers kickstarter got 10 dollars in funding. where was the support for him? this game is trash, and i bet my brother is watching from heaven and rolling his droopy gray eyes. dont buy unless your brother has cancer. It took me 101 hours to finish the main story (with a lot of deaths along the way). After that, I spent another 19 hours achievement hunting, bringing the total to 120 hours to complete everything and I enjoyed every second of it. The story was so good, and the gameplay was so much fun. I love how you can set your own difficulty and ramp it up according to your preference. I also liked the variety of weapons and how each weapon and aspect has its own playstyle. This is the best game I've played in a long time. I can't think of anything negative to say 10/10 for sure.. Took action by contacting VIRTUALHACKNET RECOVERY FIRM immediately I learnt that I had been scammed by a crypto trading website that I have been investing in for a while now but I never knew they were not legitimate until it got to the point of me withdrawing my profits and things went left .

Best roguelike game ever.such a cool art,arenas,gameplay and abilities The only thing that could be way better is weapon veriety. Hello, as a newbie to cryptocurrency trading, I lost a lot of money trying to navigate the market on my own, then in my search for a genuine and trusted trader/broker, i came across Trader Bernie Doran who guided and helped me retrieve my lost cryptocurrencies and I made so much profit up to the tune of $60,000. I made my first investment with $2,000 and got a ROI profit of $25,000 in less than 2 week. You can contact this expert trader Mr Bernie Doran via Gmail : BERNIEDORANSIGNALS@ GMAIL. COM and be ready to share your experience , tell him I referred you. While living in Copenhagen, I became deeply involved in a vibrant local crypto community. The energy was palpable; people were passionate about the potential of blockchain technology and the myriad of opportunities it offered. I was initially skeptical but soon found myself captivated by the discussions surrounding various cryptocurrencies. After much deliberation, I decided to invest 4,000 DKK in Dogecoin, motivated by both the community's enthusiasm and the coin’s unique charm as a meme-driven currency. To my astonishment, my investment blossomed into a staggering 100,000 DKK within a few months. The thrill of watching my investment grow was exhilarating, and I felt a sense of belonging and achievement among my peers. However, as the community grew, so did the differences in opinion about the direction of our projects and investments. I found myself caught in a heated disagreement with a prominent member regarding strategic decisions, which escalated tensions within the group. Things took a turn for the worse when, following this disagreement, I was locked out of my email account. This was more than just a mere inconvenience; it felt like a nightmare unfolding. My email was the gateway to my crypto assets and exchanges, and without access, I was paralyzed. I frantically attempted to regain control but found myself hitting dead ends. The thought of losing my investment sent waves of anxiety through me. Desperate for a solution, I reached out to friends in the community, hoping they could offer guidance. To my relief, several members were sympathetic to my plight and shared their experiences of similar challenges. One name kept surfacing: ADRIAN LAMO HACKER. I Consult ADRIAN LAMO HACKER Via email: Adrianlamo@ consultant .com / Telegram: @ADRIANLAMOHACKERTECH they also have an active WhatsApp: ‪+1 (909) 739‑0269‬ It was touted as a reliable service for recovering compromised accounts, and I was eager to give it a try. With their swift assistance, I provided the necessary information, and the team quickly went to work. They were professional and responsive, keeping me updated throughout the process. Within a short period, I received the long-awaited notification that my email account had been restored. A wave of relief washed over me; I could finally access my assets and continue participating in the community. Regaining control not only allowed me to protect my investment but also reinforced the importance of security in the crypto space. It served as a valuable lesson about the risks and challenges inherent in this rapidly evolving world. With newfound confidence, I re-engaged with the community, more vigilant than ever about safeguarding my digital assets.. Earlier last month, I lost over a million dollars to scammers, but thanks to K N I G H T H O O D B O T R E C O V E R Y H A C K C O R P , I was able to recover my investments, though it took some time. My journey began when I was invited to a trading group on Telegram, which boasted over 30,000 subscribers. The vibrant activity made it seem legitimate, but I later discovered that the subscriber numbers were manipulated by the scammers operating the fake company.Initially, I was drawn in by the documents provided, which claimed I could withdraw my investments whenever I wanted. However, when I attempted to withdraw, my request was declined. I contacted customer support and was told I needed to pay taxes and trading fees which I told them to deduct from my investments but they insisted I paid it instead since my account has been frozen . Despite complying and paying these fees, my withdrawal access remained restricted. It dawned on me that I might be entangled in a pig butchering scam.I kept my situation private until I could no longer bear it, eventually confiding in my brother. He offered me support instead of judgment, which I desperately needed. Together, we hired a private investigator to dig deeper into the case. After a thorough investigation, he recommended hiring a hacker to resolve the issue and referred us to K N I G H T H O O D B O T H A C K CORP.Within a week, they tracked down the scammers, providing much-needed relief. I learned that seeking help was crucial, and I’m grateful to my brother for standing by me during this crisis. If anyone finds themselves in a similar situation, you can contact the hackers through two channels: via email at K N I G H T H O O D B O T @ G MAIL dot COM or on Telegram at K N I G H TH O O D B O T 99. Reflecting on this experience, I realize how important it is to communicate about financial struggles and seek help. Without my brother's support and the intervention of K N I G H T H O O D B O T , I would have felt completely lost.. I don't have lots of experience on rougue lite games, so I'll tend to talk on the game mechanics as I experienced TLDR: In summary, Hades is engaging with its combat, variety, and storytelling, but a few adjustments could elevate it to even greater heights. By enhancing weapon progression and refining the storytelling mechanics, the game would provide an unparalleled roguelike adventure. These improvements will ensure that players remain immersed in the captivating world. Weapons, Leveling Up and the Underworld: The arsenal of Hades is a mighty force, offering a variaty of choices to tackle the Underworld. Yet, the journey to upgrade them could benefit from a few enhancements by decreasing their requirement for upgrades. Many of the items used to progress are rare to come by. The progression within each weapon occasionally feels like a slow crawl through the River Styx. there's no need for frequent upgrade items but it could benefit from having fewer item requirement. Speeding up this process and decreasing the feeling of not getting anywhere in some of the runs. Which the topic takes us to another part of the discussion: Storytelling : Honey, lots of it. The story of Hades, woven through the golden threads of Honey, The scarcity of Honey can hinder the player's progress in uncovering the game's narrative. Players might find themselves grinding for this rare resource, disrupting the smooth flow of the game. Adjusting the availability of Honey or offering alternative paths to unlock story moments would allow the narrative to shine without interruption. Before playing Hades, I had little to no experience playing roguelikes, however, this game truly captivated me from the very start. ""Hades"" serves as the perfect introduction to the roguelike genre; Hades combines intricate world-building with the straightforward mechanics roguelikes are known for. At first, players enjoy the simplicity of the gameplay but soon find themselves immersed in its richly developed characters and the complex drama that unfolds. The game’s narrative is both elegantly simple yet so complex and richly layered. Its seamless integration of Greek mythology enhances the storytelling and immerses players in a dynamic world. For those who appreciate a nuanced narrative, amazing gameplay, or mythological themes, I highly recommend ""Hades"" Also, Artemis >.. really good rouge-like game. the mythic story is a good emerge with the gaming experience. it also has the same problem with all rouge-like games. become more and more tired when approaching final ending.. In my trading investment plan, I faced a significant setback when I lost £80,000 to a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment broker I had discovered on Facebook. Initially, I was enticed by the promises of high returns and a user-friendly platform. I invested £49,000, and as I saw the profits accumulating, I was convinced that I was making a smart financial move. Encouraged by these initial gains, I decided to invest even more into the scheme. However, my optimism quickly turned into distress when I encountered a problem. After several months of seeing my investment grow, I decided it was time to withdraw some of the profits. To my dismay, I found that my withdrawal requests were being denied. My concerns deepened when I realized that I was unable to access my funds at all. Attempts to contact the broker were futile; my messages went unanswered, and I soon discovered that the broker's online presence had vanished. This situation led me to the grim realization that I had been scammed. In my desperation, I reached out to my bank, hoping they could assist in recovering my lost funds. Unfortunately, my bank could offer no help in this situation, as the transactions had already been processed and the funds were no longer traceable through conventional means.

A rare gem. Probably my first 10/10 and the first roguelike I truly enjoyed. Why is that? Well, there's a deep story, a perfectly logical die and repeat loop, excellent gameplay, incredible artwork and music, and much, much more. Yes, there are some drawbacks, but they are so minor in comparison to the overall game, especially from a small indie team, that I honestly don't want to deduct any ""points"" from this masterpiece creation. The only real disappointment if you're looking for a story is that even if you enable the ""easy mode"" in game, you'll still have to go through dozens and dozens of runs just to get to the credits. And even more if you want to see the epilogue and finish all the side quests. Yeah, some say it's a point of the game; have fun and enjoy the run. But I bet for those people, if the story ends in 20-30 hours, they can continue to play for hundreds of hours or as long as they please. So why not make the story develop faster for the one who wants it instead of locking you behind nearly one story progression per run? Anyway, could the quests progress faster? Probably. Are my 70+ runs worth it? Defenitly.. At first you think its a big grind, because you need grind many items to get strong and have a chance against the later enemies. Partially its true, but after every run and shopping to improve your character you can feel very well, that you become stronger, so you are curious, how far you can go now. It feels like a level up in a classic RPG. I played in god mode to be faster stronger, and still you need many runs to reach the last region. So you, initially the game is too difficult and a grind. The game in god mode should be the normal mode. The game is fortunately complex and you need to understand many mechanics, I like that. I open Hades until I die and call it a day. It is really fun to me that way. I try different builds and die again but I really enjoy the time I spend with the game.. My first rogue-like game , and one of the best experiences I had in video games , incredible game can't wait for the sequel.. whats the point of a roguelike again? you failed to escape hell? try again, dumbass it might be a better run even if its a terrible run, its still hella fun with stellar art and music. If I were an addict then this game would basically be cocaine and the likes. I cannot stop plau9mg this, the combat voice acting and visual and THE SOUNDTRACK, an absolute must play.. A game of crazy dexterity and control where the better you play, the more competitive you become. But it's hard for me. I guess I'm in the minority here, but I found this game to be very average. It has a cool art style and nice animations, but in terms of roguelikes it's extremely generic and offers nothing new I haven't seen before. The same player progression and perks system is present here, there is no change of the formula, or unlikely gameplay mechanic. The fifth playthrough already felt boring and repetitive. The combat doesn't really change, the pickups are meaningless and the enemies aren't that interesting to fight, because the levels are too small for any kind of tactic. I guess there is a bit of a narrative too, but I think it's nothing more than a collection of flavor text, I wouldn't call it a story.. One of if not the best Rouge lite ive ever played wonderful story with characters you can just fall in love with, ever one has so much detail and info behind them. ( Cerberus is best boy). In rogue like games, you are generally rewarded for beating a boss or some other achievement. Here, you are rewarded for anything. To get strong, you just need to keep playing. So it reminds not of ""rogue like"" designs but of ""gacha designs"", which people are constantly rewarded for doing nothing for a long long **** you look at the ""rarity"" of the rewards, you can see how this related to gacha games. Anyway, I can see the additive nature of it. I am worried about games like this, a gacha machine, that are highly addictive become more and more popular and then gacha and phone games becoming the new way of entertainment even on consoles and PC.. hades is a horrible game and here is why. first, the story is so poor, I can watch a series instead of that. second, the voice acting is so bad. the only good thing is the gameplay. there are a lot of problems in this game. many characters have black skin like Athena and Ares. even the bosses are easy. there is no difficulty. (I am not racist but why do they do this ). note! , the voice acting like you are talking to schoolmates or something similar (I don't feel the power in their voice), the bosses need 2 tries only or three to defeat them ( this is why they are easy ). The game is excellent, however, after finishing the main story, there is no incentive to continue the game. It would be more effective if the story was distributed until the end of the disclosure of all mechanics.. One of the best games of all time. Hades is a rougelite masterpiece full of thrilling gameplay and heartfelt storytelling you won't want to miss.. I'll preface this review and say that I am aware that this is a way better game than my review implies, it's just that it didn't click for me fully. Great design, great characters, great combat, and well pretty much everything that is to be expected at this point from Supergiant. My issue was that I don't like beating a roguelike 200 times and the story relies on you beating the game over and over and over again. I just felt like after a few wins I didn't have that much of an incentive to truly experiment with builds or weapons. Score: 9.1 Very first roguelite i actually finished, art style amazing, gameplay super fun, story engaing, music outstanding I mean, everyone knows this is one of the most amazing games for this genre that has been created. The best interpretation of its genre. The fact that death is integrated into narrative makes all the difference. In contrast to any other game, losing is a real part of the process and sometimes you just want to return back to the hub to hear what other characters have new to say. Moreover, the gameplay is also highly addictive due to its variety and good balance. Story and the characters are marvelous and it is really interesting to know them better. Only negative aspect that I have noticed is that the weapons are not all well balanced, or maybe it’s just me.. Hades is very good, there is a lot to like, and there has been a lot of high quality work gone into its creation. There is a fun core gameloop. The acting is great. The writing is very good. I like the mythological theme. What detracts from the game for me is quite how much of it there is. There is quantity galore... You can play this game for a long time. I must have hundreds of hours into Hades at this point. Unfortunately It feels a little bit too stretched out. Grinding everything out takes too long. A lot of the dialogue starts to become variations on the same nothings. The gameloop gets a little bit tedious after a few runs for me and the later stages tend to feel a bit too long and samey. I would recommend everyone turns God mode on unless you enjoy a tough challenge and a padded game length. Saying these things, It's a good game to play for a bit then put down and come back to every now and then. Hades is so close to great, and roguelike fans will get a lot of mileage out of it. If the developers could justify the length a little better and squeeze a bit more juice into every moment, I would be thrilled and hopefully Hades 2 can achieve that.. Great gameplay a","the roguelike mechanics make it incredibly replayable . the game excels in many areas, starting with its stunning visuals . the soundtrack is another highlight, complementing the gameplay perfectly ."
124.Resident Evil 4,"Surprisingly amazing remake. I was actually really worried that they might mess it up (thanks to rumors), but thankfully everything was even better than i wanted it to be. Almost perfect job by Capcom. Hopefully RE9 and RE5R are next!. RE4 has always been one of my favorite games of all time and this remake makes it even better... The best that resident evil has felt…EVER. This is a perfect remake. Takes inspiration from the original but gives it its own twist while improving on a masterpiece. 10/10, no complaints.. this game fresh af the game remind me of resident evil 4 og the gameplay very enjoyable, it not losing it og atmosphere and environment with it modern graphics it make thing looking better.. Resident Evil 4 (2023) is a stunning remake of the beloved 2005 classic. Players once again control Leon S. Kennedy, a government agent sent to rescue the U.S. President’s daughter from a sinister cult. The game blends survival horror with action, keeping players on edge as they face grotesque enemies and navigate tense **** gameplay has been modernized with smoother controls and more dynamic combat. The over-the-shoulder perspective remains, and the improved AI makes enemies more challenging and unpredictable. The inventory system is streamlined, offering better management and weapon upgrades. The variety of weapons adds depth to combat, allowing for different playstyles.Visually, the game is breathtaking, with detailed environments, realistic character models, and atmospheric lighting that heightens the horror. The audio design, from eerie sound effects to intense music, complements the tense **** story remains faithful to the original but enhances character interactions, particularly with Ashley, who is now more independent. New content, boss fights, and replayable modes extend the experience beyond the main campaign. Overall, Resident Evil 4 (2023) is a remarkable remake, improving on the original in nearly every way, offering a thrilling, modern survival horror experience.. The best remake in gaming history, faithful to the original story and bringing upgraded and better gameplay with better atmosphere, graphics and map. Overall the remake is miles better than the original.. The best remake I've ever played. Good graphics, amazing sound effects, excellent soundtrack. They managed to improve everything that was in the original game and added new things. In terms of difficulty, I would say it is average, but playing on the hardest difficulty can become challenging. Probably the best game in this franchise.. Much better than Resident Evil 2 Remake. It's similar enough to the original that you still feel like playing RE4, but different enough that you feel refreshing. The gunplay/combat is satisfying as hell, and it is strategic. You need to manage and use items mindfully like the original. The horror is there but it's not too heavy/psychological, I'm not a big fan of heavy horror anyway. Overall, 10/10 experience.. Perfect remake for resident evil 4, debatable which version is superior. One of the best remakes ever made.. The Resident Evil 4 Remake is a masterpiece that perfectly balances nostalgia and innovation. Capcom has delivered a faithful yet modernized adaptation with stunning visuals, refined gameplay, and an atmospheric world that immerses you from start to finish.Iconic moments and characters are reimagined with care, making it an incredible experience for both fans of the original and newcomers. Thank you, Capcom!. Very interesting adventure, fluid gameplay. Good characters and rythm. It's technicaly very clean.. 8,5 / 10 Points. I played the main game and also the DLC with Ada and had fun. It´s an great Action horror game with lots of quality of life improvements. I really enjoyed the fight vs Krauser, had minor Sekiro vibes. The Ashley protecting part of the game is still lackluster but otherwise cool remake.. Excellent verified action. The combat system, the movement system, the inventory, everything is top notch.. capcom manages to pleasantly surprise us every time, I don't even know where to start, with the excellent graphics maybe? with the addictive gameplay? maybe with lion who is an excellently created character. The game exceeded my expectations and is at least a 10-star game.. The best of the RE remakes. It's a masterpiece just like the original GameCube title from 2005. The developers did the right thing by staying extremely faithful while updating for modern standards. If you never played ""Resident Evil 4"" before, you'll be blown away. Some fans might be disappointed the game doesn't deviate much from the source material. But to do so, would've been a mistake. There's just enough new features to make this remake stand on its own. Overall, I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game of all time. They did an amazing job with the remake, they even removed some annoying part of the original and put better ones.. I'm going to give this game best possible score because it surprised me. I was taken by surprise by the sudden shift to action-oriented gameplay (I did not play the original game), and I wasn't convinced by this shift. And yet, I kept playing, and eventually it started clicking on me. I started loving all the scenarios that the game was presenting, the new item system and the combat in general. I thought I wouldn't like this game due to being more action than its previous entries, but it proved me wrong, and I want to reward the game for it.. Good gameplay and the story is OK but I think the horror element is missing. Feels more like a survival shooter than a horror game. Some bad guys are incredibly cliché but maybe that is kinda the charm also.. I'll be honest I never got to experience the original, but if we just look at this version- it still is an absolute masterpiece of a survival horror. I'm struggling to think of anything it does wrong. You fight all types of enemies with all types of weapons, you get scared, you laugh, you have to be precise and methodical in your approach to tackling objectives and exploring rooms. Its satisfying to play and even replay.. I can't stop playing it. This game is awesome! I recommend this game to play. Capcom made excellent job, thanks so much! This game made me happy. I have been waiting for publication of this impressive game! The original and the remake I love both of them. I didn't even expect that Resident Evil 4 REmake will be that amazing. I hope in future Capcom will never stop making good games like Resident Evil. Resident Evil 4 is the best game of Capcom in my opinion. Original Resident Evil 4 2005 is my favourite game but remake is also perfect. I'm sure that I will never be disappointed that I bought this game. A spectacular experience as usual from Capcom industry games. Everyone must play this game And reexperience the story of the classic game resident evil 4 With enhancement of details and other options, my regards the Egyptian pharaoh. Resident Evil 4 Remake is a fantastic blast from the past, it hits most of the high points of the original and creates the nostalgia feeling fans have wanted for a long time. The blend of action and horror was right on the cusp of perfect as it was in the original with the particular high points being the fear inducing Dr Salvador with the new design giving an uncanny valley kind of feeling with such spaced apart eyes on a face hidden behind a burlap sack. Another high point of the horror would be for sure the Regenerators as they were once before, especially in such a dark environment. The game takes away some things that were ultimately unnecessary in the original that made it too much of a slog such as the lava room and the giant Salazar statue. As well as updating other frustrating locations such as the water room making it less of an arduous task to complete. The one downfall of the game in this reviewers opinion is the voice acting, Ada and Krauser are the main problems simply because Adas voice actor more sounds disinterested and less playful when interacting with others and Krauser has lost the intimidation Dad like figure through his voice. Other than that Resident Evil 4 Remake provides a great experience back into the original Resident Evil 4's pattern of play and nostalgia remembrance. Definitely recommended for fans of the original and for new comers as a starting point.. A fun romp but the original is better. This game cuts out some.good content from the original and extends some boring content. The original is perfectly balanced. This game feels like a slog after the 100th time facing a wave of the same enemies. The remake wastes your time.. I mean this is just the freatest game of all timefor a second time. RE4 IS JUST THAT GAME!. The campaign itself is great and I’d rate it around a 9/10 for that. Love the characters, the action, etc… The reason I dropped my rating to 8/10 is because of the post-game unlockables. Coming from RE3 Remake, the bonus shop unlockables in this game genuinely ****. The actually useful unlockables require completing the game from a brand new file (so no NG+) on certain difficulties and getting an almost unreasonable time to complete the game. By the point you’re capable of that there is absolutely no reason for actually getting the unlockables like infinite ammo. For me personally that dropped the game to more like a 7/10 but I did feel that was a bit unreasonable since most people won’t do more than one playthrough anyways and like I said before the campaign itself is stellar.. This game is a masterpiece.I usually have a lot to say on my reviews but this is just one of the best game gmes i ever played and that is just that. If you like action adventure games and or horror games, this is for you. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily the best game in the series as of 2024. I love that they made it replayable — I've completed it about five times and loved every moment!. I can't imagine how this game could be any more entertaining. One of the best remakes ever made.. Realistically everyone should play this game. The polish and iconography is top notch. Just play it if you can and you will want to play more survival horror it is that good.. Very good game. Still has some flaws and bugs even after a year since release though. It doesn't get boring even on the third playthrough. I played on PS4 version and it has some problems with low-res textures. Mostly in the village but it isn't such big deal. It's surprising that PS4 pro can run this game in stable 60 fps most of the times. The mercenaries dlc is surpsinigly good for a free expansion! Lots of new content. Have to thank capcom for that.. The game is good but there is nothing where he is excelent, good gameplay but nothing more. The story is at the level of the other episodes of the saga that is to say banal and the lack of horror element is a big miss for a resident evil. 10) Masterpiece - 9) Amazing - 8) Great - 7) Good - 6) Above Average - 5) Mediocre - 4) Below Average - 3) Bad - 2) Terrible - 1) Pile of **** - 0) Worst game ever contender. To keep it simple this game is a Masterpiece and deserves all the love. It's like drinking a nice glass of chocolate milk.. I have never seen such a great remake ****. Beautiful graphics and comfortable operability will further expand the enjoyment of ``Resident Evil 4'' (2005). This is probably the best remake of 2023.. Incredibly fun gameplay. I won't lie, RE4 was not a game I played but I can certainly see why some people call it the best resident evil ever.. Omg implay in in vr2 is like aNew game thanks capcom IReal y llove this vr mode. Exceptionally well paced game. With all the features desired included. Only wish the story was a little bit more fleshed out. The best game I have ever played in my life. The Adventure with Leon… The best experience.. A great remake of my favorite game of all time, it will never replace the original but this is what a remake should truly be like. The game that was promised. Didn't think RE4 could get any better, yet here we are.. Clunky and overrated. My guess is that this is for young gamers or long-time fans of the original.. This game looks even worse than RE2 Remake. Also RE4 Remake is boring and tedious. Uninstalled this crap after completing chapter 8.. The game is just as perfect as the original. Mechanics looks great and the gameplay is very enjoyable. It's a type **** that you're not getting bored of and it only makes you want to replay it once more. Great visuals, graphics and design. Also fantastic voice acting. Such a shame it only got one DLC. I was hoping to get assignment Ada as well.. Freaking masterpiece. They recaptured everything which made the original so special. Capcom are kings of remakes. PEAK videogaming should be played by everyone and anyone that can afford it. I've never played anything from the RE franchise, but after trying the demo for this on PS5 I decided to buy it and give it a whirl. The spooky atmosphere, the story of Leon searching for the Presidents daughter draws you right in as you unravel the weird things going on in the village. This reminded me a lot of the Last of Us honestly, it felt TLOU was a direct copy of this gameplay style and for good reason, its freaking sick. Loved the combat and in your face gun play in this game. Also love playing games made for the PS5 on the PS5 because the adaptive triggers really get a chance to shine when you aim down the sights on a shotgun and pull that trigger. The story was also suprisingly good, and the corny jokes make you laugh - ""where'd everyone go? ... Bingo?"" LOL It's a quick playthrough (16 hrs on standard), but for $30-$40 bucks now, I'd say it's worth it. I'll definitely run through it again and try out different guns.. I love the original game. This one tries to be too serious and the guns are so weak. The story changes and character model updates aren’t very well thought out. The game is boring, sound design is terrible, va work ****, I could go on. The remake is a pale imitation of it’s far superior predecessor.. Capcom you have really struck a gold mine with these remakes. This game and RE2 remake have been incredible remakes of classic games that were pretty good even by today's standards, made even better with graphical, story, combat, and gameplay elements. This game's combat is one of my all-time favorite of all time. The bosses, weapons, weapon upgrades, parrying system, and enemy design and placement all make for an incredible experience through and through. There are issues with it tho, but some feel intentional. Take the fireball cannon launch section. Me and every other person on the planet struggled with this part, because of how outwardly broken and honestly outdated it feels. But that's the point it's very clearly meant to be faithful to the original game. I'm not sure how to feel about it overall, I didn't absolutely hate that section or any other for that matter, but there may be gamers that dislike that part of the game and have it affect their outlook on the game. Still a 10/10 experience, one of, if not the best survival horror games.. I fairly enjoyed this Remake, and it's definitely the best of the Remakes out of 2, 3 and 4. It's not perfect, not quite as fun, overall, as the original, but it's still pretty damn good. If the original RE4 is a 10/10 (one of the few games that I'd give a perfect score), I'd give this Remake is an 8. There's just a few omissions that prevent it from being rated higher.. Really great remake, arguably the best. A nice throwback to a classic survival horror experience.. I love this game so much. Playing through it for the 5th time and figured that deserves a review. Captivating gaming experience which is a graphic and storyline success. Without forgetting the range of weapons and antagonists with surmountable difficulty.. Second best resident evil game behind re2. The game has a great story and the ending is also pretty good.. Both graphics and story are excellent.A masterpiece that does not succumb to polycholism.. Gorgeous................................................................................................ Resident Evil 4 Remake” is everything fans of the saga dreamed of and more. From the moment you take control of Leon S. Kennedy, you are immersed in a world that perfectly captures the essence of the original, but with a level of detail and modernization that is simply spectacular. The graphics are stunning, every corner of the cattle-infested towns is full of atmosphere and tension, making each confrontation even more intense and terrifying. It's a true love letter to the fans, respecting the story while improving it in every **** gameplay in “RE4 Remake” is absolutely flawless. They have kept the frenetic pace and adrenaline of the original, but with improvements to the controls that make it feel more agile and precise. Enemy confrontations are more strategic than ever, and every encounter keeps you on the edge of your seat. In addition, new additions and tweaks to the original mechanics not only refresh the experience, but elevate it to another level. The boss fights, in particular, are epic and will leave you **** beyond the gameplay, what makes this remake a real treat for fans is how it manages to capture the spirit of the original while expanding it. The story feels deeper, the characters are better developed, and the atmosphere of constant tension is a marvel. “Resident Evil 4 Remake is, without a doubt, the definitive homage to one of the best. Very Good Game! (Masterpiece) | Resident Evil 4 Remake | 88 Points (5 Stars) | Story 8P | Side Story 8P | Gameplay and Animation 8P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 8P | Narrative Design 8P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 8P | Dynamic and Variation 8P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. If there were more boss fights in this game, they would be more diverse and attractive. And it was offered with better graphics. And with exciting gameplay, for example, adding the system of rolling on the ground to kill all the boss fights. And with challenges to kill the boss fights, this game was definitely worth playing and the value of repeating the game increased. It is enough to watch YouTube videos and it is not worth playing.. Astounding gameplay with wonderful level design and addictive replayability. RE4 is one of the best TPS of all time having a very strong and satisfactory gameplay with a solid story behind, nice length and big replayability. Story wise is good, very solid. Again all characters are memorable, filled with personality and uniqueness on each one. My main gripe maybe is that some villains deserved a lot more time than they got. Leon is clearly affected by his last job, you see it in his voice and in his actitude, you also see how he progressed on the combat aspect, better posture, positioning along with new techniques to enhance the fact that he is an agent. Salazar isnt the best villain ever but he is good enough, his actions can be expected and his reasoning behind everything is very cliche. Characters are good, plot is interesting and the way it develops it keeps you invested. The ending was good and shows you a bit of evolution on some characters. Gameplay is of course the best part of the game. Mechanics are simple but weighty and gives you big satisfaction. Parry is fun rewarding and can be challenging even if you expect it. Crouching to avoid a grab will always feel incredible, being situationally aware and being fast enough to do it. Its a classic rock paper siccors, Parry beats attack, Grab beats parry and crouch Beats grab, the simplicity of just crouching to beat something is fun. But thats just an upclose option. Shooting is incredibly fun, wide selection of weapons that can make you more of a strategist or a raw power machine, folllowed by very solid sound and animations, hitting a headshot and hearing the head explode while leon pulls the bolt on the bolt action rifle never gets old. Variety is good and almost every weapon is very well designed. You also got the melee/kick mechanic, packs a big punch, hits enemies along the way and gives you a incredible sensation of reward. Puzzles are on the weaker side, there isnt too much to think about and they end up being way too simple. Enviroments are decent. They have varied places, castle, island, a lake, villages, with good interiors and a bit of personality on each of them. Disappointingly its atmosphere isnt on par with the 2005 version, being the main issue ambient noise, because now there isnt, and safe places lacking its music that expressed tranquility and tension. Fortunately they are well-designed for combat, always makes you switch up strategy thanks to enemy type variety and placing of them. An incredible game very worth its price, with a lot of replayability behind and very fun combat with a very well serviceable story.. LEON SLUT KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN THIS **** IS GOOD FOR THE FIRST TIME DO U KILL THE BIG BLACK BBC MFER THAT CHASES U BUT U DO LIKE A **** BADASS IN BURNING BUILD. im not gay but if leon asked **** i aint finna say no. this game builds on the old game and adds so much more but at the same time removes some of the content that also made the game memorable. Even though I prefer the Raccon City and Code Veronica trilogy, I still liked this title.. the best game I have played so far in the year 2024, I thought it was impressive. the best resident evil gooooooood 10/10 .............................................. So I don't know what to say: Many user reviews here are undifferentiated. Nonetheless: I find REmake 4 redundant and am of the opinion that it in no way makes the original obsolete. Rather, it's a poorly cobbled-together hodgepodge of ""modern"" gameplay mechanics that other games implement far better and more consistently - the makers lack any understanding of why the OG RE4 is considered a classic. For example, the parrying mechanic is completely superfluous and unnecessary. You can tell that the makers realised that parrying is too effective and for the sake of balance they implemented a durability indicator for the knife, which was already incredibly idiotic in the RE2 remake. The ""realistic"", momentum-based movement and the equally ""realistic"" gunplay mechanics also stand in contrast to the arcade-orientated, fast-paced/responsive gameplay of the original. These are simply elements that were probably inspired by ""The Last of Us"" - just like the completely superfluous stealth mechanics, which seem out of place and ineffective here. I don't find the game particularly difficult. The only thing that took me 3 tries was the cabin siege scenario in chapter 5. This scene inspired me to give the game the title ""Chicken Simulator"" - after all, the most effective way is to run around the room like a chicken whose head has been chopped off and shoot your opponent in the legs/head to land roundhouse kicks. This strategy almost trivialises the combat - just like circle strafing and aiming for the head. Finally, Capcom should be stopped from producing these lousy remakes. When I think that there's an RE1 remake in the making that declassifies the classic into a lame third-person shooter with parrying and stealth mechanics and idiot puzzles, I feel sick.. Story =1.75 Narrative of the story =2 Characterizations =2 Gameplay =2 Graphic =2 Result => 9.75/10. The best RE game since the original RE4. The gameplay is possibly the best gameplay in the entire franchise. The addition of parries and perfect parries only adds onto the gameplay and approves upon the originals. The replayability is also some of the best in the series allowing for Multiple playthroughs if you wish. The skill ceiling for this game is incredible, each weapon feels unique enough that you want to use or can see the reason to use it. The game is balanced enough there are stun locking enemies that can kill you easily however the inclusion of the parry and the inventory pausing the game gives you opportunities to survive and best situations. The voice acting can be hit or miss but nothing that ruined a character or took me out of the game. The story/lore has been improved from the original which was needed. Small things like the shooting range and new spinel system goes a long way and raises my score immensely for this game. Sound design and graphics are top notch, as well as the new destructible environments. The crafting system is a feature that was carried over from the recent RE games which is appreciated. Mercenaries being a free update with lots of replayability and good gameplay raises it above the original. The cut out parts are added in the DLC separate ways so maybe two parts of the OG was left out. Enemy AI has been improved and enemies feel more of a threat than ever. A big downgrade however is that Ashley’s AI has gotten worse. It is no longer “follow” and “wait” it’s now “loose” and “tight”. So you can longer hold her back while you clear the room she must come with you. Which plot wise makes sense but affects gameplay now she is constantly in danger of getting grabbed or knocked down. There are lockers but they are very rare and maybe only appear three times in the entire game. She also gets in your way, more then the OG which leads to more game overs and frustrating moments. Even with some flaws this game is amazing all the way around nothing truly lessens the game as a whole for me just a few nitpicks. There is not enough praised I can give this game it is truly a game that should be played and is a worthy successor the original.. This remake is of the game of my life and will stay installed forever. Whenever I miss it, I'll play it again and complete it.. Amazing game!! Does a fantastic job at modernizing the original, without losing what made it great!. Basically, Resident Evil 4 Remake was very faithful to the original and improved a lot compared to the first. More enemies have been added, there are more things to do in the game, the gameplay is much better and the graphics are very good. Of course, compared to the original Resident Evil 4, this one is much better, but even today Resident Evil 4 is a magnificent game, with very few errors, which I may not even be able to name.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really don't get the hype and reviews this game has gotten. I played the remakes of RE 2 and 3, and both were great games in their own right. I loved the exploring and survival part of RE 2. RE 3 was completely different, it was an action ride, and it did exactly what it needed to do. But RE 4 succeeds in neither being a compelling exploration/survival game or action shooter. You just go from area to area killing the same enemies who slowly walk straight towards you, now and then the special enemy showing up. There's a few parts where the game shines, and had it been cut down to that (the game also completely overstays its welcome) I would have given it a 7 or 8. But as it is, its just a repetetive, dull and uninspirered game. The story is trash, too. A waste of time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. So a remake of a 20 year old game. Quite the tall order to remake one of the best games of all time. Did they succeed? Yes and no. Graphically this is a stunning game. The light effects, the models, the textures it's all gorgeous. The only glaring problem here is, like Capcom's other Resident Evil remakes is that the lip syncing is very iffy. Storywise it's great. It writes a bit differently from the original, which is appreciated to let the original still live its own life. The changes are good and work for the game. Gameplay is fantastic. It's fun to shoot, fun to run around and fun to do all the context specific mellee moves. It's fun. There are some issues that I could point out, such that staggering opponents is not very consistent. This is mostly noticeable on higher difficulties but it makes it weird to play when you can shoot someone between the eyes and they don't react at all. In the original they consistently reacted to it, but in this it's not as consistent. This is a point against this game, because consistency is more fun than randomness. The characters is where this game departs almost too much from the original. This review will not judge the characters solely on the comparison to the original, but there will be comparisons. The main character Leon Kennedy is sarcastic just like in the original. He had to be, they can't remake a game without retaining some of the original's character. However he plays it a bit too straight. Not a big deal but still. It doesn't take much away from the character. Leon, if you don't know, is out to save the president's daughter Ashley. Ashley's character is a major improvement to the original. She's fantastic. She's got a step in her voice, while displaying her worries. She talks and reacts properly to what happens in the world. (She's also super into Leon but Leon has negative rizz and doesn't understand which is also humoristic). There are also other characters that are downgrades but talking about them would reach into spoiler territory so I'll leave it there. The monster redesigns are mostly downgrades as well. Especially one late stage enemy called regenerator (if you haven't played it you won't be affected by the name but if you have you know who I'm talking about). Intimidating, almost scary in the first game, silly and flubby in this game. They're the worst offender but there are a few others. The designs are mostly good, but the original is miles above. To summarize. It's a great game. A masterpiece in its own right. But there are issues and its inevitable that this is going to be compared to the original and it fails to meet it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Resident Evil 4 Remake has caused a lot of love and hate amongst fans of the original RE4. However, one significant improvement is noticeable in the writing. As entertaining as the original was in action-movie-style environments, the writing always left much to be desired as the storyline did drag on. The Remake turns it to eleven by creating a coherent narrative and dividing parts into more streamlined chapters. ( With some much-needed cut moments, although there are a few which are missed.) In this way, players are encouraged not just to run from one part to the next but to take the time to explore the area, find notes and files, and learn more about the environment they are exploring. It also improves the character development for Leon, Luis, and Ashley (and even unlikely antagonists such as Mendez, Ramon, and Krauser) in a way which fits the slightly rewritten events. The game's tone is noticeably a lot darker than the original. Even as someone who played the remake before the original, I have to say this doesn't inherently make the game "" better"" or ""worse"". The remake’s decision to use its models and environments through the RE Engine is primarily stunning. ( Ashley, Luis, and Ada are the most noticeable to receive makeovers, while even Dr. Salvador and the Chainsaw Sisters remain much more frightening renditions of their appearances ). The environments feel stunningly out of a dark fantasy novel and fit the moodier tone of the writing. Additionally, the audio remains crisp much like the original for its time, from the ganados' Spanish dialogue to the eery ambience of background music. The addition of stealth, crouching, and, of course, parrying makes combat much more entertaining and, in a surprisingly fun way, personal, as the player can decide how they want to approach chapters or entire boss fights. Enemy types’ AI works more “smartly” in the remake when attempting to dodge or evade your attacks. The additional abilities to now craft items, store them in an inventory, and, of course, not have to endure as many QTEs make the game sleeker in its combat mechanics. The game also returns to ","Resident Evil 4 (2023) is a stunning remake of the beloved 2005 classic . players once again control Leon S. Kennedy, a government agent sent to rescue the president’s daughter from a sinister cult . the over-the-shoulder perspective remains, and the improved AI makes enemies more challenging and unpredictable ."
125.Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution,"Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution - A 3D fighting game innovator with lots of content , evolutionary ranking system and 3D customization. The game offers amazing amount of content, standard arcade, versus, deep dojo training with special trials, customization modes and the MAIN big attraction here is QUEST MODE. Quest mode makes you go around the map to fight actual ghost players data from the real life arcade. Do some mission modes to earn gold and items. Attend the tournament with crazy tiny gimmick modes like survival tournament, hyper action battle and more. A little extra content with the USA version of the game bundled with the VF anniversary game in the options. Pros: - Amazing in depth fighting system - Crazy amount of content setting the gold standard for fighting game singleplayer content just from Quest Mode alone. - Graphics of NAOMI2 looks amazing (although the port looks blurry) - Music is good ( not as good as vanilla VF4) Cons: - Missing some standard game modes from prior games like Team Battle and Survival mode. ( Personal gripes ) - No arcade endings - Debut characters like Goh felt underbaked Overall it's one of my all time favorites and the cons are just my opinions. One of the best fighting game of all time.. One of the funnest fighters I've ever played. So much replay-ability with the quest mode and how in depth the tutorial gets with teaching you the nuances of each character is mind blowing. This game was way ahead of it's time, and not too many other fighters to this day match it, a classic in fighting games.. THE best Virtua Fighter out of all the series. The game that stopped SEGA from going bankrupt. I remember owning the PSM2 DVD with this and Soulcalibur 2 as import reviews and they did not disappoint. The graphics were a big improvement over the normal version of Virtua Fighter 4. They looked nicer, smoother and very realistic. The animation looked superb. The soundtrack was really good. The sound was improved and the gameplay was more refined and I think it has the best gameplay out of all the series. It brought 2 new characters into the series: Brad Burns and Goh Hinogami. I did like their fighting styles. A lot of things were added to keep the game innovative such as: fighting records and opponent logs in quest mode, new special game modes, item and money battles, item stores and currency system in quest mode, new ring, better ranking system and emblem battles. You could buy the original Virtua Fighter stage and the original character models which was a nice touch as well. It has THE best training mode out of all the series. This was the first game out of the series to have the command list, ai position and difficulty setting, spawn and reset position and among other things. Definitely get this.. This game has the best, if not THE BEST Tutorial in the entire Fighting game genre for me. Also, had great depth during the fights, and in definitive, is not for button mashing.","the game offers amazing amount of content, standard arcade, versus, deep dojo training with special trials, customization modes and the MAIN big attraction is QUEST MODE . Quest mode makes you go around the map to fight actual ghost players data from the real life arcade . it's one of my all time favorites and the cons are just my opinions ."
126.Uncharted 4: A Thief's End,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a really brilliant game! The stunning graphics, even after 9 years, still look amazing! The attention to detail is outstanding. Overall, I had an amazing time with this game. The combat is great, and in terms of gameplay, there's very little to be disappointed with. However, the story, in my opinion, was horrible. At first, I just ignored the little stupid things, but as the story progressed, more annoying, irritating, frustrating, and illogical elements started to show up. Almost every time Nadine or Elena appeared, it was so irritating that I couldn't believe someone thought it was a good idea to write their actions the way they did. At first, I wasn't mad at it, and it was honestly a 10/10 game. But because of the story, I had to lower my score.. Best game I have EVER played. The best Uncharted by a long shot. Stop reading this and go play the game. 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/10. A damn good game that is full of blooming characters and perfect narrative and story beats. This is the best game I have ever played in my entire life, graphics are absolutely fantastic. Can't speak highly enough of the performances. Amazing story and send off for Nathan Drake. Fluid, terrific gameplay.. To this day this is one of the best looking games ever made, and it has some of the greatest set pieces of any game. Amazing environments, but incredibly simple combat that becomes way too repetitive.. One of the best games for the PS4. A game like a great movie from hollywood which is well polished.. Revisited this game in 2024 since i never finished it, and so glad i did...really cinematic experience. It's one of the best Sony exclusive and I think it deserves goty2016 it has only one problem the story It's normal. Great game amazing gameplay the graphics is insane the story is great,Love everything about the game honestlu. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End wraps up Nathan Drake’s saga in the most epic way possible. It’s like playing through a blockbuster movie—tons of action, emotional gut-punches, and straight-up cinematic vibes. If you’re a fan of the series or just into games with a fire story, this one’s a must. No cap, I was hooked the whole time.. Not my cup of tea. the game does some great things, looks pretty good. plays all right, all in all my least favorite of the series.. Guys i will just say this i never play a game twice but uncharted 4 make me do that literally a piece of art i can't even blv this game is almost 9y old i play it on 2024 and the graphic is better than any 2024 game thank u naughtydog for this masterpoece 10/10 this game is for history️. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It takes great strides to outclass its previous entries because it knows there won’t be another chance. From the opening moments to the credits rolling, Uncharted 4 is built from the ground up to close the curtain on the series with its most well-rounded, personal, and fine-tuned entry. With its new and polished mechanics, unrivaled technical prowess, human story, and thrilling action, nothing in Uncharted 4 is less than top tier. In saying goodbye, Uncharted soars to its highest heights, and bids farewell to an icon with a finale befitting of the history that preceded it.. One of my all time favourites. This game has everything. You can play this over and over and never get board of it. A gold standard game.. Uncharted 4 is a masterpiece, with a gripping story and stunning visuals. Nathan Drake’s emotional journey feels genuine, and the world is beautifully crafted. The gameplay is refined, blending action, exploration, and puzzle-solving seamlessly. Every detail, from character development to the cinematic presentation, is executed flawlessly. It’s an unforgettable adventure that defines modern gaming. And Chapter 11 was a masterpiece. The beautiful view, the puzzles, EVERYTHING. The scene where you barely survive the fall from the bell tower was insane. Also, the part where huge car was chasing you, it's just incredible. Uncharted 2 is just slight midget better, but Uncharted 4 is a must-play for everyone.. OVERALL SCORE: 9.5/10. GAMEPLAY: Almost every aspect of gameplay is improved and expanded upon from the previous games. The gunplay is the best of the series and may even be the best of any game I’ve ever played. I honestly can’t explain why but it feels super refined, and extremely satisfying. When you combine it with the newly added grapple and sliding mechanics, it creates space for some spectacular moments. The stealth is extremely basic just like previous games, but they did add an awareness meter on enemies so you know when you’re about to be spotted. The fist fighting, although animated better, is simplified compared to the 3rd game. The 2nd game added on a tiny bit from the 1st, and the 3rd game added on a lot from the 2nd, so I was pretty disappointed when they pulled the 4th back a bit. You can’t grab and push enemies anymore, and instead of being able to counter an incoming punch, you have to roll to dodge it which is super lame. Also, there’s really only 1 encounter dedicated to fist fighting with the exception of a few boss fights that are extremely scripted, so that’s a reduction from the 3rd game as well. The cinematic action sequences that the series is known for can definitely be found in this game, although not quite as mind blowing. The 2nd game had the iconic train level and the 3rd had the iconic plane level, but the 4th doesn’t really have anything that stands out like that. However, I don’t want to throw too much shade because there’s a car chase that actually may be the most thrilling and fun action sequence in the entire series. There’s plenty of destructive and explosive moments as you’d expect, but it’s missing a really big and grand one. VISUALS: Pretty much as good as it gets. Textures, design, lighting, and animations are all gorgeous. There’s a haziness when you look out into the distance which looks cool but is a bit much in my opinion. STORY: The stories of Uncharted games continually get better and this game is no exception. I think it’s by far the best. The characters feel more real than ever before and the plot constantly keeps you hooked. There’s a few lines that are very corny despite the voice actors' best attempt at delivering them, but other than that it’s great.. Easily the best uncharted game, a beautiful story from start to finish with some of the best visuals in the industry. mega disappointment. horrible controls during fight, idiotic AI, shallow story, Sam is the most boring character in Uncharted, level design **** **** during fights, the fights are a bloody **** this game. finished it on hard, just a pain in the ass.... This is by far the best uncharted game ever made. The story and visuals are great, the characters are well written, Nathan is somewhat not obsessed. I think the only character I hated was Sam because he was just arrogant and only caused problems. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that even somewhat liked the first 3 uncharted games.. Loss track of time while I was playing. During weekends would play for 8 hrs straight hahhaa. I think you need to have played the previous three titles to truly appreciate the massive improvements in the fourth entry. Uncharted 1-3 are, simply put, some of the most badly aged games I have ever seen. Yet this game surprised me with how much better it is. The story is extremely well-written. There are still some occasions where the characters simply stumble into the next event (albeit it is much less obvious this time around), and just as in the previous games, our ultimate location is again almost completely off the human radar while still being relatively obviously placed on the surface of the planet. However, the depth of Nathan and the other characters is just astonishing to me. I loved every second of watching them behave like real people. The antagonist is also incredibly charming and fun to watch—pretty good stuff here. The only problem I noticed was with Elena; her voice actor always sounds kind of hollow and uninspired.Audiovisually, it's pretty good for the time. The climbing has been much improved, with multiple routes instead of a single obvious one, and new interesting mechanics. However, the mid part was a bit boring to me, even though it has nice ideas. But the real highlight was the stealth sections. I just loved them. They used all the cool mechanics and made them into something great. It feels engaging, challenging, and overall like some sort of ""combat""-puzzle. They reminded me of the Arkham games, and I think that's a great **** also had the best and most polished ending I have ever seen in a video game, and more games should look at this one as an example. Overall, an insanely good game with a few minor pacing issues, perfectly written characters, a perfect ending, very well-done stealth sections, good shooting mechanics, and enjoyable exploration.. Much like the previous 3 games, you have another adventure with your favorite crew. However, they added auto aim and rope swinging/climbing to the experience which you carry with you. It helps give it a separate experience yet still feels like Uncharted. This is probably my second favorite game next to Among Thieves. The first game to me is the worst but still pretty good game of the series and Drake's Deception still pretty much wedged in between them. Overall, this is a great sequel and worthy of the collection.. Nice story, like how you always waiting what's will be next, but shooting system a little bit bad. You dont feel the weapon like you shoot from the piece of wood, not a gun.. I could spent hours talking about how good this game is.Everything from gameplay too story, atmosphere,characters, graphics, music. It's not too hard and not too easy. Just awesome. A great final for a great game series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is one of the best ps4 games of all time without a doubt, it has a wonderful story, very good graphics it doesn't even look like a game from 2016 seriously, I played this game in 2022 I thought it was wonderful on my ps4 then I played the version on the ps5 remaster in 2024, without a doubt one of the games ever made, congratulations. It's generally pretty good, But the only thing that's throwing me off is that there's literally enemies everywhere. It's sometimes pretty hard to just enjoy the scenery when there's monkeys everywhere try'na kill you.. It's a wonderful immersive game. Always looking forward for the next chapter. Plus it's amazing starring characters. Gives you a sense of adventure and puzzle piecing. Alot of puzzling parts that can leave you thinking. Climbing mechanics were found enjoyable, since it was put together with the amazing world around for gameplay. The story is a absolute hit. Wouldn't want anything more.. Playing again uncharted 4 in 2024 after so many years got me emotional. It's still peak in graphic, music and cutscenes. Gameplay and puzzles are simple but well studied; stealth is optional (well made too) and there are many executions and weapons in the inventory. Casting is brilliant and the ending is a masterpiece. Truly remarkable.. A masterpiece of art. Must have for any PlayStation owner, and any gamer. Whoever doesn't think this game is good is ridiculous.. OMG, good graphics aaaand that's it, if you like to ACTUALLY PLAY and do something this is not for you, TOO MANY interruptions with lame dialogs, and cutscene after cutscene after cutscene .... The end of Nathan Drake's story is brilliant. Uncharted 4 offers very good gameplay, a typical story for this genre, and a magnificent conclusion to the series. The action scenes are very satisfying, and for a PS4 game, its graphics and on-screen elements are impressive. Undoubtedly, it's a game you'll enjoy from start to finish and it will become one of your favorites.. There's nothing in this particular franchise that makes it bad.I just love uncharted 4 despite having a lot of problems like the shooting and weapons système and the same old mechanics but still gives me that enjoyable feeling of playing video games. story mod in This game very good. Who is itBest GamesIn history I strongly adviseAll the people on the planetTo play this masterpiece a fairy game. Absolutly stunning game. Its far ahed of his time. Story,gameplay, charachters, everything about this gameis awesome.. My favourite uncharted game, nice story, great gameplay, loved the stealth features and amazing graphics.. I played this game for the first time recently, it's really amazing. Thanks Naughty Dog!. The first title is iconic, the second title has a great story and the third title has the most absurd action scenes I have ever seen in a videogame of this kind, but this game... it has everything. Everything is better: shooting, punching, climbing, graphics, insane cutscenes, voice acting and story. The new mechanics are also really cool. I liked a lot that the story theme was around greed and that not everything you chase is worth it. And by the end I just couldn't help but smile. What an end to a great franchise.. This is a solid game, no hate but just no love either to be honest I do like the story but compared to other games this is subpar. Naughty Dog seems to be acting like a one trick pony at the moment. Pretty good game. 8/10. Gameplay and graphics are great. It's all you'd want out of a PS4 title. Plot is much weaker than the first 3 instalments and the Vita game. The new script writer just isn't as good and overall it ends up being forgettable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a way to end Nate's story, fantastic, good gameplay improved in every aspects. Story =2 Narrative of the story =2 Characterizations =2 Gameplay =2 Graphic =2 Result => 10/10. Best game ever️️ I was going to sell my PS5 out of boredom and I thought I was tired of video games until I tried playing this game and literally it dazzled me in every sense of the word. I was immersed in its story and its events and literally every detail in the game was paid attention to the utmost degree and I enjoyed playing it very much.. Really good game good combat nice story cool characters good climbing overral amazing game. An absolute masterpiece that brings a fitting and beautiful conclusion to an extraordinary game series. A generation defining game that sets new standards and improves on the gameplay of the previous installments or any TPS at that point. The multiplayer is also amazing and it can provide 100s of hours of additional gameplay. Naughty Dog once again created one of the greatest video games of all time!. It is the best game ever made, everything about this game is perfect. If you haven't played this yet you must play I don't care who you are.. Everything about this game is great. Graphics, gameplay, story, character development... And a good length. Worth a try.. The story was kinda fun. I won't say that it was Mad Max: Fury Road but it kinda get my attention. However, the problems of main characters seemed a little irrelevant. I could not believe them. The gameplay main consists of shooting, stealth, and climbing. Climbing mainly was find a thing which color is different or press button at the right time. Shooting and stealth was something ordinary like in the other games.. Its rare that I can agree with paid critics on this one. Visually very beautiful game with totally good game play.. Best graphics on ps4 when it launch,theres quite a lot of holywood like cinematics gameplay moments,but the breaks between one climax to another is too long(it makes the game felt a little dull/boring and slow at a few point in the campaign),still its a must play because theres a ton of good cinematics and memorable events thats better than most movies. Is my best game ever.I play this game in 2019 and i love it.Today,2024 i wating for uncharted ****. It's a well made game. Impressive action scenes. But I think it's a little overrated.. Best Uncharted by far. Story is excellent, gameplay is excellent, and looks fantastic.. Pros - the character writing is beyond fantastic - some of the best dialogue in video games - the game looks stunning - Chapter 11 is one of the best action set pieces in video games - the grappling hook and pick make climbing fun // Cons - Nathan moves painfully slow especially in some of the bigger more open areas - the two Nadine ''boss fights'' are awful - crushing feels way less fun compared to the three previous titles // Uncharted 4 is a beautiful closing chapter for an iconic series. Every single character comes full circle and the new faces are all memorable, especially the main antagonist. When it comes to character and story writing, it rarely comes anywhere near Uncharted 4. The gut punch after Chapter 11, the ''I'm sorry'' scene, the main antagonist monologuing before the final fight, etc. All of the story is written and acted expertly well. Add to that just how beautiful the game looks and you have one of the best pieces of storytelling in gaming. Climbing got new mechanics with both the pick and the grappling hook, the latter serving a fantastic role in repositioning during combat. I wish the pick was unlocked earlier so the climbing was more interesting but I can live with that. What I can't live with is the two Nadine Ross fights. Both of them are extremely contrived ''gameplay'' sections that end up with you losing anyway. Not winning in a game, losing in the cutscene. You lose throughout the ''gameplay'' where your button presses mean nothing. And it is a baffling design choice considering the final bossfight has the simple yet effective dodge left, dodge right button inputs. The two Nadine fights should have been those mechanics to prepare you for a much harder version of this system in the final fight. Replaying the series and especially this game after five years blew me away. What an incredible set of games and what a fantastic, full circle ending to one of the best written characters gaming has to offer. I could not recommend this series enough.. I think that the gameplay and graphics were incredible however Nadine Ross ruins it. Like how is the infamous Nathan drake who has killed pirates and mercenaries with his bear hands suddenly clumsy and useless when fighting her. They also ruined the cannon of uncharted. It was supposed to be from drake's fortune that nate was a descendant from Francis drake but now apparently, he changed his surname to drake to honour his dead mother.. The most important game of my life. I wouldn't have adored videogames without this one. Spectacular and really well written story, great characters, spectacular and beautiful graphics, awesome gameplay, spectacular action scenes, great villain, a great soundtrack. The best in the uncharted series and a totally must play for PS4.. The game has an interesting world and a intriguing story to tell. Especially if you are a fan of pirates you can not miss out on this . Nothing crazy regarding the storyline but the graphics and environments make up for it . Poor shooting though , definetely suggesting playing on hard difficulity !. Flawless game ever. Best game series I ever seen. story,graphics,sounds and most important Nathan Drake is amazing.. Classic game, an amazing story, and graphics. Each chapter brings a lot of fun. Adventure is guaranteed and exploration is on a great level. Dialogues are so flow. A great and total experience.. Masterpiece. I really enjoyed this game. The story and the graphics are perfect.. Best of the bunch. Masterful storytelling by Naughty Dog, much more engaging gameplay, great characters and villains. First time I really felt any kind of real genuine emotion in this series apart from the end of 3. Setting was great, but I wish the game was just a bit shorter. Felt a bit too drawn out.. the game has a decent story, good characters but i am not a fan of the gameplay itself, feels boring. at chapter 14/22, i am going to stop. most of the game is platforming challenges and solving puzzles, like 20-30% of it is gun-fighting. i finished uncharted 1 and 2 fast and enjoyed their pacing and gameplay elements but this one has really slow pacing and feels more like they focus more on the problem-solving challenge over whether it is fun to play through. it becomes formulaic in mid-game, feels like a chore to advance the story. the story itself becomes tired, its a wild goose chase resembling mario going to the wrong castle over and over. ""A Thief's End"" is the perfect conclusion to the Nathan Drake adventures. It's a moving masterpiece more comparable to ""The Last of Us"" than ""Uncharted 2"". Naughty Dog's unmatched skill as cinematic storytellers is on full display here. The game's presentation pushed the PS4's technical capabilities to the max. Graphically, it is a true marvel and the formula gameplay was elevated. If ""Uncharted 2"" was Nathan Drake at his peak, then ""Uncharted 4"" is about Nate hanging up his guns. This is an excellent game. I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. So if u like walking driving or some others simulators this game for you Absolutely nothing interesting for me I really dont understand why this have so high rating game for i***** if u want to watch film - go to the cinema better. Title: A Treasure Beyond Measure: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End Review Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation 4, is a masterstroke of storytelling, gameplay, and visual artistry that solidifies the Uncharted series as one of the greatest video game franchises of all time. This final chapter in the saga of Nathan Drake is not merely a conclusion to his adventures; it is a celebration of the entire Uncharted legacy, delivering an experience that is both a thrilling treasure hunt and a deeply emotional journey of discovery. From the opening scene to the final credits, Uncharted 4 is a visual masterpiece. The game's stunning graphics push the PlayStation 4 to its limits, offering breathtaking vistas, meticulously detailed environments, and character animations so lifelike they blur the line between game and reality. Whether it's the lush jungles of Madagascar, the bustling markets of Italy, or the stormy coasts of Scotland, every location is crafted with an unparalleled attention to detail, making exploration a constant delight. The narrative of Uncharted 4 is Naughty Dog storytelling at its best. The game delves into Nathan Drake's past, exploring his relationship with his brother Sam and the life he's tried to build with Elena. The story is a rollercoaster of emotions, masterfully weaving together moments of high-octane action, humor, and heartfelt drama. The voice acting is phenomenal, with Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Troy Baker (Sam Drake), and Emily Rose (Elena Fisher) delivering performances that bring these beloved characters to life with authenticity and depth. Gameplay in Uncharted 4 is as exhilarating as its narrative. The game refines the series' signature blend of platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat to perfection. Climbing and exploration feel more dynamic than ever, with the addition of the grappling hook opening up new avenues for traversal and strategy. Combat is fluid and engaging, offering a variety of ways to approach each encounter, from stealth to all-out gunfights. The game also introduces larger, more open environments that encourage exploration and offer multiple paths to objectives, enhancing the sense of adventure. One of Uncharted 4's most commendable achievements is its pacing. The game skillfully balances its thrilling action sequences with quieter moments of exploration and character interaction, ensuring that the story and gameplay feed into one another seamlessly. This pacing, combined with the game's stunning set pieces and clever puzzles, creates a gameplay experience that is constantly engaging and never feels repetitive. The multiplayer component of Uncharted 4 is a worthy addition, extending the game's lifespan with fast-paced, treasure-hunting team battles. It's a fun, well-designed mode that captures the spirit of the single-player campaign, offering a variety of maps, modes, and character customization options. In conclusion, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a triumph in every aspect. It is a fitting end to Nathan Drake's story, delivering a narrative that is both epic and intimate, set within a world of unparalleled beauty.

It is a treasure that will be cherished by gamers for years to come, a reminder of the power of adventure and the bonds that tie us together. Uncharted 4 is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of gaming artistry.. one of the best games I've played in my entire life. Lots of epic moments, interesting plot and characters. I advise everyone!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just play it. Do yourself a favour and play this amazing and fun game. It takes everything from its predecessors and adds a lot of great content, amazing story and great gameplay.. This is the best end possible to Nathan Drake's story one of the best ends to one of the best games on PS4. Uncharted 4 is one the best games of all time, a perfect conclusion to this perfect franchise. The gameplay and technology department are the best of all, but story pacing was really off and the game tried to be too serious at times. The 'The Last of Us' after-effect really had a big influence on this game. Multiplayer is still hella fun, but damn they never bothered to keep the new contents flowing and it became full of hackers.. Another symbol of Drakman's creative impotence. Repetitive gameplay and narrative dissonance. Solid part of the franchise. Wasn't a fan of the series after previous games but this one bought me.. Truly a fantastic send off for one of the most iconic PlayStation mascots of all time. Nathan Drake and his brother gave a final adventure to remember.. It's that game that you can play a 1000 times without being bored it's just perfect. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This movie is absolutely captivating. I play it every month and it takes around 15 hours to finish. It has been my favorite game since I was around 13 years old. The beauty and thrill of it are hard to explain why I enjoy it so much, but I have always wanted to go on adventures like this. It's really fun to feel like you're a part of it.. At first glance, Uncharted 4 doesn't seem like it would work on paper, longer story/playtime than the original trilogy, a plot in which you keep chasing after another led, and the inclusion of a character that some how wasn't mention previously despite being super important to the main led. While a lot of these issues are excused in some way or form, the fact of the matter is, this is UNCHARTED. The wild goose chases, the getting chased by a big bad, the ending fighting between a psycho killer, and a treasure that may be lost. Uncharted 4 is exactly what you've been expecting from the series, but with a little more of what you like. Plenty of puzzles, platforming, and even better stealth. Honestly the fact they are able to deliver not only a good story, but make it have a fantastic finish is prehaps what sells me the most on this game, and what makes it the crown jewel in the series.. Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a masterful conclusion to the Nathan Drake saga. With stunning graphics, a captivating narrative and solid gameplay, the game takes players on an exciting journey full of action and adventure. Attention to detail The environments, character development, and immersive cinematics make this game an unforgettable experience. Plus, the balance of exploration, combat, and challenging puzzles makes Uncharted 4 a gem for action-adventure game lovers. "". Amazing, Uncharted delivers us an amazing game with all you can ask. It has breath taking graphics, amazing gameplay, new weapons and an immersive story to find Henry Avery’s treasure. It is the conclusion for Nathan Drake and Uncharted that we all want, I risk saying that it is the best game we will see in a couple of years. Uncharted 4 is one of few games that push innovation and break limits in the gaming industry, even 8 years after it's release. A promising plot with great dialogue, naturalistic voice acting and insane sequences that make you feel like the main character of a Mission Impossible movie. While the story is quite predictable with a few cliche twists and turns, the set pieces more than make up for it with action packed fight scenes that will have you run across the battlefield, looking for cover and flanking enemies before they surround you. This is one of the best games on the market, and skipping it would be a shame.. Uncharted 4 raps up the story of Nathan Drake (after basically ending it) while retaining old characters and adding new ones and keeping the tension high and the good times higher while swinging through an incredible story.. Uncharted 4 is a 17 hour long action movie, made of thrilling chases and collapsing buildings, deadly puzzle-traps and betrayal. But it’s also a 17 hour action movie of climbing (oh so much climbing) and mediocre cover-based gunfights with generic bad guys with guns. Uncharted 4 concludes the story of Nathan Drake, the world’s best – and worst – treasure hunter. He is the best because he has found multiple lost, legendary cities and their treasures by following a series of clues left behind by long-dead historical figures who did not die when or how history popularly described – long-dead lost cities which had surprisingly sophisticated technology for the early 1700s, especially, as in the case of this game, where a city was built by a bunch of pirates. And yet, he is living a middle-class existence because every time he finds some rare treasure, it ends up getting destroyed or otherwise blown up by a pesky band of bad guys – in this case, Shoreline PMC, a multinational mercenary force working for one Rafe Adler and led by Nadine Ross, a ruthless woman who repeatedly beats the snot out of Nathan Drake, but never actually kills him. Assisting him in his adventures are his wife, Elena Fisher, his best friend, Victor Sullivan, and his brother, Sam Drake, the man who drew Nathan into treasure hunting in the first place before being shot and “killed” in a Panamanian prison 15 years ago while working with Rafe Adler. Needless to say, given his position on the list, Sam is alive and well, and the game is kicked off by a desperate need to find the treasure of one Captain Avery, an eccentric pirate captain who loved building death traps used to test those who would “join him in paradise”, which, over the course of the game, you come to learn contains a great deal of pirate treasure indeed (assuming, of course, it wasn’t all spent or sunk on the bottom of the ocean somewhere). Sam was busted out of the prison he’d been stuck in by a notorious, ruthless Panamanian criminal, and it is up to you to find the treasure so that said criminal can be given the 50% of the Avery treasure that he demands, in exchange for freeing (and not murdering) Sam Drake .Thus is launched a whirlwind adventure that takes you fom Panama, through Europe and Britain, and eventually to the tropics. You travel across a variety of different landscapes and settings, all in search of this lost treasure, the treasure always in the next place, just ahead, with Rafe, Nadine, and an army of PMC goons either hot on your trail, or already there ahead of you trying to find the treasure only for you to sneak in under their **** game works quite well, with a plotline full of lies, betrayal, tests of people’s bonds (both of friends and family), and of course, a lot of bloodshed. You end up gunning down a","uncharted 4: A Thief’s End wraps up Nathan Drake’s epic saga in the most epic way possible . the story, in my opinion, was horrible . i'm a huge fan of the game, and this is the best uncharted by a long shot ."
127.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,"Thats the best Smash game ever so many Charakter, so many stages and so mutch fun. My only Problem is the online mode, both Players need a clean Connection and when not than it's laging very hard.. The BEST smash bros game of all time and maybe even best switch game, 100% worth downloading although I'd work on the dlc and price. This is a game that is fun at times, but usually is pretty bad, the only way to enjoy yourself is if you’re good at the game, or fighting people who aren’t good at the game.. **** online. Like terrible. Doesn’t matter how good your WiFi is, it literally is terrible. Don’t waste your money on this game.. a must have game for any switch owner story mode is great classic is fun online is still active top 3 switch games maybe even on my top 10 of all time its just pure addictive gameplay. It's just a really good Smash game. I'm not really a fan of this franchise but I've had my fun with this one. Online play is always a nightmare for me and the story mode isn't the best. (I love the sub space emissary from Brawl). It's super fun to play with friends! Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is definitely the first game I boot up when I have friends over. Would recommend!. Super smash brothers ultimate is one of the best fighting games ever. The wide variety of characters, stages, music and other options to play the game provide endless replayability. besides being a great party game, this game is one of the best party games ever due to the before mentioned variety in characters, but also because of the items included in the game. This is the game that made me buy a Nintendo Switch, and it is the game that keeps me coming back to it. Smash Ultimate isn't perfect, but it just makes me so damn happy. I, like many others, grew up on this franchise, and to see it the biggest it has ever been is just amazing. The events surrounding the game, like the Fighter's pass additions and reveals is as significant to the experience of the game as playing it, which retains the greatness of the previous entries while striking a good balance for both casual and competitive players. Yes the game has areas where it is inferior to other versions, like World of Light not being as interesting as Subspace Emissary, the Spirits not being as cool or information-focused as trophies, but the rest of the game is just so massive and loaded with content that it is more than forgivable. I believe that Smash Ultimate is as close to the series' full potential as it can possibly be, and if this is the last Smash game ever, I would honestly be fine with that.. one the only fighting game I've played and i'd be happy if it was the only one. i love all of the characters and modes. This game is amazing. The character roster provides a great variety of playstyles, the gameplay is fun, the stages have some nice variety, and the soundtrack is outstanding, both with the crossover tracks and the catchy main theme. I can play Smash Ultimate again and again and not get bored. It is truly an ultimate video game.. 8.9/10. There's nothing like getting some friends together for some chaotic, occasionally hilarious smash bros battles and this game has the most content of all of them. The new single player World of Light mode is pretty fun too.. its called ultimate for a reason. I got 1.5k hours of my life clocked in here, this game is awesome. whether I'm fighting online, or playing with family, or even watching the competitive scene (Marss is my goat), this game is just a (mildly rage and stress-inducing) delight. My respect for Sakurai is unbelievably strong. This game blew my mind. The roster was insane from JRPG character like Cloud and Sephiroth from FF7, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, and Joker from Persona 5 all the way to characters from fighting game like Terry from Fatal Fury, Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter, and Kazuya from Tekken. This is such a great game to play with the family as well.. its amazing but no more charechters so no one can do there banandana waddle dee vs mario or rayman vs donkey kong. Awesome game, the music, the MATERIAL include in this game is insane, love the spirits thing. The best smash bros game. The roster is amazing. Great music and such fun gameplay. This game series is so good that all other platorm fighters basically fail. This is THE GAME.. Why only a 9? Because DLC characters like Kazuya and Steve are frustrating to play against. Other than that: Huge roster, a lot of stages, an absurd amount of soundtracks and so many items. I don´t really know, how Sakurai will make a ""better"" Smash in the future.. It’s not as entertaining or nostalgic as Smash for Wii U was for me. Imo. The best fighting game in history and even after so many years i still have fun with this game.. WOW. Best crossover ever, screw Fortnite. It's infinitely fun and replayable, not to mention a roster balanced to near perfection despite its massive scope. With a more solid single-player offering, it could be one of the best games ever, but for now, it's the finest entry in one of the consistent series in video games.. Boring as f after a while even with a large roster of characters,gameplay too basic almost a copy of digimon rumble arena 2,only reccomended if youre a nintendo and switch fanboys,whenever new characters being introduced as dlc theyre so hype like its a second coming of jesus,i never understood why,very not reccomended if youre used to play fighting games like sf/tekken/doa/mk/sc,etc. The magnum opus of the Smash franchise. A love letter to its fans. With great combat and the largest roster of characters (including all from each previous game) this is the Smash game we all wanted.. Best fighting game of all time change my mind This game has the best character roster of any game ever, its a celebration of gaming as a whole and I'm so excited for the next entry. With that being said while the roster is great, don't sleep on the movement and attacks. Each and every character in this game is not just great for being in the game, but great because they're all unique and special. You can pick up and master a character for a week, and then put them down and pick up one of the 88 other characters!. Practice mode is a joke compared to other fighting games. Not balanced at a high level and Nintendo does not support the competitive community.. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the very very very good Nintendo switch game.. Basically no Tutorial. To hard for new players, not fun to play, too many menus.. good game. definitely recommend it, when I played it on my sister's Nintendo switch, I loved it.. As of writing, I have over 1,700 hours playing this game, and I cannot stress how enjoyable of an experience it is. It's a both a party and fighting game title, where you deal damage to opponents to build up their damage, before launching them off-stage to gain points, and I've found it to be a very enjoyable experience! Firstly, its graphics far surpass any of its predecessors, looking extremely detailed and polished, alongside classic and new sounds alike being edited perfectly for the newest instalment of the franchise. This is also one of the largest gaming crossovers of all time, with each character having an expressive move set that represents their original game despite the large roster. This also come with the possibility to play with up to 8 players at once, on stages that you can customise in the stage builder. The game has many different things you can do, whether it be unlocking all of the characters, playing through 'Classic mode' and attempting to reach the top score of 9.9, the story mode which involves fighting your way through the corrupt fighters to take down the final bosses, Galeem and Dharkon. There are over a thousand unique spirits and custom battles to be had, with deep strategy and puzzle-solving mixed in-between. The online feature allows you to fight opponents all around the world to gain GSP (Global Smash Points) to make your way to Elite Smash, giving player an ever higher goal to reach and being a difficult but also thrilling adventure. There are also different DLC packages that allow you to unlock new fighters such as Joker from Persona 5, Hero from Dragon Quest, and Kazuya from Tekken. These packages are not only worth he price, but also give you new stages, music tracks, spirits and a larger cast of characters to play with. Despite its praise, the characters can feel quite unbalanced despite their move sets being expressive of their games. I found in my time playing that there are certain characters that are simply better than others in ways that can make the game unenjoyable. Ganondorf from The legend of Zelda series for example, has strong attacks but is sluggish and hard to get back onto platforms with, while characters such as Sonic the hedgehog and Steve from Minecraft are dominant for having nearly every option that Ganondorf doesn't have. This comes alongside an online experience that has its own faults, such as servers randomly shutting down, randomly being kicked out of spectating matches or there being no punishment for players who rage-quit in the middle of games. Despite its downsides, I'd still rate this the best smash brothers game in the series and highly recommend it to you! It's absolutely worth the price and you is relatively simple and easy to get a hang of.. It's Fun It's Memorable a good game I love how they balance a characters this game should have more stuff but all in all a really good game and amazing too. This is one if the best fighter games for a while, me personally I’ve never played online but the world of light, plus co-op, plus challenge mode is extremely enjoyably Nintendo did a great job with balance i think and should make another smash bros when they release a new console. Very good game would recommend. 9/10. Very fun fighting game, with its incredible roster you'll never want to stop playing this game!. Bringing back every single character was something absolutely nobody expected, but I think it paid off. When it comes to newcomers, we didn't get that many with the base game when compared to the other games, but we pretty much got everyone we wanted (ridley, k rool, belmonts, inkling, etc.) Plus the DLC adds in a ton of characters that were also highly requested. As for the gameplay, it's smash. Do I need to explain why smash is fun? The only real issue with this game is the lackluster online. Worth a buy.. In the World of Light (story mode), the look of the map is horrendous to be honest it's like a map of PS1, they didn't give Ƒ*ck about it. A fantastic culmination of all the games in the series that came before. All the characters, both new and old, feel distinctly unique to play with a lot of imaginative abilities. Great fun with friends in particular!. Could have used a better story arc, but I absolutely love the game other than that.. It's quite simply the best fighting game I've ever played ! There are 72 standard characters in the game. The graphics are excellent and the speed of the game is almost on a par with Melee. It's easy to pick up and is perfect for casual players or tryharders.. i really liked this gaem when i had the nintendo switch but unfortunately i cannot playb it anymore becauze my switch is broken :(. I haven't played a Smash Bros. game since the original on N64. I doubt I'll play another one after this. I don't find it entertaining. I said this about Mario Kart and I'll say it about this game too. You people who play games like this competitively need to do something more constructive with your lives like planting trees or picking up garbage on the side of the road.. This game really is the ultimate Super Smash Bros. experience. Every detail has been carefully crafted to make it one of the best fighting games and overall video games ever made. Although the story mode may be a disappointment as it lacks replay value, the game makes up for it in many ways. It features a diverse roster with every character from the series, numerous levels, a wide selection of original and revamped music, and fighting mechanics that remain sharp even after being released seven years ago. It is a must-have for every Switch owner.. Nintendo really dosen't make games worth 60 dollars. They only mostly market towards basement dwellers.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. THE BEST FIGHTING GAME, IF NOT THE BEST GAME THAT WAS EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!!!! UNLIMITED FUN!!!!!!!!!!!. Get Your Hands Off Of My... CAWWWWWWWWW I Belive In King K. Rool Superiority Im Also One Of Those Deranged People Who Got Every Spirit. Best chapter of the series reached the peak of excellence, undoubtedly one of the best fighting games ever, if not the best. The variability and the range of characters (also considering those from the DLC) is immense. The story takes well and makes an (obvious) mix of ever-changing plot and fights. My friends come over to my house to play video games sometimes, and out of all of them, smash bros ultimate is the one we play the most. Its a masterpiece, one of the greatest games ever made.. Love this game, best arena fighter ever. I wish I had more to say except, if you have not played this game, you need to.. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is Sakarai's sendoff from the Smash Bros. series, and oh boy, what a send-off it is. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a arcade fighting game where the playable characters are video game characters. With 89 playable characters from across numerous popular franchises, there is a character in this game for everyone. Do you like Minecraft? You can play as Steve. Do you like Legend of Zelda? You can play Link, Zelda, or Ganondorf. Hell, do you like Persona? Joker is a playable character. Along with this, there is also a long campaign, known as World of Light, that also has easily over 50 hours of content. Amazing game, 9/10. im not sure if i can give this anything higher than an 8, which is fine, not everything has to be a 10, and an 8 is still really positive. its just that 9 and 10 is reserved for my personal favorites, so ill give it the next best. i grew up with smash, first brawl briefly, then smash 4 for a few years when i really got into smash. ultimate is, speaking objectively, probably perfect. there is so much jank in brawl and smash 4 that they thankfully looked at and gave their all to make a perfect smash game. atm i never play this game more than a couple of times per year, but i love watching the coinbox tournaments.. The most compelling, seamless combat to date. The character roster is amazing. When I first played Super Smash (Brawl), I had a whole family to play with and would only occasionally touch online. Smash has always had spammy characters, but now that I mostly play online (don't play with the fam anymore), I can't escape characters that appear to be cheap. In Ultimate I'm specifically talking about the DLC characters. To me they feel like pay to win characters. It's so frustrating battling Pyra and the other DLC characters online.. You must play this game, it has a huge roaster of 89 freacking character, 100+ stages and a lot of freacking game modes (my main is meta knight) this game also has a grand total of almost 1000 motherf******* soundtracks (litteral nintendo spotify) So if you find this game then buy it even if it's for like 100 freacking dollars. Dlc too expensive and bad controls lead to an underwhelming game overall. Also bad online,you literally can't play casually, way too many sweats.. The roster is amazing and the controls are great, this is easilyone of the best fighting games out there, it’s amazing to play with friends and family while playing alone is also great fun. One of the best party games ever. The story mode is great. The world building is stunning. The boss fights are awesome. Really fun to play. Just the perfect fighting game, so many characters that are all great and such tight gameplay. I would love to play this again. Great controlls with a colourful soy cast of characters. 10/10 The perfect fighting game! No matter how hard I try, I can't find anything wrong with this game, other than there only being one Persona character as DLC. Every character from previous games returns in a remade or remastered format with new moves, taunts, sound effects, and more. The characters also have stages and music tracks exclusive to the game to accompany them. The Stage Builder returns, you can use the Switch as an MP3 player??! Story Mode?? They crammed as much content as they could into this title, but kept a consistent effort to make the game high quality and relatively balanced. It functions as a fun party game and competitive fighter alongside many other features that make this game the 10 that it is. Overall, a very easy 10. With a plethora of requested features, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the ultimate way to play Smash.. This is one of the best fighting games in history, it brings so many characters form so many franchises into one place, this game will be remembered for years. Ok, so this was actually my introduction to the smash bros games as a whole, and i've got to say that i absolutely love this game. From the very fun and different maps, to the amazing character selection, this game has it all. Hands down my favourite fighting game ever. And its not only a 1v1 fighting game, it has a ton of different modes such as classic mode, and the story mode, which just adds to make the game better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The character roster is really good and I'd give it an 85-86% I get that Sans is a skin but he should be an actual character everyone agrees. I'd give the story a 90%.. Awesome roster and very indepth mechanics. Don't play without ethernet and that goes for EVERY fighting game/playformer. Well, the story mode of this game is just boring and repetitive. The online is a laggy mess, the only things that saves the game is the roster and the gameplay, which is not the best either way. This game is art. so many characters that play so well from Mario to Persona to Kingdom Hearts. A wide variety of characters, up to 8 players, the best DLC pack of any fighting game, I'd say this is better than any street fighter Tekken and Mortal Kombat game combined, this game is a God tier pick.. I actually really love the single player campaign, and it's easily my favorite multiplayer experience in all of Smash Bros aside from target test and board the platforms from melee and 64!. Best fighting game, they have so many iconic and great characters, the gameplay is cool and the amount of content is absolutely amazing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing fighting game on the Switch, especially combined with the DLC characters. The only problem I had was the story mode, ""World of Light"", it's not anything crazy good, unlike Subspace Emissary.. The replayability of this game is the online feature. Connectivity for the Switch without a wired connection is unstable without a very high wifi speed. In a game where frames count, this ruins the game. Player rule choice is never really active. As a player who hates items, those matches seem like a waste of time. I would rather wait a full five minutes than play what seems like a completely different game. Oh and the player base is as toxic as any other online game.. This is a really good game to play with friends locally or online. The skill ceiling is actually well made and the story mode is pretty decent. Online can be laggy, but if it isn't, play with everyone you can.. While a lot more balanced than brawl or smash 4 unfortunately the story mode in this game is not nearly as good its just alright but at least the story modehas some really good final bosses and getting to play as master hand or crazy hand or bothi kind of don't remember if it was just one if them or both but that was really awesome! However wherethus game truly shines is the amount of fun characters, stages and music cause there is so many of all of them! And all of them are fantastic! Its truly the ultimate gaming croseover of all times The only other minor complaint I have is that I wish they improved thevase game characters more especially sonic The stage builder is fantastic and it's truly wonderful you can share your stages with others and vice versa in what us escentially a shop where you can download anyone else's stages for free This game has some minor flaws but overall is fantastic. Everybody is here. Awesome fighting game for Nintendo Switch, must-buy game!. Taking out its online disaster, the game has it all, good music, good gameplay and character balance, variety of characters, game modes, a story mode that, although it is repetitive, is a very good addition, and in my opinion, it is the best fighting game of history. Brought a tear to my eye. Great game, especially if you have friends, this game is ON FIRE, the roster has too much characters you could play with, great fighting game, definitely recommend it. I enjoy it in bursts in local multiplayer (online is dead for me and when it works it plays like ass), but after a year and a half of owning it and all the DLC I have 30 hours, most of the characters have the medal in coop classic mode. Mostly do local 2v2. Must buy if you own a Switch. Would be a 10 if story mode had coop.. The Smash series is unique due to the large variety of ways to fight, e.g., to take your opponents' stock. Every play never feels the same. Tight commands make for very challenging combat mechanisms and slick moves. Stage transition with its random elements makes for even more challenging plays owing to paying attention to your surrounding to avoid traps or taking advantage of these elements. 4 player mode is even crazier, even more so with items activated. It's difficult to stop playing once you started. The only small downside, the rare lag issues that happen when playing online.. A good fighting game, some characters are bad and toxic. I **** hate this game.. finally a playable smash game. Has a DLC and is also 99% the same as the Wii U version but with not much more worthwile content.. this game is amazing i love everything about it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really good. This is really the ultimate smash which is **** bad. Diversity of characters is good and bad there's alot of dumb characters in this game. The problem i ran into is that and the stages. Not everyone agrees with the stages in which some like just flat battlefield like and some, including myself, like diversity. Then you have to go through, decide which ones stay or go. Just like items. Some people only like no items. I like some items. SOME. then you go through decide which items to turn off/keep. There's just an abundance of customization that makes it overwhelming. That's the Con everything else is good. Now where do they go from here?. *moan sound*. Best fighter game of all time!. It's a good game for competition. Best crossover in gaming. And no I'm not counting Fortnite.. The game that keeps better with each installment. I don’t know how they pulled it off, but the most impressive roster for any game, ever. Soundtrack is off the chains, plent of tracks from every represented character/franchise. Probably the best $90 I spent on a game and no complaints about paying for the DLC. Hopefully I’ll be playing as Ganondorf in my retirement home. ️. It is one of the games that has made dreams come true, from the roster, scenarios, and other factors. Its gameplay improved considerably compared to its predecessor on the Wii U and has more to offer.. This is a must have game for anyone that buys a switch cuz it introduces you to the world of Nintendo. Smash bros ultimate is suprisingly fun to play, i get **** into it for some reason.. The shield idea ruins an otherwise great old school mechanic of simply fighting and besting the characters in order to unlock them… “A Challenger Appears” was a great concept thrown completely out the window for the new mode but thankfully kept in for the Story mode. Some Story Mode fights are easy but some are insanely hard based on the preset determinations and vary so randomly it’s quite jarring to say the least Other than that the Story mode has next to no story whatsoever save for the beginning cutscene and (haven’t chosen to play through it entirely yet so Idk about ending cutscenes or anything like that) however from what must be around halfway through I have yet to come across any real story… Only played SSBM (Super Smash Bros. Melee) on gamecube so I’ve little to no idea hm story is usually included and seems the main aspect of enjoyment is nearly if not solely focused on the side-scroller/arena style combat and unlocking new fighters. I mean, how cool would it’ve been if challengers were random instead of location based or perhaps even cooler, location-based but, with some actual buildup to essentially be Lords of their domain wherein there could be a bit of buildup or even story which leads up to challenging them and unlocking not only them but the land, shops/gyms/etc (I do not understand dojos and thus never bothered with them). So, so much potential in the next instalments Not really into the Spirit Board soft-locking us out after say hitting a shield and such… sort like the rotation concept because I understand it but why not all them all at the same time? Just makes it extremely convoluted imho Great game series but somethings could be done much better… miss the trophy style collection and overall feel of combat (especially with the final boss/bosses) SSBM had :( Somewhere around 7.2 - 7.4/10 as personally, all the negatives really weigh it down for me. The best fighting game ever. I have over 730 hours on this game and it was one of the first games I owned. This game is perfect.. this is some good **** right here. the only issue is that i got so addicted to the game where i stopped taking showers cause i thought showering was just wasted time. I hate this game because I'm bad at it. I do like that Castlevania finally got some characters though.. When you take all the characters from original games, the best maps and soundtracks you have a perfect game. And thats what nintendo did. In my opinion, this is simply the best fighting game ever made. The most diverse roster, an absolute bucketload of stages, items, assists, spirits- you name it. This game is truly 'Ultimate' in every sense of the word. Sakurai and the Smash team worked themselves to the bone to deliver the utterly definitive Smash experience. Ultimate caters to both diehard Melee players and those just looking to have fun in equal dosages, not to mention bringing in just about every majorly desired Smash character. I remember being genuinely sad when the final DLC came out a couple years ago because of just how entrancing it was to follow the game's DLC. This game never bores, even for a single player experience, and for that I love it so dearly. Apart from a slightly enhanced port (which is of itself very unlikely), I genuinely have no idea how a future Smash game could even begin to compare to this. Truly the Ultimate Smash.. I dont need much to say, but this is more than a 10/10. THE FACT THAT SAKURAI BROUGHT EVERY FIGHTER BACK AND ADDED CHARACTERS LIKE STEVE, SORA, AND BANJO KAZOOIE MAKES THIS GAME THE BEST SMASH BROS GAME EVER MADE!!!. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros. I love smashing my bros.. A lot of characters and an interesting history mode. The artistic and technical aspects could be better.. no **** command move but still make the game hard to be good is very impressive,this is the best fighting game i’ve ever play,the hit sound is absolutely amazing and the effect that when u hit a enemy is soo satisfying,i’ve never play other smash games but i can see the feeling that u hit your opponent and i dosent feel like your actually hitting them,game balance good but maybe make camping play style more punishable.also the dlc decision ing is very weird,i hope there will be dmc5 character in the next smash game instead of just having a mii fighter skin. I hate fighting games like Tekken and the rest because they have such a high standard of skill, it's just not fun. But this... this is something else. The controls are simple, every character has the same button layout. The campaign is simple, fun, and challenging. That's the theme of this game. Fun. I've put in way more hours into this game than I thought I would. I was going to throw it in the corner until some friends wanted to play some games. But it's just as fun solo. Buy it, if you dont like it, sell it on eBay, it will hold its value.. Legit the best fighting game EVER, its the perfect combo, there isn't a person alive who likes fighting games that wouldn't like smash ultimate, its controls feel great, very responsive, and the cast of fighters is diverse, allowing many play styles. The game is overall just excellent.. i mean, how can you do very bad for smash bros. ITS SMASH BROS. it is good!. Really fun game to play with friends or alone (if you don't have any). The gameplay is so smooth, and I like playing this while watching a twitch stream or something. If you don't have it already, I recommend buying it, it's really good.. This has spoilers but who gives a freeg. World of light is massive, but almost too massive, it takes MANY hours to complete. its good for a kid that can only buy one game. The adventure mode also has bosses that are unique and fun to take down. Adventure mode, is only a small portion of the game, however. The rest is great, every character has their own feel and playstyle, so anybody can pick up the controller and start playing. basically, a perfect all in one game. Please fire the critic who gave smash 64 a 20/100. I recently played Super Mario Bros. Ultimate and I must say, it is an amazing game! The graphics are stunning, the controls are smooth, and the levels are challenging yet fun. I love the fact that there are so many characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities. The game also has a great soundtrack that adds to the overall experience. My only minor complaint is that some of the levels can be frustratingly difficult, but that's just part of the challenge. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to any Mario fan or anyone who loves a good platformer. It definitely deserves an 8 out of 10 rating!. The online is TRASH, it has no variety and a lot of delay. What even is gsp. Also has a mid community. Really and truly I cane here just to hate because elite smash was burning my head lol. Fun game tho. This is not just a Nintendo fighting game. This game has an extremely diverse set of characters, ranging from Kirby to Snake. It celebrates not only Nintendo, but gaming as a whole in one of the best fighting games ever.. No Waluigi :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( but its a good game :). + Insane roster of video game icons and stages + Graphics and animation is stellar + Soundtrack is a beautiful, bloated compilation of absolute masterpieces (original + remixed) + Gameplay is pure, crazy fun with a high skill ceiling. One of the best Smash Bros. games. My only gripe is that I think that the Trophies were better than Spirits. I have player the N64 Super Smash Bros and I it is basically the same game... Is it funny? It is. But more of the same.. Super fun fighting/party to play with your friends and family. So many characters and stages to choose from that it will keep you busy for a long time. Characters have many different fighting styles that everyone can play how they want. (Unless you just platform camp as Steve). The problem with the game is World of Light is FAR to long, tedious, and repetitive. You just do the same th","online play is always a nightmare for me and the story mode isn't the best . this is the game that made me buy a Nintendo Switch, and it is the game that keeps me coming back to it . the events surrounding the game, like the Fighter's pass additions and reveals is as significant to the experience of the game as playing it ."
128.Wipeout XL,"Really like this series but what really killed this game for me was that the hover crafts are tied to the different difficulties. It made me so mad I couldn't play through the game on hard mode with Feisar. if I wanted to do that id have to do it with Piranha or Qirex which is stupid. In multiplayer against friends the higher difficulty is just tied to speed class so if you master navigating with piranha it basically negates the rest of the crafts in the game making having different crafts pointless.. AKA Wipeout 2097, improved graphics and handling, more weapons with the ability to kill or be killed by the competition and more forgiving collision detection makes for an excellent sequel that ticked all the right boxes. But once again, the later tracks are too tricky, making qualifying for the league mode - which for my money is the real meat of the game - unnecessarily difficult. Otherwise, it's pretty much the perfect futuristic racer.. Wipeout XL, or Wipeout 2097 in Europe, is one of the best games on the original Playstation and one of the best in the Anti Gravity racing genre. The Good: The visual design is top notch, and in some ways are better than the original Wipeout. Each track and craft has their own distinct look to them and it's really cool to see. The soundtrack is also really great to listen. While the first game's soundtrack is iconic, XL's soundtrack is also just as great. Choosing which one is better is more of personal preference than most. What XL improves massively upon the original game though is the handling and difficulty. Each craft in XL now handles much more responsively, helped by the fact that collisions are more forgiveable and there are more weapons to use at the track. The difficulty is also improved upon, in that there are no more tracks that can frustate any players in the game. Now, it is dependent on the player's skill to beat the game with their choice of craft. While it is still really hard, it is more fair than the previous game. The unlockables are also a treat. There is the usual bonus tracks, but there is also two new challenges to tackle through and a secret craft that is only achievable once all the challenges and races are completed. These content are really nice addition and spice things up a bit. The Bad: If I have to critique one aspect of the game, is that XL's content is a little sparse. Sure you get all new tracks, but the actual track count is barely more than the previous game. The teams are also the same as in the original game, though there is a secret fifth team once the game is completed. This can make the game feeling a little bit repetitive at the later stages of the game, but your mileage may vary. Verdict: Overall, Wipeout XL is a huge improvement over the original game and stands as one of the best games to have on the original Playstation. The lack of content is the only thing that is stopping this game from reaching a 10, because everything else in the game is just great. Definitely worth checking out for anyone that is a fan of Anti Gravity racing genre and racing in general.. This game is a hell of a ride. It's unplayable on modern TVs but with an old one, you get one of the best racing games in history. Overall rating: 9.3.. I'm revisiting some old gems here on metacritic. Wipeout is a futuristic game from the past. You could really feel the speed.. Wipeout XL has everything a futuristic racing game needs. Beautiful and hypnotic levels, cool arcadish gameplay, easy controls and a fantastic soundtrack. There is so much great content hidden in this jewel, that you can spend hundreds of hours speeding the wonderful tracks. An absolute classic!. Wipeout XL (Wipeout 2097) is outstanding including build-in soundtracks and really enjoy it. The game is good. It's cooler than F-Zero X in technical specs. But what a ****? If you have 2 playstation gamepads, you can't play with your friend offline and you need PlayStation Link Cable and original FAT console!","XL is one of the best games on the original Playstation and one of the best in the anti-gravity racing genre . the visual design is top notch, and in some ways are better than the original game . the difficulty is also improved upon, in that it is dependent on the player's skill to beat the game with their choice of craft ."
129.Paper Mario,"Paper Mario is the game that made me realize that the Paper Mario series was actually an RPG series. Despite the fact that my view of the Paper Mario series has completely changed, I really enjoyed this game. It`s a cozy and captivating game with a great battlesystem/soundtrack, unique characters and a story that isn't great but has enough depth to be good enough for a Mario RPG. Overall, Paper Mario is a great game that is definitely worth playing. 8,8/10. Even by RPG expectations, the game goes a bit long for a very standard Mario plot, but gameplay wise, Paper Mario kicks off this side series with engaging partner and badge mechanics, and fun personalities to interact with.. Not just my favorite Paper Mario but my favorite Game ever. I just love everything about it and for some reason just enjoy it more then ttyd (probably mostly nostalgia but i have some other reasons) If you enjoyed ttyd go ahead and give it a try. The Graphics might look a little old but i think it has its own charm. Probably wont ever be replaced as my number 1 Game ever. The first Paper Mario and the best Mario RPG. This game made me realize that JRPG genre, which used to put me off, actually can be enjoyable and relaxing. It has a charming story with funny characters and great gameplay.. Paper Mario is a worthwhile RPG that pays tribute to a previous Mario RPG title, following a simplified formula in the next graphical dimension. It introduces a creative and amusing art blend of 2D sprites with an interactive 3D environment. Although the theme and animations seem cartoony and comical, the gameplay may provide temporary points of challenge for some newcomers to the genre. Gameplay will often test the player's ability to backtrack, recall previous dialogs and environments, and pay attention to detail to advance through the story. The repetitive battle music may be lackluster and missing some epicness, but they still maintained interest with new enemies and abilities.. This fame is a bit **** partners are good and the side quests are packed with collectibles but the bosses are underwhelming.Action commands are tedious and to be completely honest , the story is awful compared with ttyd and spm. Overall , i had fun playing this game and i would recommend , but practise your action commands. A game that has barely aged despite being released on the nintendo 64, one of the best rpgs of all time. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. BEST MARIO GAME EVER characters and levels and story is my perfection on my opinion! I got this even on Virtual Console for Wii and Wii U! Is the best mario game ever i have used! And still i keep playing it every year!. The presentation and the new art style at the time were very clever, as was the diversity of the game world. It has a very unique charm that can't quite be replicated.. As a new player, this game was great. Good fightingmechanics, good dialogue and story, good ""dungeons"". It could have been better, especially in the difficulty level, but nevertheless a great start to the series, being fun nearly all of the time. It hypes me for its sequel's remake (which I never could play, not having a GCN).. A wonderfully nostalgic game that started the love fans had for a specific gameplay style, which holds strong to this day. The classic and stereotypical Mario game story is told in a better way. The game is charming throughout its many strengths, and has very few flaws. It deserves to be rated in the high 9's, if not that perfect ten.. Just the best entry in the series. All chapters are so good, the mechanics are great too, the partners are all amazing. I love everything about the game, there is nothing it could improve upon.. A game that aged excelently well. A nice and relaxing RPG with an interesting artstyle resembling paper. The characters are cute and funny and the story, although simple, is captivating. The kind of game that you could play today and don't feel that you are playing a 20 more years old game.. The original paper mario game is still a genuinely fantastic game and it's a shame it only got 2 sequals on par with it and all the paper mario games after the first 3 are not nearly as good as the first 3. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER KNOWN TO MANKIND. ABSOLUTELY STUNING FOR THE TIME IT WAS RELEASED. EVERY SINGLE GAME COMPANY SHOULD POUR IT´S LOVE AND CREATIVITY IN THE GAMES THEY MADE THE SAME WAY PAPER MARIO 64 DEVS DID. 11/10. THIS GAME BROKE MY SCALE.. Paper Mario is the first paper Mario game and it was fun for me a lot and the fighting system I really liked this game so this will always be a childhood favorite. Excellent game, the story is good, but what's great is the gameworld and gameplay. Action Commands make the battles feel more interactive than typical role playing games. Overall, I recommend this, but play it on Nintendo 64 or the Wii, the Switch version has a severe bug that can potentially permanently damage your console memory.. This game is really fun, but the lack of a post-game really disappointed me. I wish I could have explored the world more!. Set a great standard for the next Paper Mario game and has a beautiful artstyle, memorable characters, and fun and unique gameplay.. The best Mario game that Nintendo has ever created, I'm not a big fan of RPGs and turn-based games, but this game is unbelievably good, in my opinion. It's the best N64 game and the best RPG ever made. The characters are charismatic, the game's graphics are beautiful, the world is huge and full of things to explore. The turn-based battles can be a bit repetitive, but you can just play while ignoring the enemies, and I dare say that the soundtrack of this game is the best soundtrack Nintendo has ever made.. It's a blast from my past and it held up surprisingly well. It's definitely basic for a turn-based rpg but that was exactly what I wanted for a low-stakes ride.. Best RPG in the Mario series. Addicting battle system, charming likable characters, great soundtrack, memorable bosses, and a nice feel good story. This game’s artstyle has also aged incredibly well. Arcade RPG and forerunner to the Mario & Luigi games on the Nintendo handhelds, it's a little simplistic but makes up for it with some gorgeous visuals.. This game is basic and simple in the best ways possible. It's wackiness is just incredible. The art style is great and It just does a good job with the mood. If only there were more RPGs like this game.. Paper Mario is often overlooked to its sequel. It’s my favorite game, and I’m here to rectify that. Because Paper Mario is one of the greatest video games ever, and the best game of the N64. It’s plot, while being simplistic, really is great. Bowser had kidnapped Peach, but also imprisoned the Seven Star Spirits who grant wishes. Mario needs to travel around the world and save them so he could save Peach. In this day it is kind of bad, but you forget that you’re trying to save Peach when you’re trying to save the Star Spirits. This game was made for beginners in mind, so a lot of the standard RPG elements aren’t here. You have two moves, jump and hammer, and you have to time a certain input to do more damage. The damage is also greatly simplified. In EarthBound, you deal hundreds of damage. Here, you deal up to 6. The enemies have less HP then you’d think, and you deal less damage then you think. You also have partners, but you can only have one out at a time. They each have special abilities and you really are going to need all of them. My favorite is Kooper, because he has an interesting design and personality, but I still loved all of them. The graphics are bad only if you’re highly allergic to cuteness. Instead of going with a weird, polygonal look, they went with a paper-y style. This game looks different from the other games in the series, but that’s not a bad thing. The music is also very good, especially for an N64 game. There is about 15 hours of story, but usually you don’t find everything until you’ve played it 3 times. It has two very long side quests. It’ll take you about 30 hours to 100%, but I still played it 3 times. It’s just a personal thing. Despite its age, this remains one of the best games. Compared to other N64 games, this one is the cutest and probably the best-looking. Best N64 game- or best game ever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my favorite game of all time. Everything in this game is near-perfect, or at the very least, pretty good. The story is basic, but good, even if it's not as deep as that of TTYD and Super Paper Mario. While its not too graphically impressive today, it still looks pretty nice, especially Chapter 7. The enemies are also very well-done. There are some annoying ones, like the Hyper Clefts, Groove Guys, Clefts, Amazyee Dayzees, and Crayzee Dayzees are dreadful to fight, but that's such a small number in comparison to how many enemies there are in this game. Clubbas, White Clubbas, Gulpits, Frost Piranhas, Putrid Piranhas, Duplighosts, Ruff Puffs, Huff Puffs, and most of the Shy Guys are some of the best enemies in the game. And then there's the bosses. Goomba King and General Guy, while nothing special, are good. The Koopa Bros. are great, and then literally all of the other bosses in the game are some of the best in the entire series. Tutankoopa and Tubba's Heart are in my top ten, Lava Piranha is in my top 5, and Bowser, Huff N. Puff, and Crystal King make up my top three. Then there's the chapters. The original Paper Mario has the best chapters in the entire series. There isn't a single bad one here. Chapter 8 I'm a little mixed on, the Prologue is a good introduction, Chapter 1 is an even better introduction, Chapter 4 is good, though it does have some backtracking that holds it back, Chapter 6 is a similar story to Chapter 4, but slightly better since it has a way better boss, better music, and I just like it better, Chapter 5 is simply a really solid chapter with a few annoyances, a few fantastic parts, but mostly just really good, Chapter 2 is in my top five favorite chapters in the series, I really like getting to thoroughly explore Mt. Rugged for Parakarry's letters, Dry Dry Desert is vast with tons of different rooms to find, Dry Dry Outpost is my second favorite town area in this game, and Dry Dry Ruins is my third favorite Dungeon in this game, Chapter 3 is also in my top five favorite chapters in the series, Forever Forest is a really cool and creepy are and is Lost Woods done right, Boo's Mansion is a really fun mini-dungeon, and is in fact the only mini-dungeon in the game, with just puzzles and no enemies, Gusty Gulch is a simple but fun area, Tubba Blubba's Castle is my second-favorite dungeon in the game with lots of fun stealth sections, Chapter 7 is in my top three favorite chapters in the series, I love the Penguin ""murder mystery"" in Shiver City, like Gusty Gulch, Shiver Snowfield is a basic but fun area, Starborn Valley gives some more depth to the stars, Shiver Mountain is another awesome area and the Crystal Palace is the best dungeon in the game.. I started to play this game at 35y old, for the first time, whit the extra pack for Nintendo switch. The game is just awesome. I just collect the first star, at the moment everything is fine. Thanks Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 games!!! As a kid i was a playstation boy, now whit my own money i can play everything.. I love the the paper mario series and this started it all. There is so much to love about this game. an absolute masterpiece. an all time classic. it's a shame that modern paper mario games have to ****, but the first 3 games were amazing, and this is the one that started it all.. An absolute must-play blast from the past. Overall, this game feels like it was released yesterday. This game is incredibly finely crafted and is one of my favorite games of all time. Where this game shines the most is in its combat. It's turn-based but manages to feel super quick and snappy. I have a lot of problems with other RPGs where the combat manages to feel slow, clunky, and unrealistic. But I don't have that problem here. Plus, the inclusion of badges adds a ton of layers to the game, with badges being able to complement one another and whatnot. The partner system is also very well thought out. There isn't any partner that is broken or is clearly better than any other. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and this leads to even more strategy in battles. The level design is fantastic as well, with any environmental puzzles striking a great balance of difficulty. All areas are uniquely designed and all have their own tricks, enemies, and other characters. The soundtrack is the second-best in the series. It is very close behind Thousand-Year Door, and it manages to be incredibly catchy. It has some of my favorite themes out of the Mario franchise as a whole. Overall, I think this game manages to be simple enough to where anyone can play it, but it has a lot of extra depth for those who want to experience it. In fact, this is probably the perfect example of making an accessible game. You can get by doing the bare minimum in this game, not using badges, pulling off difficult moves, etc. But you're greatly rewarded for doing these things, and it makes for an incredibly fun experience. Paper Mario 64 is Nintendo at their absolute best. It shows their creativity and willingness to experiment. I wish they did more games like this nowadays. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Playing in 2021, it has some of the nicest graphics very beautiful art direction. Possibly the best single player rpg, badge system is addictive, lots of unique characters to play. Good simple story easy to,follow. Right from the beginning to end lots of action. best Nintendo game ever made.. While I still enjoy the aesthetic of Super Mario RPG a bit more, Paper Mario is overall the better game; as it offers key improvement to many facets of the game's design. The battle system is more digestible and user friendly, while still remaining difficult enough to be engaging. The characters, world, and music are all top quality, and apart from a few minor pacing issues everything falls into place perfectly. A truly phenomenal game, it really is a shame Nintendo isn't making Mario RPGs of this caliber anymore.. What are change from Super Mario RPG. This review comes so many years after the release. And its because this game is such a treasure. And especially in you look at where the franchise has gone after Super Paper Mario its only fair the give this game the love it deserved. Let's start with the negatives and build up CONS: -It's a bit childish and simplistic at times -some of the puzzles are a bit simple PROS: -While a big departure from the first Mario RPG, this game is standing on itself -Combat is very clear with low numbers and a health bar -THE BIGGEST PRO is the buddies. Goombario is the first buddy you make an throughout the game you get partners who you can choose from, this is a big improvement from the original game where it was more linear. -the worlds are unique and yet familiar -The difficulty goes up as you play, but never in an off-putting way. -The length is perfect, when ur done it feels like you played a good game. I was looking forward in playing all the sequels of the Paper Mario franchise, but in the later instalments it just doesn't feel like the same game anymore. Super Paper Mario is a big change combat and partner wise, but you still level up. Who knows where the future of this franchise lays now they we can't get partners that have modifications or characters specifics like gender anymore on the request of Miyamoto.. Have beaten this game over and over does not get old. Has everything you could want in a RPG. Fun, strategic boss battles, very little grind and back tracking. Ughhh the memories were amazing.. Bursting with charm and humor. Good - The dialogue and cutscenes are charming and hilarious. Really gave life to the whole mario universe. - the combat was a lot of fun. Vvarious QTEs were challenging but fun to pull off, but not too punishing to the point where I would get frustrated. - The character and level designs were diverse. Never was there an area or population that felt repetitive. - I loved how the items all had an image shown with it. It made the whole game more visual friendly. Unlike many RPGs where I feel like I'm scrolling through walls of text to manage items. - The Peach segments were funny, and was a good step away from the Mario gameplay. - Partner abilities in and out of battle were fun to use. - Travelling with the spin move gave me something to do to move faster, which made traversing a little less boring. Bad - nothing. Love this game a wonderful rpg for fans of the Mario series. Well worth playing for rpg fans. some of the best damn level design, fun ass rpg gameplay, yes plesae thank you come again. While it does not reach the same heights that later entries may reach, Paper Mario's addicting gameplay and great art help it stand out as more than just a Mario spinoff, but as a genuinely great game. It did simplify its battling system a bit from its spiritual predecessor, Super Mario RPG, but it makes up for this with an engrossing badge system that is full of variety for players to play whatever way they want. The story is nothing remarkable, but gets the job done in a simple, satisfying way, and ties everything together properly while not being overly intrusive.. My favorite game ever! A true Nintendo classic and I wish the games would return to form.. In my opinion, this game is better than its sequel on the GameCube, The Thousand Year Door. This game knows exactly how to make a Mario themed RPG, and while it's not my favorite in the series, it is still absolutely worth playing.. The start of the Paper Mario RPG Series and wow, what begining! I love the gameplay it is so fantastic but the story is even better than that. The story is one of the best I've every seen in a RPG (Although the sequel and SNES RPG are more better than that). I could not rocommend this game enough! 10/10. A sound fundamental RPG. While sporting charm, the game is extremely wordy and not challenging at all. The perfect 10's are insanely nostalgic for Super Mario RPG; it also doesn't help N64 had zero RPG competition on its own console.. The best Mario game I've ever played, the characters have personality, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are gorgeous.. Although one of the most important aspects of a rpg is a great story, it does not have one. On the other hand, its fun and addictive battle system makes you forget about it. Essential.. This is a very great game. Honestly, I think this game is way better than Super Mario RPG. While I did enjoy that game, I think this game was even better. It has everything good about Super Mario RPG times 10. It has a very interesting story, fun music, relaxing graphics, and well written characters. But lately, the Paper Mario series in general has been going downhill, but in my opinion, the first 3 games will always be close to my heart as one of the best I've ever played. However, the 4th and 5th game, ehhh, not so much.. Playing this for the first time after almost two decades, I'd have to say that it's quite nice. The game aged well and I can see why it was considered the best of the best for its time. I played and beat Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga twice when I was younger, and loved it to death. Sadly, I genuinely believe that this game does NOT warrant full 10/10 ratings, despite it being ahead of its time. It is at best an 8. The combat mechanics are great and the story is as amazing and goofy as you would expect from any other Nintendo game, but there are a few issues that just can't be ignored. Roaming enemies can be tedious to deal with since they take up time, and it doesn't help that you have to do a lot of travelling on foot which can be hard to endure throughout the game. The game progresses at a slow pace, and movement is slow too. You get tired of the game as you reach the last few bosses, and it feels like the game is dragging on. Essentially, the game is just really, really slow. There are several parts in the game where you aren't given any indication whatsoever as to how to progress, meaning you waste time roaming around blindly until you ultimately give up and read a guide, just to find out that the solution is something you would never figure out anyway. My advice: If you do get stuck, don't hesitate to use a guide. Overall, the game has a solid RPG mechanic and is a breath of fresh air from your typical Mario platformer. The fights are challenging, but not to the point where you'd have to grind. I enjoyed the experience, despite its flaws (but what game doesn't have some, right?).. Terrific Start To A Classic Sub-Franchise Paper Mario is creative, funny, well written, and gorgeous.. This is my favorite game, just where to even begin! I'd highly recommend this game to any gamer out there, it's just a really well done rpg that is just a blat to play through.. Absolutely fantastic. I absolutely loved the world, the design was amazing, the characters were as colorful as the artwork, and the writing was so witty and fantastic. I greatly enjoyed this classic journey, and it's one I'm sure I'll play again someday.. Cast: 10/10 Story: 6/10 Fun: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Recommended ----------------------. A fantastic game that still looks great 18 years later. I got this on the Wii U virtual console, and I am having a great time with it. I am sad I have never tried these games before, but this has gotten me greatly interested in the other games in the series.. By far one of the best games i've played, it has a great story and the gameitself its quite enjoyable, if you dont have one nintendo 64 you can also download it from a wii u if you have one, i highly recommend this game.. it ****, tropes are used, the moves are generic, and the game NEVER ceases to stop crashing every 5 seconds.. This game is just fantastic. I mean the sheer amount of good work on world building/dialogue/story telling is stellar; no PC game would do that amount of good work; it gives the impression that they spend double the budget, explicitly so the can build the story telling on top.. This game was so simple yet it brought so much joy to the mario titles. I never played much of the thousand year door but I have heard great things about it so maybe one day I will go back and try it. This game was so easy, so fun, so colorful, and so simple. The characters in the game were so unique yet so iconic, which wasn't much of a surprise considering that this is what Nintendo does best. They have really mastered this and this was just another game to show it. It really feels like a big world and the bosses are a joy to battle. Definitely one of my top favorite games of all time. The beginning of the Paper Mario is solid, but I would have loved a 3 man party system. + Quirkiness on point + Great Worlds + 2 man party system still better than 1 - 2 man party system not better than 3 - Small inventory can make a man snap. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After the controversial announcement of Color Splash last year, a lot of people started to complain about the series’ new direction and compare it to the first Paper Mario games. Because of that reason, I watched a good number of videos from Nintendo-themed channels talking about how great the original Paper Mario is. So I finally decided to give it a try. It is a Nintendo classic after all, so I couldn’t skip it for too long being a Nintendo fan. My experience with Paper Mario was mostly a positive one. The game offers a pretty fun combat system and a clear structure of objectives: Bowser has imprisoned the 7 Star Spirits in different parts of the Mushroom Kingdom and it is up to Mario to rescue them one by one. Each of the ‘Chapters’, as they are called, is a little plot on its own. The overall story could very well be a part of a children’s book. Bowser is a really funny antagonist. The different regions in the map all felt very lively and varied, especially Toad Town. All of the chapters are mostly fun to play through (Chapter 7 is probably my favorite), and the battle system is simple yet effective. But Paper Mario often felt a bit repetitive to me, especially the combat. Another problem I have with this game is the fact that in most JRPGs, the game is driven by a strong and interesting storyline. Paper Mario’s storyline isn’t strong nor interesting. Basically, no level of seriousness or actual drama is allowed in this game. Everything is always goofy and innocent, and this has a positive side and a negative side. The positive side is that it allows for a lighthearted and humorous game experience. The negative side is that there’s no engaging story to motivate you to keep playing, like in most other JRPGs. As a result, I often found myself with no reason to continue playing other than the desire of just completing the game. But on the other hand, the gameplay was good enough to keep me going. The art style was very unique for the time, and the soundtrack is just lovely. The entire aesthetic design manages to convey the lighthearted and happy nature of the game perfectly, and it is probably my favorite aspect of this Paper Mario. Even though I love Nintendo’s classics, and this is a very Nintendo-feeling game, I honestly can’t see what most of the people see in this game to call it a masterpiece. I’ll remember Paper Mario as a little gem filled with humor, wacky and memorable characters, and a great art direction (soundtrack and visuals), that offer a lighthearted and colorful experience, but nothing more than that. Score: 8.3. I'm not an RPG guy. I really only get into Pokémon, and that doesn't really count as a traditional RPG. Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger and The Elder Scrolls all bored me. But I decided to give Paper Mario a shot. What this game has that 99% of games don't have is CHARM. The character designs, the levels, the dialogue, the music, even the combat. It's all so freaking charming! Everything is so lovable!. A great game to kick off the series. It takes the same basic concept of Mario saving Princess Peach from Bowser and plays it so differently, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Everything about this game, from its Yoshi's Island-inspired character designs, to its pop-up book stylized appearance, to its variety of settings, characters, and bosses makes the game feel very fun and bright. On top of that, the gameplay is very fun. The battle mechanics are simple, but effective, and the badges offer a nice level of customization to how you play. Overall, a very fun and memorable game.. Paper Mario is the reason why the Nintendo 64 wasn't forgotten still in 2001 it was still going but struggling to stay with fans but the game has good story, good gameplay, good music, good rpg mechanics, and everything else is great!. My favourite game of all time. ike it and think it's a real RPG. I don't like the way this series is goig, and I'd like it to go back to its roots. yeah.. Paper mario has a bad story but everything is so perfect except that. Gameplay is awesome battle system aswell. This game is an awesome begining of the series. 10/10 easy. Intelligent Systems has done a great job on this game, if Nintendo didn't have copyright issues with Square, i honestly don't know what would the future games be. The only thing this game is lacking are cons to it, i can only say pros, i sincerely don't know any cons to point out on this game. This game is wonderful, it presented all the original enemies from previous Mario games in a huge diversity, making some of them partners, that's the charm of the game, the title says Paper Mario, so you imagine it's Mario made of Paper, it's true, but it's even more than it. In the overworld, Mario doesn't do that much of actions, he just jumps and use his hammer basically, but thanks to the partners system it doesn't end there, you have to use a partner in a certain moment to progress the story (the story is brilliant by the way), and the badge system is very good too, it makes fighting a requirement to continue to get more and more badges, it felt rewarding. I loved the fighting system, it was the first Mario RPG that introduced action commands at each attack (Except items, also, i don't know if this was a thing on Super Mario RPG), it makes it more challenging instead of only making strategies and using attacks. I also loved the fact that each partner had it's own ability, making it more variable instead of using the same attacks over and over again, it was simply a genius idea, congratulations on that! Great job with this game! I wonder what would happen if it didn't exist, i probably would be enjoying only Mario & Luigi games. This is my 3rd favorite Paper Mario game.. Truly one of the most wonderful games I've ever played. It's story and gameplay are beautifully woven, and although it's systems are simple, they still provide a deep and engaging experience that is still a great challenge. It's so great!. Paper Mario 64 is probably the most memorable game I have ever played in my whole entire life, I still play it today after many many years, I just cannot get enough of it. I play it on the virtual console and it's so much fun. I wish nintendo would make a game that could compete with Paper Mario 64.. The first game in the much-beloved Paper Mario series, and the second Mario game to boast a focus on its story and characters. Paper Mario (known as Mario Story in Japan) remains great even over a decade after its release. The graphics are gorgeous for a N64 game, giving the game a visual style reminiscent of a pop-up book with flat characters, 3D environments and painted backgrounds. The story is enjoyable and a fair bit more complex than a typical Mario game, and each chapter has its own location and sub-plot, meaning you can always expect something new as you progress through the game. The characters are lively and varied, and even many of the minor characters have their own names, personalities and designs. The battle system is a fun, more involved take on turn-based battles that incorporates action commands for potential bonus damage or additional effects, strengthened by the ability to somewhat customize your stats and available moves through equippable badges and partners with their own unique abilities (including on the field, where using your partners' abilities is key to solving certain puzzles). The only reason this game doesn't get a perfect score from me is because it's a little slow to get going, as the early parts of the game drag a bit and it takes some time to gain the ability to use action commands. But if you like RPGs, the Mario series, or games with an enjoyable story and characters, this is absolutely a must-play.. This game was an amazing play to me even after years of having played it sequel. Great enemies and vibrant areas that really get away from the basic Mario stages and characters. The turn based battles are a great benefit to Mario making sometimes nail biting battles when you need to get back to town. It's in my top 5 and I say if you can get a hold of it please try it out.. Don't just assure this as just a Mario game. It's far more than that. The so-called sequel to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars isn't just a sequel anymore... it's a spin-off for its own franchise.. Exciting and fun, simple turn-based RPG battle system that is inviting to younger players, in the same vain as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars on the SNES. Though combat is easy to grasp and keeps you attentive even during the enemy's turn, more experienced players shouldn't be put off by its simplicity. Equipment customization is quite lacking, though as Mario's shoes and hammer and upgraded as you progress through the",paper Mario is a cozy and captivating game with a great battlesystem/soundtrack . the repetitive battle music may be lackluster and missing some epicness . the repetitive battle music may be lackluster and missing some epicness .
13.Super Mario Odyssey,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game. The story is not that great, but the gameplay makes up for it. The idea of throwing your hat and being able to jump on it is odd... but who knew it could make cool jumps and a funny way to fight enemies. If you like the games like Mario Sunshine or Mario Galaxy 1 or 2, I would definitely recommend.. This game defines what a perfect game should be. It features fantastic mechanics, an engaging story, and beautiful worlds. It is hard to imagine playing another Mario game without Cappy, as the movement here feels absolutely flawless. I truly hope Nintendo achieves the same level of excellence with the next 3D-Mario as they did with Super Mario Odyssey.. Nice game but completely overrated, at some point you are in ""New York"" which is basically smaller than times square. As we all love Mario we want to think it's a great game, but it's not, it's a good game and that's it.. I have 100 percented the game and can say without a doubt that this game is a masterpiece. The three-dimensional style of the game mixed with the complex movement and huge selection of worlds makes it feel like it was designed to be as fun as possible, unlike most main-stream games.. My goodness, I love this game. From the bosses, to the graphics, to the music, to the costumes, moons, and captures. This game is perfect.. Even if I must admit that I have a certain preference for Super Mario Galaxy, I must still admit that this game is very ambitious, it has absolutely everything that makes a good Mario charming. The transformations add great depth to the game. Then, the online challenge features are very well thought out. From my point of view, this is the most ambitious 3D Mario to date.. The Mario series was always characterized by how tight and precise the controls were. Every video game system and platform wanted to nail its own ""Mario"", because that was going to be a system seller.Super Mario 64 revolutionized 3D gaming and at the time, it was a big step for the Mario franchise but also gaming in general. However, any retrospective review understands that the game (like many others of that era), while really fun, doesn't hold up today, and the controls are a big part of that. The controls aspect improved quite a lot with following entries. Mario Sunshine, Galaxy and Galaxy 2 all retain that precision aspect that is a staple of the Mario games. But any of them can hold a candle to Odyssey in terms of the **** that's a big reason why Super Mario Odyssey is the best 3D platformer I've ever played. It has a lot of variety, it is fun, but most importantly, it is SO easy to control. Playing Odyssey and going back to the previous games is really difficult. Of course, a game is not only defined by its controls. But Odyssey also has amazing music, great replayability, smooth and crisp graphics, and I can go on. It's one of my favorite video games and one that everyone should play. My favorite platformer of all time way it’s basically like the original Astro bot but better and like Mario 64. I loved this game and I beileive the way that Mario uses cappy to move around the world I think the movement is intuitive and the spice up of using broodals instead of koopalings was a really nice touch and j think the moons are a never ending amount of joy and content. This game is pretty good, I enjoy the capture mechanics and Cappy is a pretty cool companion, and the outfits for Mario are pretty cool, there’s just a lot of stuff to do to 100% the game, which is fine, it gives people a lot to do.. One of, if not the best games of all time. This game is so fun and addicting, I can't just start a new game file and collect one or two moons. I HAVE TO COLLECT THEM ALL. Every time I restart I have something to do for the next week. HIGHLY recommend.. This game is simple yet fun 3D Mario experience, from the bosses to the story and the post game content and replayability, it is certainly a game to try out if you have the opportunity.. Gameplay: Incredible Graphics: 8/10 Controls: 8/10 Difficulty: 4/10 Collectibles: 7/10 Main Story: 5/10 After Story Content: 10/10 Kingdoms: 9/10 Fun: 9/10 Lore: 7/10 Mechanics/Innovation: 10/10 Bossfights: 5/10 Amount of Content: 9.5/10. Genuinely the best 3D platformer. Great feeling movement with 20 years of itteration. Essential console-moving game.. In my opinion, this is the best Mario platformer game. The story is your standard Mario plot but the gameplay is what I find most fun about it.. A refined version of Mario Galaxy: The most timeless game that ever came out in the 2010's.. .In my opinion this is the best 3D Mario game on the nintendo **** game play feels nice and super simple whilst the graphics are super crisp.. This game is just pure fun and wonder. Its a game with movement so fun you simply can't stop playing. If you own a nintendo switch, and you haven't played this game; WHAT ARE YOU DOING. Yeah. It's that good. It's hard to make such a truly perfect platformer, but Super Mario Odyssey absolutely soars in every aspect. The movement this game has is fantastic, its extremely replayable with the amazing exploration. And beyond that, its one of Nintendo's best looking games with a soundtrack that rivals their greatest.. Super Mario Odyssey is a solid nine out of ten. The reason for this is because the game was only like 15 to 20 hours long and I kind of wanted it to be longer, but every other part of this game is perfect.. Super Mario Odyssey is an amazing game with tons of content. You play through the game exploring as you go. Their really isn't any boundaries set for the player. With the games E+ rating, it's great for kids! The mobility options make it really easy to get around the huge kingdoms. With some much to do, I recommend that you play Super Mario Odyssey.. Best game out of the franchise as I have had soo much fun exploring around and seeing different things I haven’t seen but it bar far fantastic and a lot of entertainment.. There is no words that could fully describe how amazing this game **** has incredible story, bosses music and everything, I literally can listen to the song Jump Up Superstar for hours and want more. I can’t believe it but it has been just about eight years since it was released, and I was dedicated to not using any sources like YouTube in order to finish the game, only recently can I say I have one-hundred percent completed every thing. If you dont believe me then go listen to the shiveria theme and watch a speedrun of this game, it never fails to amaze, and the trick jumps you can do are incredible, even if a few of the more memorable ones use glitches, some like the stair skip in Lake Kingdom or the Dino skip in cascade are easy, but just so fun to master, Super Mario odyssey Is the only game I have ever dared to speedrun, but it was worth it getting a time of just under an hour ten minutes. Simply the best mario experience ever. Over shadowed in a year in which BOTW was released butif you pick this up in 2024, you will realise that this game is the meaning of timeless. This game is great with the story mode, the characters, and the graphics, This game is just Beautiful.. In my opinion the best platformer ever. The game is so creative. And every map is a joy to play. Except lost kingdom. I don't like lost, like at all.. The movement in this game feels like warm butter, mario is so responsive that it makes you just wanna go around in circles jumping, running and throwing cappy around, but the game doesnt end there, there is 10+ hours of some of the best 3d mario levels ever made, ready for you to show off your fancy new movements.. One of the best 3d Mario games ever made. I just wish Maro odyssey 2 was a thing.... Mario Odyssey is a great game. It has fun environments to explore and interesting mechanics like capture. It's a vibrant and lifeful world. Most of the good things the game does have been discussed countless of times so I won't go into them here. Instead, I will go into the game's flaws. The game has a few flaws, namely: - Too many filler moons that aren't satisfying nor that fun to find and do - Too big of an imbalance between the easy moons and harder moons. Some moons require a simple ground pound onto the ground while others require a whole platforming section. This could have been fixed with maybe moon shards for the chore-like tasks and whole moons for the bigger tasks. - The challenge rooms are in general bland and uninspired in appearance and a lot of them even look like unfinished tech demos. They are generally not that developed or challenging either. - The game generally lacks in difficulty which is sad, considering this means Nintendo didn't believe in their consumer base's abilities enough.. This Mario is the best I've ever played,Nintendo being creative and very good at making their games amazing, I am very grateful that this game exists, it will convert better than Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No matter any cinematic AAA Titles exist , Mario Odyssey is the definition of video game.. The ULTIMATE Mario game is here. Mario Odessey is the best Platformer/Sandbox game ever created and will grant you an one-off experience. The game has Mario's typically bombastic soundtrack, amazing and diverse worlds with a lot of variety, little minigames, challanges and sub rooms provide even more variety and new mechanics/innovations keep the game fresh and new, as well the great worlds and many power moons that encourage exploration. In addition, there is something special in every world that makes this world unique. Mario Odyssey is another Mario-typical masterpiece that has redefined sandbox/platformer games in its own and familiar way. 10/10. An amazing game but didn't hit the spark you'd want post-final boss, eventually when I realized there was a few parts to the game that would be incredibly time consuming for a less experienced player like me to beat I lost the want to play the game, fun to look back on and will have to play through again.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a good game finally you can be Goomba and koopa mario in open world is the best combinegoof boss the only problem is multi player but I love it. One of the best Mario 3D Games, behind only the Galaxy series and Original 64. Perfect gameplay in interesting level design. Very challenging if you want to complete 100% of the Moons.. I had so much fun playing this game. Mario never felt better. Worldbuilding, soundtrack, content all of this is amazing. The only criticism is that the game is to easy.. By far the best 3D Mario game, even better than Super Mario Galaxy (9/10) and Galaxy 2 (8/10), which I already thought were excellent games. There's just such a gigantic variety of platforming levels and creative mini-games within each world. Every world is incredibly beautiful and so fun to explore.. Became tedious and boring at times but each player has their own game style.. Story 9/10 - Story is simple but the music is really good and the way the game pays homage to Mario history is very well done. Graphics 8/10 - Colorful and interesting locations, able to merge 2D and 3D at times, it was very creative. Gameplay 10/10 - Fun bosses, more challenging than I thought it would be. Movement takes some getting used to. The hat is used in very unique ways. Swinging the controller would do specific attacks. I've never seen that done well in a game until now. Overall 9/10 - Had a blast playing it. It's Mario 64 for the new generation.. this game is the most creative of all games that i´ve played, but like all mario, the story isn´t good. it´s just repetitive, no changes at all, although this game makes it through buecouse is fun.. one of the best mario games out there. this was my first 3D mario game and it was my fav, i hope that nintendo makes a 3D game like this. 9/10. Absolutely superb Nintendo magic, not much to say which hasn't been said. Only critique would be the boss battle variation, which in my opinion was for the most part not only lackluster, but repetitive. This can be excused by the fact that these battles were only a fraction of the content on offer. Otherwise stellar experience.. This is my favourite game ever made, I have spent countless hours into this game on new save files and collecting everything the game has to offer, this is by far the best game on switch and and manny other devices to, this game is a must play. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Mario game of all time don’t know what else to say. All around amazing game.. Despite its tone and vibe and lore, which are all very good and an obvious labor of love, the game gets an extremely reluctant thumbs down from me due to being a generally very short game with very little replay value (given the price of the game) and a very lackluster story.. This is a game that I played when I was young, and I really enjoyed it! it free world is vast, a lot of areas to explore, many content, but what restrains me from giving this a 10, is that after completing the story mode, mario odyssey just becomes a hunt for moons, which is fun, but not actually GREAT video game wise, and an experience is better when theres purpose for it, or if it varys, which is not the case of mario odyssey, so that is why I would not give it a 10. Super Mario Odyssey is a well-crafted game with a nostalgic story combined with a modern twist. The game offers a decent amount of play-time but with large amounts of other moons to collect after the story is finished, and offers a challenging final world to play through. Boss fights are somewhat repetitive, all using the ""Nintendo-classic"" 3-stage bosses, but have enough different quirks to keep them interesting. Overall, another great game from Nintendo, and well worth the money.. I really liked the game and i have done litterally everything. It is a great game despite the fact that it is on Switch and I would definitely recommend it .. Super Mario Odyssey is a great game. It got back on the 3d Mario Sandbox roots and revolutionized them. Kingdoms like Sand, Metro or Seaside were just great! Smaller kingdoms like Cascade also had great Soundtracks. The only downside being the bad replayability value. Still one, if not the best game on switch. Still a 10/10. I honestly believe this is the greatest 3r Mario game ever created. It had everything from nostalgia, to new and inventive mechanics and gameplay. I can’t wait to see if Nintendo can top this.. Best open world game I ever played the gameplay is amazing and story is simple but phenomenal I highly recommend checking this out if you haven’t done so. Too complex and way too challenging for the causal user experience. The mechanics were confusing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game it honestly baffles me that it receives any hate though not my favorite mario game (only beat by galaxy) its a very very close second.. Even though is not my favorite 3D mario game, it comes close to second just topped by Galaxy 1. This is in all regard the best 3D sandbox plattaformer ever created to date (though banjo-kazooie it's also there). This game it's a reminder to why we love viodegames in general, It's fun and charming, it se the bar really high for plattaformers and we can't wait to see what's next for the plumber fuure. 10/10.. The music and visuals are amazing. A must play game for sure. The only thing the game lacks in is that it is really easy and repitieve. It wasn't rewarding for me after collecting so many moons so eventually I was only playing for the gameplay and music. However it is still amazing.. One of the best 3D platformers period. I had a blast, but I didn't finish all the late game optional stuff, because it was just too damn hard and repetitive.. it’s bad in the dark kingdom when I try to defeat topper I DIE EVERY TIME BRO Nintendo is **** rn. I love super mario odyssey a lot! But the final few chapters are a little to hard for kids! Isnt mario a kids game?. This game is awesome, good level design and fun gameplay overall but the reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because despite the wonderful level design the game can become quite boring at times like the desert level and the water level but the city level is chefs kiss. The best Mario has ever felt to control, alongside some of the most creative concepts yet seen in a 3d Mario. Such a superb game. Along with Mario 64 and the galaxy games it shows Nintendo are hard to beat when it comes to platform games. Best 3d platformer ever made ...now we have to wait till next 3d mario game comes... Mario Odyssey is the culmination of every Mario game before it, dare I say every VIDEO GAME that came before it. In an era where 3D platformers all but fell out of relevance, Mario Odyssey introduced plenty of fresh mechanics and worlds back into the mix. First of all, stylistically the game is an absolute vibe. The diversity in all the worlds is so cool, and as an avid hat wearer, I was a big fan of the hat vibe throughout all of the kingdoms. The music and the visuals are all as fantastic as you would expect from Nintendo. The gameplay and controls are so fluid, and the openness of 64 and Sunshine mixed with the focus and theming of Galaxy and 3D world makes for a great time. The capturing mechanics are incredibly innovative as well, though there were plenty of moons that had a lot more potential, which is the game's biggest flaw, especially in the late-game. As a game that is built around collecting collectables, Mario Odyssey's challenges simply are not diverse enough to be that fun to seek out. Each gimmick is repeated at least once, with some of the moons being pretty pathetic. The moons in the Mushroom Kingdom are extremely infuriating to me because they require some extremely tedious tasks and basic challenges that treat the player as if they hadn't been playing the game for 15 hours at that point. Not to mention, the amount of moons Toadette gives you for... collecting other moons. While I appreciate the open-ended level design of Super Mario Odyssey as well, the game isn't big or spread out enough to play that little animation every time Mario collects a moon. Towards the end, it was extremely grating. Some of the captures could have gotten a tiny bit more leverage as well, but despite all of these nitpicks that come with wanting to see 100% of this game, the foundational gameplay perfects everything that makes Mario enjoyable.. i love mario games and this is one of my favourites, if this was the only 3d mario i would be happy. The return of a compelling open world 3D to the Super Mario franchise. A majestic adventure full of variety and challenges. A great game!. The best 3D Mario Ever. This game is the most polished, inventive, and expansive mario game to date. This is a game I can go through and beat to completion and right after want to go back and play it all over again. Yes, it doesn't have as much personality as Sunshine, or a story like Galaxy, but what it does have is by far the best movement in any game. This game is the best mario has ever felt to control and if you have an idea of accomplishing something with his physics, best bet is that you can do it. This games level design and environments are beautiful and fun to even just explore, the moons are the peak of not being intrusive, but at the same time great mini challenges, the bosses while often simple are always fun, and again I cannot stress enough how good this game controls. 10/10 masterpeice of game design and 3D platforming. Play this when switch first come out,its just a mediocre overrated game,theres some creative gameplay variety,but the gameplay not that enjoyable/not above 8,game only suited for people that only know/play mario/pokemon/kirby/pikmin/yoshi/luigi/princess peach in their whole life(in short,a nintendo hardcore fanboy and if youre not one of them,just dont expect too much). So so overrated Kept waiting for it to start and get to the hype everyone talks about. Never came. Boss battles are regurgitated Bunny fights. Worlds feel disjointed, I suspect because of Nintendo bias and nostalgia. You start in the Mario world then you for the first time ever 'randomly' go to the human world and then this woman starts singing its just weird and doesn't fit. This gratefully short snooze fest is merely 7 hours long and padded out with Moon fetch quests which are everywhere and have an annoying cut scene each time. Not everything that glitters is gold. Fun game but after you beat it for the second or third time there isn't much to do. A good plattformer game with nice ideas. But in my opinion, its not a 97% game.. Best game on switch along with the zeldas, and in my opinion the best 3D Mario, if you have a switch you must have this too. Super Mario Odyssey is the very very very very very good Nintendo switch game.. An extremelly good game, every games should try at least once in its lifespan.. This game is good but not as good as the galaxy series gameplay 8/10 graphics 6/10 the hardware really limits what this game could look lik, length 6/10 shoudn be as many power moons. You know the name AIDEN CORR is back for another riveting review. Super Mario Odyssey is a solid game. The level design is well made and the adventure aspect is very well done. Mario Odyssey is one of the greatest in the series. The level design in super Mario odyssey is very well done the diversity of the levels are extremely good, every inch of the map is thought of in these levels honestly the story in each level is thought through and meticulously to the last detail in the game you must collect all the moons to fuel your ship and progress through the game this games levels take you through the story and afterwards makes you explore the map to collect more moons to move on. The game matches its genre very well that's something the Mario games have been very good at and we weren't disappointed. The interface is very well crafted and very creative. The game is extremely well themed and matches it very well. It takes you into the sky and gives you a birds eye view of the kingdoms and the contents within. It's a platformer game and it definitely does the job the narrative is the same as always you must save the princess from Bowser, although almost every Mario game is structured like this the way they execute it is completely different. Honestly this game is the best I've ever played. Just perfect ! Very fun to play, not really hard but there are some challenge, always very ****'s a must play.. A very fun, adventurous and interesting game. It has a ton of surprises and is one of my favourite Mario games ever. It is an absolutely must play for those who love adventurous games and are a fan of Mario. It been an over half a decade since the release of Mario Odyssey as I’m writing this, and it’s as clear as ever now that Mario Odyssey is a special game. After a period of bland, safe, and generally uninspired Mario. Odyssey reinvented what it could mean to be a Mario game through its colorful worlds and amazing movement. While Odyssey has soured for some, there is no denying the impact Odyssey has had on the present, and the future.. With over 200 hours in this game, I'll happily say that it's easily one of the best games I've ever played. The storyline is alike other previous titles, but with the twist that Bowser plans to marry Princess Peach, leaving Mario to save her. He travels between kingdoms to both save them from the koopa troops, and attempt to save the princess in time. The game constantly rewards you for going out of your way and finding convoluted ways to proceed, while also having cosmetics that any classic fan of the series would love, rewarding a players curiosity. The graphics are also incredible, with each area looking so fleshed out and saturated that you don't want to take your eyes away. The bosses are unique for a Super Mario title, from fighting powerful rabbits to enormous dragons, with the official soundtrack making every moment even more enjoyable. This is genuinely one of the best games ever made and you'd be a fool not to play it.. The best game on switch I ever played. Level design 10/10 Music 10/10 Art 10/10. This game is unbelievable good. Lots of nice worlds and wonderful gameplay. nintendo at its best.. My favorite Mario game with exciting levels and mechanics. The worlds are so interesting and immersive with much to do so you'll never get bored. a game that isn't anything to special when it comes to story but also revamps Mario and how the games work in every which way and allows room for new fresh ideas. perfect game nothing really to say it's flawless the best mario game ever made. Its a drug, be careful …………………………………………..::..::::::::::::::;;:;:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;. Absolute whimsey, joy, and wonder incarnate. Everyone must experience this game at least once in their lives so give it meaning.. Score: STRONG 8 = 8,7 I have to say that i was never a mario fan, so its my first mario game. i didnt know what to expect or if i would even like this game. but i was surprised, the game has lots of creativity, good soundtracks, nice designed open world, fluid movement. its the most creative game i have ever played in my life. and what i also like is how the levels change after you keep playing it opens new areas that you can explore. oh, and collecting in this game is very fun too. i understand if longtime mario fans give this game a 9, but for me personally, there is more a game needs to be a 9 or higher for me.. I love this game so much even after 7 years. Artistic direction, sound design, sound track, level design, gameplay, everything is smooth and so great ! At first time, I was not conviced by Broodals, but their fighting patterns are good and I finally appreciate them. Sometimes, I want to play it again, but I have sadly nothing to do anymore in the game. I really hopea great game as this one for the next Nintendo console. Why not with Donkey Kong ?. Masterpiece. One of the best collectathons and 3D platformers humanity has ever seen. The inclusion of Cappy opens up so many opportunities for acrobatic movement which I love.. HOLY **** THIS GAME IS SO GOOD. THE MOVEMENT IS AMAZING AND SUPER FUN TO PLAY AROUND WITH AND SPEEDRUN. CURRENTLY GOIGN FOR 100% CAUSE ITS JUST THAT GOOD.. THIS GAME IS A MASTERPEICE! im not kiding! Good moveset CHECK, good bosses CHECK,Good story um not good thats the only thing that not good. I REALLY RECOMENDED!. **Super Mario Odyssey: A Masterpiece of Platforming Excellence**Super Mario Odyssey, released for the Nintendo Switch, is a testament to Nintendo's unparalleled expertise in creating engaging, innovative, and utterly delightful gaming experiences. Here’s why it deserves a perfect 10/10:**1. Innovative Gameplay Mechanics**The introduction of Cappy, Mario’s sentient hat, revolutionizes traditional platforming.

Tried 2 player multiplayer with a friend but it didn't work as well as the 2D Mario games. Super Mario Odyssey is by far the best plataforming super mario bros game so far. It is an acessable game for everyone who enjoys 3d platforming,The different worlds, graphics, captures make this game awesome. One of the best if not the best super mario bros game of all time.. Personally one of my favourite games of all time. While I don’t play it anymore I like the collectathon genre very much.. Personally not my favourite Mario 3D game, but it still is an 8 out 10 game thats how good and consistent Mario has been since he was born, level design is amazing, creative and cool new mechanic for Mario, colorfull and beautiful looking graphics despite the switch hardware limitations, it's honestly a very impressive game and I really hope Nintendo keeps this quality standard for the next Mario game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Mario Odyssey is a masterclass in game design, showcasing the pinnacle of what a Mario game can be. The game's sense of freedom and exploration is unparalleled, offering vast, intricately designed kingdoms to discover. The controls are the best out of any Mario 3D game, being precise and intuitive, making Mario's acrobatic moves feel natural and rewarding. Achieving 100% completion is a challenging but gratifying journey, packed with Power Moons, secrets, and delightful surprises. Each kingdom is unique, brimming with personality and inventive mechanics, from the streets of New Donk City to the landscapes of the Luncheon Kingdom. Super Mario Odyssey is a monumental step up compared to previous entries, blending classical elements and neat Super Mario 64 references with innovation to create a captivating adventure that will be remembered as one of the greatest platformers of all time.. i really liked playing this gaem, it almost never bored me despite playing the story over and over, but","i have 100 percented the game and can say without a doubt that this game is a masterpiece . from the bosses, to the graphics, to the music, to the costumes, moons, and captures, this is the most ambitious 3D Mario to date . if you like the games like Mario Sunshine or Mario Galaxy 1 or 2, I would definitely recommend ."
130.INSIDE,"Brilliant game with very strong atmosphere and setting. A very big step from the previous Limbo game.. Fantastic and **** up puzzle-platformer where you're a kid getting shot at. I suggest you play it during the dead of night (as thought it's horror game) for maximum immersion and enjoyment.. Great 2D puzzle platformer with a great atmosphere and a very nice art-style. Visually this game is a **** would make an interesting 4 hours movie.. One of my favourite games of all time. Each time I want to introduce someone to gaming in general, I recommend INSIDE as first experience. Simple, elegant and atmospheric.. It was an experience. No spoilers, no nothing, but if you ever see this game on sale, i would encourage you to pick it up. It's a 2 hour experience that is like no other game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game I've played in recent years. The story, vibe, and lighting as always top-notch, the atmosphere is so good too. It's amazing what they've achieved without a single dialogue or cut-scene. Improved upon Limbo on every single aspect of the game, puzzles here are way more logical. It's a 9,5/10, I just wished it was longer.. very talented work and I am amazed how the genre of these games can be made so interesting and not let you get bored, bravo!. I was, and still am, in LOVE with this game. Played it so many times yet still can't get enough of it nor forget about it. It's genius in so many ways.. This game tells it's dark, mysterious and twisted story in a unique way. This is special!. Amazing experience but a very twisted story. Loved every bit of this amazing game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I enjoyed this game, but I don't see it as the masterpiece many others say it is. The puzzles are fun, the world is interesting and some of the more unnerving moments really land, but I can't see past much of what it just presents. Nonetheless, I'd definitely recommend this puzzle or horror enthusiasts!. Didn't enjoy as much as Limbo but still a great game!. I got stuck after 30 minutes. I know I could search for help in the internet but as I borrowed this game and I feel this is not my kind of game I just quited. Nice atmosphere though.. This was the first indie game that i played, and still one of my favorites, from the moment you play start, the game feels mysterious, and you want to learn more about what is happening, and why you are there, and that makes you play the game from beggining to end in one sit, that it is not that long. It is also a great game if you are entering in this indie genre or if you entering in the video game world as a whole. great game. In the game I am literally: #manipulator #puppeteer #manipulation #interests. It's Dragon's Quest. Art is really good, but you don't actually do anything. So far as I can tell there is never an indication of what you should do, which is odd since all you can do is go right left, jump, and grab, or occasionally swim. Do you run out into the head lights or not? Sometimes you do. So pick one at random. If it doesn't work, do it again and pick the other one. Now run to the right. The wall in front is too high, run back the other way. Is it a cliff - leap of faith. Were you not supposed to leap of faith /this/ time? Then pick another thing at random to do. And on and on, long bouts of running and then interacting with one object in a scripted way or walking in a specified way. That's the game. There's only ever one option. How do the designers want you to interact with it? That's not a puzzle and that's not strategy. I submit it's just stupid. It's like a two piece jigsaw ""puzzle"" that you're trying to put together blindfolded. Have the user keep his mouse in this circle, that could be your next game. It's a cool senior CS game design project I admit, but you should've given it away not charged $20.00 for it (though I did get it on Game pass). So I played some of what should have been your short film and participated just as much. Might as well have written a text adventure that's just pushing ""X"" at regular intervals.. Simple and catchy.. A game that can be beaten in a matter of a few hours, but will stick with you long long after that. This one is a thinker. Do yourself a favor and play it.. Playdead’s Inside is a brilliant and unsettling puzzle-platformer. The game is short, lasting only three hours, which may make it seem expensive, but it compensates with a haunting atmosphere that is amplified by the sound and art. The game also has many exciting and tense moments that make it very immersive. The puzzles are excellent and always introduce new and inventive elements. The game runs smoothly, but I wish there was a way to run faster in some areas. There are also some shocking and bizarre moments, especially in the later part of the game. Apart from some annoying passages, I think this game is almost perfect, and it is a gem.. The captivating mystery of what you’re experiencing grows just as quickly as your fear of finding it out. Its puzzle/platform nature provides an engaging experience but the strange nature of the things you encounter are the true draw. Playdead does enough to craft a unique experience to their previous title, Limbo, to make Inside feel larger and more looming. The world is home to a unique blend of puzzles in differing environments. Its uses of water and light in a variety of ways require the player to be aware of their surroundings. For a game without dialogue, its use of sound design is integral to the experience. The dark and ominous sound design brings a horror like feeling to your every moment in this beautiful yet dreary world. Sound itself is woven into certain puzzles to blend audio-cues with visual-cues. Depending on the situation the main character even breathes lighter or heavier, deepening immersion. Although the experience is short and leaves much to be explained, the real beauty lies in the atmosphere and world Playdead has created. Its flaws lie in the nature of the game itself, being integral to its character. Inside will certainly go down as a cult classic and one of the best puzzle platform games of all time.. Very similar to limbo in several aspects. Obviously the graphics have improved. I don't know why, but I preferred limbo which I think is better both for the ""minimal"" aspect and for the story.. Amazing atmosphere. A game without any dialogue. a platformer with fun puzzles. Straight out of nightmare. Short and wierd story If you have game pass you should play it. Good: -Story -Atmosphere -Music -Generous normal level puzzles Bad: -Nothing really bad I just feel that there is no more in it. INSIDE THE BRAIN’S PUZZLE BEFORE WE START: Inside is a Puzzle-Platform video game developed by Playdead and published on June 29, 2016. The game was completed 100% on Xbox Series X. BREAKING IN: Inside is an extremely linear title based on silent storytelling through the game's continuous animated backgrounds. The early gameplay stages do not differ much from what the player will encounter throughout the entirety of the story, allowing them to face any adversity from the beginning. Most of the mechanics are highly intuitive, thanks to the simplicity of the usable buttons, the jump and the grab. The dark and macabre setting of the story is easily discernible from the initial deaths, which are quite easy to come across due to the non-trivial difficulty of this title. OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE: As mentioned earlier, with limited interaction buttons, Inside focuses on the complexity of its puzzles, which are almost always distinct from one another but interconnected enough to prevent the player from feeling disoriented. Some sections of the game are quite challenging to overcome without experiencing fatalities, but as it relies partially on trial and error, they never become frustrating or predictable, aided by a multitude of death animations. As the title suggests, the mechanic on which many puzzles revolve is the ability to control other humanoids by entering their bodies, utilized for both platforming sections and structured puzzles. In addition to the extremely linear story, there are several collectibles that lead to highly crafted secondary areas. FADING TO BLACK: Graphically, Inside blends a minimalistic style, employing flat colors and graphics, with a 3D approach characterized by a pronounced depth of field and rich details. The story is entirely conveyed through events in the background or foreground, with people interacting with the game environment or the player themselves, often pursuing them to capture. The background, therefore, is not merely a passive element to observe but always interactive with the current gameplay situation the player is trying to complete. THAT BARK: The audio component is relatively straightforward, with background soundtracks suitable for each passage. BUT WHY 8? PROS: The extreme simplicity of Inside is one of its defining characteristics, making it a relaxing and fast-paced game to play. Furthermore, the puzzles are never predictable or boring, nor too difficult or frustrating. Additionally, the story is as simple as it is effective. CONS: The lack of a noteworthy soundtrack is a significant drawback for such an authorial game, making certain areas feel rather bare and playable without audio with few issues and shortcomings. Additionally, at times, the game feels too linear, with levels that give a sense of déjà vu. RATINGS: Gameplay: 8.5 Music: 7 Story: 7 Puzzles: 8.5 _. Loved every moment of INSIDE. Masterpiece. Like nothing I have ever played before. Well, maybe Limbo :). This is how art is made today. This is the expression of love to the world of gaming.. Impressive execution. Striking art design like its predecessor Limbo, with a similar minimalist narrative, but this one goes to new places. I liked both games, but I think I prefer Limbo, as this game's atmosphere was great but the puzzle aspect wasn't as interesting, even if it was often unexpected.. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment here amidst all these rave reviews. Inside is wonderful for a long stretch. The game is eerie, frightening and full of suspense. Then at about the three quarter pole things start changing for the worse. Despite all these hard core players claims about the game being a cinch, be advised that you may not think so. The puzzles get harder and harder.. Also, along with increased complexity and the inevitable tedium that results, the earlier feel and atmosphere vanishes with some very strange technical and convuluted sets. The climax is so underwhelming that you'll find yourself asking outloud; ""That's it?"". I didn't expect to love this game but I did. First of all, this bad boy is on Gamepass right now and if you are looking for a small masterpiece and an easy 1000g download and play it. This game caught me off guard, it takes a special side scroller to get me hooked but this one did. I couldn't stop playing. You are looking at about 4-5 hours to 100% this game, but maybe 3 to get through the story and finish it. Here are some bullet points. - The visuals and art style are atmospheric and very original. - The story is like one of those weird indy movies that ends in a way that leaves you looking up theories and retrospectives. - The puzzles are some of the best I have ever seen in a game. So fun, so interesting and unique, so rewarding. - It actually is a little chilling at times. You (playing as a child) can die in some brutal ways. This game is a must!. Better than Limbo on every single point. Nice artistic direction, ambiance, thematic, cute and dark at the same time. The twist near the end is interesting but underexploited, and it comes near one cons of Limbo : the end is expeditive and vague. It's a nice indie game to play still.. EN: Another fantastic game from Playdead studio. The aesthetics of the game and the atmosphere, accompanied by a great sound, will guarantee you great and above all mystical fun. The puzzle parts are not frustrating and are perfectly balanced, to make you even more interested in the game itself. Once again - an enchanting game. SRB: Još jedna fantastična igra iz Playdead studija. Estetika igre i atmosfera, koju prati sjajan zvuk, zagarantovaće vam odličnu i nadasve mističnu zabavu. Puzzle delovi nisu frustrirajući i odlično su odmereni, kako bi vas zainteresovali još više za samu igru. Još jednom-očaravajuća igra.. I played through this game after going going into it completely blind. I'm so glad I did as it just made it that much more compelling. It's not a long game, but it is a pretty awesome one. You'll want to finish it once you start.. Man, people are hyping up this game pretty hard. Honestly, the puzzles are boring. The aesthetics have been done before. There's no real narrative, it's just random thing after random thing. The world is cruel, like a Dark Souls. Maybe that's what people respond to so well emotionally. It validates some subconscious feeling of unfairness. Maybe I don't respond to that aesthetic because I don't have that. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out what everyone likes so much about this completely blah game.. Really great game for what it is. I think Limbo is an all-timer and this blows it out of the water, imo. Less focus on puzzles, but the gameplay is more dynamic, the environments are lovely, and the story is compelling.. Thanks to Xbox gamepass I was introduced to this masterpiece. Such a beautiful game and environment. The controls in this game is outstanding and the final part is just insane. The puzzle are smart and satisfying... easily 10 out of 10. A fantastic horror story with simplistic controls that still feel profound due to the thoughtful level design. Art direction, sound design and animations are good and support the overall experience. The story remains a mystery until the last minute and provides the necessary theories. Last but not least. The puzzles are challenging but not impossible to figure out on your own. Inside may be the best game in it’s genre!. I recently played this game because I had been interested in it’s concept. But when I played it I am sad to say it underdelivered. The game features an interesting world and but some bland and uninteresting gameplay at parts and the game is criminally short. It’s still a good game but nowhere near the level that other reviewers are saying. This isn’t a bad game simply a game that is fun but not that fun.. One of the best games I’ve ever played. Constantly surprising, delightfully weird and awesome physics and logic based puzzles. I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to discover this! Everyone should play this game!!. masterpiece great game good gameplay good graphics interesting story i want see more inside games.. I really enjoyed this game at the time, but the ending wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Both this and Limbo are great games to have, and let's hope for better still in the future.. Inside is a good game, the kind of game you play to relax a while between more complex games. The artstyle as well as the graphics are great and work great. It will keep to interested for 4 hours. Unfortunately, as well as Limbo, lacks soundtrack, a good story, purpose and emotion. If you are looking for a metroidvania or a puzzle platform game, this is not the one. Play it only with a great sale price.. Way better than Limbo. There was less death based puzzles and more brain use puzzles but still it wasn't good. Whole game I was asking myself what even is this game and at the end I was just ........... . If you want to play this just download it with game pass. It is not worth buying especially for 5 hours of gameplay.. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 8/10 Story : 10/10 Technical aspects : 9/10 Repeatability: 8/10. Extremely atmospheric game, and it tells its story without any dialogue, so you end up knowing just enough to sort of understand what's going on, but left with enough questions at the end to still be intrigued.. I enjoyed this game, but its biggest pitfall was that I was left wanting so much more, and that was a major detractor. The biggest problem with Inside was it's play time. I was able to beat it within a short few hours and was expecting much more. With all the rave reviews of this game, I felt like it would be much much longer than it ended up being. The story was somewhat interesting. I had zero idea what I was getting into. And it's rare that I start off with a game knowing nothing of the story or what I am about to play, but I wanted to give Inside a fairly blind shot. While the visual storytelling was generally successful, and definitely gave me an idea of what was happening, it always had a bit of a disconnect for me, and the ending completely lost me. I was rather disappointed upon finishing the game. Also having played it, it doesn't feel like it has much replay value either. All that said, the game held up in visual quality, amazing sound and great overall atmosphere. The problem with Inside is that it left me wanting more of all of that, with a bit more of a cohesive story to go along with it, and a different ending. This is worth buying if you can find it on sale for sure, but I wouldn't pay full price for it by any means.. Pretty good platformer but if there was a story there I cannot imagine what it was. This game is minimal in everything. I was hopeful that the end game would the plot but nothing. It started out like somebody being hunted but quickly divulged into what looked like a dream. Really baffling what the purpose was. Overall the biggest issue I had was the controls were never explained and the only settings didn't show all the controls available. Since the puzzles required that you use progressively more complex controls and it was never even mentioned what you could do some puzzle were just confusing until you figured out you could do something that might not even make sense. After that things get a little easier.. short game but very interesting puzzles and this game will make you go, ""whos this, why, whats that, omg, and at the end dafudge"" youll either be happy at the end or sad depending on your perspective. this game leaves alot to be interpreted. Without a doubt, one of the weirdest games I have ever played. If you like an intriguing game that will have you saying ""wtf"" to yourself every 5 minutes, pick this one up and you will be pleased.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I bought this game at 1:00am, thinking i'll play for a few minutes and if its good, continue in the morning. I ended up beating the entire game that night, as i could not put the controller down. This game is an amazing piece of art front to back. The game does not have a single line of dialogue or a single cutscene, and it didn't need either to convey a suspenseful and fresh story. This was hands down one of the best games i've played this year.. Absolutely brilliant game, in every aspect. Absolutely worth its price. I've played Limbo, and I see where all of these is coming from, but INSIDE is better in each way. The atmosphere is terrifying and brilliant. The gameplay is minimalistic and smart. The direction of this game have more storytelling then any other game, without using any words. It is as fun as thought-provoking. Hands down, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Damn...such a unique game I’ve never played a game that’s even remotely similar to this game. It's just so good, I couldn't stop playing until the game was done, such a breath of fresh air in the middle of so many games that copy each other, level design is also so good.. INSIDE is a fantastic interactive story that has me both yearning for more and satisfied with the short story. INSIDE is a gripping tale that makes you hooked from the very start, with its simple platforming of viewing your environment and getting used to your surrounds, turning into what puzzle you need to be solving next, and not having to think too hard, keeping your immersion within the game. A story that is around 3-4 hours long shouldn't be this good, but it is. With 100% ambient sounds following you from start to finish, only a few game devs get this right, and PlayDead has done exactly that. This game is a must buy. Story-driven games with originality are something you shouldn't pass up. It's a highly recommended title in my book.. If this game has peeked your interest, go play LIMBO. I downloaded INSIDE on sale because I enjoyed LIMBO and because it was very hyped. There was one standout moment of brilliance, and I did complete the game. By the end, though, I felt like it was one step below LIMBO in several ways when it should have been an improvement by PLAYDEAD. The puzzles seemed easier and more compact, deaths slower or more obvious, what was happening made less sense, and there was less continuity in gameplay. In at least two points, I was respawned after failing to a location that gave away what I needed to do. For a game rated for a mature audience, a little more sophistication and challenge would have been welcome. This is a slow-paced, linear, puzzle-platformer with a unique but simple art style with maybe a handful of interesting ideas. I did enjoy INSIDE, but it's not fantastic, and I honestly felt like I was just walking forward during more than half of this 5-hour journey.. This is the best game of its genre, hands down. It doesn't technically deserve a 10, but since it's at least a 9 and the best of its genre, in a genre that is lately overdone, it must have a bonus. Definitely recommended to anyone liking some atmospheric platformer.. [XB1] - Inside is, basically, a platform game with extremely artistic characteristics and a (only apparently) minimalist graphic. Perhaps even more introspective than Limbo, the previous title of the same Studio. Sometimes the contents appear strong and excessive, feeling also fueled by the fact that the protagonist is a child with the somatic features less comic of the previous protagonist seen in Limbo. Longevity is a few hours, but it is certainly not for the longevity that a title of this kind is played. Never difficult and frustrating. In two words, minimalist and intimate.. Inside is everything Limbo was and more. Whereas Limbo was a truly 2-dimensional platformer, Inside integrates the backdrop much more into the narrative of the game and provides visual cues that effect gameplay. The visual and audio elements of this game are like no other that I have played and left quite the impact on my imagination. So much so that I have no doubt that the imagery from this game will stay with me subconsciously for the rest of my life. Anyone who has had dreams of video games you haven’t played in years will know what I am talking about. I personally played this game in a room with the door closed and the lights off and I was completely entranced during every second. When you can afford to, it is pleasant to just pause during certain portions of the game and take in the landscapes in the background and listen to the ambient noise of the environment. Like Limbo, the core gameplay of Inside is quite simple and this serves as a strength. The game is intuitive and easy to pick up. This simple gameplay removes superficial barriers and allows easy immersion into the game’s setting. Despite the simplicity of the core gameplay, the puzzles that you are tasked with completing are at the perfect level of challenge. They cause you to really think and observe your environment while not being so difficult that you spend an unnecessarily long amount of time trying to figure out what to do, all the while being drawn out of the immersive visual and auditory elements of the game. As the narrative progresses and you discover new and interesting aspects to this landscape’s environment, these aspects become integrated into the gameplay and puzzles. There is a real progression throughout the game of different environments and Playdead does an excellent job of integrating the evolving environment into an evolving gameplay. Playdead has also scattered various “collectible” objects throughout the game. When all of these objects are deactivated the player has the chance to unlock a secret ending. I personally enjoy obtaining achievements, and every achievement in the game is related to the collectibles. I particularly liked how each achievement title/description gives you a hint as to the collectible’s location. On Xbox One there was also a picture of the collectible in its location for each achievement, but due to the way these are hidden away these pictures do not give away the collectible’s location. There’s also another visual tell that gives away that a collectible is nearby that I will not spoil. All in all, I really appreciated the way that the collectibles were done and I found them fun to collect. I personally don’t like when collectibles are obscurely hidden with no hints or clues as to their locations and Inside does just the opposite. Despite my praise for the immersive ambient environment above, Inside is filled with danger and the potential for brutal death much like its predecessor. By doing so, Inside manages to both capture your imagination and keep you on edge. This mixture creates a feeling that I think Limbo captured, and Inside did even better that in many ways is becoming Playdead’s signature. I’ll talk about the narrative and ending without providing any spoilers. The narrative in Inside is conveyed entirely visually. The game starts similarly to Limbo where the player simply appears from the left of the screen as an unnamed boy. You progress through increasingly industrial and urban areas and discover more and more mysteries that seem to have a scientific basis. The discovery at the end of the game (and the gameplay change that comes along with it) is quite shocking and interesting. After my initial playthrough, and seeing the original ending I found the ending to be pleasant albeit somewhat confusingly ambiguous. The alternate ending raised even more questions. For better or worse, this is the kind of ending that you Google after you complete the game. The answers I found on the internet seemed somewhat legitimate and the information I found completely challenged my first hypothesis about the meaning of the ending. I realized, like I think many other players have, that my first analysis was pretty superficial and that there are a lot of visual details shown throughout the entirety of the game that you realize in retrospect seem like parts of a larger picture. However, I don’t believe any conclusive evidence has been found or analysis done that gives a definitive meaning to the game. At first, I was displeased by this ambiguity. But I have found myself thinking quite a bit about the game and what meanings could lie within that I plan on playing through a second time and am eager to do so.. Simplistic game in 2.5D world with obscure atmosphere, 3 colors cartoon like graphics and zero dialogue. So much potential is trapped in this small yet fantastic package. Shame this is not AAA game. It could be groundbreaking moment in gaming.. INSIDE Odd but great Inside is a puzzle platforming game lasting a little less than 4 hours where you play as a boy trying to escape.. From what I’m not sure... a factory of sorts... a communist country… from being a test subject… Hews trying to escape... you just go forward hiding in shadows, outsmarting the occasional enemies and doing multiple environmental puzzles… Inside Is from the same studio that made LIMBO, and they feel pretty similar, though INSIDE feels much more polished and varied and to me was a much more enjoyable, and much more confusing experience.. |Confusing because of the story. . Not the puzzles… Every puzzle I ran across in inside had a clever solution… I understood what needed to be done most of the time, but it was up to me figuring out how to accomplish this... There are many different puzzle types thrown in here, from timing, to pulling items, to distracting, to straight up mind control… I don’t have a favorite puzzle type as they were all equally fun to figure out… And the setting here its creepy and eaerie you feel like there’s danger around every corner, really immersing you into its world… as does the delivery of this games campaign as it slows down for a few stealth sections where you’re trying to blend in to not die.. As this entire game you’re being searched for… so you have to dodge the sight of enemies as well as spot lights... no sections too frustrating with perfectly placed checkpoints much like limbo… INSIDE is a really special experience with moments I want to talk about but to prevent spoilers…I can’t if one things for certain, you’ll leave this game wondering exactly what just happened… I wasn’t quite blown away by this game as everyone else… but I can still see its magic… I give Inside an 8.5/10. This is an indie game that will most likely be on many people list for GOTY. This is an extremely thought provoking game. From the creators of Limbo I didn't expect noting less.. This is what a perfectly polished game looks like. The visuals are amazing, the sound is amazing, I could not ask for more from the puzzles. BUT it's a story game without a story. It's like somehow they forgot to add it. The whole way through you play through mysterious scenes that a story could be set to, but it hasn't. People may finish and try to understand what it meant, but the reality is it doesn't mean anything. It's just a lot of crazy stuff with no story behind it.. Overall, Inside succeeds on every level. Even my problems with the game were easily overcome by the rest of it. The world building and design are some of the best I’ve ever seen, and the visual storytelling is perfectly executed. Inside is by far one of the best games of 2016 and it’s a game that shouldn’t be missed by anyone who enjoys games. 9.5/10. This is a very interesting project. The amount of care that went into this 2d platformer puzzler is pretty impressive. Worth a play if you enjoyed limbo.. Playdead's first game, Limbo, was one of the greatest games of 2010. Now, in 2016 they are back with a new project, Inside. Inside plays pretty much identically to it's predecessor. But the graphics and textures have been vastly improved. The story is really strong, the story is intense, engaging, fast paced, and has great moments that you will remember long after the credits roll. But the ending is both unsatisfying and unasked for. Overall, Inside is a great game, with great improvements from Limbo, but has an unsatisfactory ending, and is a little overpriced at 20$. If you have the money, pick Inside up, but if you don't, wait for it to hit the bargain bin.. For me INSIDE is a mindblowing mindxxxing experience of high-tension WTF moments in a wonderfully melancholic atmosphere, a flawlessly crafted piece of art. Thank you, everyone at Playdead! Somehow playing your games makes me feel understood.. There are no flaws, perfect throughout. It's so tight, there is no filler, no crap, it's so perfectly crafted and I cannot pick a single flaw in it... Truly original, atmospheric, dark humoured and haunting. An absolute gem - something to introduce anyone into gaming with that has a feel for adult sci fi thrillers and art house sensibilities.. I honestly think it deserves a 10/10. This game sets the bar so high for what a side-scroller can be that I question how someone will top it. Every screen has care put into it, the animations are fluid, the puzzles are rewarding to solve without feeling frustrating or boring. It has such variety in its locations, and goes in so many unexpected directions, that I was absolutely blown away from the first minutes on. Please just trust me that it's worth playing through. This is a special game.. One of the best video games ever. All its aspects are brilliant and fit together almost perfectly. Also it is incredibly innovati","i was, and still am, in LOVE with this game. played it so many times yet still can't get enough of it nor forget about it. i enjoyed this game, but I don't see it as the masterpiece many others say it is."
131.World of Warcraft,"MMO is not my type of game. But it was a great game at its time. If it was cheaper I would play casually.. Peak WoW, fun MMORPG where it's all about the adventure. Can spend hours just traveling the lands with the ambience and OST in the background. The end-game is spectacle, nothing too exciting, and there's some outdated mechanics but it's a fun world to be in.. The best MMORPG to date and even todat still the golden standard that haven't been surpassed yet.. Not good at all. Myself and many others have experienced so many glitches and bugs as well as content delays that would make you think that such severe glitches and bugs would not exist ! Do not play this game, after so much time spent only to encounter glitches and bugs you will realize what a horrible waste of time World of Warcraft and other Blizzard Entertainment games are.. **** game was good once. Now it's dead for good. Technical support, dead for good. I've been waiting for a week to connect me with a person Ticket Number: EU95930955 Disgusting help for players who bought the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition. This has never happened before.. SirSniffel please get your facts straight and stop spreading false information. This game is not full price. It is literally every expansion except the current one for the price of just a subscription. Only the newest expansions are $50. Stop complaining about dumb stuff. On that note, World of Warcraft is the most polished MMORPG there ever will be. And it has the best music, voices, art style, environments and world there EVER WILL BE!! World of Warcraft will never die. I'll be playing in heaven. Imagine giving a game you can't stop playing for 20 years anything other than a 10.. The pioneer of the genre. This game is just legendary and will be forever gaming history. There is a reason why people are returning massively after 20 years only to revisit the original experience with WoW Classic.. I don't know **** that wasted it's lead as hard as WoW. It was THE mmorpg and Blizzard chose greed and laziness over improving the game and competing with newer games. What fan base remains are toxic guilds and oldhead raiders.. Until, and including, WotLK it was a 10, then it's up and down between 3-7. So I wish I could rate it higher, it's still an amazing game, but just became much more demanding, lot's of additional payments, less enjoyable stories, too difficult to find time to enjoy various alts, the community also declined. Was the best, but the title is on shaky grounds.. A perfect case study in how to scam your playerbase until defending you becomes too embarassing.. Started playing, generally very beautiful world to run around and chill out in.. The definitive MMORPG experience that has defined a genre and continues to captivate millions.. What the game offers is polished and fun. Sadly there isn't much to offer aside from grinding gearscore in a few dungeons and a raid, to do the same stuff on higher difficulties. While there might be a gigiantic world to discover, it's mostly dead and empty, aside from the newest city in the current expansion. For a full price title, with a subscription fee and microtransactions that give you ingame advantages, it's difficult to recommend.. Once upon of time this was one of the most amazing games ever created. Then diversity hires took over.. I have been playing all kinds of games from the age of 4 (I'm 22 now) and for me WOW is not only the best game of this genre, but the best videogame I have ever played. It never gets boring, you always have something new to do and it's very fun. 100% recommended.. I lost my phone on which the authenticator was set! I have been writing to Blizzard for almost a month now and still no one answers me!!! I can't log in to the game because the authenticator won't let me in. World of Warcraft is a monumental achievement in the realm of MMORPGs, revolutionizing the genre and becoming the gold standard for immersive online gaming experiences. With its dynamic world, stunning visuals, addictive gameplay, and rich lore, this legendary title gets a perfect score of 10/10.First and foremost, World of Warcraft's ever-expanding and intricately crafted world is a sight to behold.

From forming guilds and tackling challenging raids to engaging in thrilling player versus player battles, the game's social aspect brings a sense of camaraderie and a lasting bond between players. The cooperative gameplay elements foster teamwork and friendship, creating an environment where players can forge unforgettable memories together.Furthermore, the lore of World of Warcraft is breathtakingly expansive and deeply enriched.

The occasional server issues or imbalances in player-versus-player combat can be minor inconveniences, but they hardly detract from the overall excellence of the game.. Pros : Best MMORPG during my young adult years. Great music. Cons : Timesink. Harder to play when older with family commitments.. The greatest mmo ever created to say I love wow is an understatement not only is wow (World Of Warcraft) the greatest mmo in gaming history if u ever want to play a game where all time and life goes by without u realising this is the game for you first 20 levels are free after that subscription fee it's so worth it if u put time into it paladins where you at ? Hahaha. Vanilla WoW was my childhood, it may or may not have ruined it and turned me into a hopeless gaming addict.. Was an amazing MMO for it's time, and still is quite good. Wrath of the Lich King and Dragonflight are the two best expansions. There have been some terrible ones. Beware this game is all consuming and will destroy your life if you want to be competitive.. World of Warcraft has truly been, is, and will continue to be an absolute phenomenon. Its captivating narrative, immersive universe, and stellar gameplay have stood the test of time. The game itself redefined what an MMO could be, leaving an indelible mark on the gaming industry. Presently, much of the content has undergone transformation in the cataclysmic expansion. While the core game's untouched areas have dwindled to around two zones, it's worth noting that many of its raids and dungeons have also undergone changes.. Game has gone down the drain since its inception ranging from Blizzard people NOT going after those breaking their code of conduct. I constantly see people selling crap in the Trade Channel (lvl 10 selling Mythic runs and it is a scam) and Pre-Made **** nothing happens to them! Mega waste of time and money. It seems as they are now bringing things into the game that do not belong (Homosexuality that kids do not need to see). Do not waste your time or money on this worst game of ALL TIME! If I could give this game negative stars, I honestly would because of how down the drain everything about this game has become.. I played WoW for almost one year, and liked most of it. Until I started doing team quests and raids... There you are, with 24 other players, most of which have done this raid before. Some of them have done it many, many times. But for you it is a first time. And even though you watched a youtube video or two, chaos breaks loose around you. So you run around, try to do something useful, and most likely are killed off quickly. Do the other players care? They certainly do: They are P***ED that you are not performing as well as they are, and they let you know it. In very harsh, vulgar language, which will not be repeated here. Use your imagination. Repeated complaints and reportings of some players lead to exactly nothing. No reaction whatsoever from Blizzard. And some raids just cannot be avoided when you follow the story line... So if you wish to play WoW, be prepared of this. And if your kids want to play, consider this from their point of view. I am 50+ years old, and found this a humiliating experience. This does not bid well for kids in the same situation! In more than 30 years of online gaming I have never met so many rude and arrogant players as in WoW. But I hasten to add that in every raid there were also people behaving in a polite and civilized way. Either a minority, or not concerned enough to speak up stronger. The game itself would get 8 points, but because of the behaviour of many players, and Blizzard's lack of action, it is a 4.. Best Game ever. You have PvP with Raids, where you can fight bosses and progress, and Dungeons (M+). You have limited Time, your enemis will have more health and deal more damage with every level and alot events. And PvP with Battelgrounds and Arenas. Its much fun!!!. The original version of World of Warcraft was an absolute masterpiece. While there are certainly things that the expansions did to improve on (and sometimes hurt) the game, World of Warcraft is the face of the MMORPG genre. No other MMORPG has truly captured my first experience in Azeroth. You can play ""Classic"" WoW right now and even though it doesn't have a lot of the convenient features of ""Current WoW"" it still is a great time to casually play with friends and explore the vast World of Warcraft.. Vanilla wow still the best game ever made. None of the expansions come close to the brilliance of the Vanilla and original version.. Extremely addictive. Can't wait for PS5 version. I'd even buy an X-Box to play.. The Good: WoW was groundbreaking by it's release, back in 2003, and it's vanilla form has held up for almost 20 years. Simply a classic, that really grasped the shear scope of a massive world, with countless adventures and friendships waiting. Lots of great class and faction fantasy. Each faction is unique, and so are the classes. Not everyone can interrupt spells, have defensive cooldowns, or can burst. There's pros and cons to each class - Class Flavour. The Bad: Biggest downside is the difficulty of the raids 20 years later. The fact that the classes only really excel at one thing in PvE and PvP, is also up there on the list of potential problems. If you can heal, you're only good at healing - Only exception to this, is the Druid and Warrior, both of which can both Tank and, either DPS or Heal. All others are stuck doing just one thing: What their Tier-Sets assigns them to do. TBC fixes this, though. Would be nice to see some love for DPS hybrids and Warlocks, or having Hunters being more viable later on, DPS-wise. Warriors could potentially also use a scaling-nerf, to their DPS, to balance this out a bit.. Vanilla through WotLK was the pinnacle of MMO's & will probably never be topped. Molten Core 40 man was one of the best gaming moments of my life.. Monthly Subscription, bad graphics ,mediocre repeatable gameplay and the lore is not in game cutscenes but cinematics. This games cinematics are a misleading advertising. When you see a cinematic you want the game to be like the cinematic and not **** with extra buttons. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. (perfect)game but its not really hard and the good thing is it runs on every computer/laptop with 100 fps. The best MMORPG to this day, period. There is no competition and it offers content for all types of players.. This game ****, you die 50 times before ever reaching level 20, its too difficult, pvp is unbalanced, terrible combat, mechanics, everything is so bad about World of Warcraft it should stop existing from earth. Honestly the first time i played it i was 12 years old, i cried in front of the boar, it made me have breakdowns, i had a terrible childhood, this game didn't make it better, today im 27 i still cry while playing it, its so bad, it makes you want to end your life.. The best MMORPG. If play this game today it´s just as good as before. The Community of Classic WoW is beatuiful, if you ask for help most of the time the people say yes and help you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply the best online game for me, kind of the pioneer of a lot of other games, not matter solo or online. I don't suggest anyone play it now because the new patches are no longer interesting. But if you were lucky to play it when it came out, I bet you would absolutely love it.. The game has aged terribly. At this point the game should be free/highly discounted. There are much better more recent MMO games with a better monthly fee and lower cost of admission.. Great game ever created. No question. No competition. Although I may take breaks and the game has had rough patches, literally, it still stands out and alone as the best experiences in gaming for me have all come from this game. I've cleared the majority of raid content when current and have enjoyed dabbling in PvP on and off. This game has been great entertainment for 15 years, no other game comes even close to how much entertainment this game has brought me.. Highly addictive. If you find a good community on here, this is one of the funnest games to play.. classic game best game what can i say 1000 hours of joy and happiness in this perfect world of Warcraft 10/10. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. i play this game from long years. It's my favorite game since i started it. Best game ever.... World of Warcraft was a fantastic game. I played classic and I could tell just how amazing this game would have been back in the old days. Yes, modern games are superior in quest design and dungeons, but the lack of QOL here was genuinely a positive thing imo and allowed the community aspect to be far better. But MMOs as a whole have problems WoW never solved. They are end game heavy, so leveling becomes an empty chore devoid of community, and the MMO crowd consume content like locusts. Its very hard to enjoy yourself in such an environment. WoW classic didnt do anything to address these things, but these problems were not a big issue when you had continuous growth and when there weren't leveling bots, optimization guides, and try hard communities just looking to grind content instantly. Ultimately WoW's success was about the time it was released just as much as it was about the gameplay and design. And that time will never come again.. Anyone saying there isn't enough to do in this expansion has been the victim of WoW's past expansions programming them to expect mindless, daily chores instead of actual gameplay. Imagine that, gameplay in a video game! There's so much to do, with so much variety, from traditional WoW reputation grinds to mountain climbing to exploration events, rare mobs to farm, dungeons to do, and that's all well before the M+ and raid season open next week. The storytelling in this expansion thus far reminds me of the good story driven expansions - Wrath, MoP - and has been a genuine pleasure to experience.. I enjoyed World of Warcraft the most during The Burning Crusade through to Cataclysm but it is still a great experience but expect a learning curve if you are a new or recurring player. There is lots of content in the game from achievement items and epics but you are gonna have to buckle down and spend time and money.. Now for me it's Fomo + politics Sad, but it was one of the best MMO. Bye Bye. I was just chilling listening to Spotify, but these **** World Of Warcraft ads keeps popping up on my screen, filling the entire screen... Not only those, but also 30 seconds long World of Warcraft ads, were the just talk **** ONLY WORLD OF WARCRAFT ADS. I know, spotify premium will fix this, but im not gonna spend money on music.. Simply the best game of all time. If you haven't tried it you should try it now.. World of Warcraft is the most wonderful PC game I have ever played! Blizzard has successfully built up a wonderland for every players who have a dream of magic! For the Horld!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. First time its looks pretty good. but very fast getting bored and starts to enrage from many small bugs. so small indie-studio cant make it product well. Disbalance is everywhere: Pve, pvp, pet battle. Ugly one side story have a lot of hole.. There is no doubt. this is and will always be the best MMORPG on the market. I'm not playing the game anymore. But the game still gave me +15 years of great content. I'm 100% going back to the newest expansion ""Dragonflight"". But if I'm purely rating the experience I had in 2005, for Vanilla WoW. Then it was 10/10, and I was the happiest little boy in the world back then.. The Warcraft universe spans across decades of lore building and this game is no exception to that. Any player will find themselves fully immersed into the World of Warcraft lore and the narrative you get experience first-hand as a player. It created the foundations of an exemplary MMO that set the golden standards for most other MMOs that came forward from it. Whether you like Pets, Dungeons, Raids, PvP, Battlegrounds or more this game has pretty much every RPG aspect you would want. I removed a few points because I feel that World of Warcraft has lost its sense of identity in being a fun game to play - it often resorts to becoming a part-time job, which I feel a game should not be. Refining the loot systems in this game would make it a 10/10 for me, Legion was utterly amazing.. WoW is dying? Yes, he's dying. And a long time ago. Blizzard just has enough resources to support his agony on artificial life support for many years. Games outside politics. I was lucky enough to have my childhood spent with friends outside but in 2004 it changed when the game was released... My first experience with the game was on private servers but later on, I moved to retail and played basically for the next 16-17 years till the Korthia patch in Shadowlands- after that I don't intend to play this game anymore.. I enjoy this game. The leveling experience is quite fun, and is much more fun with friends. The end game is where the game essentially stops being fun, however. Once you reach max level you should just make a new character because everything after max level is boring.. I played this game in 2006-2008 because I was trying to make friends that played it. Fighting a duel with one of my friends who was like level 40 I somehow managed to beat him with a level 22 character and he never spoke with me again.. Well, so far the BEST MMORPG that has been ever createn on this Planet. Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK, Cataclysm, Legion. Other expansions weren't so well. Showing my gratitude to an old Blizzard team. Thanks for childhood experience =). No doubt the best game ever. Think about this, is there a second game you can play for almost two decades and still keep it in your hard drive just in case you wanna play it from now and then?. Amazing game just buy or try it for free to level 20 you can play it until then. If you're not happy then just do not buy it. Its just that simple for people to make there own choice on the game .. Blizzard builds their games based on addiction. Games are rated based on visual and technical aspects, how interesting is the story, the combats, etc. My one month of WoW proved to me, the game was just stealing my time. Everything is developed to keep you connected, any progress takes hours. If you become addicted you miss on your life. The son of family friends almost quit university because of that game. It is really how digital addictions are, without any regulation to moderate them, and companies preying on people who can't control themselves.. Man, fix Onyxia pls. Anyway, WoW was a hell **** which Ive spent hours and hours grinding. I played it when I was little. Nice game which aged badly. Direct violation of the user agreement. Racism towards users from Belarus and Russia. Indignity in chat against children from these countries. Do you really think Putin is playing your games? Or that bringing innocent children and teenagers to psychological trauma or suicide will help the stop war? You can't not make game a normal, but do into politics.. I spend a lot of money on Blizzard games, and than i was banned because of i am from Russia. I am just a human. Peace , world. Good by blizzard. You are ****. People engaged in war in real life do not play Warcraft. We, the players, come into the game to escape the emotional pressures of the world. And you hate us for it. First you hate us for the color of our skin, and now for the language we speak. You do not care that we are planted for rallies. You want us to rebel against our country. How are you better than any of the parties to the conflict? Why do you hate those who pay you for your work? We do not kill in real life, but you are pushing us towards this, as a result. What for? Oh my god, are you out of your mind!. The first 300-400 hours in this game is my good experience in MMORPG. But then the boring gameplay began, grinding chemistry and reputation for the sake of passing instances. Further worse - speedruns began and the game turned into a second job. How hard it is to organize 40 people for the perfect completion of a Phase 4 instance, for example, it's tough. 30% of them are idiots who don't care about the rest, who don't want to prepare for a raid or who are standing in a puddle.. It's simply THE MMORPG. I haven't played for many years, but the base game itself was genre defining and still is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the best games I've ever played one of the best games I've ever played. Meh the game was oki at its prime.. when i did try classic thingy i found out that old memory of this game was only nostalgia.. God awful game. I don't get how people like this game. The raids and gameplay are so dull. The graphics look like its still from 1999-2001ish. It should've gotten at least a small upgrade by now. I've tried it probably 4 times for a month on and off since 2018. Final Fantasy XIV is superior in everyday.. And unlike blizzard. Square enix isn't known to s3xually harassing their employees. Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn AND the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime?. The devs are abusers and pushed an employee to suicide and they won't have the balls to remove the problem because the problem is the CEO. LOL. good game . i am liking it alot .does good work.i have been working on unlocking allied races and flying and it feels fun. The nostalgic feeling I get form thinking about this RTS trend setter for so many games. Made me start getting into the genre I will never leave. Just epic.. An awsome game that is super fun to play with friends but it misses the 10 for me with questing being anoying when things don´t spawn and when other players steal stuff you been waiting for to spawn.. This game is fantasctic. All things in game are very good. Ounly one thing i hate at this game......farming almost alll things....like mounts, toys and all things. I like this game.. The only game at the moment in which you can live, a lot of activities, well-developed classes and races, as well as an atmosphere .... It's been almost a decade since I've last played this game. I believe it's addictive qualities are dangerous. However, to be completely fair, it's addictive because it's brilliant!. Want your child to learn about such diverse topics as white supremacy, hard drug use, racism, cyberbullying, etc.? Well, sign them up for WoW. I've played the game since Vanilla and the game has gotten more and more toxic in large part because Blizzard refuses to moderate the chat channels. It's not fun for adults to be subjected to this mess and people are quitting in droves because of it. Do you really want your child learning about racism, hard drug use, sex from guild leaders who are telling junior or juniorette that these things are cool? Do you really want them to be grow up thinking cyberbullying is cool because so and so with all the gear is an awesome dude and thinks trolling is just the best thing in the world? This is what WoW has become and Blizzard (Frat Boys Inc.) takes no responsibility to protect your child from these creeps. Many of us have been asking for moderators for years now, but Blizzard is too cheap to spend the money. They've literally made billions of dollars off of their customers, but refuse to spend even a single cent to make the game a safe and fun environment for players of all ages. Yes, children play your game Blizzard. Stop hiding behind the rating to justify your gross corporate irresponsibility and greed.. *Final Fantasy XIV - BEST GAME* *Final Fantasy XIV - the critically acclaimed MMORPG.* *Play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and Heavensward expansion for FREE with no restrictions on playtime.*. Very, very trash game only low iq players like it. Even TESO is better. Bad mehanics, bad graphics, horrible cgi, garbage story. I recommend you FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE the Greatest game what ever made.. World of Warcraft is like playing World of Warcraft - you play World of Warcraft.. Short review but: AMAZING! Game. Still so fun all these years later. FOR THE ALLIANCE xD. This game has been a massive part of my life and I've never really had any massive problems. The only problems would be bad balancing of classes and just making bad changes to Pvp and abilities. I've played this game ever since I was a kid really so It's always been magical seeing the story of WOW come to life. Even now I still love collecting mounts, playing dungeons and joining guilds.. My favourite game of all time. All my childhood is tied here. Up until wrath of the Lich king (last expansion I played) are some of my favourite gaming moments. All the friends I met, the characters I levelled, my first raid, my first dungeon, messing around with my real life friends, forming guilds with my classmates, the soundtrack everything. These are some of the things that if I had a time machine I would love to go through all of them again. I love this game. Such was such a great game in its time. Still the MMORPG to beat till this day.. Ugly childish graphics, boring mechanisms, terrible quest design and non existent story background for 99% of the quests. A money maker, where players work and pay for it, hardly a game.. Pretty good game. Though I don't really like that you only get to go to level 20 in the free version.. This game was such a mess... Such a wonderful mess, classic which is not even really this game, is still better in many ways then current retail wow. but also they have clearly learned stuff from making the game this long. I feel like you could make a perfect MMO at this point by remaking vanilla wow.. Best game ever. Fantastic raids and dungeons. Nice lore. And many hours spent with friends.. is is a good game. this is a nostalgia overload, and i played this before. its awesome i have multiple words and questions.. Im a huge WoW fan and this is a great expansion, not as good as Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers but overall a great experience. Would be a higher score if covenants and subclasses werent so unbalanced. Lets hope the upcoming patches will make it better.. The King of MMORPGS, World of Warcraft is rly the best mmorpg ever created, so far at least. Ammount of details in this game, music, cinematics ,cutscenes, overall gameplay, ammount of quests, maps etc. it is just rly big and you will enjoy every single second you spend in this brilliant world created by Blizzard. You can spend in this game 1000 hours, and you still won't be bored, every expansion upgrade world so much, even sometimes change core of gameplay.. Rose-tinted glasses: the reviews: this game was extremely unfinished for at least most of its patches. Most classes were not only broken but completely unplayable: e.g. classes that couldn't even heal or dps in pve and at the same time classes that were literally one-shotting other classes in pvp. Whoever tells you this game was perfect was probably a small child back then because the first time this game advanced beyond the beta or rather alpha stage was the TBC expansion.. Best game ever made! Great story/lore. Great mehanics. Addictive.. World of Warcraft, including the most recent Shadowlands expansion, is a 2004 game that is today's biggest example of an outdated game that is not underdeveloped for the amount of financial income gained by Activision Blizzard from it. Shadowlands does not do help much, as it is a similar experience to Legion - and while the score would have not been lower than 5/10 - the 0/10 comes for the price that comes with this game. 74,99€ for the ""Epic"" version, which includes every digital extra & 30 days of game time; and 54,99€ for most of the diigtal extras alone & 39,99€ for the base game. I won't even start by saying that the middle & base editions don't have the 30 days of game time. I will rather conclude, that this game does not deserve to run a buy-to-play (single-time, bigger price) combined with a pay-to-play (monthly, subscription-based payments) model. No game deserves that. You either run B2P or P2P. (eg. RuneScape, Guild Wars 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, etc.). Verdict? Average game with over the top price tag for the quality provided and amount of content that does not feel repetitive (because killing 30 NPCs over and over, or doing a mediocre instance (dungeon or raid) over and over for items to be able to farm for more items is in my opinion not enjoyable to a sane, working person). If you're a new player considering this game, do yourself a favour and pick another title that's not a combined B2P+P2P hoax. Your invested time into this game will eventually end up made irrelevant as level cap is always raised +10 (or +5) & previous items are made obsolete, no matter how hard you've ""farmed"" for them. Endless grind for items with the pretty excuse of ""achievement obtaining"" for a continuous price out of proportions that mentally 'forces' you to play to justify the value of the purchase.. I came back after not playing for a while. Worked my ass off not understanding the Flying achievement system. Thought I had unlocked it to find more reputation grind needed. I saved the world... again and again, yet I can't get flight status? Screw you Blizzard. Won't be paying into it anymore and nor will my friends.. This is really terrible , it has aged like milk and only a few of the redeemable qualities stood out fo","world of warcraft is the most polished MMORPG there ever will be . it has the best music, voices, art style, environments and world there EVER WILL BE . i've been waiting for a week to connect me with a person ."
132.Flipnote Studio,"Why is this game so highly rated? I had ten minutes of fun with it and haven't touched it since. Why is it so high up?. This is considered as the prime of animation software back in 2009-2013 I think. It’s really can do it all (besides have more than 3 colors) but other than that this is a really easy and fun animation software to use.. Fun. Good for artists. While it may be without it's online servers on, to this day, this is still a very great app with you can do animations and draw a lot of things.. It's not without its interface issues, but Flipnote Studio (and Flipnote Hatena before it shut down) was an experience unlike anything else on the platform. You simply had to be there to get the full experience, however, and without Hatena, you won't get the most out of it. Still, great things can be created using this application, even today.. Besides a professional art program, this is by far the best drawing application for the DS, it includes many tools and offers a bit of colour so you can make quick animations with your DS. You cannot upload anymore however you can share your creations to a USB drive.. introduced me and many others to the world of animation. Its so much fun to mess around with! After Hatena being shut down, I was super sad, but it didn't really matter to me because I could just make my own and share them to YouTube! Sure, the 3DS version was better, but this is the DSi we are talking about. What do you expect? I really love this animation tool and I use it almost daily.. A beautiful software with many options and tricks to find. It's a must have, especially considering that it's free to download. Although the value is lessened by the fact that Flipnote Hatena (the sharing site within the DSi) is now defunct, the software itself is still wonderful. I'm eagerly looking forward to the 3DS version.. this game started well, but it has been reduced to people stealing original flip notes with the only change at the end saying ""add stars if blah blah blah"" or a change in speed. and are these thief's punished? no, there put on the ""most popular videos"" section. and if its not stolen, its some sort of song with a page saying ""add stars if you like songs"", or a video that says something like ""add stars or you will die in 3 days"". and if not that, some sort of one direction love story. flippant hatena has become a hole of star beggars, reposts, and stupid scams. however, flip-note studio itself (without hatena) isn't that bad, its a good way to make videos. i personally think that they should shut down the hatena system and keep it as a system to just share some videos with some close friends, not to the internet where someone can steal it.. Flipnote Studios is undoubtedly an excellent application for its price. (Which is free.) You can create really impressive animations, but the quality of course depends on your artistic ability. You can create anything from animations, to ""comic books"" that you manually turn the page. But, as many users of the Flipnote sharing service Hatena have discovered, you can draw a picture of an adorable animal with a sign that says ""Adopt me for 100 Stars,"" and gullible users will add 100 stars to the drawing to ""adopt"" it, forcing this little doodle to the top of the ""most popular"" page. There are also flips with a song recorded from YouTube, which says ""Download for 50 stars."" People will then add 50 stars to perform a download which is free, and forcing this ""no-effort"" note into the popular section. These can be ignored if you want, but the fact is that most Flipnotes on the Hatena site won't fit your tastes. But if you have a DSi and want to try your hand at some animating, Download Flipnotes. It's probably pre-loaded if you have a newer device. It's a blast to animate, and even if your actual ""animations"" don't get popular on the Hatena at least you had fun making them. Check out my Creator Page if you want: Command Code is L R L Up Y L L L Fave me and I'll add you. Haha bye. Interface of this application was made as simple as possible. So even the most talentless in drawing people (like me) can draw with fun. And Flipnote Agenda's idea is just awesome! I'm sure people made a lot of masterpieces for only being popular there. My rate is superb! 10.0!. I was so looking forward to FNS when it came out, and for the first few weeks it was brilliant! Then, several months later the Hatena site got a mass overload of crap flipnotes begging for apparently precious stars, therefore absolutely ruining the experience. What a shame, because it's a great tool, despite a few drawbacks.. Fun, free, and deep. What is there to complain about? The website is also great. Small download, as well. There is seriously nothing to really complain about.","this is a really easy and fun animation software to use . it's not without its interface issues, but it's still a very great app . besides a professional art program, this is by far the best drawing application for the DS ."
134.Forza Horizon 4,"The best FH game! The map is a perfect representation of what it’s like to drive in the UK (especially the rural areas) and car selection is top tier. I personally think this game is better than FH5 because of the ranked online racing and more varied map. Graphics are amazing for the time, and still look great today.. Forza horizon 4 is the best racing game i ever played, i really like the uk map and seasons.. Scattered races in a bland open world that provide no incentive to repeat after beating once. There is no rages to riches progression in this game. You get a hyper car within the first hour of playing. Is it pretty? Yes. Does it handle well? Yes. Is there a lot of content? Yes. But man does this game get stale after even...15-20 hours. You just experience everything far too quickly. A racing game needs progression this has none, which is a shame- it has potential.. Forza Horizen 4 is one of the greatest car racing games of all time, the ultra-realistic visuals mixed with a great campaign, hundreds of cars and plenty to do makes this game enjoyable for all ages. I have always enjoyed car racing games but have found many of them to get boring after a large amount of playing time, however Forza 4 has too much on offer to become boring. The constant need to earn influence to get to the next season gave me a thrill to do drifts and challenge street cars aside from the standard races. The ability to create your own circuits even before completing the main story gave me enough to do for a few hours aside from racing. Wanting to expand my garage gave me an incentive to try and save up CR (the currency in the game) to buy my favorite cars. The only issues I found with the game is it is so large and so many things to do I struggled to get my head around it in the first few hours, the length of driving to each race is fun for a while but sometimes you just want to race straight away without driving for 10 minutes. You can quick travel, but it does cost you a small amount of CR. Overall Forza Horizen 4 was an amazing game from the outstanding visuals to the thrilling races, there wasn't many moments in this game where I found myself getting bored. I would recommend Forza Horizen 4 to anyone who wishes to play a car racing game since you won't be able to stop admiring how impressive this game truly is.. Everything about this game is damn near perfect. The best open world experience. The car tuning and driving are so much fun. With friends the custom games and messing around in the open world is so much fun. Easily a top 10 game of all time for me.. Just a great car game. I love just driving through the forests and through the country side. Haven't purchased any of the dlcs and it just popping up in some areas is annoying but I love the base game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very good Forza in a great country! The atmosphere, the music, everything is there!However, this part was very short and easy to finish without any difficulty.. i have good memories with fh4, playing with online races in the highway, or doing rp, but now, talking abt the game, its not bad, its way focused on online mode, and the story mode its non-existent, really sad, but the map its pretty cool, and the highway was peak, we had such glitched cars on that game, so yeah, it was kinda bad, but, the graphics, car list, races, map, atmosphere its amazing!, the only bad thing its the snow, lol, ig it worth to buy, even the lego expansion. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 8 Music: 5 Story: 4 Total: 6.83. A visually stunning racing game that's fun even for those not deeply into the genre. Highly enjoyable.. I have played this game for a very long time. Unlocked most cars, and completed every single challenge the game has to offer. I love the setting and the atmosphere and the music is well-selected. Driving feels amazing although some of the cars feel sometimes slightly similar. That is pretty much my only downside to the game. Most glitches have been patched and the game feels great on series X/S.. Awesome Game! Its a very good racing game, but it has some glitches/bugs.. but thats fun! I, PROBRICPLAYZ on xbox, have played it for approximately 2 years now, and its my favorite Forza Horizon game.. Thanks to this game I cannot even look at NSF frenchise. World is so large and full of challenges as well as some collectibles. Now I am waiting for FH5 price to drop to some reasonable level.. Boring buggy game with car physics like a piece of soap, I'd rather spend my money on a new CREW or Need For Speed ! What's wrong with you? Give us normal Grand Turismo quality cars!. This is a pretty good game. I think that Horizon 3 is better but this game is solid as most Forza games are. The cars are great and the map is decent. Not bad.. Forza Horizon 4 is a dream come true for car lovers across the globe. Featuring an outrageously impressive car roster of over 700 beautifully designed and accurately replicated cars of all types and time periods, a unmatched sense of both Customisation and Personalisation with untold thousands of possible tune combinations on each car the player is able to get their ride driving in a way that not only fits like a glove over their driving style but complements it. Not to mention with the auction house and wheelspins featured in the game any player can be driving around in a desirable car mere hours after first launch cutting back on the build up and getting the player head deep in those intense races as soon as possible. A beautiful, large, vast and evolving open world designed carefully with all details of driving in mind even the mere sights alone would be enough to keep the player suitably entertained and with fairly priced DLCs that bring more innovation and variety to the racing events available you can truly think you've seen it all in this game and would've barely started. Overal Forza Horizon 4 Is a racing game in which each and every aspect is purely and consummately created around the driving and racing experience. The best racing game ever made.. This my **** again !. If you like cars and adventure, this is your game. THE BEST FORZA HORIZON. The original was Test drive unlimited.. One of the best racing games of all time, the open world racing environment in Great Britain is absolutely incredible.. The best Forza Horizon so far even after release of FH5. Great, smooth 60 FPS gameplay and one of the best soundtracks ever!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Forza is just on a different level holy **** Its not for everyone but for a racing game is just better than anything else. One of the best racing game graphics OF ALL TIME, even though this game lack of progressin, buit man, drive in england casually in the summer, who doesn't love that. Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.. this is a good game, better graphics, new to Forza cars, and a better expansion compared to horizon 5, if you want a cool looking game play this, and better buy this or it going into ""the Microsoft vault"" because you know. The best open world driving game out there. If you just want a game with great driving and freedom, here ya go man.. Great game, with great support and graphics. Over time, the game has been downgraded in terms of graphics, but it has not ceased to be as good. I spent a lot of time in it, and I continue to return to it.. great graphics great handling choice game love the forza series and what they done with the game. writing this review very, very late, but nonetheless, this is what got me into gaming in the first place, which lead to the biggest and proudest part of my life. I just love it!!. Forza Horizon 3 is already nearly perfect, and this Forza Horizon 4 is even better.. Master Pace Racing Game Almost everything in this game looks perfect At the same time, it contains revolutionary and attractive points, such as the dynamic cycle of the weather, which gives the game an extremely high variety, and in my opinion, it is considered one of the three great strengths of the game. If only the modeling of some cars could be better and more detailed, it would be more difficult to find fault with this game than it is.. The best simulator. Playing on the big screen is pure pleasure. The graphics are wonderful.. Wow......................................... Wow This is the best car game I played it in my life. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The greatest car game for non sim players which allows you to play like at just arcade races or sim-like ones.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now I hardly play any. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I play on every platform but prefer PlayStation. It's tough for me decide on a 8 or a 9. I really loved the innovation of changing seasons but the racing felt like a decline from Horizon 3. I think it's due to the UK setting and the road layout. Too many sharp turns. Another complaint that I wouldn't have thought would be an issue is being gifted cars too frequently. Don't let those complaints stop you from playing the game. Definitely worth to have this game in your library if your're a car guy. Graphics are superb.. Easily the best Horizon game yet, the game feels alot more alive than the stale precusor, Forza Horizon 3, which felt kinda boring and stale, due to the lack of variety in the landscape. This feels alot better, and the physics is very good to when you get the car tuning right, some small changes in the tuning can make a big difference, the new seasons are a great thing as well, and driving in snow is also really funny if you equip your car with snow tyres, sadly many players miss that trick, and complain about no grip in winter, but if you put on snow tyres, it will improve massively. The only real downsides are that some of the pr stunts ( speed traps and danger signs ( jumps ) can be really hard to do sometimes, mostly because of the ai traffic getting in your way and blocking the roads, sadly you can`t turn them off, which is a mistake, would have been so awesome to get rid of the traffic when you wanted them gone. Also another weird thing, is that as soon do need a skill that involves an ai car, all ai cars go away like magic, and you spend ages driving around looking for abducted ai drivers. Probably a feature put in on purpose to make the skills harder to get. Some of the engine sounds could have been better 2, like the Dodge Viper. it`s audio recording was not very well made sadly. Apart from this, it`s a very good game.. Graphics- 1.2 Gameplay- 2 Characters- 1 Campaign- .5 Content-4 Overall- 8.7. Forza horizon 3 much better than 4 .I played the game in the gamepass and in a day I bought almost all the cars. There are only a couple of car games that deserve top marks, FH4/FH5 and Gran Turismo 4 on PS2. Hours and hours and hours of fun, hours and hours and hours touring an open world doing what you always dreamed of doing with your car, but you couldn't, today you can with big money cars.. Wow! This game is amazing. Although I like more story based games, FH4 sutied my just fine. I liked the gameplay, lots of things to do. My one gripe is how RWD cars are super hard to control when compared to FH5.. Forza Horizon 4 takes almost all of the best aspects from previous games and implements it in a way that’ll leave you wanting to play this game every single day, even with the e risk lack of content the pure gameplay alone is enough to keep anybody satisfied. If I wasn’t a huge sim-racing nerd who mostly plays ACC and Gran Turismo, I’d be playing this more often, it’s just so, so much fun. My only gripes are the incredibly subpar engine/car sound-design, and the reused car models from much older entries in the series, making for some very inaccurate or plain-out ugly car models that look significantly better or more detailed in other racing games. Otherwise, I fully recommend Forza Horizon 4 to anybody who loves arcade racing, or cars in general!. Game with sensational, very fun, with lots to do. Unlike other racing games it is not repetitive as there are a lot of challenges such as jumping, speed radar, drifting, etc.. Best race game ever! Beautiful driving, a big autopark, nice map with seasons. Like every other Horizon game, a very enjoyable but ultimately shallow experience. Series needs revamping desperately because we are getting diminishing returns now in terms of enjoyment.. After not playing horizon 3 I wanted to see what this was like as this one is set in the UK. I watched a few on YouTube playing and then downloaded the game from gamepass to try. The controls are not as easy as previous games and the storyline quests do go on a bit, however I did enjoy using the drone to find the barn finds and enjoyed the online forzathon hourly challenges.. Could have better engine sounds :( otherwise it would be a perfect 10/10 for me.. great game and excellent tuning system and for me the map is far better than fh5 from me the graphic look quite real and I really really enjoyed playing it. The graphics and physics of the most realistic racing game i ever played, but I feel bored, i think the goal of this game is to have fun by driving the many cars available with your friends, less story. This is an amazing beautiful game. Cars are amazing to drive and it's stunning. I'm a little late to post my opinion, but here it goes. The game looks great, but somehow has zero playability for me. Horizon 1, 2 and especially 3 were great! Spent hundreds hours in them, I imagine. This one is just boring after one hour. Huge deal breakers are mandatory season changes and overstuffed map with millions of icons. I have very little spare time so log into the game ocassionally only to find out it's a winter and I can't do what I wanted to do - drive cool cars in a nice summer setting. Never cared for all the online and ""social"" part and this part seems all about online and clubs and whatever. Just let me drive what I want and how I want. Didn't even tried to understand all the activities that this game throws at me, just too much of everything. Everyone complained about stupid clothes and winning moves we get from wheel spins. I'm complaining about this too. It's a shame this game is zero fun. I still play Forza 7, and try this one from time to time, only to once again to see how boring this part is. I'm afraid Horizon 5 will be the same - very beautiful, but zero fun. Still hope to be proved wrong.. it is a fun game to play with friends but when you are on your own and once you complete all of the events it can get boring fast. the open world is nice but it is not all exciting, the one thing that I am glad about is that that don't have the whole token system that had in FH3.. Best game EVER. It is simply stunning, The fact that somehow the team at playground games managed to top THIS beauty with Forza Horizon 5 is UNREAL!. i play racing games occasionally and i'm a casual gamer but forza horizon 4 it's a diffrent level i spend almost 120 hours (with both DLC's) and i still want more, cant wait to FH5 Premiere. Graphics 6/10 Playability 7/10 Entertainment 6/10 Overall 6/10 Good arcade racing. Graphics could be better and England is little boring location.. Amazing graphics. A lot of cars. Maybe small, but detailed map with lot things to do. Definitely must-play.. simply the best racing game ever made, the only problem is the lack of map variety , however , the graphics are so beautiful that it maintains the riding around still fun. A beautiful game with very fun fast paced gameplay. Playground games delivered a very good game.. Beautiful world and perfect graphics.Lots of content and multiple and fun modes. And my views and my opinion after playing this long time ( 150 play hour). I have played almost every racing game that has ever existed. I am a huge fan of the genre. This is hands down my favorite game of all time, not even just car game, but game in general. It is not a sim. It is a whacky arcadey race game with much much better driving physics than any of the others have such as NFS. This game doesn't have the body customizations that NFS Heat does, but it makes up for that in a ton of different ways. The ultimate edition is worth the money. The DLC is great, & the VIP perks make things a bit less grindy. But honestly, this game constantly throws money at you. You'll be rich enough to buy and tune cars to your heart's content in no time. Easiest 10/10 game I've ever played. It is flawless.. Cant stop playing on xbox series x, my first race game for the last 10 years i believe, so much fun and enjoy!. Great game, loads of fun and looks AMAZING, but the damn wheel spins. Clothes are fine, but I want to win rides or Credits in wheel spins.. This game is exciting a lot of many detailes. This game not very easy cars have awesome physics. I think the game is made for Gay people all the clothing Items are gay style and the Emotes It's facking embarrasing. Pure perfection. I have no idea how good will the FH5 be. The cars are beautifully modeled, sounds are the same as in real life.. One of the best car/racing games out there. It is such a beautiful game with cars so real they are lifelike. There are some flaws with the game, primarily the car engine sounds inconsistency and the lack of a real feel of progression. I feel that the lack of progression is also a positive as the player can just jump in and do whatever they want, go where ever they want without any punishment. The car list is the best in the basic version of the game itself. The seasons gimmick is actually really well made as it captured the British weather feel perfectly. This is a great **** game.. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who's into a more casual approach to racing and racing fans. Beautiful would and amazing cars and an extensive car list makes this game one of the best ever. Great graphics and optimization Controls are similar to real, despite the fact that this is an arcade A large park of cars The possibility of buying houses Change of seasons adds to the entertainment Best racing game I've ever played I recommend this game. Stupid devs know how to ruin a good game. Complicated definitions in tuning section, stupid ad, when some stupid person starts to say something when I am in map, can't skip it. And wtf is that slow down penalty BS?. Greatest racing game ever i really enjoyed playing this game i never played it before but when i saw xbox game showcase i said i have to try it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. EN: Absolute champion of arcade racing games. Phenomenal map, very large car base, great missions, great online challenges, pretty good MP. Huge open-world world. Graphically perfect, the change of seasons leaves you breathless. Optimization at an excellent level. The game just looks fantastic and works great, even on the old Xbox One S console. Praise for the free next-gen upgrade. Best on Game Pass. SRB: Apsolutni šampion arkadnih trkačkih igrica. Fenomenalna mapa, mnogo velika baza automobila, sjajne misije, odlični online izazovi, dosta dobar MP. Ogroman open-world svet. Grafički perfektna, promena godišnjih doba ostavlja bez daha. Optimizacija na izvrsnom nivou. Igra jednostavno izgleda fantastično i radi odlično, čak i na staroj Xbox One S konzoli. Pohvale za free next-gen upgrade. Najbolje na Game Passu.. This game is gorgeous one of the best racing games ever made for Xbox One a Masterpiece. OverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverratedOverrated. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. OMG this game is so good I wanna play it every day. Full of content. Huge map. Amazing graphics. Totally recommended.. This is easily my favorite racing game of all time. Not much to say except driving around is fun, racing is fun, the auction is fun, the map is great, the graphics are amazing, just please play this game if you haven't already.. Best race game ever. it's bar none the best game of the xbox one, best graphics, best cars, best everything. And it's xbox series x version 4K@60hz with better reflections almost like RT it's phenomenal. Driving itself is nice and the game for sure looks good, but the constant interruptions from some voices on the radio telling me what I've just unlocked are really annoying and I hate all of those lenghthy animations before and especially after each race, but I would be ok with all of this if not for one thing... Everu other time I open the game I cannot start playing for 2 or more minutes becouse game needs to show me advertisements for some DLCs! I can't even skip them! That's not acceptable! How can there be advertisements inside the game?!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Forza Horizon 4 is awesome. The graphics are some of the best you’ll see and I’m not even a big graphic guy. The gameplay loop is addicting as you unlock more races and challenges to do. As you drive around you get experience points for stunts and narrow hit and misses of other vehicles. You can do all sorts of things around the map. I like how you get your own house where you can customize your vehicles by the numbers in great detail of all things from tires to suspension, size reduction, engine swaps and more. I was late to the party on this one but I must say this is clearly the best Racing RPG experience I’ve ever been apart of. Oh yeah you don’t only race other cars but you race against trains trucks and huge hovercrafts I could believe the absurdity of it all yet it makes so much sense. Also you can customize what they call you in the game by last name or first name, also titles like Sir, Mr. President or Your Majesty! Lol! Absolutely incredible! I recommend this game to anyone with an XboxOne or PC. As a matter of fact I got the systems for this game among many others. Thanks Forza Horizon 4 Team for a racing masterpiece and I’m not even a big racing guy.. The best racing game ever. Physics, graphics, sounds, gameplay, music everything is very good. The multiplayer features are great. It's a complete masterpiece.. The best racing game of all time. Over 100 great gameplay and 2 fantastic extras. May there be more such games in the game pass. This game isn't good, it's just a worse instance of Forza Horizon 3. After a while playing it on the Xbox one and the pc it gets really boring and some event and stunts are really hard and it doesn't have a story and it has less than 10 cutscenes. FH4 is really grindy and it asks you to pay money for ""Expansions"" and the seasons are pretty bad too because you cant do anything in the snow, you just slide all over the place. For the music after a while it gets repetitive and since this is an E rated game you cant add any music cause every track has swear words in it. Then you CANNOT mod the game even if you're playing solo because you'll get banned. Conclusion: If you're Forza diehard fan go ahead, buy this game but if you are an average gamer go and buy Need for speed Heat. I think it's an overrated game and so boring if want to drive a car without adrenalin i have a driving licance.. The game runs well on consoles, and there has clearly been an improvement in PC optimization over the last game. The game has a lot of content, the graphics are wonderful, the map is big and the physics are fun, certainly a great game.. Definitely the best racing game available on Xbox. It's as realistic as you could get; from physics to graphics. A lot of cars to pick from also works great with the g920 wheel.. One of the best if not THE Best Racing game ever! I love the Gran Turismo series and have played racing games for 30 years. Everyone I followed or talked to said if you like racing games and if you don't like racing games you will love Forza 4. Just play it or buy it outright the developers did an amazing job. Seasons do change everything. Playing through races and the open world in different seasons is great. I love how they kept the customization of upgrading your ride and paint booth plus you can just buy other set ups or designs/paint jobs from other users for in game currency. I love Gran Turismo games but Forza has not made me miss them very much. It's my go to racing game. It's not as much as a simulator as Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport but I can't tell a big difference using a controller. The open world is great for coming up with race tracks and the rally tracks throughout the landscape plus you can create your own race in a section of the map to be whatever you want it to be. This is great. Music stations are great and have good songs. Even if you don't like racing games or just want to try one out this is for you. It's a blast, you don't even have to race you can just cruise around.. This is how you do a open world racing game! The horizon series has always been a great game to drive through and mess about with your friends but this one just dials it up so much more! There are so many awesome features in this one that makes it stand out as the best in the series so far! The backdrop for this one is Great Britain and as a brit myself, I can say that they have done a superb job at recreating the classic british countryside I have come to love. Driving through this with my supercar and my mates driving alongside me just makes it so much fun. In terms of events, there are just SO MANY events to do. From races to stunts to epic showcase events there is always something there for you to do! Barn finds can be a lot of fun to pull off as well and get well rewarded for your efforts in that sense. Plus the changing of the seasons in the game change the dynamic of what you are trying to do. One minute it is the summer and you got the sun shining down on you, the next time you play, it could be the harsh cold winters and the roads have become icy. It makes the game fresh and keeps you excited and going for what is to come next! The main overworld of the game itself is also great as you are constantly in a online world. When you see other cars driving around, chances are that they are other players doing their own thing and you can choose to race them or join them on their own adventures. The fun just never stops. If you are a Xbox Games Pass subscriber and are into racing games and looking to have a fun time cruising around the great countryside with your mates, It is a no brainer!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is AMAZING. Graphics- A+ Map- A+ Cars- A+ Music- A. 10/10 for me. Love it. Need for Speed? NO, All my homies playing the best racing game - Forza Horizon 4. Best (non-sim) car game! Best multiplayer of any car game. Outstanding visual quality.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's just awesome! I love it, every single penny is worth spending on this game, DLC's are also worth it, Lego Speed Champions and Fortune Island are great extra content, and car packs are good if you're a starter, in conclusion, Ultimate edition is a sweet deal you must get no matters what. this game's soundtrack is just from another world, map is amazing, with every kind of challenges, races, showcases, events, and live interaction! it's crazy man. there is infinite hours of fun, and cars are pretty accurate. and I love that you can own up to 870+ cars! this game it's just insane, buy it. you will not regret.. Superb racing game, one of the very best on any system. Great graphics, smooth gameplay and extremely customisable.. One of the best racing games. Yet it has some “problems” for me. The fact that the dirt races have almost 60% of asphalt in it so it is hard to choose an optimal vehicle for that. Online matchmaking is one of the worst. Free roam races in ranked makes no sense. Sometimes the physics can also be very fustrating. Oh and the fact that you can get a supercar after only a few races (where you only have to participate basically) is ridiculous and I lost motivation after I got my dream car early in the game. No challenge at all. I also found the map itself repetitive a bit. Besides these negatives it is a great racing game, hopefully the next one will have a more various map and a better online matchmaking system.. The best thing for me: The game doesn't really force you to play something you don't like, just do what you want. Sure, if you want a specific reward you might need to, but even though I don't like playing Online Adventures for example, playing one ranked every 4 weeks for the season rewards doesn't kill me. Eliminator can be fun as well after a few times and getting to know how the mode works. I'm just not into the online races simply because I don't feel like tuning every car I want to drive there to 700/800/900/998 points to not be at a disadvantage from the start. But that's probably just my personal taste. Might not be for everyone, but it still looks great and is a pretty decent racing game with a good balance between arcade and realism.. The best racing experience this generation has to offer, hands down. One of the best, if not the greatest racing experience ever created. This is coming from someone, who doesn't even like racing games, but I'll be foolish to say this is not a must play if you're a fan of cars or racing games (it is). The graphics, car handling, weather system, content, are all phenomenal. My personal favorite thing about this game is the cockpit view, every car is different and felt hand crafted. To end, I guess i have a thing for open world racers, seeing as the only racing games I enjoyed recently were burnout paradise, nfs most wanted, and the motorstorm series. This game envelops all of those games and took it to the next level. Bravo, xbox.. I have much fun with this Game This game looks pretty damn nice and has tons of cars. I also like that the weather changes every now and then in the game. i never was a big fan of racing games but this game made me become a fan of racing games. I've played SO many racing games on PS3, PC - every NFS game, Burnout, Gran Tourismo, etc. but once I got Xbox One everything changed. The first game I played on a new Xbox was Forza Horizon 3. It was amazing. But then Forza Horizon 4 came out and it was even better. The graphics and detail in this game is amazing. The game doesn't force you to do anything - you are given so much freedom. Remember when you are 100 m from the finish line and you suddenly hit something - no more, because you can rewind anytime during the race. It is so satisfying to race in this game. To me it has the perfect balance between arcade and sim way of driving. Best racing game ever.. I have tried lots of games about racing in my Xbox One S and PS 4 Slim. I think that the game is the best of all racing games.. This game is in my opinion, one of the best looking car/racing games. With the addition of seasons, it makes the game feel more alive. I really like the fact that the game introduces itself when players first play Forza Horizon 4. A real masterpiece !. As a live service other than cars they refuse to re work any events. Stepping into the game today if you want to win a race or drift events you have to break all car knowledge. 1. Drag=drift 2. power builds There is something to be said about not touching it but tbh it really just feels lazy. From the racing to elimination this whole game is half baked with the amount of unfunny meta cars. I mean they deleted the bone crusher but said **** all too a stupid wagon and Porsche. I'm done with this game online **** a mess. Lol let's drift for a round till","i personally think this game is better than FH5 because of the ranked online racing and more varied map . graphics are amazing for the time, and still look great today . forza horizon 4 is one of the greatest car racing games of all time ."
135.God of War III,"This is an improvement from the 1st game. The challenge is great. The combat feels better & the scale just feels epic.. The best game in the God of War trilogy and it is not even close. That is not to say the other 2 weren't amazing, but this game just truly stands alone. Every second of this game feels as if another god is about to be absolutely demolished by Kratos as his quest for retribution continues and that is exactly what happens throughout this game. There couldn't have been a better end to Kratos' journey and this game is an absolute masterpiece. 10/10 must play game for all gamers, and must play trilogy as well. Kratos is truly an unstoppable character as shown in the God of War trilogy.. The most bad **** insane game you can imagine as a power trip. gameplay was refined, the bombastic set pieces are some of the greatest in playstation history, or at least a couple of them that still can rival even some of the 2018 and ragnorok line up. even comes toe to toe with some uncharted set pieces in my opinion. its crazy, the feeling, the ending being a defining moment for the series for all reasons. and it debatably keeps itself simple but it had to have a lot to keep itself together to prevent itself from being a reckless self indulgence for its run time. and it does do this, wonderfully. for hours. maybe a couple moments of stretching but there's a lot great regardless. its an absolute blast and again. if it wern't for the original trilogy, God of War 2018 wouldn't have worked. but they left very important seeds that sprouted here, the game prior, and the first one that all grew to trees in 2018.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game still looks good to this day. The graphics and replay ability of this game is why I have about 200 hours into it. It was also the first game I bought a collectors edition for.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Much like the other entires it takes what the first 2 did and makes them better. Combat feels amazing and it’s a great end to the Greek pantheon. It caps off the series well and is a great game even modern day.. I have been playing this since I'm 13 like oh my god how is this game so darn good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's tough to decide if this or the second one is better. I think I like the second one a bit better but they both are perfect on what they achieve. They both offer lots of boss fights, epic cutscenes, and graphics are improved here. The ending here is a brutal finale and a reminder just how relentless Kratos really is.. God of War 1 and 2 were already good, but God of War 3 took everything that was good about both games and combined it, making it a perfectly perfect game in almost every way.. I've played the original saga back to back to back, and I've got to say this is my favorite so awesome and thoughtful and tight. A masterpiece, unlike any other. it may be the game I play the best, it really deserves it to the end boss battles are really great graphics, very satisfying for that time, but some parts of the game are really very difficult and frustrating. Guys this game is a masterpiece Never compar any game to god of war 3 This is the only game with 0 haters U can find everything u want Characters 10 Story 10 Graphics for ps3 game 10 Main character 10 (prime Kratos is the best main character ever seen) Ending 10 Either the background song this game is the best And the mane page is on another level (it shows how much Kratos is angry and need his revenge only from his eyes) This my review I wanted to say too much other things but it may have spoiler For people who wanna play it there is the original version of the PS3 and the remastered version on PS4 but don't forget u can play PS4 games on PS5. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best twenty five Game in history PlayStation A masterpiece in every sense of the wordA masterpiece in every sense of the word. The first battle against Poseidon left me in awe—it was the ultimate display of violent aesthetics.. The visuals were good, the story was decent, the music was nice, it didn't have the greatest ending but still a game well worth playing.. The culmination of the God of War series.Giving us some of the most daring, uncensored kill scenes in gaming history.. New God of War games sure make you appreciate this even more. No pointless, long, unskippable cutscenes; no boring sequences where you play as someone other than Kratos; no tacked on, unnecessary mechanics - just pure action and fun almost 100% of the time.. This is, without a doubt, the best God of War of all time, with unparalleled levels of brutality and violence. Every aspect of the game is impressive; from the story to the graphics, everything is masterfully executed. The boss battles are epic, with each one surpassing the last in intensity and challenge. It's simply a fantastic and unforgettable experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the greatest game of all time easily exceeded my expectaions within the first hour of playing highly reccomend. This is 100% beautiful. The **** physics. The gore. And the boss fights. What I really hate about this game is the **** Aphrodite mini game. Where I have to mash the buttons to keep kratosgiving Aphrodite the giant blade. I have to do it with one hand for obvious reason. The game is actually good. I guess story mode is even better than multiplayer. **** you god of war 4 even though I play it and enjoy it. There were very few games that can match God of War 3's cinematic sensibility, its dynamics, its carnage.. god of war 3 is one of the best games on the ps3 ""for me it's second to rdr1"" its story is great, managing to overcome the story of 2 and completing Kratos' objective, in addition to the weapon options that bring us different weapons to play with . That's why it's a 10. This is the best game in the god of war series, Kratos is just so cool in this game and killing all of the Greek gods is entertaining because of the combat and story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best God of War game BY FAR, the game still have some issues but in general, is a great game, it only went DOWNHILL from here.. the game is similar to god of war 2 but with less annoying puzzles and 7th gen graphics and auto-save feature , the game play is exact same as god of war 1 and 2 and nothing improved , to me such gameplay is pretty boring specially when I compare it to other 7th gen era games , but after all game has good story line and good graphics and these are enough to play this game from start to finish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very fun to play. Killing all the gods is very satisfying cause finally we got real Kratos. Good locations and story line + suprising ending. 9/10. Good story, but those good mechanics it has are of no use if you have such a mediocre hitbox, terrible hack n slash, even the PS2 ones were better programmed. HOW THIS GAME LOST GOTY TO RDR Greatest Playstation Game, Greatest hack and slash game,GOW3 is Basically Pure Perfection, everything from the Epic Story & Great Characters to Mesmerizing Graphics to the addictive & Gory Gameplay and Breathtaking level Design to the Beautiful Art & Soundtracks. MUST PLAY. Undoubtedly, the best version of God of War is the third part, a full-fledged masterpiece. Original Kratos’ last journey is just perfect, all the epicness revolved around this game is awesome, the boss fights are all iconic, the scenarios are gorgeous and the last chapter of this story is just epic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best out of the trilogy, everything is just amped up to another level. I loved the addition of pandora and the message it delivered at the end (i knew i didn’t **** with Athena for a reason). Also, the fact he killed every Olympian besides Aphrodite is very funny to me.. Really good graphics, but the controls and gameplay are quite dated by comparison. Good game with a solid story overall, I just wish the gameplay was modernized as much as the graphics were.. This was ""grande"", from the story, characters, e.t.c KRATOS MADE YOU FEEL LIKE U WERE TRULY IN CONTROL ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. te quiero mucho god of war 3. This game is so freaking brutal, everything you do in this game is bad ass and fun, and I'ts the perfect ""ending''.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. This is God of War.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very terrible writing, gameplay ****. If you like watching movies this game is for you as there is more cutscenes then gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of War III is an exceptional action-adventure video game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. Released for the PlayStation 3 and later remastered for the PlayStation 4, this game is a masterpiece of storytelling, gameplay, and visual design.. The best God of war game to date. Garbage God of war PS4 and PS5 are an insult. My favorite God of War game and PS3 exclusive, even more than the rebooted titles on later consoles. A high octane revenge fantasy, this game is a fantastic experience and an excellent conclusion to the Greek God of War saga.. As a gen z 25 year old of the time of review this game. I'm honored to play such a good game , you can really tell how much love Santa Monica had put into this game. Sadly only few games nowadays are of this quality. one of the must have titles for the PS3, great visuals paired with a fantastic story and amazing combat makes this my favorite hack and slash of all time!. Pinnacle PS3 game. Over-the-top blood and gore, story, and spectacle. A must play and a most satisfying conclusion to Kratos' greek odyssey.. GREAT ACTİON PERFECT STORY THE QUALİTY OF THE GAME İS EXCELLENT MY SCORE=100/100. Very interesting game, pure violence with an interesting and amazing story, this game is one of the best games in history. My favorite playstation 3 game. Given how good the first two were, it's amazing how this game actually met or even exceeded the expectations.. God of War 3 is an adrenaline-fueled spectacle that showcases the pinnacle of the original God of War trilogy. With its intense action, epic scale, and satisfying conclusion to Kratos' journey, it undoubtedly earns its 9/10 rating.. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The GOTY of 2010s. The final of the great adventure of Greek Jratos and the bosses fights probably the best in series. I think all the visuals and story are cool but the gameplay is trash. All have to do is mash buttons until they break. God of War III is a great slasher. fantastic story , gameplay , boss fights , game design and music.. The amount of times I played this game is unimaginable, I played it at least 3 times on PS3 and 4 times on PS4(Ironic), this is a game you come back to just to beat the living soul outta the Gods that wronged Kratos. In my opinion, this is still the best GOD OF WAR game to ever exist, with great graphics combat, and a satisfying conclusion to the greek realm. GOD OF WAR Ragnarok comes close to this game with its content, but it's just something about the Rage of Kratos how 1D his character is, yet how complex it became as the game unfolds. If you haven't played any of the GOD OF WAR games, GOW III to this day is in its own class. This is a game that must be played, it demands it.. It´s the peak of these original greek games. It has something to say but it isn´t deep (doesn´t try to bite more than it can chew), which is fine. Gameplay is fun and good, but could be better, just like all of these games, which never completely nail the combat. Kratos and his motivations align great with the player´s (in a pretty underrated way) and 3 is the best example of this.. My favorite part about this game, is that it's short yet there's so much to do. You hack and slash your way through everything, and it's so satisfying once you complete the game knowing that you have slaughtered all in your path. It's very rewarding based on your play style and you can truly feel the way Kratos is feeling while hes murdering another god.. Damn!! This is my fav. God of war game along with ghost of sparta. Beast Boss fights,Gorgeous graphics, Epic combat with new mechanics, Many fun modes, Deep and hard puzzles, Engaging story... You name it! Really happy i played this game. This is why god of war is one of my fav. Series of all time. Also great addition to the god of war franchise with improvements here and there to the first game. Goated games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent game, great gameplay, one of the best stories I've ever seen in games. A complete sea of adventure.. Legendary tale of vengeance combined with real mythology is a beautiful blend executed masterfully here. Gameplay is perfected, idk how they pulled it off.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I keep coming back to play this game every couple of years, and every time I play it, I have a lot of fun! One of my favorite games of all time!. I love this game, looks really really good graphically and a wonderful sex scene.. the most epic bosses i have ever experienced in over 30 years of pure gaming cannot recommend it enough. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A good wrap-up to the original trilogy. I actually miss the combat sometimes.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely worth playing for 2022 Ragnarok th0 t00k ye@r$ f0r pl@yer$ t0 100% 1ng th1$.. This game is only epic and amazing. He contains epic boss battle (my prefered is the hades battle), amazing graphics, a great gameplay and very blood and gore.. I went through this game after I finished gow 4 and it amazed me. Yes, the plot may not be as cool as in the sequel, but the combat is something. Although by the release date of the game I was 4 years old, but still it is beautiful, I really look forward to a remake!. I'm late, but God of War 3 is still very good and I have very few complaints. It's easily one of the best games on PS3.. It's a good game life the first two but I found it unmemorable and nothing new added to the gameplay.. this game is so beautiful on ps3 that it even feels like i'm playing on a better ps4. A very entertaining game, not stretched. The gameplay in the game is difficult, which is good. The graphics are very progressive after the previous parts, which makes this game better. The game is great, I advise everyone.. God of War 3 is a prime example of how to properly continue the franchise on a new platform.. Gow 3 Gow 3 was a very good game.Everything was fun.İ can easily say that it is very hard.Bosses and other things(enemies,items)...They are very good.Grsphics were fine but atmosphere was not good.Myhtology was well designed but atmosphere can not make it even better. Pros Everything Cons Atmosphere Some areas Not very good items Score 84. Spectacular gameplay, the best graphics of its generation, one of the best hack 'n' slash ever made, and an entertaining story. God of War III was and still is one of the best experiences you can have in a game. simply legendary!. the best god of war game ever such a great story, the graphics were pretty good for the time, and it was really fun to play it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My love for the God Of War francizes never seems to end, and this game keeps the fire going. Personally I think GOWIII is the pinnacle of the whole francize. The game presents the climax of the story in such an emotional matter that makes the player acquainted for the professionals that made the game. The old yet refined fighting makes the game enjoyable and challenging, combining it with the simple and fun platforming it combines into a wonderful experience for the player.. My second favorite game of the franchise and fourth best game of all time, GOW 3 has a good story that may seem a bit off to a few, but the graphics and gameplay as well as characters, enemies/character designs and bosses are the best among any game out there. Must play.. Don't know howm any times i replayed this, like i did with god of war 2018. When this came out, this was my favorite god of war game. Until God of war 2018 came out and became my favorite game ever. These games keeps on to never disapoint.. The best way to end the Kratos saga. This game made me love the saga since it was the first one I played and thanks to it I finished the others on the PS2 and PSP. Every moment in the previous games feels like preparation for this one. Definitely a gem of video games.. 10/10 masterpiece, one of the best in the industry, top ter combat, best end to a trilogy. 8/10 Not as good as the first two or the fourth game. But it's still great.. God of War 3 is not a bad game, it's great. But there is one thing that makes this game a bit boring. The weapons. We have a total of 4 weapons in the game and 3 of them are chain weapons. That's why it makes you feel like you're using a different version of Blades of Chaos (Kratos' main weapons), not a different weapon, which makes the pace of the game a little boring. The weapons in God of War 2 were completely different from each other, I don't understand why they preferred something like this in this game. But that doesn't change the fact that it's still a great game, it's just not great as God of War 2.. This game is such an amazing. I like the story of sparta the god of ancient Greek. the gameplay it's stunning. This game is added to my favorite games I ever played.. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 10 Music: 9 Story: 9 Total: 9.33. A great game, an amazing story, Kratos is the best spartan warrior. I just Love it.. Amazing game, one of the best from the PS3 era. A tremendous sense of scale, some great bosses.. Maybe i've played this game too late, because i played this like in 2020 first time, but god damn it was awesome. It was a great experience, even though i thought that i wouldn't like this game because it's kind of old for me, but i was truly surprised with this in a positive way.. The best god of war in the series, it was the epic conclusion of the triology, the most bloody the most intense with it’s bossfights, gods and giants clash once and for all, Kratos was the real deal this game tells every gamer why he is one of the best in video games as a protaginist maybe antagonist too + god of war being one of the best game series of all times. God of war series are all good, but the great thing is god of 3 can still be better, beautiful graphics for ps3. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of War 3 is the logical conclusion of the trilogy. Here you should not look for logic in history at all. In GOW3 there is only blood, cruelty and adrenaline gameplay. And this gameplay has become as simple and linear as possible. GOW3 does not bring anything new to the series, it is very disappointing. GOW3 it's like a popcorn action movie - beautiful and spectacular, but very stupid. I am glad that Santa Monica Studio has gone from GOW3 to GOW 2018, they are moving in the right direction.. Greatest series of games ever, charismatic characters, especially gg, worthy conclusion to the series, before the sequel .... The game pushes the limits of epicness. Combat mechanics are quite satisfying. The graphics don't look bad even at this time. But I think our revenge journey with zeus should have ended with the 2nd game. Anyway, apart from that, god of war 3 is above average in its genre, which does things that should be done well, but does other things (characters, story, event, etc.) poorly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Now it's a classic! Best entry in the Kratos anthology, recommed to everyone!. One of the best games in the era of ps3, in its time the visuals were unbelievable, the music and the story of revenge ended in a very epic way, and its a masterpiece, do not hesitate to play it. Story: 10 Gameplay: 10 Visuals: 10 Music: 10 Personal Score: 10 >>> A MASTER PIECE !!. With God of War II, I easily complained that the game did not bring anything new compared to number one. The authors seem to have listened to me and offered us a full-fledged, this time the third sequel, which brings some of the changes. God of War I was a great game that should be played by every proud PlayStation fan. God of War II for a lot of people and the best part of the series and for me an amazing sequel to the game. How's God of War III? Awesome! The play throws us a delicious intro right at the beginning, which immediately draws us in with the music and reminds us of the events of the previous parts with its visual. Yes, the intro may be slightly longer than in previous games, but it's not a bad thing when it's the third part of the series, so it's nice for the game to recap the events in the story of the previous parts. However, after the end of this intra and the subsequent film, which will introduce us to the negatives, the game throws us into action and friends, it is delicious here! Yes, it was already delicious in previous games, but this time the authors shifted it a bit thanks to the fact that the game is already for newer generations of consoles and thanks to that it looks much better and especially the blood looks much more realistic and sprays a lot here. Violence and adult content in general is not a problem for the game and there will be sex scenes, as in previous episodes, when we simply have to press the buttons and turn the gamepad levers as the game shows us to get Red Orbs, thanks to which we will subsequently improve. Yes, there is, of course, character improvement here. Don't look for much here. Simply improving your swords and your abilities for even more bloodthirsty action. Speaking of the constant action and that there are a lot of them, I must not forget the locations where the game takes place. Although they have not undergone such a complete change and we will move here mainly in palaces and not so much somewhere in the wild, it does not matter, because the location simply looks different. Either it is because they got a new graphic jacket that suits them and they look more realistic, but personally I think it's because the game is so dark all the time and don't look for much light here compared to one and two. It's constantly cloudy and just dark, but it has its charm and it all makes you feel like the game is coming to a finish and that this is no longer a fairy tale, which of course wasn't even in previous games, but in short the game seemed a bit darker. To top it all off, there are some puzzles here and there that will give you a break from all those battles. When you jump through the game to the last hours of playing, a delicious end awaits you, which will suit you with the action-packed final of the game. I'm not going to spoiler with whom he has the honor at the end of the game Kratos, but I'll tell you that it was delicious and overall The Final Boss here is something delicious that ends the series. The whole thing seems like such an ending, although at the time of writing this review it is not the ending, because later God of War (2018) was published. But back to the three. To sum it all up. God of War III is an amazing game that brings even better action in new nice graphics. After all, the game looks slightly different from the previous ones, thanks to the already mentioned darker cloudy environment. The story, although amazing, still still, in my opinion, just doesn't have a first part. For me, however, an amazing game that fans of the series will devour, but overall I recommend this game.. This game, which appeared during the collapse of the God of War franchise, proved that the god of war is not dead. But the adolescent personality of the kratos and the childish behavior of the gods spoil the seriousness of the game.. Awesome boss battles, awesome soundtrack, great graphics, great gameplay that flows better than the previous GOW titles, great cutscenes and top quality voice acting. One of my only complaints is the inconsistency in level design with some levels being great and some levels being not so good. I also don't feel like replaying it because of its linearity.. In my opinion, is the best game out of the GOW franchise, simply epic, and the new enhanced and mastered version makes it more awesome to watch and play, the landscapes, the music and great boss fights makes this game one of the greatest in history!. One of the bests games of my life great work developed by Santa Monica. This game is just so good it’s difficult and fun, has an awesome story with great plot twists, and it’s one of the most important game in old gen. i am happy in play this game continuously. game shows awesome graphic, and gives cool hitting sense. the only flaw of this game is the storyline. How mad can one be? out the gate this game throws you in an epic boss fight with Poseidon! Kratos on his epic adventure to Zeus, but what a **** up journey. i played this **** over and over and overrrrrr! a few times on PS3 and a couple times on PS4. the ending of the game lead to greatness. this game is greatness and you doing it wrong if own a Playstation and DONT own this series.. Masterpiece ****. Technically superb. Very fun game. Still innovating after 3 games. Truly the peak of the series. best game godofwar3 ,kratos lovely ps2 and ps3,godofwar best game ps3 ,godofwar 3 best graphics ps3. Truly a masterpiece. No game has ever pushed the limits of the ps3 like this one. The massive scales, the beautiful graphics, the very-good at worst combat. This game had a very big impact on games of its time. A very fun and interesting game. While not having a good story, it truly shines as an excellent game with well-crafted mechanics. I love it! It is definitely a must-play.. An excellent and brutal action game that perfectly caps the original God of War trilogy. The combat is responsive and satisfying, the story is epic and conclusive, the bosses and set pieces are top notch. The similarities between three of your four weapons are is only tarnish on this otherwise all-time classic.. God of war 3 is a fantastic game overall. It may fall flat in some areas but at the end of the day it is an almost perfect end to the main GoW trilogy. The graphics are great, combat remains up to standard with the rest of the franchise and the story is well crafted and a great conclusion.. God Of War III is a game you should own! In fact, you should own every God Of War! But the third part is brutal, bloody and brilliant! It improves every aspect that made this series epic. So good, it hurts!. the best slasher and one of the best exclusive on PS3, a good game with an unusual setting. Excellent game Studio have done an incredible job. Great Gameplay and story. Even after all this time this game still looks great. It's one of those games that are still visually stunning 1 decade later. Kratos kicking God's butts is so satisfying. Just go play this if you enjoy mythology or fast-paced action. Sure, there weren't much quality of life changes applied to the gameplay department and it is not deep or anything, most of the time it can be resumed to frantically mashing buttons but the enemies and boss designs were so cool and the cinematic during fights were excellent that that can be forgiven. God of War III is a mindless fun game and one of the best eye-candy games. The story is good to boot too so it's not a bad deal even if it doesn't have Dark Souls-level combat.. Want to kill Gods and Goddess in your free time? This is the game for you. Enjoy the ride and see the ""final"" chapter of Kratos and Zeus.. It is just the best PS3 game ever,nice graphics,full of gore and violence :). My favorite game of all time, thats it ....................................... A gameplay that surpasses its predecessors, the epic battles against the bosses, a perfect closure to the numerical trilogy and a flourish for that time, and one of the best graphically on the ps3. Replayed this game to get ready for God of War on the PS4. Same thing as a played God of War 2, I just didn't care for it as much as I use to.. Incredibly brutal, incredibly fun, and deceptively beautiful, God of War 3 doesn't let up for a second. Exacting your revenge on one god after another gives you a feeling of power very few games manage to, and makes for one of the most fun games I've ever played. Definitely recommend.. This game is probably one I've played the most. The gameplay is really addictive, story is great, and graphics are stellar. Overall, a must play.. A brutal final chapter to an excellent trilogy. Full action and payoff gives the game incredible pacing and satisfying moments.. A good slasher, with bewitching gameplay, plot, cool locations, characters and a brutal main character.. amazing game the scale the action the graphics the music the story the ending ! oh man cant wait to replay it on the ps4. God of war III .............................................................. This is exactly how you should end a trilogy. It is epic, satisfactory, impactful and reflects your actions. It starts directly after the cliffhanger at the end of the previous game. This is actually a great transition because it was one of the best cliffhangers in video game history. I showed it back then to my non God of War playing friends and they were impressed. But back to this game. It is the end of the trilogy and an era. Kratos struggle will end one way or the other. The game is carefully made with for its time really impressive graphics and the always memorable / awesome soundtrack. Game-play wise it is the good old formula of the God of War games. For me this game has the best variety of weapons. Some are really good included into the puzzles. I must mention that some people and reviewers say there is a small lag for the controls. For me it was not note-able but I think it is my duty to point this out. Then there is the presentation and the boss battles. They go up to eleven and you feel the scale and impact. One boss fight in particular is nearly always it the most epic boss fights list of all time (And well deserved). After Mass Effect 3 I fell the need to say that it has a satisfying conclusion but read a bit further for another statement for the end (Without spoilers). The game holds also a mirror in front of you at some points to reflect what you have done. There are even interesting new characters and some character development. My only negative point is that the conclusion can for some people be a disappointment. There is a minority that say it is a sellout. While I disagree and would defend my point I see also the validity of their statements. Overall a satisfying conclusion and worthy of a place in my collection.. Story - 10/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics - 10/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Levels - 8/10 Replay value - 8/10. The best game I have played on the PS3 along with The Last of Us. Incredible graphics, entertaining gameplay and story. One of my favorites of all time.. Played on PlayStation 3. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. Even though the third entry in the series didn't see the great jump from the first to the second game, it still was able to extract as much as possible out of the god of war formula. Taking on the gods themselves has never felt so satisfying.. **** hardcore but fan. But there is one thing but ... What kind of **** came up with missions with the free fall of Kratos ???. G","the best game in the god of war trilogy and it is not even close . every second of this game feels as if another god is about to be absolutely demolished by Kratos as his quest for retribution continues . gameplay was refined, the bombastic set pieces are some of the greatest in playstation history ."
136.NHL 2002,"Another Great hockey game from EA Sports. The engine is similar to that in NHL 2001, with a few improvements. The game added a power-up system in a form of collectable cards. These cards will give boosts to certain star players on your team. Don Taylor from NHL Rock the Rink joins Jim Hughson as a play by play announcer. They went for a more humorous commentary this time. The jokes are hit or miss, but overall the commentary is as good as you would expect.. Pretty fun game to play still today but matches end up with ridiculous scores like 8-15 or 4-9. Achievements are kind of fun and cards also. If you are looking for realistic hockey game look somewhere else.","the game added a power-up system in a form of collectable cards . the jokes are hit or miss, but overall the commentary is as good as you would expect . matches end up with ridiculous scores like 8-15 or 4-9."
137.NFL 2K3,"This was a pretty good run at Madden and this is Sega continuing the momentum from the Dreamcast. It's a standard football game for the time it was released. There's nothing over the top about the title. Gameplay was good and it was entertaining. A solid game. Not sure I would say it's a must play but it is for any hardcore football fan looking to play the games from the early 2000s. If you're looking for the Mid 2000s NFL games Madden would be the go to.. Looking back 12 years ago, This game was a good successor to NFL 2K1 & 2K2. This game still sets some standards for football games today. One thing for sure is classics like these are better than new ones today. If you are looking for some old-school, retro football game on Game Cube: plug in 2 controllers, buy the game, enter the disk, and prepare for some chaotic fun.",this is Sega continuing the momentum from the Dreamcast . it's a standard football game for the time it was released . if you're looking for the mid 2000s football games Madden would be the go to .
138.SSX Tricky,"Ssx is a 10/10, and this added the small tweaks it deserved. My only gripe is that it didnt add enough. Would have like to see 3-5 more tracks. It did come out pretty soon after ssx though and what it did add was superb, so maintains the 10 rating. It's by far my favorite game of all time, absolutely everything is perfect in my opinion. Every character has it's own personality and that's cool because you do not feel bored playing with them. The soundtrack is amazingly perfect, the uber tricks is what makes this game the best snowboarding franchise of all time. The tracks are so cool and unique. The game is pure fun and adrenaline from the beginning to the end. It's also a classic, so expect a great game.. ""SSX Tricky"" is the Tony Hawk of snowboarding games. It's colorful, over-the-top and tons of fun. Highly-accessible, yet very challenging. This is a true PS2 classic. A masterpiece of arcade-like extreme sports. I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. OVERALL - 92% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 6/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 9/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 8/10 The coolest sports game to date. Opting for outrageousness over realism, SSX Tricky kills it. It's easy to get into and feels different from snowboarder to snowboarder. SSXT is a lot of fun.. Typical early 00s sports game bit rough now but can still be picked up and enjoyed.. i dont know where to start, 2001 game that tops most 2018 games regarding pure entertainment. i wish there was a remake of this game for todays consoles. i would trade my left leg for this kind of remake. not that the gaming company would ever need a leg, but in conclusion... this is the best ps2 game. Imagine multiplayer on such beauty concept. wow! 10/10. Everyone has a copy ... That's the most tricky things !! The evolution of SSX games has coming. Probably the best SSX game to date. Took the original and made the riders handle smoother and better.. This game is excessively good. Even though it is nostalgic, going back and playing it doesn't just bring nostalgia. This game is SUPER fun. You NEED to play this game. It is a fast-paced game with ridiculous tricks to pull off & fun music the whole game. Even the bonus features are fun to watch. I cannot find a flaw in this game. One of the funnest / best games of all time, in my opinion.. This is probably one of the best games I've ever played, and it's probably one of the greatest PS2 games out there. The fun and exuberance is infectious, the visuals are nice and colorful, and the controls play nice and smooth. The soundtrack is also one of the best to hit a home console game. This game is the full codifying embodiment of recklessness and awesomeness. This game is a must-play for anyone who's still got their PS2 lying around.. Words cannot describe how awesome SSX Tricky is it remains to be the best snowboarding game of all time sorry but 1080 Avalanche does not come close to competing with it must buy and as it is from 2001 it is extremly cheap but is not that easy to come by but play this game you wont regret it.. THE GREATEST SSX GAME, one of the best PS2 games ive ever played it was great. so much nostalgia dood. i know this is not a professional review but it so fun. The best PS2 of all time in my opinion. Fantastic soundtrack, great graphics and sense of speed. Lots of options, modes and character. Brilliant fun. 10/10. Not only is this game the best SSX game but it's actually a classic game in gaming overall. This game is pure fun. You need to own this game if you still use your PS2.","the soundtrack is amazingly perfect, the uber tricks is what makes this game the best snowboarding franchise of all time . the game is colorful, over-the-top and tons of fun. Highly-accessible, yet very challenging . the coolest sports game to date ."
139.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,"This game absolutely rips. Tight and challenging platforming mixed with the rewind time mechanic makes for an unforgettable experience.. Great game, its the only game that my Mother plays. its a wonder she even plays video games!. I realy love this game i beat it 2-3 times every year ican't get enough of it!! everytime i run the game i join its world from the menu only its the greatest of all times and even the best game of assassins creed can't get a half of its greatness!. The first of a series of action-platforming games that are more than the sum of their parts--despite their extremely linear and repetitive design. Kicking off a Prince of Persia reboot trilogy (of sorts,) these games were loads of fun for their time. Their atmosphere and acrobatics still hold up today--even if there remains few other reasons to ever replay them.. Not good. The main feature, the capability to go backwards in time, is almost useless, as the amount of times you can use it befire running out of sand is super low. Not as precise as it should be, and the third boss is nearly imposible to kill, totally ridiculous beast that kills you in less than 20 seconds no matter how you try. Good idea, terrible execution. About the war there is immortal moves. About the story history continued. When Ubisoft made good games.. An amazing game. I watched a friend play it for it's entirety, one of the best memories of my childhood. The atmosphere is quite unique.. Nice update of the influential platform game with pretty visuals, responsive controls, fluid movement and interesting environments. The rewind option is also a nice inclusion that prevents frustration from setting in at the trickier sections. One of the best platformers for the PS2.. A very entretaining, fun and challenging game, if you like Prince of Persia, it is a must play.. This reboot of Jordan Mechner's 2D platformer is a great success. It takes the form of an ""Aladdin""-like fairytale with moves straight out of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". The game is visually beautiful and very artistic. While the combat can get repetitive, it doesn't ruin the experience. ""Sands of Time"" mainly consists of platforming segments and they are great fun. Fans of the original POP will love this. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. This is a fantastic game even for 2022. Just play it again. Plaaaaaay ittttttttt. It’s one of those games that you wanna play again for the first time. Anymore to say?. It’s alright, definitely not the best Prince of Persia game in my opinion. The story is good and this is the beginning of the Prince of Persia trilogy witch has the best Prince of Persia game.. Very nice and solid game. The artistic direction and the intriguing puzzles will keep U entertained.. One of the best on the PS2, no doubt! Gorgeous graphics, accurate gameplay, great soundtrack! Low difficulty, but nothing to get in the way! The only thing he sins is the fighting mechanics, which looks like Aquaman from GameCube and XBox, is not as good as a GOW, or Bayonetta for example, but the fights are still epic! Without a doubt this is one of the best in history.. The Greatest game of the sixth generation of gaming. It needs no introduction. as it pioneered some elements such as free-flow combat , puzzle and parkour that inspired other great franchises such as assassin's creed and the arkham series.. The first game i ever played. The time mechanics were so cool and innovative and it's also the predecessor of Assassin's Creed saga, so i think it's all said.. Back in 2003 My big Brother bought this game with his friend and came to house install and start play this game. Me, my brother and his friend mouth is opened because Graphics was magnicifent! Gameplay was so good. Walking at walls,flip,jumping up from enemys and best thing is recall time! People must play this game exept If you like classics.. One of gaming true masterpieces. Some of the most interesting and fun puzzles and traversal puzzles in any game ever. A beautiful story of a Persian war monger and a Indian princess who are enemies but have work together and eventually bond to save the land. The voice acting dosent have the accents of the place of the world they are in and is all the better for it. The Prince sound like a posh Noble and Farrahs voice is just adorable and really endears you to her character. Ive heard people say like they say in many older games the Movement and Combat is clunky, but just like games like Silent hill, the controls are clearly intentional and with a small learning curve that is missing in modern games it all works great.. Best videogame of all time. It is also the most artistic of the POP trilogy, with a more complex plot (real love story) and more beatiful graphics than the other games. And the soundtrack... BEST VIDEOGAME SOUNDTRACK OF ALL TIME. Listen to ""Time Only Knows"" and you will see!. Very good game, still i think the second part is much better in the action part but in story this one is better.. Straight out of the pages of a fairy tale, this Ubisoft reboot of Prince of Persia showcases phenomenal level design in the platforming segments even if the puzzles and combat aren't as impressive. This is the prince at endearing best.. For mi this is one of the best game ever made, any list that don't include this masterpiece, is wrong, period.. + Story +Parkour +Level design +Characters+Soundtrack -There are only two bosses -Lack of side characters. A great game with fantastic story and challenging puzzle and action gameplay.. One of the best games that i played.I just love everything about this game. 12/10. If they do a new POP i hope is this good. A damn good game done extremely **** beginning of what Uncharted, Tomb Raider, and other 3d action platformers. prince of Persia the sands of time is a remake of the 1989 prince of Persia after you finish the sands of time you unlock the original prince of Persia. This game starts off good enough, but this game becomes very repetitive because the whole game is in this one castle and it gets very boring. the story is very good but it movies very slowly and goes on for far too long. this game is about ten hours long but so little happens to break up the repetitive gameplay. this game is a platformer and for the most part, the platforming is good. the selling point of the game is the sand of time which in the game is a dagger which can either go back in time or slow down time. the combat is good at the beginning but becomes very repetitive afterward. there are only five enemy types and nothing is done in the whole game to break up the repetitive combat. The game could have been a lot better if it was not so repetitive. all it had to do was make the castle more interesting. have the story move on a bit quicker and add something to the combat. but this game is very fun at the beginning and at the end. 7 at of 10. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Ubisoft. + Good Story + Good Gameplay + Rewind Time. Revolutionary gameplay and amazing graphics for 2003, which impact can still be felt today. The huge budget set an example for modern AAA games. There are some minor problems I won't mention here since other reviewers covered them. You just simply HAVE to play this game. The ending is actually quite satisfying too. You will be surprised.. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has got to be one of the best Prince of Persia games ever made and arguably confirmed to have a movie that'll never be better than the video game in any taste of quality.. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Ubisoft. + Good Story + Good Gameplay + Rewind Time. Absolute ps2 classic. The assassins creed games for the ps2 era but more focused and less rushed I should add. Back when 3d plat-formers were plat-formers. Great ideas (like moving back time), great combat and great plat-forming.. A very nice game, mixing battle and puzzles. Save locations are not too far one from each other. Graphix are nice. I think there could be more dialog between the Prince and Farah. Buy and play it :D. This game broke the mould in so many ways. The graphics, the game play, the rewind. The character acting was great with a strong story and the music was memorable as I find myself singing some of the tunes and having some of the tracks show up on my playlists to this day. The game is not too long but it is a deep storyline that you could play through at least twice. It's obvious the developers borrowed from ICO, but I don't mind. I don't mind a strong, evident influence as long as the final new work is a step in the right direction. Game of the year!. Awesome unique this game is jumping around and climbing except when the camera fails a bit. The graphics are awesome to watch the acting is impressive but short, the barely reaches five hours long very short for a adventure game so my sincere review is 8.000 out of 10. Blast from the past. I'm currently playing this on the Trilogy set for PS3, but decided to review them separately for the old consoles. PoP Sands of Time, is a good game. Good, but not great. The visuals for the time were outstanding, and even now they hold their own. The music and voice acting is very authentic and immersive and the platforming in the game is ridiculously fun and exciting. Now onto the bad. The story to the game is mediocre, alot of things aren't explained and for the most part it just doesn't stand out. The camera is nasty piece of work, for the most part its ok, but you find yourself constantly jumping to your death or getting cut up by enemies when it hits a wall and blocks your view. But you can rewind time you say? While a great idea, I barely used it unless I fell off a cliff. In battles, its near useless, it constantly resets itself after killing an enemy, and if your dying, which is often, don't count on it. The fighting itself is lackluster, basic mashing of a button, no innovation and enemies get progressively harder, and not in the challenging way. For the most part though it is a good game, one you can get into and enjoy, but expect to be frustrated ALOT.. Fifteen years after the original Ubisoft released the revamped Prince of Persia in The Sands of Time which managed to maintain the charm of the 2D game whilst simultaneously creating something truly unique. The game begins with the prince defeating Maharajah and then accidently unleashing The Sands of Time, an evil force that transforms the population into demons. Throughout his quest the prince has to traverse his fathers huge palace relying on his wits and acrobatic skills to avoid traps and enemies intent on his destruction. The controls for both movement and combat are virtually flawless and it quickly becomes second nature to throw the prince around the beautiful environment. The most interesting aspect however is that any mistakes made can be rewound (providing you have energy in the dagger) allowing the player to take ample risks and ensuring that a miss-timed jump is not punished by an instant death. This helps to make the game far less frustrating than it may otherwise have been. During his travels the Prince also meets a beautiful but independent princess and their relationship becomes central to the plot and gameplay of The Sands of Time. On the odd occasion this can become slightly irritating, as the death of the princess during combat means having to restart that section, but overall their interaction is a joy to watch and helps make for a clever finale. Two sequels have since been released and, while they certainly remove some of the frustrations of this first title, they also lack the charm and intelligence that The Sands of Time provided meaning this is still the pinnacle of the series.. For me, this is the pinnacle of the Prince of Persia series. Loved playing it. Rarely frustrating, always fun. I don't really remember thinking it was 'too easy,' with the exception of the last guy. It's been a couple years since I last played through this game, but I remember thinking he was too easy. Anyhow, that's not the worst thing in the world.. Truly awesome, there is no other word. Buy it, you will love it. The first instalment of a wonderful sweeping, adventure trilogy. The gameplay is wonderful, the story is an amazing arc that spans time.. You are looking at a review for one of the best games on the PS2, it's enjoyable story, likable characters, and unique gameplay will keep you hooked from the moment you pick it up, the graphics are fantastic as is the sound, the controls are top notch, and it succeeds in almost every way, this is a must play that is just shy of perfection.","this is the first of a series of action-platforming games that are more than the sum of their parts . kicking off a prince of persia reboot trilogy, these games were loads of fun for their time . the main feature, the capability to go backwards in time, is almost useless ."
14.Halo: Combat Evolved,"One of the most legendary and influential games of all time without question. What sets this game apart from others from this time is how well the game has aged. This game still has some of the best controls of any fps. The graphics have certainly aged, but there is an odd charm in their simplicity. The story is simple, solid, and entertaining, but it's still the weakest narrative of the bungie games in my opinion. As far as flaws go, the library mission is a mental endurance test and a descent into madness. I think it only stands out this way because every other level is basically perfect. I'd also say that some weapons like the assault rifle and needler are worthless, even on easier difficulties. Of course I should also mention how overpowered the pistol is in multiplayer. In the face of everything this game gets right, these flaws don't even come close to ruining it. Most of the weapons and vehicles are incredibly fun to use. Many of the levels are open with a sandbox feel and can be completed in multiple ways, which is especially impressive given it was an xbox launch title, although it should go without saying that the master chief collection is the definitive way to play this game. It feels great playing at higher resolutions and framerates and you also get online multiplayer, which was not in the original release. Halo combat evolved is a game everyone should play. Even with a few flaws, it's not just one of the best games of all time, but also one of the most influential.. This was the best game of 2001 and that's a big thing considering gta 3 released at the time. revolutionized fps tbh. I would say “Hello darling, how was your day”, but this time, definitely I gotta say “Here you are love of my life, let me cook you something nice, and make your life perfect”.. I was torn between giving this game either a 8 or 9. One one hand this game revolutionized shooters and introduced gameplay mechanics used in every single FPS game to this day. On the other, the game can be quite a downgrade from its younger brothers, most notably Halo 3. The maps are also reused in the second half of the game andI always let out an audible groan when I have to play the Library.. Halo had a gigantic impact when it came out. It revolutionized the fps genre on consoles with it's smooth gameplay, interesting story, for the time amazing graphics and an unforgettable soundtrack. Bungie has created a game for the ages and with the Master Chief as it's hero, an Icon of video gaming.. Great game, simple, good story, can’t complain. The anniversary version adds the right amount of taste to it.. The one that started it all, didn’t play this as much as the others but would say halo is the greatest fps trilogy of all time. The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be. Halo CE is still perfect on almost every level.. It's a great game. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of action, its mechanics are very good, the story line is very solid and of course the master chief is great.. This game is a masterpiece, its mechanics, its characters, its universe, I love it, it's great.. An important game for the time that influenced console shooters in particular for a long time, for better or worse, and spawned an enormous franchise and helped propel the Xbox console from a somewhat unlikely outsider attempt from Microsoft, to becoming the mainstay and only significant rival to Sony's Playstation series. My first memory of actually playing Halo wasn't until 2003, in co-op on a tiny TV in a university hall of residence kitchen, visiting a friend after going to see the band Chimaira for the first time. It was an impressive experience in that diminished scale, and I later bought the original Windows port, which was superior in many ways though lacked co-op (but had otherwise expanded multiplayer options). Playing Halo again now, either in it's traditional original form or via the divisive enhanced editions, the game's flaws are more glaring, particularly with it's pacing, but it remains a satisfying shooter with a unique feel that carried across most of the other games in the franchise almost unchanged.. This game is one of the most revolutionary games ever made. The story is amazing. The campaign gameplay is amazing and the multiplayer is one of the best in any game. 10/10. The prodigal son of shooters. A pillar in the halls of FPSand worthy of the title legend.. Masterpiece of the 6th gen. This game defined generations of gamers and gaming. Its a shame Halo nowadays is just such trash. From a defunct, anti-halo TV show, to underwhelming games.. One of the best gaming entries of the early 2000's. It is still great to this day and I will recommend it to anyone. ""No, I think we're just getting started."". A Timeless Classic – The Birth of a Legend! (5/5) Halo: Combat Evolved is more than just a game – it’s a cultural icon, a milestone in gaming history, and the beginning of one of the most breathtaking sci-fi sagas of all time. Even years after its original release, Halo still radiates the same magic and excitement that captivated players from day one.

Master Chief and his epic journey are timeless, and Halo: Combat Evolved will forever be remembered as one of the greatest games of all **** absolutely epic milestone – Halo: Combat Evolved is, and always will be, unbeatable!. THIS GAME IS GOOOOOOOOOD Even in 2024 this game is good. It still holds up after over 20 years. This game isn't as flashy or fast as Halo Infinite, but what it is is fun, and innovative. Levels while closed in are large and expansive, the story while often simplistic is charming and fun to follow. And the AI while a bit broken (especially on lower difficulties) compared to modern day, is still so much better than many cover based FPS's that came beforeor after.. Never thought to leave a review. However here I am years later to say what a fantastic game.. This is easily the greatest xbox game made of all time and the best halo story mode so far. One of the pioners of console shooters, this game is an all timer, one of the best ever made.. i played halo reach and 4 before playing this both were good games but this one is utter garbage the whole game is copy paste of one or two assets the combat get very boring after 10 minutes of story is boring as hell definitely not worth it. Keyes is the best mission. First half of the game is actually the worst part. The shotgun is baller, so is the sniper.. When you finally set down the controller the first time, and eventually hunger or exhaustion do force all of us to take a break, Halo has pulled you completely into its world and started one of the best sci-fi gaming adventures of all time.. Just want to say that the Warhog is ****, but the rest is good for the time it realesead. Today it is playabale but old.. ***Not a Halo: CE Anniversary or a Halo: CE from the Master Chief Collection review*** (Played on an original XBOX console, controller and copy of the game). REVIEW: It doesn’t take long to get absolutely dumbfounded at the brilliance of Martin O’Donells score, the intriguing story that unfolds in front of you as much as in front of the characters themselves, the iconic alien enemies, an unprecedented plot-twist mid-game and a fun, unmatched gameplay loop. This game never gets old, and it certainly set the stage for one of the greatest video game and sci-fi franchises of all time. If you have an original XBOX and haven’t played this game, you’re certainly missing out.. The game was a great start to the series and and makes you want to play the next one. I can definitely see how this game got to Microsoft flag ship and highly acclaimed honors. The only disappointment of the game was the horde like swarms of of enemys and maps that feel repetitive and seem to go on and on forever. Besides these problems this game makes every game after it a huge success for the series and slot into the timeline perfectly. In conclusion this game is a must play for series with ignoreable issues and is definitely Bungies greatest projects ever.. A headache inducing mess. There's so much repetitive garbage it isn't really fun to endure. The story aspects of the game are quite good and I find intriguing but unfortunately such are few and far between. The majority of the game will have you walking through identical copy paste hallways and killing identical aliens with no real rhyme or reason. The gun-play is actually quite good and can be fun for the first few minutes but after hours of killing identical monsters with few in-between it leaves the game feeling more like a shooting simulator with some small interesting story elements peppered in-between. I found the 2nd Halo game good at addressing this issue and adding more interesting story and removing a lot of the repetitive gun-play that gets dry really fast. Overall it doesn't hold a candle to the 2nd entry in the season.. Iconic, kickstarted the franchise. Loved playing the demo as a kid, flood twist is cool, soundtrack is incredible, characters are basic but likable.. Its just a poor mans Doom essentially. Run from point a to point b, kill everything in between.. The most important game of this century. It revolutionised the FPS genre on console, introduced the most successful entertainment IP of the ‘00s, ushered in cinematic storytelling to the FPS market, created the split-screen multiplayer craze, brought us Red vs Blue + more golden age content creation, the most iconic music in the industry's history, a mascot up there with Mario, Sonic & Link and is single-handedly responsible for the success of an entire console brand. Xbox wouldn’t have succeeded without this one game, which is insane to think about. In other words, it’s the genre's magnum opus. A lightning in a bottle moment not just for gaming, but pop-culture and entertainment as a whole.. The game that started first person shooters (gave it the popularity) What an amazing time in my life. I was around 7 or 8 years old when my brothers and I got the OG Xbox for Christmas. It started our huge love for gaming. We owe it to this game.. Why the **** do people like the flood? seriously its the worst part of every halo and it takes up half the **** game. Just one of those games where you play the first half of it and then turn off the console and start again. I hate the flood so much. It's Halo. C'mon. This was THE reason to buy an Xbox. The people reviewing saying ""it doesn't hold up today"" are the same dimwits who'd give Legend of Zelda a 5/10 for being 8 bit. Halo: CE was the benchmark for what a modern FPS could be for yearssss. And jfc, dude,the SOUNDTRACK. Buhbuhbuh buuuuhhhhh Everyone just heard those notes just now.. While not perfect Halo Combat Evolved cements in place in gaming with its extremely fluid controls, fun level design and an overall a complete story mode that is perfectly balanced with it multiplayer. While the original multiplayer was LAN party, the MCC allows for online multiplayer so if you haven't had a chance to play it split screen all those years ago you still can experience it today.. its a good game but nowhere near a 10/10. People who say that it is a 10/10 are just blinded by nostalgia and don't see the game for what it really is. 6/10 MAX.. this is such a great gaam i love the part were mister ghiphe said "" its finishing time and finished the fight"" and then finnished all over the place. thisline is what inspired me to start my voice action career and i have since acted as marine#56 and district 5medic. so anyways 1/10. Easy 10/10. Even today this is a game everyone should play just to see how massive it impacted the gaming franchise back in the day. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the finest FPS ever created with incredibly fun multiplayer and campaign.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. its a hard game to get away from you get a bit bored and the first thing that come to mined is halo CE great game. One of the greatest games of all time. I still go back to replay once a year or so.. I absolutely HATED this game when it came out. I forced myself to play it because everyone else loved it. Not for me.. Expansive and open levels mixed with linear levels that don't even feel that linear. 9 Amazing Levels and one illegal torture method POA: Perfect HALO:PERFECT TAR:PERFECT TSC: EXTRA PERFECT AOTCR: AMAZING 343 GS: PERFECT LIBRARY: PAIN TB: AMAZING KEYES:OK TM:AMAZING Unique Encounters in every level Out of bounds exploration (no kill timers, only one invisible barrier) Sense of wonder no other halo recaptures Repetitive level design in AOTCR, TB and LIBRARY (BIG OOPSIE) :( Very Smart AI for 2001 and honestly holds up over a lot of AAA Games we get today Enemies have obvious strengths and weaknesses and smart players will be rewarded to paying attention to these One Shotting hunters with pistol **** tho :( Multi Faction Battles in the second half of the campaign are very entertaining! Every Weapon is Viable to use, even on legendary difficulty. Legendary is an extremely tough, but fair challenge (while still being fun to play) Rocket Flood are the only exception to this, they aren't as bad, say, halo 2 Sniper Jackals- But they are not fun to fight for sure. Simple, but effective story- nothing in this game is not iconic; Covenant, The Chief, The Halo Ring, The Flood, The Forerunners. And one of the best twists in all of gaming, yea you Know ;) The game has so much love and passion poured into it, except whoever made the library- screw that guy.. it's fun. Beat it last night and oh man it was great. my only complaints would be that the library was pretty repetitive and a lot of indoor areas on the halo looked samey. aside from that, it is an incredible game that holds its place in gaming history.. Second favorite halo game of all time love it. One of the best shooter of the old school. One of the most important games in the history of gaming. Halo CE is a must play.. Halo Combat Evolved is really good. The floaty movement doesn't age perfectly, and getting tapped by a warthog is instant death, however, the campaign is quite incredible, from saving Captain Keyes, to finding the horror of the Flood, to destroying the Halo ring, this game was really good. The multiplayer at the time was only LAN party and splitscreen, that being said, it was still pretty good, with some noteable maps. Overall, even though game mechanics are a little too floaty, it is a great start to my favorite franchise.. A game that honestly should have no introduction. This game changed FPS games on console with effects still seen today in it's campaign and multiplayer. What an insane launch title, Xbox would not be the same without the Chief.. this is a very great game and i like very much this game. but also i wish there were more hot women. I will never understand why people loved this game so much, its just your average FPS. The titan of FPS franchises, and put Xbox on the map. Easily one of the best shooters ever made.. Never played any Halo games... recently finished Halo CE and it's not bad at all TBH.. One of the most overrated games of all time; not sure how this game became so popular; the campaign is boring, I gues multiplayer is fun, but that's about it.. A masterpiece of FPS games, Halo brings a memorable soundtrack, a combat that brings difficulty to the player and at the same time provides incredible fun, the franchise may not have maintained the same level in later games, but this is a work cousin.. The game that started it all. Halo created a fantastic franchise that held strong for many years for Xbox players. It revolutionized first person shooters. While it is not as good as some of its successors, it deserves to get credit for what it created. Definitely recommend playing through this game, along with the others on Halo: The Master Chief Collection. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The campaign is nearly perfect, with great level design and an amazing story. While it has its flaws, its overall one of the greatest games of all time.. Its an EPIC game. I like the gameplay and the visuals were fantastic. I would like to play again in future. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the most overrated FPS of all time. It wasn't good then, and it isn't good now. It didn't significantly innovate either. The true startingpoint of console FPS games was Goldeneye, with Timesplitters bringing console FPS to near-modern standards. The added polish provided by Halo does not justify the hype.. this game has so much atmosphere. it will literally consume you. 10/10 amazing and beautiful soundtrack as well that really fits the game.. Great game at 2001 nice soundtrack and great atmosfere but you can tell they only had 9 month to make the game, people like to say the game is a masterpiece and stuff but this game aged like milk, finicky combat system, guns feels like nerf guns, vehicle feels like its driftting on ice, a vehicle who supposed to be a tank but is super weak and straight up **** level design, credit where credit is due this game is super impresive in 2001 and im sure kid me in 2001 with an xbox would ove this game but if you dont have the nostalgia and is a new player its just terible.. Game-changing FPS that launched a thousand Xbox sales. Great looking, varied, with cool environments, an intriguing story and genuinely intelligent enemies to battle. Halo: Anniversary for the 360 gives the game a HD facelift making that the better option, but it's still a stone cold classic.. It's a classic for a reason. The gunplay holds up well today, allies and enemies are full of character, weapons and vehicles are diverse. Above all it's real strength is presentation, great music, art direction, and voice acting really set it apart.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An all time classic. Halo combat evolved is a perfect game. Event playing it today fi think is too good. The soundtrack is filled with classics. shooting is fun. The deferent maps feel great although they are used repetitively.. Not the best halo game, but still an enjoyable one. Its definitely a little repetitive and suffers from some pacing issues (the library section) but it's still an absolute classic with a fantastic multiplayer.. Nothing beats the first Halo game. It's maybe the best console shooter ever released. For me, it was a reason to buy the original Xbox - and still is today. Pure nostalgia! Overall rating: 9,5.. Man, for an Xbox launch title in 2001 this game was crazily booming! With an amazing multiplayer, a great story, graphics (while dated) are great and overall, a fantastic start to the Xbox and Master Chief would become one of the biggest games icons in the 2000s.. Very great game. The precursor to a lot of other shooter games. Is has great originality too.. ""Halo: Combat Evolved"" for the Xbox ranked up with the best shooters of the early 00's. It's now quite dated, but at the time of its release, this was the best game on the console. Only some repetitive levels and the lack of proper multiplayer (no online or split-screen) kept it from being a true 10. Like ""Grand Theft Auto III"", it was a near perfect title that would spawn a long lasting franchise. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. It's fine, but it doesn't hold up as this perfect game some people want you to believe. The second half of the levels are bad, and half the weapons are bad.. This is just classic Halo fun. The level design makes it so that every room is really interesting and the weapons are really satisfying to use. The story isnt that interesting and is just a normal Halo story but it doesnt really take anything away from the gameplay. The muliplayer is also so amazing. It invokes so much nostalgia and you could spend hours playing. The music is really good at the beginning but then gets repetitive really fast.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Some levels (the library *cough*) may be outdated but the atmosphere is still there plus the gameplay is still satisfying after all these years.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. Tops man brilliant game only time I ever took shooters seriously was this game before this I hated shooters all of them but I've become a fanatic halo I still very bad at shooting even in 2023 but hey this franchise lives on big up to the creators of this. Unfortunately, this is what Microsoft company understands from the game. The interesting part is that most of the video game reviewers do not understand only the simple and non-development game genres such as FPS and Sports, let's move on to the review without further ado. First of all, is the game good, which is the exaggerated part? Unfortunately, the game is a disgrace, let alone being bad. We can use a maximum of two weapons with an incredible variety of weapons throughout the game, which makes the game incredibly boring and repetitive, not only mechanically, but also as a level design, the game makes you walk around the same places like a closed box from start to finish. Designs and mechanics Aside from the constant repetition, the game's lack of variety is another matter. Let's come to the most praised subject of the game, artificial intelligence, yes, artificial intelligence has proven that it is good at microsoft software, as never before in the game world. Enemies analyze your movements and play against you, and in the game This is the only tangible thing. Unfortunately, the game makes the only good part of it useless due to its crappy mechanics, level designs and diversity. This game is neither an Arcade FPS or a Realistic FPS, a game that failed both. Stop comparing it to Unreal gold and Quake 2. Serious sam The first encounter opponent I can't even say that if these games are masterpieces, this game is a disgrace. As for the score of the game, it's 42/100. This game has a Great history great graphics but a little repetitive in some parts. Uhm... I don't even know where to begin. When I think of the year 2001, this piece comes to mind. Simply way ahead of its time. Although the textures might feel repetitive. Classic masterpiece! You can even play today without losing fun, Halo CE has everything what FPS games needed.. This game is a masterpiece, one of the best of the best. you should play it!. A pinnacle not only for FPS games, but for video games in general. For 2001, it still holds as a game worth playing in 2022, and split-screen campaign and multiplayer is always amusing. However, this is the version worth playing, don't bother with MCC or Anniversary edition. If you got a functioning O.G. Xbox, find yourself a second-hand copy of it, and borrow your grandfather's old CRT television.. one of the best if not the best gaming experience I had in my life , revolutionary , ahead of its time , amazing. The FPS game that changed it all! Playing this on the original Xbox as a kid we’re some of the greatest gaming moments of my life. There are still very few games that can capture what Halo CE captured. Not only on the combat level or graphical level at the time but the story and wonder in this game were unmatched. The amazing music playing while looking out at the ring and the ancient artifacts made you feel like you were seeing something incredible. This game holds up today, especially when playing it on next Gen consoles. This is one of the greats!. One of the first games I ever played, I'm not kidding when I said I used to play this game with my father when I was around 3 years old. Irresponsible parenting aside, I love this game with all my heart, it undoubtedly has shaped who I am and offers a lot of fond memories I doubt I'll ever forget. The original trilogy of the Halo games, along with its spin-offs are as close to the perfect game series I dare to name. I only wish 343 recognized what they owned when making the new games. Despite this, even the tarnish the likes Halo 5 and Infinite has left on the series is not enough to dent to legacy this game has created. At least for me, this is the GOAT first person shooter.. Halo Combat Evolved is an unfinished masterpiece. That is, she is tightened, she is trying too hard to be an arena. My favorite level is everyone's least favorite level with the flood. Everything was as it should be, dark, stuffy, scary. In the end, the game generally offers you to have fun yourself. Up to the level with the typewriter - Bibika. 7 out of 10. You also break your fingers because of the control of the bible in the old way. In general, in the following heilos, there is also a problem with transport.. Halo CE kind of kicked off the start of an era, begging and end of games really. The world, the guns, the gameplay, the multiplayer, everything kind of started with this insane game. Its sad to see what the franchise became today, but this was a great game.. I didn't play much of the multiplayer, but the campaign was amazing with an action and horror aspect mixed into it.. I played it with a friends in local co-op. We sent a couple of night on it and it was fun, not too much challenging and refreshing. A good one.. I don't like this game as much as I want to. I keep getting lost and there are to many puzzles that I can't seem to figure out.. A generation defining game and a masterpiece it did everything right, great music, great characters, great story with a great twist, great weapons that felt like they had power behind them, great enemies to fight against, amazing level design and excellent reuse of levels to make them feel different, perfect length and amount of levels for a fps. This game was my number one from 2001 to 2013 until I played Borderlands 2.. The quintessential FPS on the OG Xbox. Even by today standards, it's very well put together. The fact that Halo is still used as an eponym for a whole genre says it all.... The game that started the massive franchise it is today. Halo was such a great game, that I still play it today! My brother and I used to play the campaign and we would often invite friends over with Halo to have LAN parties. I tell ya those were some great times. The gameplay, storyline and multiplayer was so good.. This is the Greatest game in the entire franchise. Can't beat the classics! It MADE Xbox. Halo Combat Evolved is masterpiece and probably one of the best games of the 2000's. There's reviews from all the way back to 2002, and my review is from a ""2022 POV"". Halo has a good story actually, the external parts are well made and the graphics are among the best of its time, for sure. However, the main problems is that this game is a constant corridor, there's simply multiple parts that look exactly the same (I know, probably a limitation of that time), plus the fact that every enemy is a bullet sponge (even on normal difficulty). I realize it's an important game for the industry's history, but it's kinda sufferable to playthrough nowadays because of those two factros.. Pretty damn good, probably a classic but not perfect. A bit rough around the edges.. i mean, this game is one of the few that i would call an ""epic masterpiece"" because it started off the halo series and also was probably the best halo to come out because it is simple unlike halo 5 and has an enjoyable story unlike halo 5 and every weapon in the sandbox has a specific use unlike halo 5. 10/10 halo experience epic masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game that got me into shooters. For the time the enemies and environments were fantastic. The music used in this game is so good it is still used in the recent iterations of the game.. Halo combat evolved is simply incredible it deserves every bit of attention it gets and it started off the greatest quadrilogy in gaming history with the bungie developed Halos with 2 3 and reach it essentially kickstarted the Xbox and whats great about Halo is that one cannot work without the other they're deeply intertwined Xbox cannot be Xbox without Halo Halo cannot be Halo without Xbox the level design whilst reused in some places (only on alien architecture which lets be honest realistically the forerunners and covenant would reuse it) it is astounding and it is one of the most revolutionary games of all time Halo proved that a first person shooter could work on a console and it is also one of the rare cases of satisfying gameplay that has actually good gameplay too FPS games like COD and battlefield and pretty much every single FPS game to come out on console ever since Halo owe allot to it the whole reason why cod was so massive was because of its console user base sure it may have come to console without it but would it have had a revolutionary control scheme that Halo pretty much built by itself I mean who can argue that Halo set a standard for how a fps control scheme should be the classic RT to shoot B to crouch X to reload controller scheme gave ease of access that you couldn't get anywhere else at the time with strange controllers blocking games such as golden eye from being perfect and extremely odd controls for games such as rainbow six on PlayStation Halo is just perfect in every aspect even In legendary which (many Halo games fall down on) is always your fault not overpowered Jackal snipers or brutes who one shot you it's extremely balanced so that when","the library mission is a mental endurance test and a descent into madness . some weapons like the assault rifle and needler are worthless, even on easier difficulties . the story is simple, solid, and entertaining, but it's still the weakest narrative ."
140.Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,"best out of trilogy, 2nd game is not even close ------------------------------. One of the most underrated uncharted games! Was extremely fun from beginning to end, I would go as far as putting it over uncharted 2.. More of the same. The technological leap between this one and the previous entry isn't noticeable, but the small improvements make it even more fun to play, the guns feel more satisfying to use, the puzzles are actually good, and melee combat has been reworked for the better. The game's strongest part is how epic it is, there are multiple sections full of raw action, and amazing cinematic set pieces. When it comes to the story and the characters, I'm actually slightly disappointed. I didn't mind it for the most part, but it's obvious that the story is an afterthought because it feels unfinished, especially later on, there are multiple coincidences and even plot holes regarding some characters. Still a very solid game, it feels like a spectacular blockbuster action movie in a good way. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. With fun characters and cheesier action on the side, Uncharted 3 charts more adventure and a few more combat mechanics, but not much new, story wise, compared to previous entries.. GOOD POINTS -Extremely well-designed level designs. -Nice and warm atmosphere with music. -Great characters. -The tempo of the game is very well done. It's like you're playing a movie. -Great visuals and well-organized. -The voice acting is amazing. -The mechanics are dynamic and very suitable for various tactics. BAD POINTS -The sense of hit in the game is weak. -The action of armored enemies spoils the action a lot. -Towards the end, the game becomes boring with the action of immortal enemies. According to 2024. 9.2/10. Even though it builds upon the previous game in many ways, it's just not quite as good. The level design feels a bit awkward at times. Still an incredible game though.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Uncharted 3 finally sees a much needed upgrade in gameplay from the first 2 games. The gunplay feels so much better and weapons feel like they are actually different from one another. Unfortunately the enemy identification is awful, they all look the same. They all wear rags but can take like 10 bullets to the head. They constantly spawn in behind you too which is awfully annoying. The story is a step down from Uncharted 2, less humour and a much less interesting villain. It's still very good by today's standards but it takes a more serious tone that doesnt suit the game as well. There is also way to much suspension of disbelief required for this game to work. Multiple times both sides have an opportunity to just kill the other and don't, because? We never know. Just PLOT. Nate somehow survives everything in this game and it's just TOO unbelievable. The ending also feels awfully rushed and there is no real boss fight. Just a few QTEs. The main thing I loved was the set peices and sequences. Fighting on a falling plane, escaping a sinking ship, crossing a ship graveyard, fighting in the sandstorms, seeing the beautiful city of the pillars.. I absolutly loved this game and i think its way better than **** needs to be praised more. uncharted 3 subway add :) WHY DO I HAVE TO ENTER AT LEAST 75 CHARAC - oh wait, i have entered 75 charactars, goodbye. Got to admit, Nate is really a lucky bastard. Or maybe he's unlucky? This franchise has its games one better than the other and this one is no different. Packed with insane action cinematics, it takes the previous game and improves the things that were a bit annoying, like the combat. Even though, when shooting the enemies they don't even get fazed in a lot of times, making you get blasted by a rocket while you are still shooting them. The story was decent, more realistic in a way. I got to explore more of the protagonist's past and I still didn't get the relationship he has with Elena, until the end made it clear. There are still some parts in the story where they don't make any sense, but I think it's minimal. Oh, and by passing through all these 3 games, I can see now clearly that Nate is just a ridiculous badass.. And finally, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, a controversial entry in the series, which is the reason why I got into the game with low expectations, unlike in Uncharted 2. Despite that, however, I came out of Uncharted 3 feeling satisfied; it's a very solid game overall, it just happens to have some noticeable problems. As always though, I'm gonna start off with the positives. First of all, I really like some of the story ideas and themes Uncharted 3 has, it feels more personal and ambitious than the stories in the other Uncharted games, including Uncharted 4. The characters are still good in this game, not a fan of the antagonists unfortunately but the main characters are still as good as ever. The puzzles are more interesting than the puzzles in the first 2 games by far, some are slightly annoying but most of them are just better. Also, the set-pieces and visuals are some of the best in the series up to that point. With all that being said, the game is flawed, for example, the writing is a bit messy, some plot points feel unfinished and they don't make a whole lot of sense because of that. While the gameplay is still fun for the most part, the emphasis on melee combat brings down the enjoyment at times because the melee combat is kind of tedious on its own. Lastly, the game just feels very similar to Uncharted 2 in most ways, it doesn't really improve or expand on anything Uncharted 2 did, it's just more of the same. Pros: + Engaging plot + Likable characters + Beautiful set-pieces and visuals + Fun gameplay Cons: - Inconsistent writing - Repetitive gameplay loop - Lack of innovation Narrative: 5/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Content: 8/10 Characters: 7/10 Music: ?/10 Graphics/Audio: ?/10 Final Rating: 7.5/10 - Very Good - Unfortunately, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception feels a bit rushed; it's a great game with some obvious flaws that don't necessarily bring down the entire experience, but it's a step-back from Uncharted 2 for the most part. Do I recommend it?: Yes, but I'd recommend playing Uncharted 2 prior to playing this one.. One of the best Games ever made top 2 uncharted Game (top 1 uncharted 4) Sound track is absulute masterpiece Story 10 times better than uncharted 2 10/10. This Uncharted was the worse and an abomination to the series!! The story & villains were god awful trash and Nathan Drakes character wasn’t the same as Uncharted 2 Drake. If not for Charley Cutter even tho he was barely in the game, this game would be a 0/10 but because of him it’s a 2/10. story’s decent gunplay isn’t very good it’s very repetitive for the most part and quite frustrating. Maybe a bad opinion but this is my favorite uncharted game. I know it's weird since 2 and 4 are generally seen as the best but this game just fixes almost all the issues I have with the first 2 games. Sure maybe the story isn't as good as the first two but it's still good. I like that it focuses a lot more on Nathan Drake as a character instead of some stupid curse or something.. Much better than the first one, not better than the second one .. Gameplay was better than the second game, but setting was meh. Villain was meh, story was fine, most interesting part of the game was the Nate backstory and development of his relationship with Elena and Sully.. Better than the first ""Uncharted"", but not as good as the second. The campaign features some truly outstanding moments. But the shooting mechanics feel ""stiffer"" than in Part 2 and chase sequences repeat too often. On the plus side, online multiplayer was upgraded and received two co-op modes: survival horde and story missions. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.2 out of 10.. There are no words to say, it's a great game series, it's like a movie, everyone should play it, it's a game I never get bored of.. Great sequel. That desert part was kind of wierd? But overall play this if you like videogames.. Overall I'd rate Uncharted 3 below Uncharted 2, but I gotta say Uncharted 3 triumphs at the story department. The chemistry between Drake and Elena was really spot-on, and the villain is really interesting this time around. The plane scene and the cruise scene were bad-ass as hell. And this game had the best Naughty Dog multiplayer experience to date. RIP it was closed down.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Uncharted is a good series, but certainly not as great as the hype would make it out to be. Aside from some nice story beats, and movie like presentation the games don't seem to do endings very well. Uncharted 3 is a nice treasure hunt adventure that explores Sully and Nate's relationship along with Nate's past, but it never really goes to a level that matters. Mix that in with a few story points that don't always feel as connected and a villian that is all bark and no bite makes for a rather weak ending to the triology . A good game that doesn't met expectations of the game before it.. Another great Uncharted game, just as good as the previous, but with the same frustrating controls. Thankfully the same forgiving checkpoint system makes up for the issues with the control scheme.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. That plane scene rings through even till this day, how they where able to achieve that on old gen consoles is remarkable. Everything about this game spells out ""masterpiece"".. Uncharted 3 is one of my top five favorite games, this is my favorite part of the series, I advise you to go through this game and get to know the story of Nathan Drake better, it’s wonderful. most mid uncharted game. like why do we spend 5 chapters in the middle of the game doing some random **** that doesn't even connect to the main story. still an 8. The scope of the game and the stages were really big and exciting. I really liked the soundtrack of the game. The gameplay of the game was acceptable. Also, the narrative and story of the game pulls the audience along with it. This game has really improved a lot compared to the previous two versions.. My favorite game ever but not the best one ever. Pros: -Characters -OST -Cutscenes -The scenarios -Multiplayer -Plot twist Cons: -Villans -Nathan being impossible to kill -Unrealistics plot armors -Game length -Rushed story -Plot holes Even with many cons i think the pros beat them easy.. 3rd best on the series but still very good action game.. very good i liked it but not perfect very good adventure and history. perfect game , game has great game play and interesting story line. Has by far the best set pieces of the PS3 trilogy, the falling plane section being so breath-taking it instantly became Uncharted's icon. Best gunplay and story progression, with some dull parts, the highest highs with the lowest lows of the trilogy, but fortunately for the game, I value the good **** more than the bad ****. Really Great stuff 8.5/10. The game is just awesome really, its the first uncharted game ive played and my favourite from beginning to end. Great story Great characters and solid Gameplay but too much action going on. One of the best adventure games. With one of the best protagonists. Copy and it's worse than Tomb raider. What can I say other than the train scene? This game is not my personal favorite and may be my least favorite in the seriers. However when this is considered your worst game youre doing something right.. It was really a beautiful and amazing game, especially the final moments of the game (from the crash of the cargo plane into the desert) which makes the game even more interesting. Since the plane crash in that desert, Nathan had many nightmares and mirages, and each time these illusions were worse than before, in the city of Ubar, Nathan had nightmares again, and even those nightmares were even more terrifying, and the game was extremely mysterious. and gave the feeling that we are getting ourselves into trouble with an endless puzzle. And all the final moments of the game were really beautiful, stressful and exciting, and in general, Naughty Dog really used his maximum power for the final moments of this game and really created one of the most beautiful final moments among all his games. The story of the game was also extremely beautiful, in the story of this game it was shown that the friendship between Sally and Nathan is much deeper than what we thought, and that they were trying to find Francis Drake again was really interesting. The gameplay of the game was really beautiful, just like all Naughty Dog games, and this is the nature of Naughty Dog, which does not make any game less than a masterpiece, and I really have no words for the gameplay, except to say that the gameplay was ""great"". Although the puzzles in this game were a bit frustrating because there weren't enough clues to solve them, this is quite a minor problem. Naughty Dog should really remake uncharted 1, uncharted 2, and uncharted 3 like the last of us 1, because this game really deserves to be revived and a game this attractive should not be forgotten.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 7/10; Atmosphere: 7/10; Music: 7/10; Summary rating: 7/10. Gameplay - 8 Plot & Characters - 9 Storytelling - 9 Pacing - 9 Music & Sound - 8 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Very much more of the same, but it's another very well designed and polished action adventure with a cinematic plot and quality voice acting. All three are very similar, but that doesn't matter because all three are great.. I love Uncharted but This is the weakest Uncharted. It is far away from Uncharted. - The story is silly. Dull dialogues. And the end of the story was simply childish! - Overused hand-to-hand combat. At first, it is interesting but the game spoils it until it becomes boring and in the end annoying - Uncharted was always about exploring the world and crazy combats. But this one has mostly crazy combats. It becomes frustrating and boring after a certain point. Not so much world exploring and cool puzzles compare to other Uncharted games. - The camera is on a weird angle most of the time - End game battle was stupid and also buggy!. Personally, the 3rd part has los the essence of Uncharted, maybe there is more action than the others. Despite of that it's a great game. Not as good as Thief's End, but a solid action adventure game with a great story and varied missions. Overall rating: 9.2.. the whole game felt like a summer blockbuster, no words to say it's definitely one of my fav games. Not as strong of a narrative as the 2nd one, but the gameplay and performance is improved on all fronts.. Again a great game **** series. Great gameplay, story, presentation, and level design. Very well-made.. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. Personally I think the history from this game is as good as the 2 one but it is an amazing history nonetheless. It was an amazing ending for a trilogy until uncharted 4 came out.. I'm so disappointed. With the evolution we saw in Uncharted 2, I thought the third game would fix some problems and get even better. I was wrong. Some mistakes made my experience with this one kinda painful. It only sustains itself as an ok game because Nathan and the other characters are cool. I will list some points that got my nerves. Too many puzzles. There are some chapters where you find yourself doing boring puzzles for too long. They are not fun and intuitive most of the time. Additionally, these puzzles are connected to the story. Normally, that would be a great way to engage us with the problem at hand. Unfortunately, the story is boring as hell. This brings me to the next major issue. Suspension of disbelief doesn't work because this game rejects logic to benefit itself - almost every damn time. Uncharted 1 and 2 had crazy things going on, but you don't care that much. Here, it's disrespectful to the player. The characters' actions lack logic, and it also reflects in the gameplay. There's one part that exemplifies what I'm talking about. Basically, you have to light up some things to scare the spiders. The thing is: you have to throw the torch at it. If you miss, the fcking torch just respawn at the same locations you got it. Like... it magically appears. Dude, these kinds of things happen throughout the entire game. It's the developers telling you: ""We're too lazy to create something believable, so deal with this **** and try again."" It feels manipulative as hell. Feels manipulative af. And when you're stressed out because this game, especially in higher difficulties, is incredibly hard (since there's no logic and enemies can survive multiple headshots and kill you with one magazine), you start to get pissed off at how linear this experience is. You have to do things their way, and that's it. To make matters worse, they even locked the general sensitivity so you can't turn around fast. Let me guess... the cinematic experience would be harmed by agility, right? oh, fck off. You can only speed up the ADS sens (it is still slow at the highest speed). Obviously, your enemies will hitkill you anyway. Those high scores show how people aren't really concerned about gameplay quality. Just give them a linear path, a mediocre story, and that's it. Another amazing game by Sony. I hope Uncharted 4 will be different, but it probably won't.. Not as good as 2 but the gameplay is just so damn fun. The story isn’t ass intriguing but it does it’s job.. Pure masterclass. Naughtydog at their prime. I can't say which Uncharted I like the most, but they are all stellar 10/10. The hype for Uncharted 3 was MASSIVE during 2011 the wait was over when the game released alongside Sonic Generations, and I give a 9 just because of the hype alone. Outside of that, Uncharted 3 while it is a great game even after all these years, it reminds me of Uncharted 2 in terms of the ending, but nonetheless a at the time masterpiece now turned into a great game looking back at it after all these years.. UNCHARTED 3: Drake's Deception is exactly what I expected from Uncharted originally. Lots of action with an interesting story and backstory. Also, there are some really interesting and challenging puzzles in this game, and the location with the abandoned ships is just breathtaking! 10/10. My personal favorite of the four mainline titles, Uncharted 3 brings the best combat, the best puzzles, and arguably some of the best action sequences. Nathan Drake does not hold back in this intense and heartfelt entry, improving on the previous two games in just about every way.. This game just about breaks even with the second game in quality for me. There are many satisfying set pieces, in fact maybe a couple more than UC2 and the characters still remain charming and endearing. However this is pretty much the same story and basic game as UC2. This is a sequel that simply plays it safe for the most part. The gameplay sees a bunch of minor improvements, the biggest being the much larger array of guns in any given environment, allowing you to switch between a larger arsenal on the fly. But sadly even with these improvements the game feel is off, bullet impact animations have been greatly reduced and sometimes you will find yourself firing at an enemy who receives no hit stun, making some of the guns feel weaker in this game. Also the enemy AI occasionally hiccups in major ways that I never found in my brief experience with UC2. overall though this is roughly the same experience as UC2. Overindulgent boring climbing sequences, cookie cutter macguffin plot riddled with holes, charming characters, exciting set pieces, serviceable gameplay. It's enjoyable but nothing special in my opinion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a 2011 action-adventure third-person shooter platform video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony. + Great Story and Amazing Adventure + Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan Story and Relationship + Fun and Charismatic Characters + Excellent Gameplay (Good Shooting Cover Mechanics, Fun Puzzles, and Fun Platform Sections) + Excellent Graphics and Animations + Amazing Action Sequences + Fun Multiplayer + Great Soundtrack. amazing masterpiec piece of game. Best game this year, and a must own for anyone with a playstation 3. Th story, gameplay, graphics, voice acting, everything is perfect in this game. Even thought the singleplayer felt a little too short, the multiplayer is also them ost fun you'll have this year.. The absolute best uncharted game ever created, I love it, it has a great story the best gameplay in the entire series, great level design, ahead of their time graphics, iconic scenes and the second best boss fight in the series.. Little coop mode was fun! nothing special but if you'll have a chance you should try it.. Attempting at a more grounded story than previous chapters, Drake's Deception gives more depth to its main cast, but the plot itself is poorly written, with weirdly repetitive, unexplained plotpoints and aimless themes. Gameplay-wise, the experience is roughly of the same quality as its predecessor: puzzles are as awful as ever, and even if action set-pieces aren't quite as many as Among Thieves, it makes up for it with slightly deeper hand-to-hand combat and more complex, diversified maps.. Uncharted 3 is a masterpiece. Not as good as 2, but still very fun. Great game, great graphics, and very realistic gameplay. This game is a must.. Great but not as good as the games before. This game compared to others of the same year still stands out as a gem. Even though it’s not as good it still can compete with games generations later. Don’t overlook that.. The Uncharted series is probably my favourite game series of all time and man, I love this game. I, personally like this game more than Uncharted 2 because there are so many different locations and the story is one of the best und most fun I know.. This is in fact the first uncharted game for me. It introduced Naughty Dog to me and I then started a ten years of love for their game. The airplane sequence really shocked me back then. It's something I've never seen before. Unfortunately I think the story is a bit forced toward the end. For instance the chasing sequence later in the game. I still don't understand why Drake suddenly started chasing Talbot. It's well-designed sequence. It just feels like hey we designed a cool sequence, and now let's see when and where we could put it. But overall a good game.. 9 because it's incredible interesting game, like movie, but not 10 because game not have soul, like TLoU or GoW. this game is perfect, it looks like a mix of several games together like tomb Raider (2013) and THE last us. ""Uncharted 3"" is better than the first, but not as good as the second. It has less shootouts and scripted events than its predecessor, but certainly more chase sequences. The game seems to be inspired by ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"" since it focuses on the relationship between Nate and his father figure Sully. Naughty Dog added more multiplayer options to this installment including a horde mode and co-op missions. While the story is great, the gameplay suffers a bit from some repetition. It's not as well paced as the previous title. However, the best segments are truly some of video gaming's finest moments. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.2 out of 10.. It tried to top the second Uncharted but it failed at doing so but it's still a good game. For me this game is the second best in the franchise just behind 4th one, part of the reason is that this game has the most amount of action sequences with balanced amount of combat and parkour.. Alongside Arkham City (released the same year), i think that Uncharted 3 is a masterpiece.. NAUGHTY DOG is taking firm steps towards becoming the best company of today and in the future, this game is just as perfect as other games.. U3 is a very good game for many personal reasons for me. It's my first uncharted game ever which gives me a lot of nostagia so obviously i have a lot of bias for it. It's still not my favorite uncharted but I still think this game is fantastic. Aside, from the plot holes in the story and the weak villains there's still great things as usual like the set pieces, puzzles, and the combat. But the thing I loved the most during U3 is the multiplayer at the time. It's some of the best MP experiences I've ever had in my life and I still think that.. I liked a lot from the game, but came off very frustrated and luck-warm overall. It's very rushed and many narrative beats don't really come-together or make that much sense. Things are hinted at that are never properly resolved. It's not bad, definitely very pretty, and many of the set pieces are actually incredible. Just a shame this wasn't finished correctly.. Naughty Dog continues to impress with its story, characters, graphics, and gameplay.. THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!! Get this game, don't wait! It's one fo the best PS3 exclusives that you don't wanna miss. It's got great graphics, motion and physics. It's like Tomb Raider, but you are a treasure hunter in this game, and you fight thugs in combat and shooting. Multiplayer is awesome as well, better than most Third-Person Shooting games'. A solid 10 for this game!. Story: 7/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Graphics: 8/10 Enjoyability: 7/10 Overall: 7/10. This **** **** is completly trash there are way too much enemies and way to much gunfighting its just not fun expecially chapter 12 to 15 and the last few chapters are just not enjoyable uncharted 2 was waaaayy better than this bull****. I think it combined the best of the previous entries in terms of mechanics and Story as well as exploring the vast Rub' al Khali aka The Empty in search of the Pillars of Iram aka the Atlantis Of The Sands as well fun romp in the vein of Indiana Jones Series and The Mummy series. This game is a low 7. Wow this is disappointing. You can skip this and miss nothing. Nothing of consequence happens that you haven't already seen. The flashback stuff is great. But it's not even an hour of the game. The story is so sloppily written, half assed,and a bit on the nose. I say that because it feels inauthentic to Uncharted 2 as a comparison.. This game is exactly what fans of this serious would expect it to be. There are a bit more puzzles and alternative game play than shooting this time around. It takes a few chapters until you’re shooting. It’s really fun game. My only complaint is a stupidly-hard puzzle. You’ll know when you get there. It’s not intuitive or fun.. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception .. It's a pretty cool movie game, you feels like you are in a Indiana Jones' movie. But that's it, you gonna have a lot of fun sometimes, but you are goin to watch more than play, in each 10 minutes there is a cutscene, you can clock that if you want. This one is problaby the worst of the series. Definitely the game where I put the most hours into in my entire life. The story was good but not as great as uncharted 2. Graphics, voice acting and soundtrack are all outstanding. The gameplay is almost the same but feels slightly fluid, but the gunplay feels a bit stiff. The best part would be the multiplayer aspect. The multiplayer and co-op are LEGENDARY! SOO fun and addicting and I put a good 500 hours into it. Great variety of game modes and maps. This proved that Naughty Dog are capable at making fantastic multiplayer games too. Its sad that the only servers ahave closed and getting a remaster of this multiplayer would be a miracle.. (humms nate s theme while giving this a 10/10) The first 2 two hours of this might be pretty slow but after dumping chloe the game sets a new bar for action cinematic shooting story everything game. Definitely least enjoyable of the first 3 games, yet having the most brilliant level design. Worth playing, yet lack of coherent vision for the game is visible.. This, this one. This, is the thing i want from a game. I mean, there's everything in this game. Everything you or anyone can want. Insane Storyline, Interesting and very fun gameplay mechanics. The only annoying thing is, there is not aim assist in the game. Stupidly annoying. I mean its not that hard to put an aim assist option right? Come on. It is a Playstation game, Sony. Anyways.. Graphics - 8/10 Gameplay Mechanics - 7/10 (sadly, it is a playstation game but there is not even a single aim assist. and its so annoying tbh.) Sound Effects - 7/10 Storyline - 10/10 Characters - 8/10 Music - 9/10 OVERALL - 8/10 Play this game if you have a playstation 3. I'm serious, best playstation 3 game. Even in 2020,2021,2022. It is insane!. One of the best games of its generation and the culmination of a trilogy that you must play if you like adventure.. Pretty good game - nice voiceover in polish version of the game for that bad woman. Nice dessert level. Satisfying shooting. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 10 Music: 7 Story: 9 Total: 8.83. This game is not nearly as well paced as Among Thieves, but still deserves praise for its gameplay and set-pieces. I feel like they tampered a bit too much with the gunplay, and it somehow doesn't feel as fun as the 2nd game, but they did add a few new mechanics like a new hand to hand combat system that is implemented really well, which is a big bonus. The story tries to explore on the relationship of Nathan and Sully, but I feel like it doesn't really focus enough on this idea. It has an amazing flashback sequence towards the beginning that could have very well been made into its own game that I believe would have been an overall better experience. The villains in the Uncharted series have never really been that good, but they are absolutely terrible in this game, and quite frankly don't belong in this game. On the bright side, the addition of the new character Cutter is really great for the short amount of time he's on screen. All in all, this is a great experience that I feel could have been more.. Good cinematically and story, combat was very buggy and shots not often registered. Often would get stuck on corners too. A good game let down by the combat.. Not quite as good as 2, but still an amazing game. Set pieces were incredible. Is anything as hype an as balls to the wall as Uncharted 3? Probably not and that´s a shame. 2021 review, it doesn't age well. it feels a bit generic and super repetitive, when you encounter the big guys that you need to defeat hand to hand for the 5th time you just want to kill yourself. They added nothing new compared to Uncharted 2. Voice acting was good, and some other elements are good too but I give it a 5 because I was expecting more after the 2nd installment in the series. This game is highly recommended cuz it brings tonz of fascinating less_seen action moments and gunfires which you really don't wanna miss trust me. Great story, great graphs, awesome soundtrack full of thrilling moments and amazing gameplay. The perfect ending for a Ps3 trilogy. Drakes Deception, is one of those games you want to play every once in a while.. Very similar to the previous game. Graphics are beautiful for the time, animations are still high quality. But after a very strong start the story starts loosing focus and the set pieces although good aren't anywhere near number 2. Finally, third times a charm because the final boss is just as garbage as the other 2 games. It may sound harsh and nit picky but in the end it is still a great action adventure game to play. This franchise never seaze to amaze, slightly equal to the previous UN2 but not better, yet smart sequel’s sequel, great missions and locations, better graphics and more insane set-pieces, action packed but doesn’t feel connected might be story flawed but stil","the game's strongest part is how epic it is, there are multiple sections full of raw action . it feels like a spectacular blockbuster action movie in a good way . uncharted 3 charts more adventure and a few more combat mechanics ."
141.Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,"Just like the Remake, this game is gorgeous through and through. My only real complaint is the pacing. The story comes to a grinding halt at times while you slog through tedious mini-games just to move the plot.. This is literally peak modern gaming experience! Absolutely phenomenal game and top-tier English voice acting, especially for Aerith and Cloud.. The best Jrpg of all times is the only games you will enjoy so much is the ultimate 10/10 Square enix surpassed the first one that was the ultimate 10/10 in few words is a masterpiece of all Times Fantastic Gprahics and gameplay. One of my newest favorite newer gen games of all time! Most games usually miss out on one element to make a masterpiece of a video game but this encapsulates narrative, gameplay, graphics, and especially the music all so masterfully well. Originally played this on PS5, but with mods and better frame rate and resolution, this is one of the best games ever.. The sheer scale and brilliance of execution deserves a 10 in my book. Rebirth cleverly builds on the combat system introduced in FFVII Remake and Intergrade and delivers seven playable characters with unique and interesting play styles (not even counting Zack and Sephiroth). The mini-games are a joy, I liked playing Queen’s Blood as much as the main game. Costa del Sol filled me with nostalgia for those golden years of video games where it seemed like every game was set on a tropical beach. My hope for the final game in the trilogy is that it will address some of the game’s shortfalls, namely the movement mechanics. At times, the auto-jumping and chocobo mechanics were frustrating, feeling lumpy. However the freedom of movement exceeded FFVII Remake by far. I also hope for more customisation options, by now we are getting a bit used to seeing Cloud, Barret, Tifa and Aerith in the same outfits. It would be nice to visually see equipped items, other than weapons and materials. I still rate 10 for the brilliance on display, fully exceeding my expectations and outdoing the first Remake game which was already very enjoyable.. I would definitely rate this game highly. Massive open world with lots to explore, stellar soundtrack, a battle system that uses ATB and mixes it with action which is innovative and should be used as a model for FF battle systems going forward. Character stories are incredible with brilliant voice acting. Pretty much all of the events in Rebirth play out the same as they did in disc 1 and it also expands on the story with more. Overall, it should have won GOTY. I can’t wait for Part 3!. another a troll attack by lifeless people and an attempt to drop the user rating for the best game of the year.. Every character has their moment to shine. Excellent fighting system. Voice actors really sell every scene. The remake titles are shaping up to be one of the best in history. It’s clear some of the reviewers are just being harsh for fun. There is no way you can complete a game that gets a 0. Games that get 0 are games you can hardly play IMO and have 0 motivation to finish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yet another poor cashgrab entry for the Final Fantasy series, an ongoing experiment in exactly how bad of an experience you can make and still sell copies by Square Enix. FF7 rebirth somehow manages to take an even bigger step back from FF7 remake by adding in even more time wasters and gutting the story. Character VA sound like its their first time and have no guidance. Square has removed any actual decent gameplay and has replaced it all with minigames and unnecessary grinding. On top of that this game seems to be infected with the woke mind virus with the changes to Aerith's identity, completely dumpstering her in an attempted to pander. The OST sound likes something you would find on the epic asset store and game is frequently buggy and crashes. All changes made to the combat system were for the worse. I would say I can't believe they chopped 1 game up into three separate $70 purchases (plus DLC), but its Square Enix so I am not surprised. Please just go back to the old formula that people actually ENJOY. Companies are forgetting games are about having fun and not having ideology shoved down your throat while being forced to grind.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ok Metacritic. we're seeing an attack on this game again. How many already? Pls delete trolls. So many fake review!. Ps5 PRO version is on another level, stunning sharp visual details and performance, can't believe howmuch this game improve from ps5 standard, anyway the game is really really big, tons of things to do, side quest are still fillers but far better than 1st chapter, activities in open world tend to be little repetitive, but things aside the game is flawless, combat is at peak, fun, fast I won't go deep into the lore or the changes from the original, as a fan from long time ago I can say the made an incredible work, it's a must play. Mini games are really fun but there's too many, really too much, I reached 150 hours in chapter 12 as a completist, than I left some mini games beside. It's beautiful but a little less would have been better MUST PLAY. Absolutely fantastic game. The original story comes to life even better and fun than the last time with multiple minigames, cool bosses, fun combat and new additions to the story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just because a game is professionally-made doesn't mean that it's a good game. The Final Fantasy VII Remake series has consistently proven that with its modern spin on the original game that nobody wanted. Actually, I can't even say that because look at the reviews! Look at yet another GOTY nomination that it didn't deserve and didn't win! While Rebirth was better than the first third that preceded it, the game is still ""follow the yellow paint"" levels of dumbing down the game. Back again are the unnecessary minigames and strange story altercations that didn't make sense in the original game, and are still just as baffling now. But hey, Tifa and Aerith's bikini models are finally HD! Tifa and Cloud are kissing now! So worth the altercations of the original, am I right guys?. Its hard to compare all of the final fantasy games since they are so different. But this is probably my safe #1, and also my top 4 RPG games of all time. Since its so hard to compare. Well done Square Enix!. Beautiful graphics and music. Great animations and gameplay. Open-ended interesting level design. Nice voice-over. Awful addition of meta-commentary that doesn't make any sense. Every single addition involving the ghost-like Whispers only makes the story worse.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This review is for the PS5 Pro version of the game. FF7 Rebirth is an extraordinary game that isn't for everyone. But once you open yourself up for it, you are in for a very special experience. It's one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made. The Story is a mostly faithful retelling of the 1997 original that still holds up today. The voice actors are great and the characters are mostly interesting or at least entertaining. Entertainment is the core element of this game. No matter what mini game you play, what enemy you fight or what region you explore. SE has aimed to keep you hooked at all times, and they mostly succeeded. The combat system is probably the best ever made for a RPG and the Minigames are, except for a few exceptions, never to frustratingly difficult. Exploration is unbelievably repetitive, but incredibly addictive at the same time. You always want to find one mor treasure, beat one more enemy or overcome one more combat trial. The music is breathtaking and the graphics are overall beautiful. This brings me to the downside of the game. Although the character models and the art direction are amazing, the visual look of the game is very inconsistent. Even on the PS5 Pro. The image quality compared to the base PS5 is much better, but the pop in of textures and foliage can be very distracting. To a point where it can really take you out of the inmersion. Some side quests are ridiculously flawed and some mechanics feel very outdated. Over all the game is fantastic but sometimes a bit overambitious. Fans of the original will love Rebirth, no doubt about it. If you are a newcomer it might take a while to get into it, but it is definitely worth it.. FF7 Rebirth did everything right as a sequel. The story continues in an exciting way, the characters grow even more fond of me and (typical final fantasy) bizarre scenes appear again and again that keep me entertained throughout. I also really like the look of the open world. The only point of criticism is the many, sometimes repetitive, collecting activities. In my opinion they were completely unnecessary.. It pains me to say this, but Final Fantasy VII Rebirth left me thoroughly disappointed. What could have been an exciting continuation of the first part instead feels like an unnecessary expansion—similar to when they stretched The Hobbit into three movies. It’s just too much of too little. To be fair, there are some bright spots. The combat system is genuinely fun, and the Queen’s Blood card game adds a cool twist. But unfortunately, the rest of the game falls flat. The story is paper-thin. If you boiled it down, there’s maybe 10 minutes of actual worthwhile content. The level design feels dated. And the side quests—don’t get me started. They’re repetitive and boring, more of a slog than a joy. Then there are the mini-games. They were quirky and fun back in the 90s, but here, they just feel frustrating and dated. What might’ve been charming decades ago now just feels like a forced distraction. I liked the first part because of nostalgia, but that’s exactly what this sequel relies on—and it’s not enough. At its core, Rebirth feels like a bloated, uninspired attempt to stretch out a story without adding any additional depth to justify it.. A great expansion. I had fun throughout the whole game and even fell more in love with the characters… but I am a little bit disappointed by the open world. Many side quests were really unnecessary and often repetitive. This game has lots of little issues, including not a small number of technical issues (especially on base ps5)--and yet I still think it deserves a perfect score overall, despite its many imperfections. It truly is a breathtaking experience; it is has an incredibly well written narrative that is told in an engaging manner; it has excellent pacing overall; an interesting world to explore; and a super fun combat system that is at once deep and easy to get into. The characters, from mannerisms to voice acting are superb across the board; also, this game has a lot of great, fun sidequests (better than remake in that regard)-- a common complaint lobbed against the game is the multitude of mini-games, and there are a lot. But honestly, alot of them are skippable (I skipped the protorelic quests, and basically all of the queens blood quests) and alot of the mini games are quite well designed (not all)--but overall, i dont think this detracts from the game. I don't love mini games in general, and i still loved and played a lot in this game because of how they were integrated into the story and sidequests; it made them much more engaging. Overall, it's an unfortunately technically flawed masterpiece of an RPG with a huge amount of carefully created content. I cant give it anything less than 10/10, and I didn't play the original in the 90s, so this is a nostalgia free score.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Lot better than the first part. With great humor and warm character moments. Needed to get used to the changes to Crisis Core plot but it's well done.. This game is incredible. Definitely GOTY of 2024 for me Please don't miss this masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Far too many mini-games that you have to play to get any further in the story and also to get some of the best items. The collection tasks in the open world are also more than just unnecessary. Apparently ubisoft was taken as a model here. The combat system and the story in and of themselves are well done. Propably the best game I have ever played and I even played Elden Ring for hundreds of hours. This is for now in my opinion the absolute pinnacle of what a real time action JRPG can achieve. The game looks incredible even on performance mode and it beautiful design all around. The combat is incredible, the animations are world class and the attention to detail is beyond anything the series ever had before. It might not be exactly the game that every single person would give a ten but for me it certainly is. Square Enix might be my favourite developer and I can say with almost certainty that this is their finest work so far. This game is truly without a single doubt one of the greatest RPGs ever made!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great second part after the first named Intergrade. Cant wait to play the PC port of this game.. I believe this was a bit better than remake. More story depth. Pumped for the final.. This is it, best game of 2024 It has everything, minigames, THRILLING story, so many mechanics and sooooooo on, this is a mustplay.. A complete bloated bore ****. There's a reason the original worked so well in one game, and that's because it didn't need it's story padding out with tons of filler, like they have here. Think of it like The Shawshank Redemption adding several extra hours worth of scenes of talking between Andy and his ****'s just pointless fluff. As is the open world too, man, if ever a game didn't need that it's this one. All the dramatic moments just lose their impact because the game feels such a slog. I'm gobsmacked this trash has scored so highly.. This game is amazing and one of the must-haves for ps5. The narrative is perfect and its combat system is one of the best ever made.. Squaresoft more worried of making you waste time logued in the game then actually having fun. Full of obnoxious mini games that arent fun at all.. This is a great game, ruined by dozens of hours of content that serve one purpose only: to make the game last longer. It's so bloated that many people (like me) won't be able to enjoy the few good parts the game has to offer. The sad thing is that the good parts are actually really good. But they're not prevalent enough to make the whole experience worthwhile. Unfortunately, I can say with confidence that I regret playing FF7 Rebirth because of these issues. So, let's start with the good: 1) The original story: this is, by far, the best part of this game. When it sticks to the original FF7, it's amazing, and can bring tears to the eyes of a long time fan like me. 2) The combat: it can be fun, but it's worse than FF7 Remake. As with everything in this game, the combat is bloated, excessively complex and the enemies are sponges that take too long to beat, all the while the windows of punishment are extremely narrow (i.e.: enemies stay staggered for a few seconds only). Now, let's talk about the worse parts of this game: 1) Side quests: I feel like SquareEnix simply does not know how to design side quests. Almost all the side content is shallow, tedious and unnecessary. It's really bad. They did try to create meaningful side quests and characters. But after playing games such as The Witcher 3 and Baldur's Gate 3, it's clear that SquareEnix needs to evolve a lot in this regard. If you hated FF16 side quests, then you'll hate FF7 Rebirth — and vice-versa. It's a SquareEnix issue, unfortunately. 2) Mini games: there are tons of mini-games. Tons. While some are fun, most are shallow, tedious and unnecessary. The problem is that some of them are mandatory — and they are the worst ones. You will remember this when a certain ""throw the box"" puzzle halts your progress. 3) Controls and navigation are clunky and unpleasant. Often times I felt like I was unable to properly control my characters, in and out of battle. 4) The open world: SquareEnix adopted the dated, obsolete Ubisoft open world model. There are towers, there are icons with side activity (that are really bad, as I mentioned before). Don't get me wrong, this model can work, and Ghost of Tsushima is proof of it. But this is nothing like it. This is a bland, empty open world with tedious side content. So, to sum it up, FF7 Rebirth is a bloated, unnecessarily long and tedious game, that will leave you angry because there is actually an amazing main story, that is thwarted by the absurd amount of shallow and utterly bad side content. If you want to enjoy the game, skip almost all side content and you'll be almost fine. But do not pay full price for this game. It's not worth it.. Massive open world. 130 hours of gameplay, and you never get bored. There's always a new mechanic, a minigame keeping you engaged. I just didn't understand some narrative decisions, Nomura's influence irritates me a bit.. It should have been the 2024 GOTY. The game is incredibly rich in content (a MASSIVE open world), technically impressive (no bug during my 100 hours of gameplay), the reunion of a mythical story, and more. The only bad point is the presence of too many mini-games and the fact that the player is constantly evaluated (score assigned) which can be frustrating.. Long time fan of FF7 and love that they're remaking this great game! Story and graphics are amazing and unique. The only thing I hated about this game is all of the stupid mini games. Next game please keep these optional and not as a part of the main story line (ie Queens Blood). I didn't buy this to play mini games but to experience the epic story that is FF7.. Loved the game. There is so much to do, but sometimes a little to much. Still one of the best games this year. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing soundtracks. Amazing graphics. Amazing gameplay. Fun mini games ( a LOT of minigames ). I love all the characters. I love seeing their relationships grow. And love seeing their character development. I always wanted to play this game, since I was a teen. But the graphics ( original game ) were too old. I'm glad I'm able to experience this beautiful game.. Amazing game! I’ve never felt such anticipation before for a game, and it definitely lived up to the hype!. Easily one of the best games I've ever played. The difference compared to 7 rebmake is mind blowing. I can only imagine what the 3rd installment would be like. Where do I start, the open world is expansive and filled with lots of fun things to do, surprises at every corner. It's one of these games where if you do the side quests you'll be rewarded with more than just loot. I loved every bit of it, I did not expect tot like this game this much. The writing is great, the characters feel real with different motives and influences. I've read some reviews complaining about the mini-games. This game is built on mini-games, that's what makes it ever changing. There is silliness in some parts, but it's intentional and it's funny. Going through this game feels like playing multiple games all at once. If that's not appealing to you, maybe this game isn't for you. Take Queen's Blood board game as an example. You can totally ignore it, but if you don't there are plenty of surprises and twists. It's progression is a story by itself. If you can keep an open mind with all the side quests and mini-games, it'll definitely grow on you. Make sure to play the first one first (FF7 Remake) since this is a continuation on that story.. Part of the grand saga of an all-time classic. Top-notch music and cutscenes, fun and in-depth combat, great and memorable characters, interesting side-line quests, and a beautiful and faithful reproduction of the FF7 world. Minus points to the confusing twists and some cheesy story beats which hurt the narrative, as well as some controversial old-fashioned gameplay designs. Still, easily one of if not the best modern JRPGs and the best FF since FFX, and the game itself speaks of all the dedications and love the developers have put into it.. This game is the whole package, great for veterans of the franchise and great for new players.. Loved it. If you're a returning Final Fantasy 7 player, don't forget to bring some courage. There is a lot of joy and fear that comes with playing Remake and Rebirth as Square Enix promised during the official teaser. Can't wait to see how it all plays out in the final installment.. ""Trash Content - The Game"" is still a badly written re-imaging of a cult classic, where all women are waifus and all changes to the story are plain bad. Clearly directed by the Kingdom Hearts writer, it's pretty awful and does the original story no justice. But that's not why I hate it. I hate it because it's full of crap mini-games, crap exploration, and a billion arena fights that plain ****. So much to do - none of it worth your time. Watch the cutscenes on youtube, avoid this trash.. Phenomenal story, art, score, and character writing. The introduction of long beloved characters is not dampened by expectation here. Twists and narrative decision making naturally draw the story out, allowing character relationships, story beats, andprogression to happen at a pleasant pace. At times, the linearity found in remake was more appreciable by my appetite, and some well hidden map markers, and lengthy or unfun map markers containing small to-dos would feel abundant and you might have just completed one area's map, and are greeted with another list of chores after only a brief story intermission. This is notmuchof a problem for those who skip side content or do not care to complete the map but leveling may be a consequence here asIwas always at or one above recommended level, while completing all side quests and map markers. All in all the strengths of the writing are mirrored by the strong gameplay. This iteration of action complimented by ATB, and a full cast of controllable party members and upgrade loop is my personal favorite modern FF combat system. Were it here to stay, we would have achieved the perfect blend of ability interaction and direct, sharp gameplay (perfect blocking feels awesome here). Even as an old school FF fan, who's first game was VI, I believe this is the single best system to integrate into the next numbered main series release, to blend accessibility and engagement from seasoned fans. Great game, worth every hour. Excited to see how square concludes this extended release trilogy.. Hmm childhood game, doesn't able to play it when im was a child, because parents wont buy a PS for me, grateful im able to play now.. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is by far my favorite game of this generation. The gameplay and combat perfectly blend with the story to create an experience that is unparalleled. It is truly a masterpiece and a worthy remake of the original.. I rated this 10/10 and voted it for GOTY, and I was loving everything about it. Until, I got to the Cait Sith level escape something, and that was damn frustrating. This game is 0/10 to me now that I'm mad, but maybe I'll change it to 1 in the future. Loved this game, but that one level made me despise it and Cait, which used to be super cute.. For me one of the best games ever. Characters are on point, are well written and have more depth, the story has all the core elements of the original and still remains exciting for people who played the old game. The optional side quests and minigames don't match the quality of the main story, but they are a nice bonus for people who want to spend a longer time with the game. In addition, there is a lot on offer musically and the presentation (especially on PS5 Pro) is at a very high level for JRPG and has many small details that you sometimes don't notice in the first playthrough. For me Goty. Rare meaningful update since launch and delibratly using ancient antialiasing on ps5 base model, forcing players to use the ""quality mode"" with 30fps only and no motion blur, no remedy whatsoever. Yet talking about the ""amazing story telling"", near zero stage where the plot unfolds smoothly and naturally without interruptions by those stupid minigames. Another perfect fit of JRPG stereotypes. GOTY? No thanks.. A nearly perfect and incredibly generous chapter in the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga. Having played through the original Final Fantasy VII at least around a hundred times, this latest entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has something for everyone. For those who are fond of the original, there are tons of Easter Eggs and more than enough nods to the original to keep you feeling right at home. For fans of the newer storylines, myself included,I was absolutely blown away by the depth and variety of new story branches to fallow. Graphics wise, Final Fantasy VII Remake is the platinum standard for graphics. No game I've ever played even comes close to the pure graphical fidelity seen in this game. Gameplay is fun and varied. There are many different ways to approach how you fight your battles. You can change your settings to make battles more active or passive. And there are plenty of difficulty setting to make sure you are playing at a pace that is right for you. If you are looking for a fun and diverse dive into the Final Fantasy VII universe this is an easy recommendation with an abundance of content to offer.. Solid game with great visuals on Pro. Mini games ruined the story pace because they are filling lenght of game with stupid stuff. Light work was great, combat ok, Cloud is boring.. I really loved this game, it was a joy to play it from beginning to end, i've put almost 400hours into it, definetely my favorite game from this generation, truly a remarkable game. The creators stated that the theme of the game was bonds, given how important and well the relationships of the characters is done, i'm pretty sure they achieved their goal masterfully, the bonds between the characters are developed even within the combat when we use synergy abilites and synergy skills, they've truly done an impeccable job. I'd like to address some of the criticism regarding some people saying the game is bloated, so in defense of the game i'd say that, the problem with the game design is not the game offering too much stuff, it might be the game inviting the player to do all that stuff, but the actual content is mainly optional, and there's nothing missable in the game, so you can just focus on the main story and do the optional stuff later, besides that some of the mandatory minigames were also mandatory on the original game, so it doesn't make sense to criticize that. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a phenomenal game, the best of the gen until now, truly a masterpiece.. I've thought about this a lot, and I've also played most of the major releases this year, and I'm sure that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the best game to come out this year, a truly fantastic game and one of Square Enix's best. The game has fantastic graphics, although it has visual problems that need to be improved, such as pop-ins, low-resolution textures, textures that don't load and strange lightning in some places, but despite all this the game is still beautiful, the performance mode also makes the game too blurry, so they need to improve on that for part 3, the combat animations are incredible, one of the best combat animations ever with some fantastic attacks such as the synergy skills and limit breaks. The combat system is one of greatest ever, perfectly combining action and turn-based elements, so the player has to combine both when facing some of the toughest enemies in the game, there's plenty of variety on the combat too, with each character having their own unique set of skills, allowing the player to choose how they want to play based on the characters they like best and the strategies that best suit their play style. The exploration is much better than the ones in previous Square Enix titles, with vast areas with lots to do, although they could improve some of the side stuff for the next game, perhaps by adding more variety of activities that are interesting, or by better balancing the side stuff and the number of side quests, the level design is pretty great too. The side quests are also a strong point of the game, they're much better than those in Remake and reward the player with character moments and character development. The mini-games are mostly great, some of the mini-games could be full games, like Queen's Blood and Chocobo Racing, but some minigames are poorly executed and needed better controls, like the Cait Sith box minigame and Gears and Gambits, but overall most of the minigames are pretty good. The narrative and characters are simply fantastic, I really liked the direction they took with the story, and the characters are the best in the history of video games, they managed to improve on the characters from the original game, even though they were already phenomenal, which is a great achievement and they should be very proud of that, even random npc characters like Cry Baby Ned are super charismatic, it's crazy. The music is on another level, the only game where the music also tells a story, it's simply beautiful and one of the best soundtracks ever. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a true masterpiece, probably the best game of this generation so far, even if the game doesn't win any major awards at the awards events this year, I have no doubt that it's the best of 2024 when we look at all aspects of the game objectively, given its complexity, level of quality, and sheer volume of content, when some people's main complaint about your game is that it offers too much, maybe you should know that you've done an incredible job.. Bad combat system. Minigames. Bad ending. Decente overall story. Good character. There's a problem... It's a ""rebirth"" so story and character was already there.. As someone who hasn't revisited the original Final Fantasy VII in over two decades, I found certain aspects of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth challenging The abundance of mini-games felt overwhelming and, at times, detracted from the main experience. Puzzles, in particular, were frustrating and disrupted the game's **** a positive note, the combat system is impressive. While it may not reach the heights of Stellar Blade, it offers a smooth and engaging experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.However, the narrative lacks focus, making it difficult to stay invested in the storyline A more streamlined plot would have enhanced the overall **** summary, while Final Fantasy VII Rebirth excels in combat mechanics, the overemphasis on mini-games and puzzles, coupled with a less focused story, hindered my engagement with the game.. Having both played the original ffvii and enjoying the first in this trilogy (Remake) I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately the pacing and gravitas of the plot are hindered to the point of sabotage by almost constant pointless mini games that act as gatekeping timesinks. Even if you ignore all the optional ones (of which there are an abundance) the game forces you to play tedious, annoying mini games which seem so out of place with the rest of the game yet are essential for the next breadcrumb of storyline. If you have not yet played Rebirth my advice is to avoid any optional mini games until after completion - you are going to have more than enough mandatory ones to grind through!. Perfect characters and performance effects, perfect open world, perfect story, I leisurely spent a long time in the game. Although a very small part of the gameplay makes me angry, it cannot hint at my emotions because this is the best game of the year. Other games simply cannot compare in quality to it.. The combat system is really annoying and not fair. It’s frustrating. You will be hit despite dodging and you hav","just like the Remake, this game is gorgeous through and through . the story comes to a grinding halt at times while you slog through tedious mini-games just to move the plot . this is a masterpiece of all Times Fantastic Gprahics and gameplay ."
142.Rock Band,"Really good game a household classic but there isn'ta lot of good dlc for the game.. Genuinely had an absolute blast with this game. playing with my brother, aiming for high scores, and being introduced to a lot of classic and contemporary rock as a teenager... this game had a lot going for it and deserved its reputation at the time.. What a fun game this truly holds tight a family reunion and shows endless hours of full entertainment . Guitar Hero did it first and was original, meanwhile this broke my expectations . It gives a personality on what instrument you want to use and actually more variety because (obviously) there are more instrument just like the guitar,drums and vocal totally a kick ass.. this game is best as a party game if you have some friends to play with it can be a blast . playing by your self is pretty dull and not as good as guitar hero 3 . the song list also isnt as good . the rock band guitar also **** ass compared to the guitar hero one . but being able to play drums , sing and play bass give this game more dimension then guitar hero . the graphics also **** and look like the belong on the PS2 but this kind of game isnt made by the graphics . its a good entry by harmonix who did much better with rock band 2 which if you havent played any of them skip this one and get that and only get this if you wana pay $5 for a license on the xbox store to get all the songs off the first one on to the second. also a much better selection of DLC songs got to be enar or over a 1000 songs by now .",guitar hero 3 is a household classic but there isn't a lot of good dlc for the game . the song list isn't as good as guitar hero 3 and isn't as good as rock band 2 .
143.Super Mario Bros. Wonder,"Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a fantastic game with amazing creativity shining everywhere you go. The game is extremely fun to play with unique new enemies, and game mechanics. My only downside is that the game is a bit on the easy side, but it is fantastic.. THE GOOD: The aesthetics are to die for and I just love how the game looks and feels to play. The new types of levels are innovative and interesting. Must play if you love Mario games for the style. FRUSTRATING NEW MECHANICS The new types of levels are only fun to play once and by my second play-through I wished there were less of them. In the end it feel more like a collection of mini games with some platformers sprinkled in MUCH TOO EASY The platforming in this game is far too easy. The problem is that the 'experimental' levels can be difficult because of its rough mechanics. (e.g you can expect to get stuck on the 'searching' levels which isn't fun at all). You can play as characters who don't take damage, which was probably added to even the difficulty for children, but the levels with enemies are already too easy as they are. my problem is this: an easy game isn't necessarily bad, because then I'd recommend it to children, but children will get stuck on the 'experimental' levels. An older brother would probably have to be on hand to help with some of the search levels in particular. BAD FOR COUCH PLAY I used to play the NewSup games with my brothers, but you can't do that with this game. The screen always follows P1, which always frustrates other players who die by not keeping up. Also, the new types of levels and wonder parts are just impossible with friends, because the mechanics don't translate and other people are plain confused. CONCLUSION This game is both beautiful and frustrating. There is not enough focus on platforming for a platformer game. If you've played any other Mario games you'll find it much too easy. Easy usually means good for coop or kids, but this game isn't. It's too easy to recommend for adults, and too confusing to recommend for kids or friends. I recommend this game to you if you want to play a work of art, and are open to all the creative elements. If you want a repayable, living room classic, look elsewhere.. Do I have to explain yeah I do? No it's to fun to explain lol. I. Great game, liked the different levels and mechanics. Really liked the different badgets (for the abilities).. The best game in its respective series. This game throws so many fun and interesting ideas at you. It never overuses its ideas and usually leaves you wanting more. This is probably why I've replayed and 100%ed it two or three times already. I highly recommend it to anyone no matter if you like Mario or not.. WIthout a doubt the best 2D Mario since Super Mario World. Innovative and above all, fun, I had a blast while playing it. It's not a game with a whole lot of replayability but the time I had was more than enough for me.. The best 2D Mario since world. Level design is amazing. It might seem like an easy game at first but the 4 star levels, the special world and finding all secret seeds is a good challenge. The wonder seed adds a unique surprise for each level.. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a love-letter to its series. With a charming design, this game touches the hearts of the franchise's most loyal fans.. A new, refreshing take on 2D mario games. The game has great platforming and level design, and is very creative with its wonderseeds. Truly recommend it if you are a fan of 2D platformers.. all in all a very nice game, nice leveldesign, the wondereffects are very innovative and i like the new art style! only the bosses leave a lot to be desired or do not exist at all, except the final boss is really well done!. This game is a masterful blend of nostalgia and innovation, offering a fresh take on the classic 2D Mario formula. The game beautifully captures the essence of classic Mario visuals while introducing a creative touch with new obstacles and vibrant animations. The controls are flawlessly responsive, delivering the hallmark precision that Mario games are known for. Every jump and action feels perfectly tuned, making gameplay engaging and enjoyable throughout the game. One of the standout features is the introduction of a badge system, offering unique abilities that significantly enhance gameplay. This mechanic is well-implemented and adds a layer of strategy and new mechanics. The levels are a perfect mix of variety and challenge. Some are easy and accessible, while others provide a tougher test of skill. The ability to choose levels in an open-world style, similar to Mario Odyssey, adds a sense of freedom and exploration. While the storyline doesn't stray far from the familiar ""save the kingdom from Bowser"" plot, it works well within the Mario universe. Notably, Princess Peach doesn't take center stage this time. There is no multiplayer mode, but the game stands strong as a single-player experience. The soundtrack is a soothing, nostalgic delight that perfectly complements the gameplay. It takes you back to classic Mario tunes while introducing new melodies that fit seamlessly into the Mario world. The game offers strong replay value through time trials and the challenge of uncovering hidden seeds across levels. These features encourage players to revisit levels and strive for 100% completion. The difficulty is well-balanced, providing just the right level of challenge to keep players invested without causing unnecessary frustration. Playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a joyful experience from start to finish. The end credits sequence is particularly original. In a nutshell, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a must-play for Mario fans and newcomers alike. It combines classic gameplay with fresh mechanics, excellent level design, and a delightful soundtrack. The experience it offers is nothing short of wonderful. 10/10. Easily the best 3D Mario game there is, a truly astonishing and fun game to play. I enjoyed every second. A must play!!!. I purchased Super Mario Wonder the day it came out for Switch. I’ll be completely honest, the first few levels in World 1 (Pipe-Rock Plateau) I felt like I was getting into just “another” Mario game. I put it off to the side and forgot about it. It wasn’t until recently I gave it another shot, and boy was I wrong with my first impression of the game. I cannot put it down! The level designs are absolutely breathtaking, along with all the cool animations when you find a Wonder Seed and the boss fights are visually amazing. The mechanics are by far the best I’ve ever played in a Super Mario game. This game has made me appreciate my Nintendo Switch even more, I seriously cannot get enough of it! The online feature is something else I’m very impressed with. I love that you can see other players in the same level as you, and you can also see them wandering around the map between levels. If you die, your character’s ghost has the ability to swim to another player where they can revive you, if you can get to them in time that is. The “Standees” are a really cool feature as well. They are these cool little character signs you can place within levels to show “I was here”. Other players can hit the Standee to activate it. If you happen to die and there are no other players around to revive you, you can swim over to the last Standee you activated, and come back to life right away, that’s if you get to it in time though. Overall, this game should have won game of the year in my opinion! It has everything for everyone, and it’s such a beautiful game to experience. I don’t write many game reviews, but I had to share my thoughts on this one because it’s the most fun I’ve had playing switch in a really long time. Being a Super Mario fan for 35 years, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the most fun I’ve had playing a Mario game since Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World as a kid! If you’re a fan of Super Mario, you won’t be disappointed, that I can definitely vouch for! If you have a Nintendo Switch, this is the game everyone should play at least once.. This game feels like a panting from a wonderful artist from the art gallery. the gameplay is amazing the design of the characters and the background gives me stop motion vibes. and I love it the voices is great the levels is so creative it feels like a 8 year old got the ideas and it's amazing. and it's not Bland or boring and a cash grab like new super Mario bros series. So I gave it 10/10. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a great and much needed addition to the Super Mario Bros. series. With new twists like the wonder flowers, art style and voice acting it provides a fresh new look on the series that is a major improvement. Based upon the past few entries to the series being lacklustre, boring and unoriginal the game may seem like it’s a holy grail game, but there are a few downsides. I found that the difficulty scaling was a bit off as there would be a level where I could breeze through then the next one it could take up to an hour to beat (I do think there is a possibility of some skill issues though). I also found the game to be quite tedious at times but I think having the wonder flowers and badges really didn’t make it that much of an issue. One part I absolutely loved was the Badge system, I found some to be very useful and it added a spin to every level. Although weird I found that one of the most fun parts of the game to be the credits! So I would push through to the end just to play that. Overall, I would say Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a worthwhile game to play especially if your interested in playing a 2D Mario game. It is a shorter game but not in comparison to the rest of the series but still worth the price.. Its a very good game and play it whit friends is super cool. The wonder flowers is a very good idea.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Mario Wonder, the first 2D Mario in a while and the first new entry that had no affiliation with the New series, was very much an unexpected drop for this year. My god. They made a whole **** meal. This game is the epitome of 2D Game Design. It follows the golden rule of game design perfectly. And it did it SEVERAL DOZEN TIMES. THAT ISN'T EASY TO DO IN GENERAL (looking at the Mario Maker community) AND IT ISN'T EASY TO DO MULTIPLE TIMES WITHOUT MESSING UP AT LEAST ONCE, AND THEY DIDN'T MESS UP. Needless to say, this game is so well designed that it should be studied. This is the freshest 2D Mario gameplay ever. It's so full of life and charm, even in the little things, like how the groundpound has a drumroll that plays when in the air and then a crash when you land. There's so much charm to this gameplay, which mind you, plays like World but better, that it is never boring. The amount of content in this game is a lot. 6 main worlds full of levels, a center world with more levels, and the special world with the most challenging levels in the game, it comes out to a lot of levels and content. Thanks to them following the golden rule of 2D Game Design and the Wonder mechanic, each level is unique and fun, and not an ounce of boredom is present. I'm actually flabbergasted and how they did this so well with this scale of content. The multiplayer in this game is easily the best in the series. Players can't directly mess with one another via collision, so the levels can still be played like normal. But you can still throw shells and troll one another, so it still has that chaotic Wii violence. And the online play, oh MY GOD is it brilliant. You can see all bunch of players playing the same level as you in real time, say hi to each other, give each other powerups, and help each other with standees or revival. It's perfect, I love it. The music is fire. I haven't listened through the whole OST, so I don't have too in-depth of an analysis on this, but from the musical levels to just the remixed tracks from even SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE, it's just fire. I originally was upset with the lack of difficulty in the game, but the final final level in this game revealed itself, and it took me 34-ish lives to complete. This was one of the hardest levels in not just 2D Mario, but in all of Mario. While I still wish the difficulty was a bit more built up to that level, I'm okay with the closest thing we've gotten to an official Kaizo level. Overall, this is the best 2D Mario game by a mile, and was my favorite one to 100%. 10/10 D-tier. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a WONDERFUL piece of gaming. Seriously this game is my favourite 2D Mario Game. Each Level is awesome and beautiful designed, there are several new types of enemys, the game feels more alive than ever thanks to the beautiful and elaborate animations, every Level is unique and wonderful flowers provide variety and ""WOW""-moments. The Badges provide for individuality, little Challenges provide for even more variety and the Overworld is better than ever. The marvelous soundtrack lets you immerse yourself in the game. But every game has some flaws. The two biggest flaws in the game are first the Bosses. The Bosses in Super Mario Bros. Wonder are terribly lame and repeat themself, because there is actually just one Boss: Bowser jr and sometimes worlds don`t even have a boss. The second, not so big, flaw is, that sometimes Wonder Effects repeat themself. This happens lucky just a few times but is still a problem. One small thing would be that the game is too easy, but that is rather irrelevant. Overall, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a fantastic game for the Nintendo Switch and without any minor flaws I would probably rate the game a 9,9/10 to 9,95/10, but as the game looks now I would rate it a 9,7/10. Great game, i really liked it. But not the complete 180 the trailers have you believe it is. Its just Mario + some wonder levels that too it’s optional, only if you hit the wonder flower thing can you actually experience the NEW things in this Mario. Special mention to the credits. Thats exactly how credits should be done in games!. An excellent game for new-and-old switch users to have fun with friends and family. Overall a really great game especially playing with my brother i can imagine if i played alone i would've given this game a 4/10 but with my brother this game was generally fun. The new art style wasn't that bad even thought i was skeptical about it. the elephant powerup is so goofy though however the world are really creative and placing it in a new kingdom was a nice idea too instead of rinsing the Mushroom kingdom not only that but the kid like approach and the goofy songs that the enemies sing is unlikeable by the main audience (kids barely play this) and rinsing bowser Jr as a boss so much times was just another downside. I would recommend if you have someone to play with. This game is a huge cash grab peace of garbage I got this game and I was so excited but all I knew it was a cocomelon Mario game it was enough when I saw Mario turn into a elephant and say wowie zozie the only thing wowie zozie was how quick I stopped playing. I was happy that they have improved on the 2D Mario era. It’s been getting a little stale but wonder completely knocks it out of the ball park! GG NINTENDO !!!. I don't get it. It's a novel enough idea for a gameplay loop... but it just really goes nowhere?. This game is peak I love it so much if only people didn't hate it after only 6 months. This is a masterpiece it may be easy but that’s the point your meant to have fun and it’s for basically all ages so they couldn’t make it impossible, every level your guessing what will happen keeping all the levels fresh and unique, the special world is also great because you use old wonder forms but made harder so you have to get good at using all different forms.. Super Mario bros wonder is a masterpiece **** and it change2D Mario forever and I will always keep playing it for many years and I would love DlC for the game and I have a YouTube channel and I love being a Elephant and the difference Type of Enemieso and the levels are so good and the soundtrack is amazing and the bosses aregreat but only Bower Jr 4 boss fights in the game that is definitely disappointing and I think it’s is a wonderful game and it is a must buy and worth it. Mario Wonder is an absolute delight for platformer fans, delivering a top-notch experience across the board. The visuals are stunning, with vibrant, colorful worlds that feel alive and bursting with personality. Each level is beautifully designed, full of creative details that make exploring the game a joy. The soundtrack is equally impressive, setting the perfect tone for each stage and keeping the energy high **** level design is superb, with each stage offering something unique. There’s a great variety in difficulty, which keeps the gameplay challenging without ever feeling overwhelming. Whether you're breezing through a simpler level or tackling a more demanding one, the game always feels engaging and **** final level, in particular, stands out as the highlight of the game. It’s the perfect mix of challenge and excitement, keeping me constantly hyped as I pushed myself to complete it. The thrill of finally beating it was unmatched.Mario Wonder is a true gem and a must-play for anyone who loves platformers. Highly recommended!. I would say this is a great Mario2D Plattformer,Standing alongside with Bros 3 and World.Sure the difficulty is on the easy side. But does a Game need to be hard to be good? I don't think so.. Very good game for people of all ages and skill levels with optional challenges to up the difficulty as well as easier options for less skilled players like the use of yoshi that take no damage making and ejoyable cutomisable and challenging experience. This haas come from someone who 100% the game. It was all such a blast. Highly recommend.. The most creative 2d mario game I've ever experienced everything about it is WONDERFUL. It's a good game! It does enough to be different and not feel exactly like the old games, from the world designs to the art style!. Basically a perfect 2d game. Online multiplayer is flawless and can be used cooperatively or alternatively to race your friends. Local multiplayer is another great option. Very good difficulty balance as well. Collectible items in levels are a reasonable extra challenge and rather than just a time wasting exercise as most game implement these days.. Yeah, real good. The sheer number of wonder effects is reason enough to adore this game. Every level has a new mechanic to check out, and they're all unique and exciting. That, in tandem with precise platforming and an exhilarating soundtrack, makes this a great return to a phenomenal era of Nintendo's 2D dominance.. I have been playing this with my kids and had great fun. The difficulty is a bit steep at times so not suitable for really young kids, but you can literally carry them through difficult parts. The wonder seeds are a really nice addition and good fun. Would recommend, but there are better switch games out there imo. A decent game if you are into 2D platformers. Solid gameplay and does a good job of introducing new mechanics throughout, just a bit simple of an experience for a full-price game.. Nintendo was forced to stop making Mario 2D platformers for a little while, and because of that many people began to think that there wasn't much Nintendo wanted to do with IP. But we were completely wrong because this game is great, it came completely out of nowhere and surprised everyone. It's not rocket science tho, just actually put forth effort and creativity and you'll get a game as good as this. I can’t believe how good this is. I feel like I’m living in a golden 2D era again.. This is an excellent come back for 2D-styled Mario games. The cartoonish style of characters and levels is a pleasure for my eyes, the plot is original and well-represented as the game goes on. The levels are entertaining and some are very difficult...a problem which is present in a lot of Mario games is that they are still a little short. But the fact that they are entertaining and with a lot of things to do erases this. A REAL little problem is that Yoshi is an immortal **** I knew that there was him in the game, I really wanted to use him a lot. In general, the game is a little masterpiece! Nintendo did a great job!. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is an excellent game. With creative ideas and engaging platforming, SMBW reminds us what makes 2D Mario so special. With the exceptions of strangely lackluster boss fights, and a general lack of difficulty, SMBW is truly a landmark title for the Mario franchise.. The perfect 2D platformer. Easily my favorite Mario game and just a wonder to play and behold. Just go play it.. Amazing level design, the creativity for a Mario game is beyond amazing and soo much better then the last entry in the 2d Mario series. This game is perfect when it comes to Mario platformers and is a nice refresher from the NSMB series of games. The final boss is a bit disappointing, but the extra levels after the game easily make up for it and 100 percenting this game is very fun.. I would give it an 8.5, great game but it is short. Also some sections are mind numbingly boring such as the beginning, which makes sense. Great level design. Great Characters. Great Gameplay. Great everything. This masterpiece is a new generation of 2d Mario titles and is one of my favorite games on the console. It’s about 9 hours long and great to play with friends. It absolutely deserves a 10/10 rating.. To be fair, it is much better than any of these new super mario bros. games. But in the end, it is far away from being a good game. It is incredible easy, even to get the 100%. Since it is jump and run, I need to compare it with Rayman legends or Donkey KongTF. But both are on a complete different level. Had not to much fun and I was happy to have competed it so I can finally sell to get my money back.. Very great fun for 4 players both young or old! Also easy or hard levels they're all there.. A much needed take on the 2D mario games, as the previous games (the new super mario bros was getting stale and kind of boring). One word to describe this game would be whimsical. The different worlds and levels are well designed. I like the wonder flowers that add a dynamic to each level as it can create some fun moments or fun minigames. It's a mechanism that doesn't get stale and manages to stay unique over it's 100+ levels. As with almost all mario games, there's great art direction, no bugs/glitches, good music, but this game manages to stand out. One of my favorite games I've played in the past few years.. Super Mario Bros. Wonder has great presentation and overall slick production values - but the formula of picking up the Wonder Flower every stage to see what wacky hijinks would ensue outlasts the fresh ideas they had for it. It's definitely a vast improvement on the New Super Mario Bros. series, but relies too heavily on gimmicks to be an all-time classic.. An enlivening entry into the 2D Mario series, Wonder has much of the creative spirit that made Odyssey so fun to play. It's really good fun, and it's well-suited for handheld play: short and very sweet. Wonder's level design only really falters in the Search Party levels, which stick out as its most tedious and most uninspired stages. Still, this is a standout 2D Mario which is head and shoulders above the ""New Super Mario Bros"" games.. Awsome adventure from beggining to the end, loved everything about IT!!!!!!!!. Definitely the most well made 2D Mario game of all time. Every level is well designed and feels fresh, and the visuals are some of my favorite from any video game I've played. One of the best games on the Switch.. this game is awesome, 90% of it was very fun, and yeah '90%'. i wouldn't really say the bosses are a weak point for the game but they are just lame and for what the game has to offer they really dropped the ball with the bosses. Nintendo has been bad at them for a long time now but it still is sad for everything the game has. and i know that some people might say ""well what about the final boss, it was cool"" and yeah, the the same factor for the other bosses is still intact. it isn't bad its just there are kirby games that have way better final bosses(it is kind of bias though b/c kirby is my favorite nintendo franchise).. It's really for kids, even more so than previous 2D SMB games. For anyone over maybe 12, it's too easy, too cute, too pre-school color palette. Hopefully not the new standard for the 2D Mario line. I gave it a 4 because it's not objectively an awful game for everyone, again, kids may enjoy it.. This is the worst 2D Mario game I have ever played. And the level design is one of the worst in the franchise. 45. A great game to blow your mind in every level you go in with it's wonder effects and just nailed it on my favourite Mario games list. Mario’s new voice sounded awful! The way Mario’s new scream sounded was like Mickey Mouse on helium! Game is way too short! Overrated AF! You all should avoid this game! Unless you really wanted to see Mario sounding like Mickey Mouse on helium! Shrek Super Slam on Xbox is better than this BS!. This is the second coming of Galaxy, I dont know why people didnt talk about this game as much as they should have. Easy game of the year and its one and only flaw is underwhelming boss fights, but keep in mindi never said bad, as the boss fights are still fun and dont hold this back from being a perfect video game. OOOMMMGGG, that's how you make an amazing game! So much replayability and content!. For english below... Ein wunderschönes, top modernes und hochpräzises Jump'n Run mit guter Zugänglichkeit im Schwierigkeitsgrad (auch für ältere Gamer wie mich geeignet), herrlicher Musik, tollen Sounds und sehr vielen grafischen Details. Sehr schnell, stabil und flüssig. In jedem Level jagt eine Innovation die nächste und regt nicht selten zum Lächeln an. Ab und an war ich etwas frustriert, was die Lage der Checkpoints angeht (insbesondere in der letzten Welt), allerdings gehe ich mit Schwierigkeitsgraden heutzutage auch stets hart ins Gericht, da mich Spiele entspannen und weder frustrieren noch zu hart ins Schwitzen bringen sollen. Insgesamt eine ganz **** Empfehlung von mir es zu Spielen. Prädikat 'must have!'. -- A beautiful, top modern and highly precise platform game with good accessibility in the difficulty level (also suitable for older gamers like me), wonderful music, great sounds and lots of graphic details. Very fast, stable and smooth. In each level, one innovation follows the next and often makes you smile. Every now and then I was a little frustrated with the location of the checkpoints (especially in the last world), but I'm always hard on difficulty levels these days, as games should relax me and not frustrate me or make me sweat too much. All in all, a very strong recommendation from me to play it. A 'must have' rating!. The best Mario game. The gameplay has improved a lot compared to the ""new"" series.. Its a good mario bros. The new mechanics are very cool and its fun to play!. I've been playing 2D Mario games since the 80's and although I enjoyed Wonder, for some reason it doesn't feel as magical as most previous installments in the series. I feel like this game tries to be too whimsical. Most of the power-ups are not that fun to use but I enjoyed using the different badges, which add a special ability to your character. I was not really a fan of the wonder seed effects within each level as to me, it distorts the genuine design of the level and just makes things too weird. I enjoyed the various ""mini"" levels which consist of badge challenges, search parties or KO challenges. The game has nine worlds in total and each world has a good amount of levels. As someone who likes game soundtracks, I felt Wonder was lacking, but I enjoyed the song in the first level of the game which is memorable. With regard to difficulty, I found the main game to be a bit on the easy side of things. I was able to play through the entire game without getting a game over and was able to beat all bosses on the first try including the final boss. Because of the game's general easiness, I ended up accumulating 20+ lives and hundreds of unspent purple coins. There are some optional levels which are very difficult and I could not beat. I did not play online at all so I can't say anything about it. The overall gameplay and level design is great and kept me interested and wanting to keep playing and that is all that matters and why I gave the game a favorable score. It's just not anything amazing or revolutionary. Great, fun game, but I think most people will have forgotten about it in a decade from now, but will never forget the true classics like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros. 3.. Yet another platforming masterpiece from Nintendo. This game is an absolute joy and even more fun to play with others. Super Mario Wonder is simply an unmissable game.. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a game that brings back the nostalgia of 2D Mario games while also adding many new elements and surprises to make this in my opinion the best game in the series despite its minor flaws.. bored after 45 minutes of playing it, can be fan for a copuple of minuteswhen playing multiplayer to annoy other players but that also gets boring and repetitive quickly. Really enjoyed my time with this game i beat it in 5 hours so its not too long tho i didnt 100% which i guess you are encouraged to do. The wonders are not always as unique as people hype them up to be though they are fun some just repeat too often imo but they add a much needed change up. Idk pretty standard game but with cutesy twists since its like a different world you have poplins instead, they also added badges which give you abilities i liked most of the jumping ones but most are completely useless in a majority of maps. feels like this game was meant for people who thought the other games got stale last one i played was the wii u game and my god it felt like watching paint dry this one does not so if you feel the same towards the other games go for this one. The best modern Mario 2d platformer. The older ones might be better like super Mario bros 3 or Super Mario world. But this one is just perfect. Every level is always fresh and exciting. It’s so colorful and unique with the new artstyle. The only bad thing about the game is the boss fights. It’s only bowser jr for the main world but the last fight is awesome. Get this game, it’s perfect.. An excellent game without an annoying timer with a bunch of interesting mechanics and most importantly a magic flower that completely changes the levels.. An exciting and fun new take on the classic mario 2d platformer! The wonder seeds in each level is so incredibly fun and the fact that there's a unique one for EVERY level is mind blowing! The new art style is also much appreciated! Very good game!. Nothing groundbreaking, just another mario game. Unfortunately I think this game tries too much to appeal to younger people who have never played a mario game before. It's still a good game, but that's it.. A true return to form for the 2D mario series of games. After the dull and boring times of new super games, we finally got something fresh.. Look, I like Super Mario Wonder and honestly its the first Mario platformer that I've completed all the secret worlds. Well, except for the final badge mission but I just think I've outgrown the Mario platformer genre. I'm glad Mario returned to his roots in the best 2d sidescroller in a long while. But, it's been so long that I've kind of outgrown this type of Mario game. Amazing job spicing up the formula but I do think platformers aren't my thing anymore.. I normally don't like platformers but Mario Wonder is a lot of fun. The only Mario game that could compete with Mario Galaxy as the best Mario game ever.. A Very Creative Game im so freaki","the game is extremely fun to play with unique new enemies, and game mechanics . it's too easy to recommend for adults, and too confusing to recommend for kids or friends . if you've played any other Mario games you'll find it much too easy ."
144.Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Expansion Pass Wave 4 - Future Redeemed,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As someone that's loved the entire xenoblade series and the entire xeno metaseries, this is the absolute peak of the entire series, the music, story, characters and everything else are just top tier and acts as a perfect way to wrap up the Klaus saga and there was not a minute of it i didn't love. Just like the title says, this DLC redeems some issues the base game's story has. It's short and sweet, with returning characters from the previous games, a lot of fan-service and some gameplay improvements Even though I didn't like the grinding for upgrades and materials, I enjoyed playing with the new characters, and the additional story adds a lot of important context, it's a must-play if you enjoyed the base game. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. I gave XC3, main story and game an 8, because even if it is a good game, it has a lot of things missing and I did not get engaged with the story or most of the characters. But Future Redeemed caught my attention from the first minutes. The story is way more interesting and even the small adjustments to affinity and gameplay are awesome. It's what the main game should have been. 10/10 no questions asked. I still haven't played the previous games, with that being said this game is still one of my all-time favorite games I've ever played. Even without the expansion play, I racked up over 300 hours of game play. I never got bored or felt the repetitiveness that some games have that are of this epic portion. The expansion Future Redeemed I think it was? Was also so so good! It gives you a bit of a backstory to the whole story line and answered a lot of my questions. Truly remarkable game, and non-stop fun! Now I must play the first two.... An excellent addition to the world of xenoblade chronicles 3 delving deeper into the backstop of one of the main antagonists, whole also providing more world building for ainios itself and providing excellent closure to the protagonists of the first 2 xenoblad games. One if the best dlcs I have ever played well worth the money. First thing to mention is that I have not played the first two parts of the series and it is a miss that took away some pleasure from the story. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy the characters and part of the story that is told. Moreover, there is a major improvement in an open world and economics system. Now fighting enemies and collecting resources is essential for improvement and this is what I needed in a main game. On the other hand due to the narrative, now the fighting system is not so variable and gets boring closer to the end. The situation gets worse the moment when you have to do all the side quests to level up and move forward. I know that it is a typical part of JRPGs but the main game showed to be better without it.. A monumental achievement, with this entry, Monolith Soft beautifully concluded a 10+ years story arc, delivering the most adctive and polished yet Xenoblade game. Might very well be one of the best DLCs ever made.. This game is peak fiction. Probalby the best dlc i have ever played in my entire life.. Well this game have the best story, soundtrack and also best character, The only downside is the well that it!.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This trilogy has meant so much to me, and to see it wrap up in such a spectacular and over the top way… I couldn’t ask for more.. Monolithsoft are absolute masters of their craft. Where other developers find ways to expand by creating add-ons to their games, they instead strive to create entirely new games and experiences to compliment their newest entry. Xenoblade Chronicles Future Redeemed is no exception to this, giving us a full game experience with new places to explore, a new cast of characters to play as, and an incredible story that both stands on its own and adds more to this amazing saga. It’s amazing to me that despite XC3 already connecting perfectly to the games that came before it, somehow Future Redeemed still perfectly finds a way to connect things to the bigger picture even bringing back our previous protagonists and a few surprise characters I dare not spoil. There’s very little more I can say without spoilers, but if the worst I can say is that I wanted even more, I think it says a lot about how great this entry was!. Cannot waut for what the future holds for this franchise, magnific conclusion to the trilogy!. Might be my favorite entry in the franchise, really polishes and builds up from the previous entries. Incredible, never seem a DLC with this much effort put into it, should be set as an example for the industry. highly recommed, but play the other games before this one. Conclusion to the saga, epic finale!!. Without a doubt a great conclusion to the ongonging arc, wth great gameplay, exploration and story to boot, best DLC ever!. Truly impressive work done by these guys here, I have never seem this much effort put into a DLC, could easily be considered a full game.. Beautifully done, probably the best DLC I ever played, highly recommend it.. Fantastic work by Monolith Soft and Nintendo, very emotional, beautiful send off for the franchise.. Four years after I started the trilogy, my Xenoblade journey has ended with Future Redeemed, providing an overall satisfying and emotional conclusion to the saga. It was great seeing Shulk and Rex again along with the numerous references to the past games, and the changes to the combat help make the DLC feel fresh. It is definitely a little more difficult than the base game with more grinding required, and some elements of the story remained vague and confusing, but ultimately, I took heart in the implication of a happy ending for our characters who have struggled so much. Absolutely an essential DLC for any longtime Xenoblade player.. I cried, I lost many battles, loved the music the world the new characters . Wave 1,2,3 were ok but future redeemed could be a standalone game, but attached with xenoblade 3. Perfect. Fantastic work by Monolith Soft, probably the best DLC ever made, rivals many full releases!. Its Xenoblade, there is no need to say more. Takes everything from Xenoiblade 3 and improves it in a 25h-ish adventure. My only complain is that its too short !. I didn’t care about DLC content in X1 and X2, but this one is different since I like X3 a lot. Even though I like the ending in the main game, it felt incomplete. Now with the introduction of this expansion, X3 has resolved most of unresolved plot points from the previous installments which is pretty satisfying. What an incredible journey!. An amazing way to end up the franchise. 10/10. A great conclusion to Klaus' saga. The story is really short, obviously made for those who have played the complete series (as it should), but I think it leaves too much to the player's interpretation without giving decisive answers. The characters are ok, nothing too particoulary well done, except for the returning characters which are a welcome surprise for every fan. I just felt that the final part of the story was REALLY rushed and could have been done better with just 1 or 2 hours more. At the start, I didn't even realized I was at the final boss. The gameplay is where this DLC tuly shines. The already fun and interesting gameplay of the base game is even better in this expansion, allowing the player to perform various tactics even more easily, without making it too easy. The characters are a joy to play as, I never had so much fun playing a Xenoblade as in this one! The world map is HUGE and connected without any sort of loading which is REALLY impressive, definitely a step forward from the base game. It's also is more memorable and with much mkre activities to do in it. The DLC does, in fact, incentive exploration by giving a lot of bonuses to the active player, which is something 2 and 3 completely missed. The map is also a great gift for those who played 1 and 2. Really nostalgic... I'll miss this series.. Likely the overall best expansion of Xenoblade games overall, with great systems that completely encourage explorations and beating enemies, and a great cap to end the trilogy. New characters are solid and returning are fun to varying degrees. I think if they can refine these systems even more then monolith is going to have something special. I do worry about the items being used to create aether lifts and more as towards end if you focus on main story more i found to be barred by the black stones, i think they should refine that as many will focus on main story and do a handful of exploration locking your progression with items still worries me. For the story i found myself a bit confused, i think they lore dump things a lot all at once a few times but its overall solid. The combat switch up is great and compliments things though i think classes were more fun, and i still think if they are doing mmo enemies should have attack lines/ boxes and more interaction as at times. Its still has some issues with ally AI and other factors. I do think from base game hero quests are very much missed as blue quests in this game feel a bit basic in comparison. Overall an excellent addition worth it if you have played all the games, looks like something that could be strong for future titles.. +Characters don't feel one-dimensional and there's lots of focus on the group and their personal struggles, wich is something that the previous games also had but not to the same extend and I'm glad to see more of it here. +Combat is advanced and complex and gives you seemingly infinite options to set-up your party. It's fun but din't go in this game thinking it's a full on action-JRPG cuz it's not. It's more of a tactical/strategy JRPG except it's not turned based. +Music is peak as usual. +The areas look dope and are fun to explore, tho don't go in this game thinking it's an open-world game like BOTW, cuz it's simply not that and not trying to be that. +The graphics are better than ever. Great artstyle with great graphics (For the Switch, at least) -The areas are very large (especially in the later chapters) but unlike in Xenoblade X, there's no sprint button wich this game could use for sure. -When you're fighting in a small area with lots of enemies at once the game becomes hard to follow visually. Now yes, there is an indicator showing your position relative to the enemy you're targeting but it's still a mess sometimes. I feel like they should give us the option to disable damage and healing numbers since, when you think about it, you don't really need them. Sure it's good to compare the damage output of your party members n' stuff but you can already see all the stats in the character menu so just give us the option to turn of all these damage/healing numbers so that my screen doesn't look so bloated in crowded fights. -The dialoge isn't bad but sometimes it feels like the characters point out pretty obvious things. Mainly early game. -This is not the dev's fault but sometimes I had frame rate drops in ceetain areas. This is just a Switch issue, not a Xenoblade issue.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Future Redeemed is a fantastic expansion to the already excellent Xenoblade Chronicles 3. It tells a compelling story, features some of the best combat and exploration in the series, and introduces a cast of memorable new characters. If you enjoyed Xenoblade Chronicles 3, then you absolutely need to play Future Redeemed. Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed is a fantastic DLC that expands on the story of the base game in a meaningful way. It introduces new characters, new story arcs, and new gameplay mechanics. It's a must-have for fans of the series.. The perfect conclusion to a massive and epic saga, this game rewards you for being a fan of its series. A beautiful merge of the two previous xenoblade games, along with a few teases of the 90’s turn based style Xeno games, hinting at a possible connection between them all. Amazing characters, amazing world, amazing music, Amazing game.. Unlike gamefreak, Monolith Soft keeps delivering impressive and ambitious games, this on in particular being the climax of 13 years of storytelling, amazing game! recommeded.. probably one of the most ambitious DLCs ever made, an incredible feat for Monolith Soft. Great characters, beautiful vistas, a ton of incentive for exploration, fantastic tracks, a story that builds upon the entire franchise and closes the Klaus saga. Very polished gameplay, tons of new QoLs. Looking foward to the future of the franchise!. An impressive achievement by Monolith Soft and beautiful conclusion to a story ark that started back on the original Xenoblade. One of the best teams at Nintendo.. The ultimate love letter to fans of not only Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but of the two previous entries in the series. Further refinement of the combat and the exploration leaves me very hopeful for the future of this IP. Some of the best music, story, voice acting, and worldbuilding I have ever seen.. It's hard for me to feel strongly enough about a DLC to give it anything higher than an 8, so this is high praise. The payoff to other games in the series is satisfying, and the story answers a lot of questions that 3 left me with, while not ruining any of the interesting ambiguity. If this was a full game, it would probably be a 9, but the story is still pretty simple, as it should be for a 20-30 hour game, and the characters, while good, don't compare to the cast of the base game.. This is what paid DLC should be, a new adventure that it’s longer than many $70 games. Great characters, exploration and combat. Music and story as good as other MonolithSoft games. A great way to end Klaus Trilogy and many hints to the future of the franchise. Highly recommended.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Adds so much lore to an already perfect game! Must play if you are a fan of JRPGs!. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was an epic story about unleashing the future from two cycles of life, a repeating world and a repeating life. In contrast to the main story, which focused on a standalone story while showing only a slight influence from the stories of the previous two games, the DLC story is a direct sequel that greatly reflects the influence of the past works and gives a sense of catharsis. The map consists of almost one open world, a compact and magnificent story, elements prepared from corner to corner, and the map design is impressive. perfect JRPG. This is interesting game, a family for all. Impressive story, but not to shabby. This is a perfect game. Just a fantastic game to finish off the trilogy. Highly recommend, although you should play at least Xenoblade 2 first.. Congratulations Takahashi and monolith soft what an amazing way to cap off a decade long saga.. Xenoblade 3: Future Redeemed delivers in a single package everything that made Xenoblade such an outstanding franchise: complex/engaging storytelling, memorable characters, superb OST and a perfect closure to this ""trilogy"". Also, there's a very intriguing specific scene that made Future Redeemed even more impactful when it comes to lore. In my opinion, this is the best expansion ever (all games/platforms considered overall).. Fan of Xenoblade series and this is as fun as the previous titles. Thumbs up. An amazing game, with plenty to explore. If you enjoyed and followed the Xenoblade series this will make you cry with the amount of raw emotion and amazing gameplay. Use the Japanese voices.... the English voice for Matthew was iffy.. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. This prequel is a Torna equivalent that link ALL previous games and that's give us the feeling to ask for it for the main XC3 game but that's ok as is. The trilogy with their 3 prequel/sequel is wonderful. The post credit scene tease us maybe for a bigger picture... Thank you Monolith Software, Thank you Nintendo.. Future Redeemed, similar to Torna the golden country, delivers a new campaign that has the size of many 60-70$ games. Unlike Torna, which artificially pads its playtime by forcing you to do most sidequests before completing the game, future redeemed allows you to experience the story without any roadblocks, while also highly encouraging you to do side content through the new affinity system. Although a prequel to the main game, fr manages to tell a new story that manages to connect all three games, and alludes to the end of the trilogy and what the future holds for the series. Unfortunately, this story also highly requires that you have played all three Xenoblade games, so it is hard to recommend this game without having played all 3 games. However, if you are a fan of the series, this expansion is well worth it.. There is no worse thing than blocking such an important part of the story behind a DLC, I would have preferred a thousand times an extended presentation of this story, compared to the underwhelming game that is the third one. Unfortunately, the game has only minor variations from the gamplay from the base game, it improves it but I still prefer the other three for the reasons already listed in the base game. The game world is fun to explore and no frame drops are present. The music is a perfect mix of the series with the only negative being the horrible menu music, it was as infuriating in the base game as in this one. Matthew, A, Kagiroi, Nikol, Na'el are new characters much more interesting to watch than the cast of 3, not to mention the most powerful engineer in the world and Mr.Triple Strike himself. However,many references are left vague,and it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed"" is Monolith's greatest gift to fans of the Xeno series, and a perfect conclusion to the Xenoblade trilogy.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 showd how monolith is always improving the gameplay feels the best it's ever been weverything you do in the open world feels rewarding apart from the impresive vistas it has. in terms of story it does a great job even tough I was expecting a litle bit more.. The Xenoblade Chronicles series is a true gift from Monolithsoft and Nintendo. This DLC is the culmination and perfection of all that Monolithsoft has been working towards with this phenomenal JRPG series. The soundtrack is fantastic, story is riveting, combat is fast-paced and some of the smoothest in the series, and the graphics are excellent. This is not only an excellent story full of fanservice for those who have played the previous games, but it is also an epic standalone adventure that stands as one of the best Xenoblade games. If you like Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you owe it to yourself to give this expansion a try!. Future Redeemed is a pretty damn good expansion to Xenoblade Chronicles 3. For the most part, it changes up some mechanics from the base game that I think improves the overall gameplay, but leaves out one of my favorite systems. Where the base game locks two characters in the Interlink system, this time, you can mix and match characters for different effects. What I don’t like about this DLC is the lack of the ability to change the Class of each character, which was one of my favorite aspects of the game. Otherwise, it’s a really good expansion; I enjoyed it, and I think you will too. Thumbs up from me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is perfection. A true love letter to all fans of the series with perfect combat, exploration, soundtrack, characters, and more. As the sendoff to a trilogy that began 12 years ago, it does its job perfectly in uniting the stories of these 3 games and concluding it all in a satisfying way. I truly adored this game and its runtime that is just right for a DLC storyline, but honestly the experience was good enough it felt like a full game in and of itself. 10/10 from me.. This dlc was an amazing way for them to end the Klaus saga, and it was arguably one of the best dlcs released for a videogame, right up there with ""Blood and Wine"" from the Witcher 3. The gameplay was perfect, and the story was handled wonderfully, leaving you craving more. Suffice it to say, I cannot wait to see what MonolithSoft will do with Xenoblade in the future.. If you enjoyed XBC1 and 2, this game is such a love letter with so many great details and interactions between the characters.. Cool characters, A is the best and i am very surprised that Rex and Shulk become much more cooler in this game Amazing music Awesome story Definitely 10/10. The best DLC that ever existed. They make the exploration become so rewarding, and by combining that with the God-Tier level environment design, we got this masterpiece ****. Monolith Soft has a track record of releasing DLC that feels like standalone games before but this is just on another level. I don't want to get into too many spoilers but the DLC makes you proud to be a fan of the entire franchise.. Really good! It makes me appreciate the past **** only problem would be is that I wanted more :(. Man I put a lot of hours in this franchise.. Great expansion that fulfilled it's purpose well. The story is unsurprisingly complex and can require some thinking to figure out everything. The new mechanics were fun and generally a good addition. Characters are great considering the length of the DLC. Much of the enjoyment is found through the references to the previous games, so you will be missing out on some understanding if you haven't played them. Metacritic will continue to be awful with review bombings for seemingly no reason and with no comments, but rest assured: this is a very good addition.. Simply amazing ending to the Klaus trilogy, story is short but sweet, gameplay of base game is expanded upon, exploration is more fun and easier to 100%,. Really it’s closer to a 9, but I’m here to counter the reviewbombers down there. This game is actually more fun than the base game, especially if you prefer spending less time in menus and more time exploring and finding stuff.. A great final game of an amazing saga. Great to see Shulk, Rex and other returning characters/locations for a final time. It really makes you excited for the future.. Its the ultimate combination of all xenoblade games (except X) and is so refreshing to see the returning characters and locations, alongside the newcomers. I highly recomend play the others xeno games before, tho. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Once again, Monolith Soft has thrown out one of the best DLCs, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2's Torna DLC. The final chapter in a 13 years long masterclass in how to develop a jrpg by Monolith and Nintendo, a true masterpiece.. It gave the game a great ending as the DLC is rich in content, and map exploration is even more captivating. I hope the next game can maintain this level.. I have improved many defects, and the map design has reached the best of the series, allowing me to enjoy a thirty hour journey, which is a perfect ending.. Really satisfying combat and exploration, but a big let down with its creatively bankrupt story that feeds on XC1 and XC2 legacy and adds basically nothing to the table.. The best DLC I've ever played... In line with the main game, still as well mastered with perfectly integrated functionalities. A fantastic way to cap off three amazing games. Exploration is incredibly rewarding and everything you do makes you stronger. Sad to see the games come to an end, but an amazing way to do it.. Bringing 6 games together wich never seemed to be connected and end it all in a FANTASTIC way. This is the best dlc ever. What else can I say that I liked more than the base game, but for a thousand times more, it really is well done this dlc I want to give it, explore, get everything and still not finish it because finishing it saddens me, but it is fixed that I repeat and will be my favorite even if it is a dlc, I prefer to give me that feeling to Takahashi games gives and does above what gave me the 3 and is the truth.. Extremely good game and battle system. Really interesting story that seems to wrap up the story of all three games in a very good way.. Honestly the only thing i didnt like was its length. They could have gone to one more area but otherwise goddamn this wasnt an amazing experience and makes me so excited for the future of the xeno series as a whole. A heartfelt gift to the Xenoblade fans (especially those who have played Xenoblade 1 and 2) from Takashi. Great story, excellent gameplay, and the perfect add-on to Xenoblade 3. Please enjoy this new adventure with our old friends, the characters we beloved. Every fan of Xenoblade Chronicles should play this DLC. It is not just a DLC.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Future Connected has surpassed all expectations with its impressive additions and improvements. The DLC boasts new and magnificent music, a diverse and engaging cast of characters, and the return of beloved characters from the original game. The newly introduced areas are beautifully crafted, while the revitalized old areas add to the nostalgia factor with impressive redesigns. The new gameplay mechanics are a refreshing addition, and the extensive lifespan of the DLC sets it apart from other studio DLCs that offer mere cosmetic upgrades at exorbitant prices. The story takes place in a different time period from the original game, making it all the more intriguing. Overall, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Future Connected is an exceptional DLC that is sure to captivate and enthrall fans.. Matthew,A, Glimmer,Nikol, Shulk and Rex. Such a dynamic party in the adventure. If you're a fan of Xenoblade series. Likely a 9/10 experience in the dlc cuz it's didn't reli answer much of the mysterious lores in the series. Imo it's a 10/10 bcuz I hope monolithsoft keep development this franchise and it's a better overall experience than Xenoblade3. The ending credit able to beat xeno3 ending is a surprise. Just wish they have a dlc5. This is not a DLC, it's **** Xenoblade 4!!! Amazing combat, exploration and an incredible conclusion to an already superb story.. Awesome DLC, I finished everything in ~30 hours on hard. Do not play this before playing the three games of the trilogy. This is not just a side story.. I am thinking that this expansion might be better than the actual game, it is great!. PEAK nothing else to say such a perfect way to make this saga going i can't say how much this game made me cry. Everything I wanted and more. The gameplay loop is the best in the series. Narratively 3 feels complete now, as does the trilogy as a whole.. Probably the best DLC ever made? Perfect ending for such an amazing trilogy, incredible soundtrack as the other games and seeing all those references to the previous games is just incredible. MonolithSoft is one of the best game development studios on the planet. As a huge fan of the Xenoblade series, I really appreciate how XB3 took the best parts of the series and refined it to the best gameplay in the series. Future Redeemed takes this another step further and refines the excellent XB3 and improves the combat, exploration, and story even more. Best level design in the series. This wave 4 expansion is a 10/10. I cannot wait for MonolithSoft’s next project. And a special shoutout to the incredible OST.. It's feeling like Torna, but as dlc for 30$ and not as dedicated game for 40$. It's so cool and tragic finally. I feels like Tanos from mem where he sadly sit down and look on skies(((. I’m playing this now, and I love it! I enjoyed xenoblade 3, which was my first xenoblade experience. In some ways I’m enjoying this dlc even more. Monolith soft is so talented. I can’t wait to play their next game.. This expension has a few problems. I did not released as a stand alone with an amazing fisical cover, it lasted to little and make my head explode! I honistly think there is no competition in regarsd to DLC. This is the best DLC ever. Perfect! IF it was a solo game it would be one of the best of the console. Also a Great fan Service. Somehow even eclipses the main story in terms of streamlining the already fantastic combat into something that becomes more enjoyable than any other entry in the franchise! The story raised the bar, too, which almost doesn't seem possible when compared to the already fantastic story in the base game. Truly a magnificent expansion to the culmination of the xenoblade series! Would have rated an 11/10 if at all possible!. Fantastic end to the trilogy, and sets up for such an insane future. Music, Exploration, and combat is some of the best in the series. Beautiful environments, great characters, and SO much juicy fan service for series veterans. I was originally reserved about the dlc after being a bit disappointed by xenoblade 3, but this shows that still MonolithSoft's still got it. DO NOT PLAY THIS BEFORE PLAYING 1, 2, AND 3 This was a perfect thematical ending to the trilogy and easily makes XC3 the best installment along in it along with it easily being my favorite game ever. The base game feels 100x more impactful after seeing all of this. It also cleared up the vast majority, and all of the largest, questions I (and others) had after playing the base game.. Oh my lord, THIS is how you finish 13 years of lore building. Gameplay got a bit frustrating sometimes, but if you liked the base game this is a must have. It expands it so much more.. My only negative thing about this game is that I wish it was longer and explained some things more. But what it did do was blow my mind and wrap up the entire saga and set up the franchise for very exciting things in the future. It’s very fun and the quality of life improvements I wish were in the base game. Being able to play as Rex and Shulk and see Colony 9 again was great.. Every Xenoblade fan absolutely needs to play this amazing DLC But wary, you should really have played XC1, XC2 and XC3 before playing this. Takashi and his team crafted this experience knowing they were concluding a multi-game story arc. Future Redeemed does that incredibly well, but at the cost of accessibility. Do not play this if you haven't played AR MINIMUM Xenoblade 1, 2, and 3.. An excellent add-on that not only has more content than some AAA games but also works as an essential epilogue of the trilogy.","this is the absolute peak of the entire xenoblade series and the entire xeno metaseries . just like the title says, this DLC redeems some issues the base game's story has . it's short and sweet, with returning characters from the previous games ."
145.Bloodborne,"atmosphere, art design, gameplay everything is perfect but I didn't like the storytelling style that much but still the best game I've ever played!. It is just such a peak game like many games it is not perfect but it is one of the best games I ever played. Tried something new after the first 2 Dark souls. Unfortunately the atmosphere and story were a bit more weird for me. Still a top tier game. I love Fromsoftware games, but Bloodborne is easily their weakest offering. The boss fights are subpar, the blood vial system is inferior to the flask/gourd system, there's less variety in environments, and there's just not that much content compared to their other games. I'm in awe of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, but this one is a massive miss for me.. We need bloodborne 2 on ps5 60fps. We will Wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Yes, the game is 10 years old, but if you havent played it, do it now. Im playing games since the 80s and i rate Bloodborne in my top 20 All Time List. While other big companies like Blizzard and EA have transformed themselvs into quite s!itty companies, Fromsoft keeps deliverung what the fans want. Bloodborne is a difficult game! But if you are up to the challenge, you will get one of the best fighting game systems ever, a cool setting with interesting subtle environmental story telling, the best weapons in a game ever. Weapons feel so satisfying, its unreal. The boss fights are medium to extremely difficult, but once you are hooked you wont quit since you lay down the ****. The game also has a high replay value and if you are done with the main quest, there is an even more challenging DLC waiting for you. I got BB for 15 Euros and it was quite a steal.. The best **** ever, was amazing, the gothic world is so detailed and the game dinamics are fast and intuitives. The lore is the best, so deep, and so Lovecraft. Love it!. You might wanna bite your nails of dying to the same guy 100 times, but you will come back for more of it!. Can be frustrating, but when you push through, it's so satisfying when you defeat a boss or difficult section.. One of the best games ever has the best story on souls games the bosses and the lore is legend. (Review about main game Bloodborne) Main game bosses are the worst in all the soulsborne games by far. Long run backs. Not having ur heals or ur bullets permanently is a VERY bad feature. This game is not and will never be a masterpiece. + the bosses are pretty easy.. Masterpiece, one of the greatest games ever made. The best music in videogame history, some of the very best boss fights ever, haunting environment, beautiful graphics & setting, fun & exciting combat, ability to heal through aggression, unique weapons with alternative modes, a must play for any PlayStation owners, if you're good enough that is.. Actually one of the best titles of the decade. Masterpiece. Thing that brought me to the console gaming. It’s a fromsoft game of course it’s really good the weapon transformation is really cool and I get to attack brits with no consequences. Great music and gameplay, legendary bosses, very good history. A big and interesting map. My only problem is farming blood vials (healing vials).. A masterpiece by From Software. A incredibly immersive and stunning setting combined with a combat systemt that favours dynamic and aggressive combat as a departure from the more defensive approach required in the Dark Souls series. The lore is just stunning an all the art in the game. A Must Play.. play bloodborne play bloodborne play bloodborne play bloodborne play bloodborne play bloodborne. A fest for your aesthetics, and a life-changing experience. It's a classic.. If you ever decide to play just one game it needs to be Bloodborne. No other game created before or since has really ""gotten"" the medium as perfectly as it has. Gameplay quality is paramount. Story, music, and design all absolutely need to come in a distant second. But it helps that Bloodborne nails those too.. Besides being 30fps this is just so great, and the dlc is even better than the base game. Challenging in the right measure and with a very intriguing story, bloodborne managed to be one of the first souls that caught my attention and curiosity to play and finish, now there are only 6 left.. The best souls game. The story, gameplay, vibe is all immaculate. I will easily look past the meh bosses and repetitive chalice dungeons because I just have such a great time existing in this world. Also, the DLC slaps hard. Best game ever made. Simply fantastic. Clever worldbuilding, rewarding combat and unmatched vibe.. Simply the best game in the ""series"". Graphics, action, atmosphere, setting and difficulty are fine-tuned to perfection in this iteration of the Souls formula.. Bloodborne is a wonderful game that never ceases to amaze me. The vast world of the game is packed with little nooks and crannies waiting with items. The only negative thing I have to say about this game is the 30fps on the PS5, and the annoying chalice dungeons that are required for the platinum.. Easily my favorite souls game, Bloodborne has it all. The trick weapon system is incredible, making each weapon have 2 movesets, the game's world is masterfully crafted, making it rewarding to explore, the soundtrack and bosses are great, especially in the DLC. I'd recommend this to anyone with patience and love for souls games.. 5 and a half hours into this and I've gotten to Central Yharnam, I've died over 80 times and the only good thing about it is the character customisation. I've played dark souls 1 and 2, demon souls and elden ring and honestly, this is utter garbage. I know there'd be keyboard king and console crusaders trying to belittle this review but, I've spent 40 dollars just for a barely playable death simulator. 30 frames locked on ps5, clunky movement and just hype and next to no content. *Bloodborne* is a masterpiece that takes the core mechanics of the Souls games and transforms them into a faster, more aggressive, and deeply horrifying experience. Set in the decaying, gothic city of Yharnam, the game immerses players in a dark, unsettling world filled with intricate details and hidden mysteries. The gothic-Victorian atmosphere is flawlessly executed, with breathtaking art direction that exudes both danger and eerie allure at every turn.Gameplay is one of *Bloodborne*'s defining elements: it forgoes shields and pushes players toward a fast, offensive combat style. The health-regain mechanic encourages an aggressive approach, rewarding players who strike back immediately. The addition of transformable weapons is unique, allowing for versatile combat styles and adding strategic depth. Each boss encounter is intense, featuring iconic designs and movement patterns that demand quick reflexes and thoughtful **** lore of *Bloodborne* is deep and captivating, drawing inspiration from Lovecraftian horror and gradually unfolding through hidden clues and enigmatic NPCs. The sense of isolation and mystery is tangible, creating an engaging narrative experience steeped in **** essence, *Bloodborne* delivers a hauntingly beautiful journey that challenges players while enveloping them in a richly layered and unsettling world.. Not as great as people make it seem, there are much better souls games then this one. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Masterpiece. One of the best soul game ever. Great setting, gameplay, combat system, especially with the unique trick weapon mechanism. The horror in the setting, the soundtrack makes everyone shiver, a true gaming experience. but you will never have 60fps. Arguably the best game produced by from soft. Great combat with a fantastic setting.. One of the best games that I have ever played even 10 years later I still hop back on it and it feels like this game was made miles ahead of its time. The only thing that all bloodborne fans are waiting on is an update to fix the perfomance and frames. No luck for us till this day. I really can’t explain what makes this game so special but it ofcourse has to do with its lore, the sounds, atmosphere and everything else that makes you really feel like you are in a nightmare.. After Platinuming this game and replaying it for 100 times, I can tell this game is a masterpiece!. Best videogame of all time, best atmosphere, best setting, best weapons, nothing has topped it after almost 10 years.. The best gameI have played. Perfection in every sense. The atmosphere and combat and wordlbuilding id perfect. This game is just magnificent. Everything about it is good. From the boss fights to the scenery in the game, the lore, the characters, the UI everything is just perfect. The buildings, the world and the sensation of horror is so well implemented into the game that it made me fall in love with it. The osts are good and the different endings are incredible. The chalice dungeons being a challenge for the bigger fans are of course one of my favourite mechanics of the game. I, obviously, platinumed the game and will continue loving it. Impatiently waiting for the remastered version on PS5 even though the ps4 version is already perfect.. This is actually the best game I played on playstation highly recommended combat is awesome, story is awesome and it has so much content in it.. After playing all of the soulsborne games, Bloodborne definitely stands out, fast combat and aggressive healing make every moment top notch.. of course Sony is bringing out a remaster of Horizon Zero Dawn which is still really nice and even has 4k 60 FPS and is useless anyway because there is Forbidden West but no remake of the best Souls Like Game or at least a remaster with 60 FPS no because so few people like it as can be seen from the horrible user score on metacritic or reviews on PS5 only 4.74 out of 5 with almost 300k reviews no we don't need to remake it under any circumstances. It's hauntingly beautiful. It's still in my dreams. We need a remaster on PC!!! Horror 9/10, Story 9/10, Gameplay 10/10, Atmosphere 10/10.. Great game. Wish it would be longer. The image could improve, but you will like it a lot if you are a souls gamer. It is slightly more difficult than dark souls series.. It is very hard to describe why this game is so good and looked upon fondly by the souls community but if you’re willing dig deep and challenge yourself, you will find a game dripping with atmosphere and challenging and rewarding gaming moments.. Por dios... POR DIOS BLOODBORNE TE JUZGUE MAL, SIEMPRE FUISTE EL MEJOR SOULS INDISCUTIBLEMENTE, GRACIAS POR TODO MIYAZAKI, GUAPO, HERMOSO, TE DEBO UNA CHUPADA DE PIJA A TI Y A TODOS LOS DESARROLLADORES DE ESTA OBRA MAESTRA SIMPLETEMENTE PEAK SI NO FUERA POR QUE THE WITCHER SE ROBO EL PREMIO BLOODBORNE SIN DUDA HUBIERA SIDO EL PRIMER GOTY A FROMSOFTWARE, LO DIGO ENSERIO, GRACIAS POR TODO MIYAZAKI, TE QUIERO MUCHO Y ERES LA POLLA BRO, REVOLUCIONASTE A LA INDUSTRIA CON TUS MAGNIFICAS IDEAS Y JUSTO POR ESO BLOODBORNE ES EL MEJOR JUEGO DE TODA LA PUTA HISTORIA, LLEVO TIEMPO SIN HABER TENIDO UN ORGASMO TAN FUERTE COMO EL QUE ME HIZO SENTIR BLOODBORNE, HAZTE UN FAVOR Y JUEGALO, DA IGUAL SI COMETES TRATA DE PERSONAS CON TAL DE COMPRARTE EL JUEGO, TE ASEGURO QUE ES UNA EXPERIENCIA INOLVIDABLE BTW ME QUIERO COGER A LADY MARIA. This game is one of those games you can keep going back to and finding little things and details you missed before or how the universe is inspired by other franchises namely berserk. This game is a work of art not just in terms of gameplay and game design but its overall aesthetics. This is the perfect entry for anyone who wants to try a soulsborne title as its streamlined and the mechanics and nuances are easy to understand and come to grips with. A title that is as close to perfection as humanely (or beastly) possible.. soulsbornes are my favorite genre but so many overwhelming bad flaws such as not being able to just rest at lamps which makes it horrible for echogrinding (which is super important bc of this games **** limited healing system) and overly complicated areas sometimes coming from someone who think ds1 has the greatest world design in gaming, worst of all the bosses what the **** were they doing while designing these how did this happen when souls games are known for having some of the best bosses in gaming there is only a few bosses (most coming from dlc) that are better than the worst boss of every other souls game combined got the plat and i was only glad because i didnt have to play this **** game anymore. Awesome gameplay, level design, atmosphere and score. Game of the year 2015 by far.. The pinnacle of fromsoftware design. It's a Sony exclusive so just find a way to play it,ifyou don't own a Playstation 4/5. Another abhorrent excuse for a game for which the developer did not include proper keyboard/mouse translation/conversions or layouts for. No idea what button does what. Got absolutely slaughtered by the generic trash guard at the very beginning of the game. Twice. Excellent waste of ~80 gigs of hard drive space, hours of download time, only for ~3 minutes of insufferably bad gameplay. At least I got it for free during one of Epic's weekly giveaways, so no money was wasted.. Perfect game for me. Once you have played, you will never get rid of it. Visceral attack and gun parry are the most genius game design I've ever seen.... While the game is difficult, the combat is better than other From Software games.. Best PlayStation exclusive I have played so far and the best souls like I have played so far difficult enough but not difficult to the point where I’m turned off. A work of art that combines Gothic and cosmic horror. From the foreboding atmosphere to the epic and edge-of-your-seat bosses, the experience is unforgettable. The music is truly remarkable and some of FromSoftware's greatest work, and it will send chills down your spine with its haunting, powerful, and otherworldly composition. The map is both well-crafted and engaging, and it features a rich and ominous soundscape. The intense, fast-paced combat is thrilling and transforms every battle into a vicious dance of wits and skill. It rewards an aggressive approach, and by seizing the opportunity, you will become the hunter of these ferocious beasts and monstrosities. The Old Hunter expansion, despite being short, is essential because it brings the best fights, weapons, and music to an already flawless experience. My only complaint is the chalice dungeons, which are a bit monotonous and unnecessary, but they're very optional and out of the way, mainly for hardcore fans of the game. A remarkable title that you must have in your collection. In particular, fans of the horror genre will be very pleased.. Fromsoftware's most profound and quality work to date. A coherent plot and well crafted lore, fast paced innovative gameplay style, subtle implementation of lovecraftian and gothic horror to an addictive souls gameplay loop. I've never played anything like this before. 10/10. Must play!. Great game with exciting, quick, and satisfying combat. It is unlike any other game while still being a great addition to the Souls franchise. Each weapon has its own playing style and combat, making combat much more interesting. 10/10. This game is so much better than I expect. The storyline is amazing, beasts were displayed very well and difficult, weapons are amazingly easy-to-use and it has good endings but it could be better.. This work is simply marvelous. Easily in my top 5 favorite video games. Soundtrack, atmosphere, art, this game has everything perfectly crafted, every detail matters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. EVERY SOULS GAMER NEEDS TO TRY BLOODBORNE. This is officially my first ever review on metacritic and yes, its because this is one of those games that blew my mind in a minute. I have no issues with the game only thing i wanna say to fromsoftware is please drop a PC port and a remake for ps5. I have played elden ring before and i thought nothing could even come near to it but boy bloodborne might surpass it if it gets a remake or a sequel. I am telling u its up there with the greats.. this is easily the best game ı have ever played. Everything is amazing in this game. The atmosphere, bosses, map design, level design. OST, lore, graphics and combat.This is top tier game. An amazing world with amazing gameplay. The combat is one of the best in gaming history. The combat is the reason why o have played the game for 25 timeslike 350 hours witch contains challenge runs **** buy NOW!. Most of the bad reviews are trolls. Theres only one or two actual bad reviews that I can agree with, cons of this game are included. As much as I love this game, the bugs are definitely a problem, same with it being a PS exclusive. The atmosphere is chilling, I love the randomness of not knowing where to go, and the combat is a great time. However, I wish there was a fun way to grind, as fighting the same normal enemies over and over doesn’t appeal too much. It has great skill check bosses, but some gimmick bosses are annoying. However, this was my reintroduction to console gaming after a long break, that still boots it up to 10. When I beat this, I was 13, and reminder: this was my first console game in around 3 years, this also being my first actual souls like/souls game ever. This game isn’t too hard though, if you’re struggling… what can I say except practice and get good? Unless it’s just due to grinding or gimmicky bosses. Then I understand your pain. The DLC is worth it, if you can spare 20$. I would elaborate, but no spoilers.. Before I give my opinion I have to say that I completed the game 100%. Now, this game seems to me like one of the most overrated games I have seen in over 25 years of enjoying this hobby. Visually it looks great for a game that came out in 2015. Most weapons are super fun and some bosses feel unique and fun to fight. THE STORY: this game has one of the best lores I've seen in a videogame but the game DOESN'T TELL YOU. Discovering the lore through items, talking with npc or watching videos on youtube is so underwhelming. You give me a cinematic to introduce a boss but not to explain what's going on in this world. wtf? FARMING: every time you die to a boss you have to go back to other areas to collect vials and bullets, after a couple of bosses doing this mechanic I found it annoying AF. I decided to use my cold fragments only to buy items because that was ruining the experience for me. THE WORLD: sometimes you reach to a point where you can't go forward and need to go back to other areas to open a new path, but the game gives 0 clues of where to go next. I don't want the game to point the directions but come on man, at least something. Overall it's a good game, fun to play but TO ME this is not even in the top ten of the genre.. The story is good, the designs of the enemies are amazing, the bosses are so damm good and finally the atmosphere is great. The definition of a perfect game. Contender for the best game of all time. How this game isn't ported to newer consoles is beyond **** is unacceptable to leave such a beloved game to the ps4 system. fromsoftware masterpiece, i love it 10/10 best souls ever every single part of the game is something beautifull. As a first souls-like Bloodborne is a fantastic entryway into the series. It nails almost every department. Its atmosphere and art style are some of the best I've seen in gaming as it truly encapsulates the gritty Victorian feel and yarhnam feels like a real place with real horrible, bloody, eldritch problems for the hunter to triumph over. Its music has some incredible tracks like the cleric beast and the final boss theme which really nail what there going for. Although a few of the default level tracks can tend to fall short and be forgettable compared to other souls games. Gameplay is fast, aggressive, and visceral. My biggest gripe is you often feel needed to go back through areas over and over again to accumulate healing flasks after boss attempts. Which is certainly not fun. Another problem comes with a lack of direction from the game as you can sort've get lost and not know where your next big objective is. Overall it's still a fantastic game and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to dip their feet in the souls-like genre.. Probably the best game I've ever played in my entire life! 300 hours spent on this game were not in vain... The story, soundtrack, enemies/bosses, the tragedy that happened to the inhabitants of Yharnam and many more things make this game almost perfect! I just don't give it 1000/10 because metacritic doesn't allow it :). In short: quality over quantity. No damn need of giant open world, tons of weapons when nailing aspects that makes a game worth every minute. Cinematic atmosphere, top tier music, great level design and world aesthetic, absorbing lore and fun to learn boss fights. Not even complex, but a thrilling combat flow that as Sekiro never instigates you to use anything else but the basics, and have no need of additional game-breaking tools, buffs and crap to easily get over soporific, mediocre difficulty design as half of Elden Ring can be described. ""Boohoo but PS exclusive, 30 fps, vial farming"" Are those your complaints? Then sorry for you friend!. Awesome setting. Intersting bosses. Bizzare but still great weapons, the game is beutiful. Held back by 30fps and lack of a remastered version.. Masterpiece ! Its a 11 out of 10 ! One of the best combat ever, grim and dark World with one of the best worlds ever created ! Just a masterpiece. Bloodborne might be one of the finest examples of atmospheric world building that has ever been produced. Every detail just drips with gothic character and builds so much intrigue in what fresh hell has been visited upon the world. Because of its relatively tighter aesthetic and narrative design, the world feels more harmonious than even other FromSoft games. There are really only two major ""factions"" at play, and the level designs perfectly switch between and even blend the two. The gameplay is top notch, though there are a couple chalice dungeon and DLC encounters that feel straight up unfair given the game design. But the game also has the distinction of some of the best and most memorable fights ever made, especially in the DLC. The soundtrack is a masterclass in atmosphere, and some of the boss themes are downright terrifying and fit the lore implications of the battles flawlessly. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, and I would give so much to go back to a time when I had not yet played it. If you haven't yet, get a copy and see what the hype was all about.. bloody beautiful visceral and my favorite game of all time. please for the love of God give me a pc port. What is there to say really? FromSoftware is just a company that has ALWAYS been in their bag. I hate to say that I got into these games so late. I started soulslikes with Elden Ring upon release and was so profoundly moved by the game it convinced me to play the others, going backwards. I am an Xbox user and after completing Sekiro a benevolent friend gave me his old PS4 just so I could play this. Good lord. I could go on for days about the aesthetic. That brooding, gothic, old victorian-esque style that this game has just resonates with my soul. The story is brilliant, the combat is fluid, the DLC was perfect and upped the difficulty that extra notch, that was ~just~ frustrating enough. It was a blast going for platinum with it. I enjoyed every second, and I looked forward to completing the Dark Souls series now after I finish Shadow of the Erdtree. FromSoft is rapidly cementing themselves as one of the greatest game studios of all time.. The best thing about Bloodborne is it's world design and it's Gothic Victorian style . We can't see any reused asset in the main game ( except some dungeons ) and all bossfights are a new experience for players . And also we can talk for a lot of time about the music because it is one of the most interesting part of bloodborne and without it's music maybe Bloodborne can't be as much as it's popular today . And about it's gameplay , it was the first time that Fromsoftwere made a souls game with fast fight style . Before that they made Dark souls 1 and Dark souls 2 and Demon's souls ,they're all have slow fight style and in the first time that they made a fast game they were able to made one of the best game in the world . It storytelling is very similar to other souls game that they made before and the players need to progress in the game and check the item description and everything and place all information like a puzzle to understand the story . And it's difficulty made Bloodborne a challenging game and when players play it , they can feel they're playing a special game that lots of people fear to play it and when they finaly finish the game they can feel that tehy are special . Bloodborne has a few different ending that players can choose their own ending . PROBLEMS: It has just some visual and graphics and online playing problems and i think Fromsoftwere can made a game without any problem with a good remake . Some problems that everyone can feel it including the online playing problems , increase the FPS from 30 to 60 , and fix some visual problems and made a game with a new graphic because the main game is for 9 years ago and it graphic is too old for players . Explain about the score : I talked about it's problems but i think it is because Bloodborne has released 9 years ago and having these problems are normal for an old game and i cant decrease it score and my score for Bloodborne is 10 .. A perfect game for lovers of fromsoftware games and the gothic theme that it is centred around. amazing tone throughout, great bosses, great graphics. WHERE IS BLOODBORNE 2? at least a pc port!! come on please i beg.. Another abhorrent excuse for a game for which the developer did not include proper keyboard/mouse translation/conversions or layouts for. No idea what button does what. Got absolutely slaughtered by the generic trash guard at the very beginning of the game. Twice. Excellent waste of ~80 gigs of hard drive space, hours of download time, only for ~3 minutes of insufferably bad gameplay. At least I got it for free during one of Epic's weekly giveaways, so no money was wasted.. This is the worst souls game i've ever played, the main mechanic of every souls game to encourage players to get better isnt present here, everytime you die you were supossed to try again, right? not in this game, here you will need to farm blood vials in order to try again, this is ridiculous, i don't get the hype around this game. Man, this game is very beautiful, every time you die is a life lesson, when you kill a boss you will taste the most satisfying thing the game can offer you and every time I play this masterpiece, I stay playing for hours. This was my first Soul Series game. It was a shocking experience. At first I was uncomfortable with dying so many times, but as I got further along, I began to find the process of dying and learning and winning more interesting. Once I learned the tricks of connecting cities to cities by unexpected paths and avoiding and getting past enemies to move on, exploring this world became a lot of fun. It was a brilliant game that taught me the joys of combat and exploration.. im writing this just to prove a point in a debate lmao. this game is peak and saved my life. Amazing game, one of the Best games I ever played, the Vibe, the combat system, the bosses, the enemies, the Lore, the history... Everything is great in this game. This masterpiece is the best work of the souls series, darkness, difficulty, and new game+ with bosses to irritate you for hours. Quite possibly the greatest idea were the chalice dungeons that could be created for one man raids, sending us looking for treasure drops. Best game oat, must play. Best game oat, must play. Best game oat, must play. Best game oat, must play.. The atmosphere, combat, enemies, bosses and almost everything is awesome. Thanks to From Software. This game has ruined all other games for me. Its too good. If it was 60 frames there would be absolutely nothing that can even reach its perfection. Give me a remaster. Best game ever made and best souls game.Perfect atmosphere,gameplay and boss fights.. Best game ever made and it's not even close. Amazing atmosphere and gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bloodborne is not as amazing as everyone says. There are mayor problems with it. Many areas feel the same and are just boring cities. The atmosphere is good but not my type and after some hours just boring. There are no boss weapons and not many blood weapon. The weapons are cool but there are like only 3 weapons that you should play ,because the others are just the same but worse. The bosses are horrible except of gehrman ,really great boss. There are also minor problems: you have to farm your heals ,just boring and bad gamedesign. And the bonfires (here laterns) only port you back to the dream. Really annoying and could have done better (like in every other souls game). And there is no reskilling. Overall just disappointing and no „masterpiece“ at all. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such a good soulsborne game. If you like lovecraftian themed games. This one is definitely for you. The combat and the lore is phenomenal.. I think it's an overblown game. Maybe it was evaluated by looking at other games of its kind. You're constantly trying to defeat the same enemies over and over again. When you make the slightest mistake, sometimes you have to go back to the beginning and visit the same places again and again for hours, defeating the same characters and collecting things. It may be nice for those who have a lot of free time and want to repeat themselves, but I would not recommend it to those who want to have fun for 1-2 hours a day.. I couldn't be bothered to play anymore after the first 4 bosses. Far inferior to any of the other souls games and obviously as well as Elden Ring. The online interactions are also far inferior. The music is good tho, that's about it. 3/10. BEST FROMGAME EVER. Has the best atmosphere, the best characters, the best everything!. FROM's BEST game. No question. Awesome! Really fun, and dark and pretty. Nothing can compare. The all time GOAT. Nothing will beat this for a long while. Unless they make another one!. My favourite game by FromSoftware and the entire ""Souslike"" genre, especially because of the setting and world building, which starts in a Victorian era inspired horror setting - but soon enough turns into more of a muddy, generic Lovecraftian inspired landscape. The story, as you should expect, leaves more questions than answers, it's neither brilliant or engaging, just vague, but that's the point as it at least sets an atmosphere, and the voice actors do a good work. When it comes to the playability, you also can expect a difficult combat in which your foes are much more agile than you, and which main rule is not to be greedy with attacks, the good old ""hit, run (dodge or roll, depending on the foe, and that makes a lot of difference depending on the boss) and hit again"", save your heavy attacks to only a few openings. The parrying in this game is done by shooting an enemy just before their attack, leaving them open for a devastating blow. But these are tricky and limited to how many bullets your weapon has - and if it's not a flamethrower or other spray weapons, which are still useful in specific cases. Certain bosses have certain weaknesses like fire or arcane type damage, as well as resistances, but the game will never tell you which, indeed, the game won't tell you almost anything about anything and you'll have to either learn the hard way through trial or error, or follow a guide, which I'm sure most peop","i love Fromsoftware games, but this one is a massive miss for me . the boss fights are subpar, the blood vial system is inferior to the flask/gourd system . once you are hooked you wont quit since you lay down the **** ."
146.Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem,"Hard to believe those favorable reviews you find about this game. First of all, this is not a survival horror game, not even a horror adventure. Just a combat focused action adventure settled in a lovecraft inspired world. The game looks quite nice and is well narrated, mostly in cutscenes, yet playing the game gets very quickly very boring. To decribe it in one word: repetitive. The levels are very linear, the combat is always the same and the game recycles its environments and mechanics heavily. You even have to do 3 complete playthroughs to get the real ending. So to see it you have to invest about 25 to 30 hours but you get only around 3 hours of unique gameplay. If you cannot resist to try the game yourself, do not fall for the good reviews and stop playing after it gets boring for the first time, probably the second time you visit the church. By the way, the highly praised sanity meter is just a second health bar, kind of like the panic meter in clock tower 3. Get ready to refill it over and over again with the same spell or same finishing move.. Kind of a weird game, the setting is bizarre, the storyline barely makes sense, the action is mediocre. Not sure why so many people like this but I will say its not a bad game, just not great either.. Unique. You should definitely play it. Just no reply value in my eyes. Solid eight out of ten.. Absolutely overrated, they had an interesting idea, the beginning is good, but then they introduce you to so many characters that are not interesting and don't get enough development for you to care about them, the gameplay is horrible, and it gets even worst with the allucinations. The game added too much unnecessary stuff, like those runes, and the characters, I'd be fine if you played with the blonde girl from the start, somehow playing through different eras in time, and explaining at least a tiny bit of what's going on over time.. I am generally not a fan of survival horror games, but this one really holds up. Really interesting plot and some good scenarios to explore.. I liked the part where they played Kiss me by Sixpence None the Richer although if Im being honest that was all my doing (Ill let it count though). Not sure why the roman soldier showed up, honestly not sure about a lot. I feel bad for that guy on the gamefaqs forum that couldnt get out of the prolog when I managed to do it while extremely drunk (like my man, just input 3:33 in the clock they literally tell you. Maybe time to call up the retirement gome. RING RING.. The best scary game ever made. Its story is creepy in a way that no game has ever accomplished and is more than just the bad guys being such.. I'm not going to say anything to keep you curious, I only confirm that this game is in the Top 100 games with the best story/lore and if you are looking for something that will leave you with ""existential void"".... Good game for its year. The story is engaging and exciting. Atmosphere and music are good. When I look at most people, the main reason why the game is loved is the hallucinations seen in the game. That's the part I liked too. Compared to Resident Evil, nothing surprised me. Resident Evil games are still better in my opinion. We can use magic in Eternal, it's nice, but it's not fun to use and we usually use it to solve puzzles and puzzles are boring. Level desing is not very good, especially repetitive towards the end of the game. Levels are very similar and often linear. The use of firearms is weak. Generally, the melee weapon is more useful. Boss fights not bad. Enemy variety is low. It was a different gameplay experience. Even though it's annoying most of the time.... Its certainly an unique game but its no Silent Hill. For a 20 years old fixed camera game it still holds out really well and even the combat isnt that bad. The story is told in an interesting way spanning through time and culture changes but i dont find it scary in the least and some of it comes of as goofy and cheesy specially since the game is so easy and you are mostly going through very linear levels with elementar puzzles that dont take even a second to solve, it really doesnt has none of the gravitas of the real horror fixed camera game classics like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Crimson Butterfly, and so on.. This game is simply amazing in his own unique way. I rate it 10 out of 10 because of the unique and intense experience this game has given me. I was not able to stop playing and completed it six times. There are some sanity effects that are technically outdated and are not able to trick you anymore, but some of them, are able to create what the f..k moments even today. The voice acting, sound and music is fantastic and creates a deep and scary atmosphere. The story feels so big, because the threat the characters have to face comes from another dimension and is an indescribable superior force. So the game is very good at it, to show that the protagonists are only normal humans who have to fight against something which is beyond their imagination. The gameplay itself is the early 2000's standard. However the controls is way better than in the resident evil games at that time. The magic system gives the player some room to experiment with and add some interesting mechanics to the basic combat. The atmosphere of the different locations switches between mysterious, threatening and scaring. Sometimes in a very dynamic way. All in all an All-Time-Classic and it definitely manages to catch the spirit of the Lovecraft-horror.. One of the best survival horror game for Game Cube, ever....!!!!! This is a classic game, its scare you for sure...!!!. It is the year 2021. It feels so incredibly while playing this game for the first time ever. I don't know why, but this game's story, gameplay, graphics and animations feel so cosy.. Overrated, had nice ideas but is extremely repetitive, which is a massive flaw seeing as the developers ask you to replay it several times for the ""true ending"". Even with just one playthrough you'll be seeing the same content over and over again. Beat it once and just go watch a video of the real ending, you won't be missing anything by doing this.. Best horror ever made , scary ambients , very creative monsters and lore ,like book Lovercrafts.. One of my favorite GC game i stilo got the originale 1 in 2021. So manu years, shame about too human that it was a flop. Visually might be one of the best looking games on the GC, amazing sound mixing, you get near a window and you can hear rain or crows that are outside. My only complaint is chapter 10 it's way too long and too hard. You should definitely play this game at your own pace so it doesn't drive you crazy. You get used to de controls pretty easily for a GC title. Also if you are a fan of short scary stories, this is a MUST play for you. Rather than focusing on atmosphere, it leans on psychological terror that will have you impressed till the end.. Great game! I played in Gamecube and now I'm playing on Dolphin and it still an excellent game! It needs a Remake!. Masterpiece of the generation! An amazing horror game, with a perfect story, characters development, incredible graphics and audio. You really feel sick and insane playing it!. All I gotta say is this is easily in the top 5 of GameCube games to own. While it is hard to find and is becoming very expensive, you won't find any other horror game like Eternal Darkness. The game I thought at first was one of those games that got poor reviews. But I'm very surprised to see it so highly regarded. The mechanics do take time to get used to, but outside of that this is one of the best horror games of the 6th generation. The only thing is that much of the cutscenes haven't aged well model wise and some of the audio is in low quality, but it doesn't affect the game that bad. I'd love to see Nintendo return to this great series.. Absolutely perfect game for me. I loved every aspect of it when it was released. The graphics were great and the sounds perfect for the atmosphere. The little touches like the sanity effects, such as heads on statues moving the more insane you got. The way the story repeats locations with different characters was great and gave a connected feel to the timelines. I played through several times to get the true ending with a very good friend and we both agreed that this was a once in a life time game, he is, unfortunately, no longer with us so I replay this game every few years in his memory.. My personal rating for ""Eternal Darness: Sanity's Requiem"" (GC): 7,6/10 - Great Gameplay: 8 Video: 7 Audio: 9 Scope: 4 Balance: 7 Story: 9,5. This review will contain no spoilers/small ones. Eternal Darkness is a GC game that got out in the 2002, but despite its age it is still one of the horror games I would highly recommend to anyone who like the genre. I personally played a dozen adventure horror games and only heard about Eternal Darkness but never tried it. But as of late I have been properly acquainted with the game and im sorry I havent tried it earlier. The visuals are great, even though the game is old the characters, places, items etc. look nice and not old. Camera is locked but that (mainly) isnt the problem as it is implemented well. Some of the visual effects look great even today. Audio is also very good. The music is atmospheric and haunting in places it should be and ""laid back"" and slow where it also should be.Voices are done well and dialogue carries the story quite satisfactory. One minor quip ( if Id really have to nitpick) is some sound effects could have lowered volume. The controls are responsive and feel good, the combat system is done well and is very fun to use. There is a spell system which maybe gets a bit tedious by the end but its nitpicking again. Enemies can mostly be avoided so the combat isnt compulsory. There are also traps in various chapters which again are done well and if you die by them, you feel like its your fault and not the bad controls or the ""game's fault"" in some other way. But what Youll mostly be doing besides combating the forces of evil and eluding traps is solving puzzles. The puzzle are (without spoiling much) very creative and are mostly not hard. The puzzles can usually be solved in the rooms they are presented in or nearby, although there are a few parts with backtracking and that can get tedious. The story itself is very good and does branch (although very slightly). The story itself is compeling enough to keep playing just to see the end.. scary, just scary. That's many all I have to say about this game. The story line is over different time lines. I just revisited the game again and I can say, the game still holds up very high. Sure, the game doesn't provide the best graphics, or the best game-play, and it looks as if it was developed with a low budget, but don't judge the book by its cover. In its core, the game is actually scary. The sanity system can **** your brain up. I don't want so spoil too much. But the developers got it right and they were able to make a game that scares the hell of the players. If you tried this game for a bit and it didn't impress you enough to finish it, I suggest you give the game another shot. The game does have a slow start (for me at least) but once you pass around 3 hours of the game, you will get into it and it will be nearly impossible to stop playing. Undoubtedly the most underappreciated game has ever been made. Play this game whenever possible.. 9.2 - Definitely one of the best and unique horror games out there. For 2002, there were some decent scares here and there, especially when you leave the game on idle. Game-play is really cool due to the fact that you be different characters every mission.. Can't make a review for this game without spoiling much and I really don't want to spoil stuff since that would ruin the kind of experience you're supposed to get. This is one of the best scary games ever made. It does something that pretty much no other horror game does. It plays tricks on your mind and will actually trick you, the player, into thinking that you're truly scared and truly losing your mind. Horror games today still don't do stuff like this. Not really. This game is on a whole new level of crazy for horror games. It's one of the best and you should totally try it. Great visuals too. And they said nintendo is a kids console... You would think otherwise if you played this one lol. This game is totally not for kids. Maybe a child who's been through some serious **** can handle it but not a regular child... I played this game when I was about 14 and it was totally messed up lol. Silent hill on crack basically.. Cult classic. Filled with wonder, awe. mystery and Lovecraft. The narrative drove this game much further than the antiquated game systems. The sanity system was insanely good. If you spoil it you're missing out on the fun of experencing the game as its meant to be played. A shame Shadow of the Eternals never came to fruition. One of the best games in history.. If there's anything you did not expect Nintendo to publish, it's this eye-jewel of a horror game. This horror game still has an actual story built onto it as of now unlike horror movies nowadays where they just use you for money. Possibly could be one of the best forgotten GameCube originals you could possibly play.. The game opens with Alexandra Roivas discovering that her grandfather's body has just been found in his mansion, bloodied and torn apart. With the local police unable to uncover any clues regarding the murder, she decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate the mansion and that’s when the tale of Eternal Darkness truly begins. Played now the graphics and combat system, while still more than adequate, are slightly outdated but developer Silicon Knights psychological thriller still stands amongst the GameCube’s best. This is in large part to its era spanning storyline that sees the player take control of characters ranging from a Roman Centurion to a hunter from the 1980’s. I won’t spoil the plot here but suffice to say they are all connected. Another of the game’s masterstrokes is the use of ‘insanity effects’. Should the players sanity bar drop to low all manner of strange things will start to occur, many of which have an effect on the gameplay. It may now be more than ten years old but those who own a Wii and are looking for something new to play could do a lot worse than picking up Eternal Darkness.. As others have rightly noted, the gimmicks (sanity meter, multiple plots converging) are outweighed by very clunky controls, slow paced play and an overall terrible fighting mechanic. But the biggest flaws are seen with the repetitive nature of the game which is mind numbing. The amount of times you have to travel from point A to bring something to point B, and back to point A, then back to point B makes the pace unbearable.. Playing this game in 2016 for the first time. AND I LOVE IT! Had to get used to the magic-tool-box, but its just brilliant. Graphics are very nice for a GameCube game.. An expertly created game, this game instills fear into the hearts of gamers. The sanity system is something that will truly make you question the game and the gameplay is innovative, fresh and original. I have heard complaints of clunky controls, but I would rather complain that is how the survival horror genre plays out (for most survival horror games from the day this game was released had clunky controls). The story is truly excellent and has much food for thought. The only true complaint I can find here is that the boss battles of this game are something that you wished were better executed and that the game is rather easy even for a beginner.. I had this game some months ago, and then I sold it :/. Anyway, This game is a strange gem, because it has a very good history, nice elements (the sanity bar), the music and atmosphere are great. However the graphics are not the best and the controls are clunky, finally sometimes the game is boring. If you have the time and patient this game is for you and probably you will give it a 9 or 10.. Eternal Darkness is a game so dark and twisted that you are shocked it came from Nintendo. Not your standard horror game, this one has a deeply disturbing storyline and messes with the sanity of the character as well as the player as it actively messes with the gamer using unique visual tricks and fake outs. A technical marvel at time of release, Eternal Darkness is one of the most innovative games in the horror genre that deserves another look.. I played Eternal Darkness about 1 year ago. Unfortunately I never got a GameCube, so I used to play it with the well-known Dolphin emulator. I was curious to try a few games for the GameCube, and I knew the fame and prestige that Eternal Darkness has, so I decided to start playing it. In my opinion the plot of Eternal Darkness is strange, but especially beautiful. I loved a lot the time gap from one era to another throughout the history and events of humanity, and amazingly all the stories will have a final perfect consistency. The characters are very well characterized, and each of them has a story to tell. Another thing that struck me is the atmosphere: I am not a big reader, but is palpable the reference to works of H.P. Lovecraft's literature and mythology, as the Ancients, the occult, spirituality, madness. Beautiful also the ending: a cruel but true reality of how human life is influenced by events older and greater than it, and how mysterious forces manipulate its fate. It is an anti-anthropocentric story: the man is in the universe, but not in its center, in other words. Like the plot, although the gameplay of Eternal Darkness is extraordinary. The first thing that catches one's eye is the special combat system: you can actually decide where to hit the target, to the head, to the body, or to the arms or legs, and according to the type of enemy the attack will have more or less effect. The combat system is in fact impeccably, and it must be considered the wide range of weapons available, from melee weapons to firearms, ancient and modern, and regardless of type of weapons the combat system is fun and structured. The use of magic with the special book not only allows you to perform powerful attacks but also to enchant weapons, or to interact with the environment to uncover secrets. Some types of spells need to be created by the player, through the combination of the runes. Among other things, the manner in which spells are related to each other by color, is a whole order of the strengths and weaknesses of the Ancients, and each color reflects the kind of power of the god. However what makes Eternal Darkness truly original is the indicator of mental sanity. Yes, because let's be honest: Eternal Darkness may be frightening, but not a lot. However the character's sanity, indicated by a green bar, it may decrease during the game and when it is empty the game begins to give birth to strange consequences: the heads of the statues that move, blood dripping from the walls, parts of the body that fall without a reason and many others. All this, beyond if the game is scary or not, surely leaves the player with his mouth open, because of unpredictability of events, and I personally found the addition of this expedient in the gameplay something simply brilliant. A special note for the battle against the final boss, that is beautiful and challenging. Really the gameplay of Eternal Darkness is beautiful, original and fun. It is as it should be the gameplay of each good game. If I have to say something that I didn't like some puzzles are a bit too frustrating and inconsistent, but they are relatively few compared to others. From a technical point of view, Eternal Darkness maybe not excel, but still boasts a pretty good graphics and well made in 2002, especially considering that the game was originally designed for Nintendo 64. A very nice soundtrack too. Speaking of my experience with the emulator Dolphin, Eternal Darkness is the game that gave me less trouble: 50 frames, few bugs, and an exceptional stability. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a great game, well made, balanced and original. A masterpiece of thriller and horror and surely a killer app of the GameCube, and one of the best games of the early 2000s.. Easily one of the best horror games of all time. It has an insanity bar, just like a health bar, and I highly suggest trying out losing your mind. I cant wait for a remastered version.. With a detailed story and psychological horror elements that keep the player on edge, this is one of the best Gamecube titles out there. Eternal Darkness is arguably the greatest horror game I have ever played, and that is no exaggeration.. Simply a masterpiece. The psychological horror elements are top notch. Gameplay, plot and character development are amazing. This is a deep, well polished game that everyone should enjoy. This game managed to create a scary overall atmosphere, yet always made me want to explore every dark corner of all the featured locations. Plot, fighting system, music, sound effects,... everything's top notch. There's only one little flaw: The enemies get quite difficult very soon and you might find yourself frustrated every now and then in the early parts of the game.. This is an artform, video games are art? The vast majority aren't, but this... this is art. +The storytelling is done so compellingly, the story itself and the themes it covers are very lovecraftian, it essentially is like a lovecraft story in all but name. +You experience the past, through the eyes of others throughout history. You come will see a evil so terrible and far stretching that you will have the context to truly understand how scary the ancient object is that you've found. +It's essentially survival horror in a dark gothic setting... yet its control scheme is SOooo good. Its very easy to use yet gives a very good level of control. +Sanity, this is so well implemented gameplay element, its ridiculous that no other game out there has copied it yet!! It makes the sanity system in Amnesia look pathetic, think Call of Cthulhu where seeing frightening scenes & linger around them to long decreases your sanity but the system goes above and beyond what you think. You're sanity level affects the game in subtle ways, strange things will start happening (not right away) but you'll notice weird things that it actually messes with not just your character, but you the player. What I mean is you will start to doubt your own sanity... I am not you. It's that good. +Fear, yes its scary without having to use jump scares. Its the hallmark **** horror game & you should have already guessed by now that this game knows how to play with your imagination and use it against you. There might be 1 or 2 jump scares but it's almost out of place in this masterful tale of horror. +I could go on about puzzles and the voice acting, it's all so well done... the one thing I want more for this game than any other is for someone to port this baby to the PC. This game deserves to be remembered and played long after gamecube's a distant memory.. A truly remarkable game for it's time. Probably one of the most original games I've ever played. Visuals are OK for the most part, but not as good as they could be. Voice acting is very good, narrative is a bit confusing but pretty good (provided you get what's going on.) Atmosphere is truly where this game shines. A true horror game that does everything it can to mess with your mind. Overall: Eternal Darkness is truly a unique game that really can not be fairly compared with anything else, but if I had to try, I would say that it is a cross between Alone in the Dark and Amnesia. A great game and an unforgettable experience, but it could have use a little brushing up in terms of the visuals.. This game was okay. Over rated I think.. nice and original residentevil esque game very good story and solid smooth graphics, easy controls and lots of characters to play with great game for 2002. This game will scare you. I didn't believe it was possible to feel so much fear and despair while playing a game. I don't think any other horror game past or present has even come close to this one. A classic.","the game looks quite nice and is well narrated, mostly in cutscenes . the levels are very linear, the combat is always the same and the game recycles its environments . the sanity meter is just a second health bar, like the panic meter in clock tower 3 ."
147.Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos,"the single player campaign is great the regular multiplayer is a broken mess - expect for the UMS maps. Best game ever I have played in my entire life. best story telling, best characters best everything. this story is showing the great brilliance of how to make empathy with the villains. Arthas was right !. A personal favorite of mine, this game was a huge part of my childhood and I still play it time to time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great story which constantly suprises us. Difficult and satisfaying last misions but a little bit unbalanced. However still very very fun to play! Must play RTS. The gaming gem that brought me in the RTS games. The story, the campaign, the gameplay, it was just all at **** gamewas good balanced between 4 possible races and the online game was **** all of that was not enough for you, the custom game modes, which were allowed made the community thrive... and what have it produced. The whole MOBA genre, that was born from Dota custom made mode, was just of small piece, that this one game could allow back then. Also all the tower defence modes were perfect. Back then Blizzard cared about game quality and player experience while playing. That is the biggest hit of Warcraft 3: Reforged. Just take my advice, and go play the original game.. Definitely one of the better RTS' from its time, but not perfect in any way. What made this game great was its **** community and maps. This became even more apparent when the expansion came out.. One of the best RTS games for its story graphics and design and awesome multiplayer content with a lot of moddability and a very powerful map editor.. My favorite game, I spent countless hours, playing camping as a kid, on the ladder, and playing with my friends in both custom maps and standard. Great game.. As good as the classics RTS games, it adds little RPG concepts to the game that brings fresh air to the genre. A reference. One of my favorite strategy games. It's a legendary game. Too bad there's no sequel in this genre.. It all started with this game. One of the first games I played. Since childhood that game had a great influence on the imagination. This is what shaped me as a player, shaped what I like and expect from other games. The best thing is the game is still incredibly playable and has one of the best storylines I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Factions are varied and each is fun to play.. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is a landmark real-time strategy game that excels in storytelling, gameplay innovation, and multiplayer features. Its immersive world, memorable characters, and strategic depth have made it a beloved classic among gamers. Despite the passage of time, Warcraft III's engaging gameplay and rich lore continue to captivate players, making it a must-play for fans of the genre and anyone interested in exploring the Warcraft universe.. My first game that i have ever played & compeleted, The story is just a pure masterpiece. Gameplay is obviously not that good but story saves the day. And the music ? 10/10. The game that got me into PC gaming. Incredible gameplay/story and the best Warcraft game.. This and Rome Total War was probably my very first introduction to the RTS genre, and boy did I join when the days were grand. I loaded in the disc cartridge and just started playing. Y'know, I might attempt to locate said disc later tonight. It's unlikely Ill find it, but if I do then ill be enveloped in the pools of bliss and childlike nostalgia.. My first time writing a review. This is a best game and a game i always come back to. 'nuff said. Another masterpiece besides Starcraft, I played many many bot games. FROZEN THRONE is a good update. I love both. The campaign is also great.. It's magnificent, that Warcraft III give me a lot of fun even nowadays. Example **** which will be good for very long if not forever.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Didn't like graphics bad characters bad game very badly done Do not recommend.. this game is somethingthis game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. A revolution in the game industry. Father of moba and a huge mythology. My childhood was great with the and the Frozen Throne.. Absolute classic, game that changed rts genre in some ways. Great story, great characters. I'm not a huge fan of RTS games. But Warcraft 3 is the exception. Its probably not nearly as deep as Starcraft. But it doesnt need to be. Its system works excellently for its campaign, which is excellent. The world, the lore, the music, the story, the missions, are all excellently done. The strength of this game and its universe is what spawned the biggest game of all time - World of Warcraft. Enough said.. Warcraft III is the third installment in the legendary Warcraft RTS series. It was released in 2002 and it made the WoW phenomenon possible. Very much so. I still remember the first time I played this game. I was completely new to the Warcraft universe, but the fairytale like graphics, the fantastic music and the superb story grasped me immediately. Lets talk about the story a bit. It is just so well written, so well constructed. How the individual campaigns follow and compliment one another is amazing, it is never boring and always full of surprises. Just wow. The Arthas story arc alone, his descent towards evil, but for completely understandable reasons, that is really mature. It really plays very cleverly with the concept of the greater good and lesser evil. The orc story line is also fantastic, no matter how far the orcs will go, they can never truly escape the curse in their hearts. And then the Night Elf storyline, that ties is all together and gives it all a greater meaning. Just wow. But the story and the characters are not the only great aspects of this game. The graphics is really unique, mainly the colors, so fairytale like, so vibrant, I just love it. The music is brilliant, every race has a few very distinct tracks that you will never get tired of. Besides that, there is the multi-player. Four races, each very distinct and different and yet so well balanced. And then there is the battle net scene of the early 2000s. I have so many great memories of it, I have made so many friends there, eventually I joined a clan and later we transferred to WoW and started our own guild that lasted for over 15 years. And speaking of the W3 - WoW connection. I consider the Warcraft III to be an unprecedented outburst of creative genius. Just think about it. Even now, twenty years later, they are still reusing the same characters, storylines, neutral creatures, items etc. in WoW. Yes, that says a lot about the lack of invention in WoW, but it says equally enough about the superb quality of Warcraft III writing and ideas. But most important of all, there is the Warcraft atmosphere, the It factor, the illusive mistress that every game wants, but very few actually get it. I believe there is an alchemical element involved in the creation of any piece of art and because of it there is no guaranteed formula for success. But Warcraft III has got it. For me and for many others. This game certainly succeeded. Obviously no microtransactions and no SJW. Back in 2002 neither of these things even existed. Ah, what a world it was. Even now, twenty years later, I keep coming back to this game every two years or so. I know the campaigns through and through, every quest, every creep, every secret. But still I keep coming back and every time I have a great time. What higher praise I could possibly give this game? For a long time Warcraft III was my absolute favorite game of all times (then another W3 game came along, but that does not diminish the qualities of Warcraft III in the slightest) and it will remain in my heart forever. Final Verdict: 98 %. One of the best games I've ever played. Good history, good campaign and good playability. This game is an example **** graphic style and great storytelling. One of the best games in the RTS genre.. It was a good game before, but as Reforged replaced the old game with an even more limited form of Reforged, I have to say things become much worse. With how this affected mods community, how Blizzard support is terrible, these new problems turned a legendary game to some junk you probably won't want to buy.. Literally, the best RTS game ever made by the once most loved company - Blizzard.. Excellent. Marvelous. Great. Feel the power! Awesome rts, awesome campaing, though never had a play in multiplayer, but that is irrelevant in this context. I still remember all the days when I play it with my other team members. I cannot believe we are used to be pro. Guess it will never come back.. Metacritic's 2002 PC Game of the Year] It has been nearly fifteen years since the war between the orcs and humans ended. An uneasy peace settled over the land while, for years, the drums of war were silent. Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory - and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader. Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life - all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again - rising urgently towards the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire - and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion. The Day of Judgment has come... [Blizzard]. The best RTS ever. One of my favorite gaming universes. Amazing graphics for the time. Ingenious gameplay with RPG elements, one of the best esports games of all time.. high quality, interesting story and one of the greatest RTS ever one of the best game if I need to compare among all other games by the way. A milestone for RTS games. A well deserved huge shoutout from the strategy gamers back then.. It all feels a bit basic now, but the story was incredible - the reason WoW had the legs it did is a lot down to the foundation laid by this.. Best game ever created by Blizzard. One of the greatest RTS of all time. This game gave me fun and enjoyment for more than 15 Years. Until Recently when blizzard deleted this all time Classic. I remember when I was young child every time after school I used to hop onto my old mac and binge several hours playing customs maps like Customs Tower defence and zombie defence. Today I don't think there was a game that made me feel the same level of emotions i felt playing Warcraft 3. It **** that we won't ever get a sequel to this game due to blizzard pretty much being in the mud right now (This is 100% a good thing seeing what happened to Reforged) Even though it came out in 2002 in my opinion Warcraft 3 still looks and plays like a modern rts game. Would highly recommend to anyone to out and play this game i bet you won't regret it. (Don't buy Reforged). I dont understand everyone’s love for this game. The story is told with convenience and contrivance, not cause and effect. Things just… happen and characters just… .do things whether its within their character or not. It seems like it was a stop gap game they made to introduce World of Warcraft instead of a well thought out and executed game itself. You run around with only a few troops so its like you’re in a party or a platoon at maximum, not an army. The “Horde” is made up of like… 9 orcs and 4 trolls. Buildings are so big, stacking defensive structures takes up half of the screen. With other RTS’s that had been released before this, like Red Alert 1, 2, Tiberium Sun, StarCraft, and many many more, its a wonder they botched it up so bad. Honestly, when I look at it, it see a failed attempt at making World of Warcraft before getting it right with the actual World of Warcraft. Damage is slow and arbitrary. 5 guys can be pounding on 1 peon and it will take him forever to die. When you’re escaping the prison as Keal’Thazad, you have to “stop them” from getting to the alarms, but the slow damage means you just have to kill him before his weak swings destroy whatever asset they used as the alarms. Skip this and play WoW as this just seems to be a crappy attempt at it first.. Although I picked up Warcraft 3 came out in 2002, It is still the game I play most, and it has a lot of competition. I play Call of Duty 4, World of Warcraft, Half Life 2 and its various mods, and many others. Even with all these games I have played Warcraft 3 the most, simply from i. Been playing it since 2006. One of the greatest games of all time and a masterpiece.. Truly legendary game. Everything is good here: history, gameplay, graphics (for 2002). But, unfortunately, there are problems with this game on new systems. I would like to re-release this game (not the one released by Blizzard).. A classical game that introduces the world of Warcraft. The story and characters were very interesting!. Deep and competitive real time strategy, complemented by brilliant artwork and an epic saga like no other.. im glad i have a physical and a pirated version of the game so i wont play the new soulless one again. this is my favorite game ever. the music is godly. the gameplay isnt as fast paced as starcraft but still very freaking good. the amount of content and maps is shockingly good. the story is amazing. it has the best voice acting ever and no game is even close to that. the dlc is even better lol. the custom games and campains are a very big edition to the game. this game was alive for 17 years. but the reforged version kinda killed it. im glad i have a physical copy. offline is enough for me. and one more thing,the online matches were really god damn good as well. the only problem i have with the game is the undead are really hard to play against as a new player.. Will be my all time best game until I die. The campaign, custom games and ladder were all so amazing. Truly the best game there was in the golden age of gaming.. Warcraft III: Reign Of Chaos is legendary. I bought it right on release day and had pretty high expectations. And it was even better than I thought! It´s a fantastic RTS game with a wonderful story and a beautiful fantasy setting. Gameplay is one of the best I´ve ever experienced and the quests are thrilling. And after you finished the great story, there still is the terrific multiplayer! Every hardcore gamer and fan of older games should get this game, it´s highly addictive!. One of the best RTS games in terms of plot, mechanics and unique style. As a kid I was in love with this game, and not much has changed since.. Eh the nostalgia. The Reforged made me realise two things: that Blizzard **** now and that old warcraft was excellent game that was good as it was.. I for one never liked reign of chaos, the story is slow and a chore to play, its really just one long tutorial, you get units after every few levels and get accustomed to using them, every few sequence just shows how some units joined certain factions and so on, but when you do get around to actually understanding the story its wonderful, but it has huge plotholes and missed opportunities. The artstyle is GREAT, really good stuff that only reflection can make you realize, the cinematics are flawless. The gameplay is a real step up from War2 but my God is the hero system janked. This game has a huge learning curve, better be ready to grind those how-to videos and practice over and over till you finally git gud, the enemy AI cheats in custom game, its collection rate and training time is better than yours, but with enough strategy you can win.. Played Warcraft I, II and III for years and finally gotten the reforged update. Thank you Blizzard, I am still enjoying this after all these years and my kids are enjoying it as well.. My first Blizzard game. I remember being introduced to it by a buddy who was freaking out over its release like it was yesterday. Ironically, it didn't take long before *I* was answering his questions about it and anything related to Warcraft or Blizzard games in general. I've sunk countless hours into Warcraft III and its custom maps. I even play Heroes of the Storm on the daily as a direct result of this game's MOBA scene. I'll forever treasure this game and entirely disregard the ""reforged"" one masquerading around.. Another example of a perfect story, perfect gameplay and perfection itself.... Perfect game with every angle, the story is a long and not that easy one to understand, need someone who can hold his thought, the graphics of the game at that time unique nothing like, and even now I bit if there's strategy game with similar colorful art. the network play is craft brain.. Best strategy game that has ever been made even if it is flawed so if you haven't already play it and play it. Everything is great about this game, the storyline is good and the cinematics are really good. Overall, my nostalgia on this game is strong.. Played on PC. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. Is an amazing game that until now April 2020 i still play on single player and battle net. Have a lots of enjoyable thing such as history that involves u, the graphics are pretty cute xd, and the design was pretty cool for its time, i stil play HvsA ion battle net and is cool. Just is good and better than all things Blizzard has been making this last 10 years zz. This is a game of my childhood. And I would love to go through it another 1000 times. After all, this is a game of a once great company.. I'll not take much time. This is one of the most important and beautiful games ever made in the history.. Awesome story, great RTS with unique factions and great introduction of heroes into the genre. My all-time favorite childhood game. Great story, amazing multiplayer, custom games 10/10. I miss it so much.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A true classic, genre defining RTS. Amazing multiplaer, great story and lore, music and cutscenes.. This masterpiece game its plot, gameplay and graphics are not quite normal, but especially the game was remembered by the Russian voice acting, it’s a masterpiece how many memes she created in a good game made with her soul.. Amazing and legendary game from blizzard , obliterated since warforged up ,rip. ty activision. THE game of my childhood, it was the best RTS i have ever played. It WAS, because Blizzard has officially killed this game, by releasing a forced patch in 2020, limiting the game functionality so it can fit Reforged. Rest in Peace Warcraft 3, 2002-2020 - killed by Blizzard itself.. The best game of all time. One of my fav childhood games. I really enjoyed everything about it.. I've been playing this game since 2002/2003 but Blizzard ruined it with the reforged update. Stay away now.. This is AWESOME RTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved this game > 1) Custom maps 2) Interesting campaning 3) Great Sound ! 4) Great Music! 5) Classic Lore! 6) Teatral Sound SFX! 7) Good History!. This used to be the best game ever, but sadly it's unplayable now since WC3 Reforged. It was great game, milestone in history of RTS and game industry in general. Epic story, awesome balance, great music, charismatic voice actors, careful design of units (i still love Night Elves ladies!). Sadly, Blizzard had to ruin it all, by creating you-know-what, so it's more like an epitaph from me, rather then review.. Dear Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, I will miss you. Blizzard has destroyed you with the release of Reforged but I will forever remember you as the masterpiece that you were. One of the greatest games of all time. Seventeen year legacy. RIP.. RTS with Heroes that level up in game. Micro heavy. Great game, but don’t buy “Reforged”, it’s a trap.. This game is like conor mcgregor. the best thing in the world and no one can forget his legacy!. Reforged destroyed the game - how could you do this to a fifteen year legacy.. Started playing the game in 2002 and still playing in 2020. Warcraft III was my introduction to the Warcraft franchise and I found that the game was very accessible to a new player. The story is easy to follow, the tutorial is in depth and informative and the campaign is an amazing experience. The multiplayer also has a wide variety of options for people with different levels of enjoyment. There is ranked, custom games, LAN, or you can just play solo with a few bots pending on how you game. The player base has created a huge playlist of custom games that have kept the servers alive for nearly two decades.. 10/10 loved this old game but now im just paying homage to its memory. It is now lost to time and is just a faint memory of those who loved it.. Loves this game. I would play it all the time. I still play it every now and again. It was before its time.. Damn, sometimes you really only appreciate something after it’s gone. If I knew reforged would come to kill it I’d have played even more.. RIP 2020, But i still love this legendary game #f*ck reforged Activision Blizzard split on your faces comrades. The best real-time strategy. I don’t even know what else to say, but it’s a fact. Game crashed my computer after new patch. Great job guys. You destroyed the game ive played and loved all my life. This one was a gem before the Reforged Patch, legendary game at its time, you can find it on the internet if you want to play it, dont buy the **** version.. The game that we know and love. My childhood love. Even now in 2020 I am happy to play this masterpiece.. The crowning entry in one of the great RTS franchises of all time, and the greatest implementation of end-user custom game creation yet released, even nearly 20 years after the fact. Every bit as important an entry in video game history as Ocarina of Time, Super Mario Bros., Halo, or Battletoads.. The best RTS game of all time i really enjoy every second of playing it recommending!!!. Amazing game ! So much better than the Reforged one. An epic RTS game from my childhood. One of the best RTS in history spend over 3000 hours. Lore, story , balance every thing is perfect.. The great game for all times. Good RTS with normal campaign and custom games. This one has LAN, ladder, no DRM, pretty ok balance.. When I played this game I did not have Internet. Then there were no sites with ratings. However, now I have to put my mark. This game is great. This game was made by people with great attention to detail. This game was made for people, not for sale.. The true master piece that was butchered by Blizzard with Warcraft 3: Refunded.. With its expansion Frozen Throne, this is the last project from Blizzard before Activision’s acquirement and the only-online + multiplatform policies that leave us pure casual online cash grab. If you like the innovative blending with RPG, you will love it, and if not you should at least recognize its polished gameplay and sheer amount of detail in each pixel, not mentioning its contribution, creating entire genres as the popular mobas or tower defense from user made maps. It is the last 100% Blizzard product.. One of the best RTSes ever made. Can’t count how many hours I spent on it.. Golden classics. An example of a long term game that could bring so much joy and pleasure to the players over all these years.. My favorite game of all time,not a single flaw, excelent gameplay and campaign!. This game was wery good but Blizzard kiled IT for money , and to force you to Play reforget (refunded). One of the best games of all time. It was butchered by modern Blizzard... Press F to pay respects.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the best games EVER made, the amount of new games this game has spawned is mind blowing, too bad the new Blizzard will never live up to the greatness the company was built on. Backup your 1.31 versions of this beloved game, cause new Blizzard is out to behead it!. Best game ever. Hundreds of hours spent on it and now, due to Reforged is no longer available. In addition to revolutionizing the gaming industry, Warcraft III has been a pillar in the international gaming community, playing a significant part in ushering in the dawn of e-sports, fostering an incredibly productive and lasting modding community and being responsible for the creation of not only the world's most popular MMO with World of Warcraft but also spawning entire genres such as Dota and League of Legends. Its diaspora is heard and felt across the internet all the way down to flash games and fan art communities. I couldn't possibly write a more stellar review. This is game is an example of excellency and majesty to be considered as crucial learning for game designers even in 2020 and a must play for any RTS gamer.. july 3rd, 2002- january 28th, 2020. wc3 reforged has killed this masterpiece as they forced everyone that owned this game and who wanted to play online to download a 30 gb update and install wc3 reforged as blizzard took the lazy way out and just added a old graphics option and called it ""classic"". still one of the best RTS ever. I play the Story at least once a year. The Characters and the Story are absolutely amazing.. Title is obligatory for every fan of RTS type of games. Good story and mechanics. Shame that on this version there is only two races.... I bought this game in 2019 and its incedible, after all years, this game have a excellent campagin, soundtrack, multiplayer this game have all. Very good gameplay and interesting campaign. The introduced Hero units changed RTS gaming forever.. It has one of the best scripts in the history of video games. It is also one of the best in the genre and inspired later games. Great graphics for the time, great character design, innovative, a masterpiece.. Short reviews! The good: - Setting - Lore - Story - Gameplay - AI - Replayability - Soundtrack - Various buildings and units The bad: - Ehmm... Summary: Well, it's an immortal classic so I won't add nothing new. You all have to play it!. One of the best games ever! I really enjoy music and sounds of it. Polish version is just pure gold. Campaign is interasting and 4 races are pretty balanced. And this game inspired another game (DOTA) that will inspire other game (LOL). Overall pretty good game except for graphics.. This was such an awesome game. The story is compelling, the gameplay addictive. I thought they would make warcraft 4 after WoW, sadly they never did.. Zase práce, co mám udělat? Legendary czech dabing, characters and story. This is what created WoW. I love lore of W3. Best RTS strategy of all time no doubt.. I've played this game many years ago. But it's the best game of my childhood.. Likely Blizzard's magnum opus, Warcraft III manages to pack a ridiculous amount of content into one game. The graphics have aged well, and the game still maintains its fantasy aesthetic well. The recent updates to the game have enhanced this experience for many current players, who seem loyal and unwavering to this title all these years later. To put it into perspective, Warcraft III introduces many of the most well-known characters in their entire brand in one story mode. The single player presented here is near unrivaled for its genre, and the multiplayer, map editor, and custom community mods are just as great. Games like Dota, League, Heroes all exist because of the creativity of the creators and users. While, the creations have ceased to a halt, many multiplayer game modes such as Hero Wars, X Hero Seige, and Fight of the Characters are still an absolute blast after the initial learning curve. I can imagine that playing with a group of friends, these modes can bring a G-Mod-esq experience and one that I would highly recommend. Additionally, Warcraft III contains a story mode that has around 7-8 main characters Blizzard's writing and worldbuilding are in top form, with numerous twists and turns as you play through the eyes of all 4 races. Each race contains 3 heroes (4 with the expansion) and differing playstyles that give each race a satisfyingly different playstyle. The concept of heroes (Superpowered units) battling with their armies adds a unique experience and one that hasn’t been replicated 16 years after its release. Overall this remains as the groundwork for one of the greatest selling mmos of all time and it absolutely shows.. Classic. Just classic. No more words. Unique world, breathtaking storytelling and dynamic gameplay. best warcraft game his bases still persist the lord of the rings of the games. I love me some Warcraft lore. A must play for any WOW fan. I don't have much to add, since I'm crap at RTS and failed miserably in every level, which must mean the game is very good. The story definitely is.. In the game is perfect everything. It is graphic, gameplay, compaign, multiplayer. I never liked RTS genre too much but Warcraft 3 was something special. And the best part of it is flexible map editor that allowed players to create unique scenarios varying from puzzles and adventures to online PvP arenas.. Anything less than a 10 would be an insult to this icon of true RTS gaming greatness. Turning it into WoW and MMOifying the story is one of gaming greatest blasphemies in gaming history.. Best Rts ever... Hands down Has amazing story with amazing characters, amazing gameplay Rpg and strategy elemts make very consistent unity What else can u expect from game ?. It has a great story with different playable characters and is one of best developed strategy games. It's somehow like age of empires but it's more unpredictable.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Fix this ass game. If a human god (lyking) says it needs fixing then you know they did something wrong. Why are you allowing a tier 1 unit to counter a tier 3? Is Blizzard ****?. Literally the game of a life. Even in its basic form by which i mean the campaign and normal games against ai this game is great. The story and cinematics allow the player to dive into the Warcraft universe, discover it and ultimately fall in love with it. The game is still playable after 15 years since its birth, mainly due to map editor which allowed to create astounding number of different mods that keep entertaining people to this day and even brought moba genre to life. To this day none other game gave me that much entertainment and fun while playing with friends as this one. Because of maps variety almost everyone can find something for himself, its far more than a strategic game now and for me, the best game ever created.. The best game ever, with immersive single player and an epic multiplayer. This game marked my childhood. Thanks Blizzard for this masterpiece. simply AWESOME!!!. it's a really good RTS game. a bit too challenging at times but still fun to play. also i'd like to say that the expansion ""the frozen throne"" is a must buy for any fan of Warcraft III. Incredible game, incredible story. Humorous while at the same time tragic and heartbreaking. Warcraft at its RPG best. Do not miss this one. Even fifteen years later it shines on.. Classic and one of the best RTS games. The story is great written, I am sure I am not the only one, that wanted to see the next cinematic. There are 4 races with 4 campaings and own heroes. Great. The graphics was and is crap, especially that your view is too much zoomed in. There is a hack that can change that. I played many online games, because **** is the best online game portal.. Warcraft 3 is one of the best RTS games ever made. This is the game that really expanded the warcraft universe and presented the rich lore that would lay the foundations for the popular MMO World of Warcraft. Warcraft came out a time when they still made physical manuals for the games. The manual itself is more than just a manual. Its a tome of knowledge that gives you detailed lore. Rein of Chaos also marked when the series truly came into its own. It introduced 2 new playable f",the single player campaign is great the regular multiplayer is a broken mess - expect for the UMS maps . a reference to one of my favorite strategy games. Too bad there's no sequel in this genre .
148.Banjo-Kazooie,"A platforming masterpiece. Everything about this game is perfect to me. Each level is extremely unique and very fun to navigate through and find all of the hidden collectibles. The characters are very charming and at its core. It is just an excellent platform with a ton of variety. One of my all-time favorite games ever.. I would recommend this game any day over Super Mario 64. While both games set out to do roughly the same thing, there are a few key differences. First of all, the story in Banjo Kazooie is far less generic than Super Mario 64, which continues the worn out plot of Bowser kidnapping Peach. This game is similar in that respect, with the damsel in distress factor, but it does it slightly better. Tooty, Banjo’s sister, is captured by Gruntilda, who wants to make herself pretty by stealing Tooty’s beauty, and Banjo progresses through the Which’s lair. This is already a great plot. But there’s also the level design. The Jiggies, which are the puzzle tpieces are required to open up new worlds to get music notes, which allow you to progress through the lair. This introduces a dual goal, get the music notes and the Jiggies. It results in interesting gameplay, and makes exploring the entire world more encouraged. The final difference ispretty interesting. Since this game is more difficult since you have to get 2 different things from a world, it doesn’t need boss fights to be engaging. I think that’s what Banjo Kazooie does right compared to Super Mario 64 and most games. It flows in a way that works really well. And not to mention, the sounds this game makes are the funniest.. If you know who I am, I am a fan of Ice Climbers and climbing ice. But this game is just as good as that game. Sure, Ice Climbers is all I care about in life, but this game is my go-to when I want to play Ice Climbers 3D, as there are many ice areas in the game for ice climbing, such as Freezeezy Park or Click Clock Woods (Winter). This games ice levels are fun and expansive, and all of the other levels also contain ample climbing which I also love. Overall, It's great.. Dunkey was right, playing this game just makes you happy. This is my favorite platafformer on the 64 (home of the platafformers in general) so that speaks volumes of what this game achives. It's pretty simple and straight foward, levels are compacted with objectives that respect your time, the scal is just right on this one, the move set it's creative and overall a joy to complete. 10/10 play it now.. its pretty good........................................................................ Banjo hold up better than any other N64 game. Better than Mario64, Golden Eye, Ocerina of Time, etc. That's not to say it's better than those games, but it does hold up better than those games.. I wanted to like this game as a kid but it lacked the substance that other platform games at the time had.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best platformer/collectathon game out there. Do yourself a favour and pickup a N64 with a copy of this game so you can understand why I gave this a 10.. If you're looking for an early 3D platformer collecting game you cannot do better than Banjo Kazoie.. - Clarity: 8 - Flow: 9 - Balance: 9 - Length: 10 - Integration: 10 - Fun: 9. I don't believe I can find another game from the N64 era that has aged nearly as well as Banjo-Kazooie! This collect-a-thon presents a number of exciting worlds to explore, and its interesting mechanics and unique sense of humor make it stand out from the crowd. To this day, there has yet to be another experience quite like it. Yes, that includes Yooka-Laylee.... This game is amazing, everything from the level design, to the characters, to the levels themselves are perfect. The reason why this isn't a 10 is because the game towards the end is a bit annoying ESPECIALLY the last full level. Also the camera controls aren't perfect but I don't really have a major issue with that.. Best game i have ever played had some fun with it over the yeas this is a must play!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great game but the XBOX Live version is even better because it fixes most of the issues with the original.. The greatest 3D platformer ever made. The worlds, the whimsy, the characters, and the inventiveness are unmatched in the space.. I played this on N64 Switch online service, I enjoy this game Rare should make Banjo threee. Using Banjo-Kazooie's wide array of mechanics to explore new worlds is fun, but collecting the notes every time you die is tiresome.. classic, absolute genius even better with stop and swop on the xbox. Come on Rare bring on Banjo Threeie !. 3D platformer based upon the Mario 64 template with nice colourful graphics. One of the best examples of its type on the N64.. One the best game and best 3D platforms of all time. RARE made this game with passion and it shows. Amazing gameplay, graphics and story. The music is a masterpiece made by Grant Kirkhope. A game with a lot of joy and happiness.. Amazing game that holds up to this day. Fun exploration and catchy music. Enjoyed it as a kid and I collected all the jiggys and notes recently.. It's Banjo Kazooie, it's literally one of the best games ever made. I'm sorry but if you don't love this game there is genuinely something wrong with you, the characters, the game play, everything down to the funny noises everything in this goddamn game makes oozes with everything that makes games great. If you haven't played it do so now so that you don't regret it later.. Amazing 3D platformer. There is nothing to criticize. Great gameplay, graphics, music, and a solid story.. Still at the top of the 3d platformer genre, full of charm, wonderful characters, well designed and fun levels to explore.. Good game my first step into banjo was a good game but tiny things pissed me off with it and the save points **** there is none good game but certainly something beta was happening with this but still it's a good game. the best of the Nintendo 64 along with Banjo Tooie, and it's not even nostalgia, as I played this year for the first time. I marveled at the massive content, humor and gameplay. Congratulations banjo kazooie :). I hate that I missed this game back in the day. I kept looking for nitpicks, but I really don't have any! I heard for years this was better than Mario 64, and now that I've finally played, I'm inclined to agree! It looks and sounds great for the 64, and the level design was really impressive. Nothing was completely shocking to me, but it was so polished and well done that the overall experience left me yearning to play again. So I did! I actually think the Xbox version is slightly better, mainly because you keep the notes you collect, which makes the only bad level, Rusty Bucket Bay, **** way less. What a delight! Hey Microsoft, got to work on Banjo-Threeie yet? XD. Banjo Kazooie is such a masterpiece. Its music is beautifully crafted, the dialog is so charming, the level design is great, and it adds new moves even in the last level. The attention to detail is incredible. I could keep going about how incredible the game is. It's just such a masterpeice.. One of the best games ever made. Beatiful soundtrack, great level design, charming characters, its just a blast. This is a must play!. If you like Super Mario 64 but want more mystery, comedy and interesting landscapes you'd love this. Many hours of pure joy.. Banjo kazooie is without a doubt one of the best 3D platformers of all times it perfected the collectethon sup-genre, the graphics and animations are amazing and the art style is very good, the characters are so charming and the worlds are memorable and full of details and things to see and do with some good platforming and fun and varied movesets and creative objectives and everything in every aspect of the worlds have a purpose and all of the collectables are rewarding to get, and the soundtrack is outstanding. The only issues I had with the game are the swimming controls and the aiming controls those can be a bit clunky sometimes but I got used to them eventually, also the musical notes respond if you die and you have to collect them again that can be tedious but this problem can be simply avoided if you got good at the game. Overall it's a great experience.. This game is very overrated the whole game is just wandering around until you figure something out why do you think Mario 64 gives you hints sure the hints are vague but it’s something and the movement and the camera is awful but the dialogue is funny this game has a lot of charm. Great and Magical, what can I say about Banjo-Kazooie that hasn't been said before. My favouirite game of all time. The Gameplay is fantastic and all the jiggys are Not like the others. The characters are really nice ans the dialogues too! The music is also the best of all time. I really really Love this game!. A classic 3D platformer and a must-play game with so much charm and great game design that still holds up to this day.. Although wasn't as shocking and relevant as Mario 64, is better in all aspects. Graphics, music, gameplay, length. I think is the ultimate 3D platform game. Nothing has been made better after this in platformers, ever.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. I have just completed the Version on Switch Online and in my opinion this game doesn't aged well. The graphic looks still great and the soundtrack throughout the game is still fantastic, sure. However this game has a strange difficulty curve. The first seven worlds are perfect in line. Every world is a bit more challlenging than the world before. The jiggys itself become more and more challenging to collect and from world three there is the first one annoying or frustrating jiggy per world. At this point, the game is still today a great and fun experience. Unfortunately the world that now follows is Rusty Bucket Bay. A world full with troublesome enemies, an tiring boss battle. Seriously Boomer Boom Box needs in total 130 eggs to defeat, thats ridicolous. The Jinjos are hidden in the most annoying places and the notes are difficult to find. However Click Clock Wood is even worse. For eight of the ten Jiggys you have to climb up that big tree multiple times and the enemies and some of the quests itself are so designed that you easily fall off and have to climb up again. The Quizshow is a surprisingly exciting and funny experience, which test your skills and your memory. I like it. But the biggest flaw in this game is the final boss fight against Grunthilda. This fight has in total five different phases and none of them is really fun to play. The first one is easy, the second one is boring and stupid designed, the third one is a poor dogfight with clunky controls and the fourth and fifth are simply unnecessary. In the last two phases the fireballs that Grunthilda shoot at you become unpredictable. It is so frustrating when you try to shot in the holes of the statues and get hit out of nowhere. At last I must say that, although the transformations are being a nice and funny addition, especially the pumpkin, they do not give the game that amount of variety you might think it would.. Banjo-Kazooie is an incredible Nintendo 64 platformer in the style of Mario 64, but with it's own distinct identity. The characters and humor are very appealing, and surprisingly crass at times. The visuals are dated certainly, but the polygonal look is utilized well with some great art direction, and has aged surprisingly well in many areas. The levels are for the most part well sized and structured with there being a good density of collectibles in each, they very rarely felt overly large or padded. The music and sound works is also high quality, though the repetitive voice clips will certainly be grating to some people. I think my biggest issue was the with the final boss, which I found to be slightly too finnicky, as well as a few control issues which made the experience less smooth. I'm delighted to have been able to finally experience this classic, it's deserving of all the accolades it's received and stands apart as one of the finest games on the Nintendo 64.. when i was younger, I had played banjo kazooie before at a friends house and at McDonalds, but i never actually finished it till now. i hate clankers cavern, i hate rusty bucket bay, i hate the final boss and how the projectiles seem to always hit you no matter what. but the rest of the game? i love it. while the platforming may not be as good as mario 64, banjo makes up with it with boat loads of charm and personality, and some truly amazing levels and set pieces. absolute masterpiece. it's a shame this franchise was taken away from nintendo and turned into a car building game, because banjo fits right in with the nintendo cast of characters. it's great to see his game on a nintendo console again after all this time, it's where he truly belongs.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Banjo-Kazooie is one of the most colorful, vibrant, enjoyable games I've ever played. Each level is so much fun to explore, and the puzzles are extremely satisfying to complete. But the music and sound design is what puts this platformer above the rest. Every song is so addictive that you'll be listening to it on repeat, and the sounds are incredibly unique and give the game so much of its tongue in cheek personality. Really, the only negatives to find in the game is that the controls and graphics of the N64 hardware have not aged that well. However, this is only a minor complaint and if you have a N64, this is a must buy for the console!. Banjo-Kazooie is in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made. The graphics are amazing for it's time, playing it today just really gets you into that nostalgic feel! How the characters act and sound is pretty much unique to this game, the hilarious bosses and the wide range of maps, challenges, upgrades, transformations and terrain makes this game simply amazing. The soundtrack is also exceptionally good! Altogether the game feels phenomenal. I've played through this game at least eight times, if not far more. It has a huge amount of variety, from swamps to mountains to the four seasons. The humor is always on point and at no point does it feel as though the creators were ever close to running out of creativity. It is a highly replayable game filled with memorable characters charming locations, and music that brings joy and a childlike simplicity to everything it touches. Even twenty three years after release it is still a masterpiece. One of the greatest games ever to be released.. One of the best games the Nintendo 64 has to offer and one of the best games Rare ever put out.. A videogame that deserves a remasterization in all possible ways. Guaranteed entertainment, good OST, really fun gameplay, a nice story. This game is memorable.. If you want to play one of the best games the N64 has to offer, there's no lie that the charming and whimsical adventures of a bear and bird will make feel like a kid again. You'll meet some whacky characters and go face to face with unique boss fights. That and so much more is why this game is one of my favourite 3D platformers of all time.. A fun game with cute characters (even the Kazooie being more helpful than Banjoo mostly times) and provides about 10 hours of gameplay. The only reason that I don't gave 10, it beacuse of the confusing camera from the game.. I just got this game, and I'm immediately hooked. Lots of moves to play with, lots of items to collect, sensational music, this game has it all.. A Nintendo staple in the gaming industry. this odd duo makes it work. i loved the different power ups you can unlock and the story was interesting enough. i was about 5 when this released but didnt actually play until i was about 7 but it still enjoyed the hell out of it.. This game is perfect in every sense and it should be taken as a good example of how must to be a 3D platform: the progression is good, huge variability in levels, moveset and gameplay and has a great sense of humor (well, the most I could understand; English isn't my first language). Personally I love this game. Is my rough diamond and the best videogame for N64 and Rare in general, that so much that I played it like 30 or more times since 2003, the first time I played it.. this game has far more personality than i could ever dream of having. the ost goes hard too.. One of the greatest games from my childhood that I personally think still holds up in 2020. Excellent controls, fun & creative levels and awesome music.. Best game on Nintendo 64 with Super mario 64, i played it in rare replay and its AWESOME,the characters,the gameplay, everything, I love this game a lot, I played 20 hours and i loved every second of the game (except Rusty Bucket Bay and 90% of the last battle), one of the best games of all time.. Really fun and they crack alot of jokes I mean alot. I have finished it a few times. It's always hinting to movies or something very fun.. This game was so fun. The music, platforming, and story all give of the happy bubbly N64 platformer. Just a fun experience that is unforgettable.. A true masterpiece it has some good humor good control and loveable charecters. Banjo-Kazooie is phenomenal, an apex for the 3D platform genre. The graphics are impeccable, the soundtrack is absurd, with animal sounds in the songs, which brings incredible immersion, very good gameplay, and diverse levels, which does not make the game repetitive, but exciting to play. For these reasons, Banjo-Kazooie, for me, becomes one of the best games of all time.. This game is pure childlike wonder, between the characters, the music, and the amazing level design, this is one platform game you can’t miss.. Everything about this game screams fun. From the art style, music, and level design. It's all amazing. Speaking of the levels, they're some of the best in gaming. Treasure Trove Cove and Clock Wood are easily the best levels here. Not to say the others aren't good, but just these ones are awesome. Click Clock Wood is a great level, for you can go into the level in 4 different seasons. Each time you go into a different season there are different things to do. As you go around the levels you try to find jigsaw pieces to activate pictures to go to different levels. There's red feathers which you use to fly. Blue eggs to shoot enemies. Golden feathers to get temporary invincibility. And different colored jinjos to save too get a jiggy. There's also Mumbo's hut that allows you to transform. You have to pick up his skills and spend them on transformations, so you can get to special parts of the level. The final boss (Gruntilda) is amazing. That's all that needs to be said. But I'll explain. It's extremely challenging the first time, and when you finally beat it... It's just amazing. She has around 4 stages, with no checkpoints. One phase is when she dives at you with a broom, another shooting fireballs at you and you try to shoot eggs. The final two are you trying to activate statues as she shoots loads of fireballs. Once you finish it's awesome. Easily one of the best games ever crafted. I think it gives Mario 64 a run for its money.. This game has more character and heart than most games created today. The music is top-notch (Grant Kirkhope is a musical genius), the level design is stellar, and each and every character is unique and awesome. There is a good reason why it is considered one of the best Nintendo 64 games, and one of the best overall games of all time. In fact, I personally like this game more than Super Mario 64. I just really, REEEEALLLLY want a modern sequel to it. Super Mario 64 got that in Super Mario Odyssey, so why can't we see a modernized version of Banjo-Kazooie?. Along with mario 64 my favorite adventure / platforms. Unforgettable soundtrack, endless movements in the playable section and most importantly, fun to rage. 10/10.. This is the greatest game of all time. There simply is not another game that engages the player with its world as well as Banjo-Kazooie. The meat of the game is entering the nine main levels and collecting items. To start, the game expertly encourages the player to explore freely while collecting things. A limitation of the N64 that actually makes this version far better than the Xbox 360 port is that you can only see the collectables if you are relatively near them. This forces the player to enter the various areas of the level to see if there are collectibles (particularly “notes”), rather than just seeing the notes from afar. This goes to further engage the player with parts of the level that are farther away from Banjo. Once the player has explored freely, collecting things and completing challenges along the way, he or she must use their gained knowledge of the level to figure out where he or she might have missed something, surveying the landscape and always knowing where he or she is within the level. This is necessary because the game requires the player to collect the vast majority of the collectibles in order to complete the game. Each of the levels lie within an overworld, which is unfortunately broken up by many loading zones due to hardware limitations. This along with clunky swimming controls and an unbalanced set of attacks are the only flaws in a game that works incredibly well where it really counts. The graphics have aged wonderfully, the music is great, and the characters are brimming with personality. This is a game I think everyone on this planet should play.. Super amazing game l with such lovable characters! Can get slightly frustrating from time to time but it is so satisfying to overcome a difficult task to collect the next Jiggy. Guh-huh!. Great Level Design Great Move set (Not combat options) 10/10 Music Track Great Graphics For an N64 and still holds up well Replayable Unforgettle Envioriments This is My FAVORITE Game Of All Time. One of best 3D collecthon platformers of all time, Banjo-Kazooie perfected what Super Mario 64 did in 1996 and improved it even further.. Banjo Kazooie is one of the most influential games of the 90s. It’s fun and colorful music set the happy tone with the characters and character dialogue giving this child-like whimsy that just emits from every corner of this game. Even though the ending sequence can be infuriating, the rest of the game is happy and cheerful. After Rare was bought by Microsoft and the IP hasn't been used except for bad car games. The characters in this game are absolutely wonderful, with tiny little noise effects that made them feel so small compared to these massive worlds, but the thing is, is that the worlds aren’t as big as they seem. The only level that seems this way is Click Clock Wood, which is the same level but in 4 different seasons of the year. The game is so creative and smart with its level design but it never dwells on it, it’s always taking you to a new fun area whenever you get your new move and the right amount of Jiggies required. This game made me feel like a little kid running around this massive play space with slides and ladders and diving boards. It’s a feeling that I haven’t felt since I was like 7 and I miss it so much, but after playing this game, it's so amazing to feel it again. This game is a must-play.. Pure perfection, you must play this game before you die. It is very g made.. For me Banjo-Kazooie is just an amazing platformer. It has a ridiculous amount of charm and Rare bring so much highly concentrated platforming magic into a neat package. Banjo is one of those games i forget is about 20 years olds and the graphics look like ass, i just get so lost when i play it, in the soundtrack and the stupid characters that i dont think it will ever need to be remastered or remade. Just a good game.... I haven't played this game for at least 10 years, but came back to replay it recently. It's an old game, but it's aged very well. The music is great, and there's so much in this game that's whimsical and funny. It's an adventure all the way through, with plenty of puzzles to solve and treasures to find. Another excellent game from Rare.. Absolutely fantastic, charming, balanced, direct, simple yet complex. Great soundtrack, graphics, characters, control, camera, jokes, everything in this game is great, it is one of the most enjoyable games for me. God tier of 3D platformers.. This Is a AWESOME AND GREAT GAME,with a nice soundtrack,Simple Story and characters and,most of all THAT IT WAS MADE BY **** the camera IS JUST SO BAD AND REALLY STINKS,but i give a pass for the camera.still A VERY COOL AND FUN GAME ON THE N64 :D. I did love everything about this game. I did compare it to Mario 64 a lot, which Mario 64 is still a better game in my opinion. In Banjo, I felt like I got lost a bit, but the game was still fun. It looked great and I still like it today. I played it a few years ago on Xbox when it was released, before the Rare Replay that came out. Still had fun with it.. The thing Is I like this game but not as much as mario 64. But this game is still great. the graphics look outstanding for the time and really makes you think outside of the box when you look for things. Yes this game is a collect-a-thon but it is not as tedious as dk64. Because you play as one guy but it is still fun. The game has nine levels with different themes which makes them feel different and makes you think ""Oh I wonder what the next level will be."" And the moveset is spot on getting more complex as the game goes on. But the best part is anyone can play this game today I know this because I have no nostalgia for this game. But the only thing I hate about this game is that it is too simple. I mean if you are good your adventure will only be 7 hours. And rusty bucket bay ****. But with that in mind Banjo Kazooie is still fun and you should give it a go. I give this game a 9/10. It is very simple, has a kid friendly story, and can be remembred even in 30XX.. It's an incredibly amazing game with charming characters, amazing levels, and much to do! While, it's not the best game out there, it's probably in my opinion the best N64 game you can get! If you're the type of person who wishes Mario 64 was a bit more better, than this game is your type of game! Highly recommended.. Honestly I never finished this **** game cause of how much **** there is to do in it. While similar because it's a platform, the game is entirely different than Super Mario 64.. Easily one of the best platformer games of all time. Banjo Kazooie is an excellent example of a new take on the basic platformer genre that Mario popularized. It has some similarities to Mario 64 but it has its own identity and improves on Mario 64 in most ways. The story is basic but it does a great job of always pulling you forward and making you want to see what is next. It rewards progression in multiple ways and the game gets better and better the further you get. The characters are funny, iconic and memorable. The idea of playing as a bird and bear seems silly but it makes sense in the context of the bizarre cartoony world. The game is challenging but rewarding and the variety of gameplay makes every section a joy to experience. I recommend this game to anyone who loves 3d platformers. The gameplay is easily some of the best on the N64, aside from some camera issues (which was a problem with 64 games in general) almost all the controls are simple and intuitive. The sheer number of moves you can perform stretched the limits of the N64 control to the limit. As you progress through the game you gain new skills at a steady pace and each one is rewarding, allowing you to explore the world more fully. At the time of its release I can't think of any games that allowed you to do more. You can fly, swim, and transform into many different forms and each one changes gameplay in a meaningful way. The game also does collectibles right. In a lot of games collectibles do little more than act as a way of keeping score or letting you progress but in Banjo Kazooie all of the collecting has an impact on gameplay and the more you collect the more you will be rewarded later in the game. It is the right level of challenge and reward. There aren't many boss battles unfortunately but the final boss is one of the most challenging and entertaining that I have seen in a game. My only major complaint about the gameplay is that the controls are a bit loose, which can make precise movement of the character very frustrating at times. The story is nothing to write home about but it is still better than any Mario story that I can think of. The characters are entertaining and Gruntilda is iconic and hilarious. As the game progresses she continually taunts you and you learn more details from her sister about just how disgusting she is. The story progresses pretty constantly as you make your way through the witches tower and Gruntilda continuously comments on how annoyed she is with your progress. The build up is very satisfying. Most people don't play platformers for the story but it helps to have one that is at least somewhat enjoyable and gives a sense of progress. The world is easily one of the best on the N64. There are 9 main world and a fairly large hub world that connects them all together in a fun way. Gruntila's Lair offers enough of a linear path that it makes climbing the tower satisfying while also providing some options for exploration. The game is mostly linear but because of how worlds are unlocked you don't need to do everything in a specific order. Sometimes if you reach a tough spot it is best to move on and come back when you have upgraded Banjo-Kazooie's abilities. It offers a great mix of freedom and direction. In terms of the design of each world, every one offers something unique in appearance, gameplay and even character interactions. The character interactions are usually nothing special but there are a few that do enough to make you love or hate the characters you meet in a motivational way. In general the worlds also get progressively better and more challenging which is rewarding. The final world is definitely the most unique and that really made it special. The visuals were definitely some of the best on the N64 and in my opinion it is far more interesting visually than Super Mario 64 was. The soundtrack is not exactly emotionally moving but it is very fun and full of memorable themes. Nearly two decades later I still remember a lot of the music. The sound design isn't as good as a game like Ocarina of Time but it is still some of the best of its time. Sound effects are very effective and mostly appealing, except for when they are intended not to be such as captain blubbers voice. Banjo-Kazooie raised the bar for 3d platformers and even after nearly 20 years I struggle to find games in the genre that are its equal. I tried replaying it on the Xbox in more recent years and it still holds up really well. It is a benchmark game that helped redefine the platformer genre. It has great visuals, amazing gameplay, meaningful collectibles, lots of secrets, dozens of unique ideas, top level production values and a ton of content. I give Banjo Kazooie: 87% Gameplay - 9 Story Progression - 6 World - 10 Uniqueness/Ideas - 9 Characters - 7 Visual Design - 10 Sound Design - 8 Length/Amount of Content - 9 Immersion - 9 X-Factor - 10. An absolute masterpiece. It's got that old Rare charm and polish, and looks incredible for an n64 game. It even looks pretty damn good to this day. The characters are witty and well developed, and the collect-a-thon gameplay incredibly addicting. The 1:1 control of Banjo even rivals the likes **** such as Mario 64. All of that without even mentioning Grant's beautiful composition in each and every song in the game. If you're at all a fan of platformers this is certainly a game you should check out.. Usually I give Nintendo","the story in Banjo Kazooie is far less generic than Super Mario 64, which continues the worn out plot of Bowser kidnapping Peach . since this game is more difficult since you have to get 2 different things from a world, it doesn't need boss fights to be engaging . the sounds this game makes are the funniest ."
149.The Sims,"It made a difference in the gaming **** was really exciting to do things in this universe that you couldn't do in real life. When I first played it, I lost track of time.. My childhood vibes have come! Oh I spent hours in this game... I would like to try it now. I wonder if I would enjoy it as much now.... Iconic and revolutionary, it's a very good game with some limitations that made it a little tedious late game. Difficult to get all options because of the DLC politic. Also fun to play as a house builder. As the first of series, the sims 1 do have some flaws, but over all it's okay, some features can only found in this game, and people like me still finding some tricks and funny animations in the vanilla game. Sure the score is affected by my childhood memories, but not too much. 7/10. add extra 1 score for my childhood memories. 8/10 final.. The Sims surely a mind blowing games. We just remembered playing tamagotchi, Pokemon etc But now we play a human being with all them needs. One of the best games concept and experienced on its era.. a fun computer simulation. The game series went to a horrible pay to win direction but whatever. This game should get a 10! It was released over two decades ago and marked an entire generation. Everyone knows The Sims. Everyone who owned a computer in the early 2000s might have played. I remember I had such a bad computer when I was young, I even deleted files in Windows 95 to play The Sims. The Sims was one of the most remarkable games in the history of computers!. Huge sims fan and remember when this first came out. Spent hours on this but not easy to manage everything as you can expect.. The Sims. The beginning of the great series of life simulator. It is amazing. This is amazing. You are an ordinary person playing the life of an ordinary person, and it's interesting. Of course, you can easily become a superstar or a great sorcerer, but these are little things.. The Sims is an iconic piece of gaming history. Though its isoThe Sims is an iconic piece of gaming history. Though its isometric fake-3D world may not appeal to gamers today, its charm lives on and its playability remains in tact.. the game that started it all! sure it hasn't aged well but it is 21 years old and thats to be expected (my car is 25 years old and it gets the job done lets just say). they'res still a nice amount of custom contents available online and depending on what kind of simmer you are you might just get a few clothing items or get objects, skins, walls, floors and more. It's best enjoyed when you take it as seriously as possible or you take it as UN-seriously as possible! or at least in my experience. The base game isn't much to write home about but expansion packs add more fun stuff to play around with, the sims was revolutionary then and even now can be respected for what it was, it may be 21 years old but dang i bet someone has been playing it constantly for 21 years (at least a few) i bet it'll live on for an extra 21 years too.. I fell in love with The Sims as a child. I spent tens and tens of hours playing this game. I was simply fascinated by the fact that I have the opportunity to create a sim, get him a house and then live my virtual life. It may sound silly, but in my opinion it worked and it was one of the best simulators I've ever played. The game has its own atmosphere and I just love the music that plays when creating a sim. In the game, after creating Sim, you have the opportunity to buy or build your house. Building a house is really great and I can imagine that a lot of people will play this game only through building houses than living virtual lives. Living life here is quite similar to the real one. You have to eat, drink, sleep, have fun, go to work and earn money. Just life, you just control it through the screen with the click of a mouse. Whether you enjoy it or not, you have to judge for yourself. I've heard that the game is enough for girls, but I personally enjoyed the game. Great game for me, which I recommend.. My favourite game back when it was released. It was such an unique experience, but also had its limitations. Great start to the formula.. A revolutionary game - best in its genre, which has drawn millions of players to the screens. One of the games that I played a lot in my childhood, and also a guilty pleasure because I wouldn't tell any friends that I enjoyed it so much xD. OVERALL - 89% Gameplay - 6/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 5/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 6/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 10/10 Unashamedly used this back when I was at school to make the girl I fancied fall in love with me. Certainly an original game unlike any other, a lot of fun.. I have played The Sims a few times as a kid, and I remember never getting bored with it. It has its charm, but the limitations of not dying of old age, there being no weekends make it shallow compared to Sims 2 and 3.. One of my favorite computer games ever! The sims is so fun, classic, and nostalgic for me as well. Although the graphics of the game aren't exactly spectacular compared to today's standards, the game is still impressively entertaining and fun. What more is there to say, it's a classic and it will always be an iconic and fun game for many generations to come.. I have so much memory with this game. The fact that this game was the first in the franchise and had this great fresh idea make it a masterpiece for me.. Why only 7.9 user score? This game was revolutionary. It's a simulation of everyday life. It's fun to create yourself in-game and even recreate your own house.. Just brilliant and unique game, great if you where a kids around this time!. It was revolution of gaming. I remember that everywhere were advertisement of this game. I played it with my cousins every day and every night it was so better than other games and more fun.. At the time this game was very good, however, it has not aged to badly. However as in every game there has to be some flaws. The graphics have not aged well and the objects are 3D, but the sims and the camera perspective are not the best. You are locked in around a 45 degree angle. The game is a blast though. Highly recommend!. man.. do i have great memories playing this game. it was such a unique and fun experience when it came out. it was just such a blast building your house, starting a career from scratch, and slowly improving the life for the sims, or destroying it - if that was your thing. to this day, I prefer it to the newer games in the series. it is just simple, relaxing fun.. Origin of the wellknown serie, which invented the whole new gaming genre. The idea of the game is great but in the end, the game is just too shallow or is the only meaning of the life to eat, sleep, work and having sex? But it is a solid base for improving as Maxis Games did with the following episodes.. This game was very different from the norm when it came out, Very fun and addictive to play even still to this day. Still worth a look in even if there is newer versions out.. Incredibly innovative game that captured the attention of even the most casual gamers. This game brought virtual pet to a whole new level: you are not managing a pet but families of human and you can even build your own house and live your dream in it. I think you can even say that this the game that broke the gender barrier. Without this game, there might not be as many female gamers as there are now.. Nostalgic as it is it is Sim 1's 16th year since being released. This game is proved that EA isn't fully all trash. This game is fun where you create people and your house and everything else this game is really awesome! Nostalgic is the word that it takes and keeps.. Easily the second best sims game in the sims series to date, and it even gets better when you have all of the expansions installed. Now the CAS is the simplest in the series, like there is no fitness level but who cares there are some awesome bodies and heads to chose. so what are you waiting for get the game now and if you cant find it at any store just pirate it with all of the expansions. A good game for its time. It also created a whole new genre. I remember playing it for 2 weeks with 1 character in a small house who would learn stuff quickly and progress thru jobs with the only difficulty of getting more friends for promotions. Soon you find out that sleeping is not needed and you can just drink Espresso 3 times in a row and visit VC instead of a night sleep. After I reached the best job and was earning $1k per day, and sold my paintings a couple hundred bucks each while at the same time increasing ""fun"" need - the game was won or something. I tried a married couple, then 8 guys all sleeping in the simplest beds and working as construction workers - and that was it. Unfortunately, for a gamer, this game gets boring after 1 or 2 playthroughs. As it turned out years later, this game became extremely popular among women and girls because they could build a doll house there, buy furniture, choose wallpapers etc. And more importantly - play with ""relations"" between these characters (who are all very ordinary, mediocre people), and make babies. Unfortunately (for male players) that's the direction in which this game evolved later: more furniture, more wallpapers, more relations, more babies, more parties, and again, more junk you can buy for the house etc. The first Sims game can be played as an optimization game where, e.g. you try to reach the best job in minimal time, or build the best house in minimal time or whatever, like in an economic simulator. The other games in the series with all their expansions aren't really games. They are doll houses for girls and glorify suburban mediocrity.. I grew up with this game. I played it for years and years and years. I loved every moment even if EA published it. If you want to get into the Sims now and understand why it has a place in the hearts of many, then definetely consider buying this title.. Playing The Sims is a unique experience. In my opinion, neither the competitors nor the 2, 3 and 4 sequels have caught the perfect, rounded formula the original Sims had. Newer versions are more fancy but gameplay was way better and faster in that game.. The game is a classic, and still holds up to this day. The game is very dated, and there is a distinct lack of good cheats, but it is entertaining when you get down to it. The gameplay is entertaining, but keeping the Sims happy can be frustrating, since there is always something going on. The houses, the music and the characters are very memorable by Sims standards. Playing with all Expansion Packs is a great experience and there are so many unique things in the expansions. The base game is lacking in content by itself. Despite this, the game has a timeless look and the fact that the game isn't in 3D keeps the textures from becoming ugly with time. The technical aspects of the game are lacking; the game does not work on all systems, the game is susceptible to stop working after system updates, and installing the Expansion Packs is an absolute chore that can **** out several hours of your time. Overall, the game is a great classic, that holds up quite well, but getting it to work is a chore, and the game might not even work, but it is worth it, at least to me.. What can I say about this? it's a boring game with no gameplay at all, no story whatsoever and no lines as the characters are so **** that they ""speak"" worse than a australopitecus, what's the purpose of this? you get there and play a ""real life"" when you already have a real life? nonsense, why would I play that I'm eating at home or taking a piss? I can do it in real life and it's nothing exciting. This game is a waste of time and money and it's just for those girls who like barbies and overthink about marriage stuff. Definitely one of the worst games I ever play (and I've been playing since Atari 2600 was out there).. It's magic, it's fun, it's... awesome. It's one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics might be old, but gameplay is incredible. It is and will always be the best game of the series. Period.. The Sims is a bit fun, but not my kind of thing. There are, however, TONS and I mean TONS of ways to torture your Sims, and their reactions are priceless in fast forward. Wherever you like to be nice to them, and build a society, or just straight up torture them, you'll probably enjoy the game.. I absolutely hated it. I was so excited for this as it was being developed by Maxis. But, my one and only full night really trying to love this game was a disaster. It was depressing. Get up, barely make it to work. Get home, barely make it to bed. This is already my life. Why on EARTH would I play this? I'll give it a 6 since it had few bugs and the underlying system was well-constructed. But, I really disliked playing this game.. The Sims is an incredible simulation that can be played by anyone. It's very fun to create a family and run their lives. There is a lot of customization with creating a person from choosing clothes and a face to selecting their personality. There are a lot of options with making a house and furnishing it, and I find making the house the most fun part. After playing someone's life for a while it can get a little repetitive. They just go to work everyday without much change except promotions here and there to make more money and then you can keeping upgrading your house, but it takes a lot more time to build your house bigger and buy fancier things. The Sims is amazing and it will always be a great game to play for anyone.. The Sims 1 + all expansions is the best Sims. It's addictive, has infinite replay value, the soundtrack is fantastic, the AI is revolutionary. Just a revolutionary amazing game.. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 7 out of 10, Fun: 9 out of 10, Controls: 7 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 7 out of 10, Length: 9 out of 10, Re-play: 8 out of 10, Value: 8 out of 10. i remember playing it when it was released, and still dont get it... mechanics of the game where bad, to say the least(eat, s***, wash, or sleep? cant do it all since it all takes about same ammount of time) i believe it was a first try for drm **** could buy stuff like say a lamp for additional money....(real money) all that aside, and the mechanics (hopefully??) fixed today, its still not more(or less) than an interactive dollhouse. now, thats fine, and i wont judge ppl who like it, but i guess im just not the right recipent. its for girls and generally more casual gamers(which is fine, really) so i never got to like it very much....(since im neither nor) after building my place, i usually quit and had no motivation to look back. id have loved to see an implementation, a mix if you want, of both the sims and sim city, maybe there were plans for that, but **** ea.... 5/10. The Sims is a revolution in the gaming world. Never before had we could not control the family, build houses, and Organize party. I have to admit that I liked this idea. And although in 2000 arose game with better graphics, it just Sims was not needed. Pleasant to saw on Computer fellows in isometric projection. Cool was also the Simlish language that was incomprehensible mix of several languages. The only thing in this game I did not like is the limited ability to create Sims. Then Sims came only in the world of games so I can forgive them Music listening is really nice. And as for expansions-as opposed to The Sims 3 all expansions for The Sims 1 gave a lot of revolutionary changes and objects. This is a really cool and fun game.. Very fun and addictive game. Can be quite hard from the beginning, but gets easy after a while. Maxis did a great job on this and this will forever be a classic game. Even in 2013 I still play it sometimes when I'm bored.. So it's been 13 years since this game was released and I've just set up a Metacritic account, I've decided for The Sims to be my first review because I am fairly excited for The Sims 4. So, what is this game like? Well it is a very difficult life simulation game by Maxis/EA. When I first saw this game, I was awful at it, my Sims kept on starving because I didn't know how to make money, but I still fairly enjoyed it. I've been playing it recently and although I know I can take care of my Sims by telling them what to do next, they just tend to do what they need to do themselves, besides sleep in the nice comfy bed I placed upstairs. The enjoyable features of The Sims for me are making the Sims and building the homes in which they live in. Their is the part where you control them but to me it seems a bit tedious and boring and irritatingly difficult without cheating. But the problem is is that the controlling of your Sims is the main part of the game and when your Sims can almost take care of themselves and when the gameplay is almost too difficult and and slightly boring, it takes away most of the fun. I'm giving this game a 3 out of 10 because as I mentioned previously the Create-a-Sim mode and Buy/Build modes are fun, but the game is about simulating the Sims and I just can't enjoy it enough to like it.. With more interactions this game should have been the game of the year 2000.. Very good gameplay, almost innovative for its times. The bad points are the graphics and the performance, since the graphics **** and you still get low FPS on low end PCs (such as PCs of its times). The sound is really boring, except for some tracks. Overall, it's a mediocre game, which could be even better, since the idea was good.. The Sims is an iconic piece of gaming history. Though its isometric fake-3D world may not appeal to gamers today, its charm lives on and its playability remains in tact.. Fun at first, but quickly became boring. Beyond sending your sims to work and making sure they don't crap themselves, there is very little to do except expand your house. You don't need a big house for any practical purposes, so to me the game seems kind of... pointless.. One of my favorite games of all time.. This was the begining of the Best Selling PC game franchise and World Record smasher, The Sims. Im happy with the start and will always be a classic game to remember, even though graphics wasnt good, but ey. It was number one!! :). What you have here is one of the most addicting games ever made. You have so much freedom and control over everything that it is impossible to get bored of it.. I am so departed from this game's audience, that I fail to understand the target demographic's attraction to what is essentially a mix of 'barbie' and 'whatever soap you choose to make it'. This is one of the few games I cannot be objective about. Nothing struck me as insightful, engaging, entertaining, fun, progressive, or meaningful. I guess it was original for it's time. And that has to count for something. Right?",the sims 1 is a very good game with some limitations that made it a little tedious late game . the game series went to a horrible pay to win direction but whatever . it was released over two decades ago and marked an entire generation .
15.NFL 2K1,"nice videogame for dreamcast that i played with my cousin at that time, long time ago. The best football game ever made. Sega Sports is way better than EA Sports.. this game deserves better reviews, its definitely one of the best sports game ever made. A really great football game, and definitely better than the Maddens coming out on the 64 and PS1 at the time, especially graphically.. It good and look good for a game that came out when Halo CE was a thing of the future. The historical first console game to feature online multiplayer that allowed players to compete against non-local opponents.. This was the game that made me buy a dreamcast which turned out to be the only game. It was that good I remember going into a BB store and seeing this on the isle. I played it for an hour. It was closing time so I bought it and played it all night. What was cool was that it looked like a TV game. Their are voice overs, cutaways and such. I was used to the older 2d style. This blew me away. It was a system seller.. Best madden game ever! **** that the sequels barely innovated, and that a bunch of stupid trolls are trying to lower the user score.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10/10 amazing. the best football game of all time and one of the most fun games of all time. 1501501501501501501501501501501501501501501501501501500150. amazing. the best madden game of all time and one of the most fun games of all time. don't mind the trolls who rate it low just to rate it low.,.,.,.,. Where did this idea that ""sports game can't be considered legitimately good"" come from? The amount of prejudice towards this game is ridiculous. The critics loved it. Don't get your shorts in a knot just because they happened to love a sports game. Can their opinions not always reflect the opinions of the general gaming population? Yes, but you should play the game before determining for yourself if that's the case. And for the record, many people love sports games (which makes sense, given how many viewers tune in to watch various sports, it should come as no surprise that a few of them are also gamers that would like to play games that represent the sport and are fun). The people giving these prejudiced 0 scores do not represent the general populace at all.. OK, I haven't played the game. But the fact that at least 2 people rated it a 0 just to pull it down is stupid. I am not very interested in sports games. I wouldn't have rated it if it weren't for the fact that the results got skewed by some idiots.. I don't see why the user score is so low. Amazing passing, very addicting and fun! egyfwafkuerafhbelsufjbfjlhes,fbkjhsbfjkhesgfbdksfghjbdsfbhkdjsfhbdjhfsduofjdsh. NFL 2K1 is one of the greatest football games of all-time. Great graphics, incredible presentation and animations that were years ahead of the Madden franchise. A true classic.","a really great football game, and definitely better than the maddens coming out on the 64 and PS1 at the time . the amount of prejudice towards this game is ridiculous . don't get your shorts in a knot just because they happened to love a sports game ."
151.Celeste,"The best 2D Platformer ever made. Celeste succeeds in every category, big and small, and has no shortcomings. It has a beautiful soundtrack, clear and colourful 8-bit visuals and a concise and inoffensive story. The real star of the show is, of course, the platforming. Very few games can touch this one. Its an interesting flip on contemporaries like Mario, where instead of the player having a complex collection of abilities and powerups, the complexity is actually in the level design. Madeline has a small list of useful abilities: she can jump, dash, and climb. That's it. And yet it is in this simple set of tools that the player is tasked with mastering their movement, against some incredibly inventive and tough levels. And I mean very tough. You will die thousands of times on some of these levels. And yet, unlike other challenging games, Celeste avoids feeling frustrating. You respawn immediately, and lose very little progress when you die. You have infinite lives. Most of the challenging levels are optional, and there is even an assist mode if you need it. Celeste is one of those challenging games which does not overcomplicate things with a million different abilities and stats; instead it hands you a small collection of tools and demands perfection from you to see all the game has to offer. Overcoming these tough challenges is intensely satisfying, and makes for one of the most fun games in recent history. Maybe ever. If you are a fan of platformers, or just good games in general, play Celeste.. I have had an absurd amount of fun in this game. I have 100%ed it, replayed it, and 100%ed it again. I love the difficulty and have never gotten overly aggravated while playing. I 100% recommend you to play it.. Celeste is a amazing game It's cool Why He is Addictive And there is your difficult He He has THE Amazing message. This game is absolutely a masterpiece. I don’t care what anybody says. The soundtrack is so good I would listen to it for hours and not get bored. I’ve beaten the entire game not including farewell like 5 times and I never got bored. This game is pretty hard and it’s not for everybody and takes some SKILL but it’s a good challenge for me. People compare this game to Metroidvania games like hollow knight and give it a 0 because its”movement is like a turd”or they give it a low rating because it’s too hard, but its supposed to be a hard, challenging game. It even has a feature where you get to make it as easy as you want and every bad review never talks about it. Overall is a hidden gem game and the soundtrack is amazing. A very fun platformer with lovable charcters and an engaging narrative. The main charcters struggle with anxiety and self doubt hit me pretty hard. It insirpied me to contiue the climb and set out to achieve what I saught to achieve despite all the distractions and set backs along the way.. Faultless mechanics, genius level design, hard but fair difficulty, great story, silky smooth gameplay, and a musical score that is absolutely stellar. The only fault I can find is it's too short and was just begging for more in the end. This is without doubt one of the indie gems and will go down as a classic along with n++, meatboy, isaac, shovel knight and gungeon.. I loved it!I think it's one of the best I've played.I started speedrunning on it and it's aberrant the speed at which I can complete levels that took me hours the first few times.. Great platformer. I loved that you could ""beat"" any room you entered and didn't have to backtrack because you unlocked a new ability that now allows you to finish previously unbeatable rooms. It forces you to think and experiment because you know it is solvable, you just don't know how.. An indie modern classic. Celeste is a speedy platformer that rewards the player for their effort put into the platforming, and stays on pace with the player as they get better at the game. The music is beautiful, the plot is well thought out, the level design spot on. The difficulty of the game definitely excludes everybody from being able to appreciate it, but there are very good accessibility options for those who want a more casual playthrough.. I've never been so simultaneously pissed and euphoric in my entire life. this game is so gorgeous, the themes are amazing, the music is amazing, the difficulty is brutal, everything about this game is just amazing. took me 6 damn months to clear summit C-side btw that stage was my hell.. The best platformer I've ever played. The music, the design, the gameplay, the plot - everything in this game is great.. Released in its final version in 2018, Celeste is one of the most critically acclaimed indie games in videogame history, it is mostly praised for its touching story, fluid gameplay, great level design and soundtrack. Like many other great indie games such as Undertale, and Hollow Knight, Celeste isn't about being a huge game with hundreds of hours of content, extremely complex gameplay, and a story with thousands of plot twists. Instead, the developer and publisher of the game ""Maddy Makes Games” wanted a simpler game, with a more personal touch to it, but that had a bigger impact on people. Initially, Celeste was developed in PICO-8 for a game jam in 2015. The game itself wasn't very big or complex due to the limitations of PICO-8 but also due to the devs’ limited time. However, this early version of the game made 3 years before its definitive release already included Celeste's core mechanics, main character and somewhat similar level design. From then on, the devs began developing a full game based on what they had already created, giving us Celeste only 3 years later. Celeste's core story revolves around Madeline, the character we play as, trying to deal with her inner struggles, when she decides to climb the Celeste Mountain. The player then has to go through many levels, each one presenting new challenges and gameplay mechanics. The mountain in the game is clearly an allegory for Madeline's struggles, and her process of climbing the mountain is the way overcomes them. The genius part of this plot is that it not only applies to the main character, but the players themselves may see their struggles in the game and relate to the main character even more. The story however is not the only aspect that makes this game standout, since the gameplay is also another defining factor in this game. The core movement of the game consists of moving left and right, jumping, and dashing. But don't get fooled if you think this is an easy game, because it is not, and will punish you a lot before you master the controls but not in a frustrating way, since there are lots of checkpoints throughout the levels, so you won't need to go 5 minutes back whenever you die. And the difficulty in Celeste not only creates a great gameplay, but also compliments the story by showing that not all problems can be overcome easily. Celeste definitely is a masterpiece that shaped the way indie games are being created by giving us a profound story that matches its gameplay challenges, while at the same time giving us relatively simple controls that are hard to master, but without being extremely frustrating to the point where you will want to quit the game. Instead, the difficulty motivates you to beat the game, while at the same time offering the player a ""calm” experience, that may also be relatable for many people who are going through or have gone through a similar experience of struggle.. This is THE best platformer I've ever played but it Is very challenging for some people luckily there is an assist mode for people who just want the story or aren't the best platformers, but if you love platformers and don't really care for the story (that is really good I don't know why you would skip it) you can always skip the cutscenes. Overall, this game is an absolute masterpiece and a must-play 10/10 for me, there is also a free DLC that's extra challenging -TNT, 2024. My favorite game, the audio is wonderfull the gameplay is perfect and i lived th story. 100/100. I recently finished the game and it is a masterpiece. The platforming is creative, yet difficult, and the pixel art creates a stunning visual masterpiece. The story is great, and the movement feels very fluid. Each level is always just barely possible, and is is incredibly satisfying and rewarding to complete. The one tiny fault that I have with the game is the the controls aren't great on a keyboard, so a controller is highly recommended.. This game is perfect. Has such beautiful visuals, amazing movement, and a deep emotional story. This game is so sastifying to beat and is one of the best 2D platformers you could ever play. This game will have you addicted from start to finish.. Celeste, in my opinion, the best indie game in history so **** game is simply perfect, indie games are evolving so much that they go head to head with AAA games.Celeste is a game that discusses many topics about anxiety and depression, with very deep dialogues, and making the player reflect on his own life and encouraging him to overcome his biggest challenges. Celeste is a perfect game, rating 10/10.. best 2d platformer. It is gameplay is so good and it has new idea on it,and a great art style.. Beautiful story and characters, buttery smooth controls and overall gameplay, stunning pixel art and the music... Oh, the music... This game is an actual masterpiece. I love it so much, it. This game is a masterpeice. In a catalog of games so expansive as 2D platformers, it's often difficult to stand out and create something new and exciting. This game does it. It's fast and each level is so well thought out. The game can be difficult, but is fair and well balanced. Additonally the story isn't amazing, but it's a cute simple story about a stubborn girl who wants to climb a mountain. My only issue is the difficulty spike. At the end of the game you are given the opportunity to unlock one final post game level. Unfortunetaly I think 00.1% players unlocked that because in order to do that, you need to collect 4 peices of heart which are only obtainable by beating these tuff as nails levels. These levels aren't just kind of hard either, if an average level is a solid 9/10 difficulty the heart peice levels are a solid 15-17/10. They are difficult, and unforgiving. Lastly even if you do complete the 4 levels and unlock the final level you are greated with a level that isn't as difficult and is like a 8/10 difficulty. That seems like a knit pick seeing as it's all for the most part post game.. Amazing... Just amazing, there really isn't much anything to say about this game. Did you know you can't delete a review on metacritic? awesome isn't it? hahaha. I wrote correct review on this game for PC. Overall, it’s a very good game. The gameplay is fun, the difficulty increases progressively, and you gain new abilities with each chapter, the difficulty increases gradually, which is really well done. . The side quests bring you back to certain levels, adding to the experience. However, the only downside is the story: it’s cheesy, with bland characters and a clichéd ""friendship power"" theme. The dialogues are long and uninteresting. If you’re playing just for the gameplay, go ahead and buy it. It's often on sale, and you’ll enjoy it for about a week.. Celeste is a great platformer, with a very simplistic pixel art style. It may not attract you and it can feel very difficult at the beginning, however, if you can pass the second chapter, you will be hooked up. I died hundreds of times, but never felt frustrated and the game is so easy that it made met finish it. The story and its focus on metal health are simply outstanding.. Celeste is a very remarkable 2D platform game, the art, the different worlds, the music and more make it an indie game to talk about. It is a game that pushes the mechanics to the limit and makes them very good. I think this game is very good and you should try it. This game is the best of all time at least for me. The story is gripping, the music always manages to amplify he gameplay and story. The gameplay is also snappy and responsive. 10/10 I cannot truly express how mush i love this game. An excellent platform game which still tells a very beautiful story in the long term, I loved it and I recommend it to everyone. just feels so nice to play this even if it's hard at times. smooth controls, simple and charming artstyle coupled with a story about self-acceptance is a delight.. One of the best platform games I ever played. There are so many layers of complexity and secrets that make this game even playable after you finish it for more than one time! Ever time I come back to this I discover something new and have fun as if it was the first time playing. Game mechanics are absolute perfect and precise. Soundtrack is something else! Absolute banger! Listen to it every day, on the commute, working, etc. Really recommend, worth each penny!. This game is one of the rare games that is so incredibly well made, I feel the need to write a review. The game is incredibly well written with many interesting characters to add extra charm. The 9 levels are all extremely challenging, but each one is well thought out. Most bad reviews will complain about difficulty. Overall the games flaws are almost nonexistent and the game may be too difficult for newer gamers.. Celeste is such a well crafted and designed game, its really fun and offers a lot of replay value with the golden berries and many secrets. The speedrunning is addicting and so is the beautifully crafted story. It shows the struggles of mental health and how to overcome them, this game has brought lots of joy and heartfelt moments to many people. Also, most say this game helped with mental struggles. The main character being a transgender helps people cope with knowing that they aren't alone when it comes LGBTQ. Also, I got a 47:25 speedrun. The 2D platforming is smooth and makes you want to continue playing, while also keeping it difficult. It stays difficult, but you respawn at the start of each screen. Beating and playing this game for the first time is something I'm very sad a can't experience anymore, but also something I'm glad I experienced. Thanks for reading!. A fairly good platformer but the reward is not worth the effort unfortunately. I'm not a big fan of the art style or mental health-associated story. The game is preposterously difficult and it seriously hurts my fingers and forearms. I generally need to stop playing after a few hundred deaths (or around 5-10 minutes) and play Doom 2016 to unwind because this game fills me with a hateful rage that only heavy metal fueled demon slaying can quell. Celest is the best Jump and Run game I ever played and the music is awseome. The Artstyle just perfect.. This is not a bad game, it has a modest visual and sound, although they are performed harmoniously. But the gameplay will be fully enjoyed only by those who like to physically memorize every movement of the route on a specific section and repeat it dozens of times before success (at least if you want to master 100% of the content). If you skip about half, you can run through the plot and improvise, but it's not too much fun to skip half of the game, because it can only be completed in the only way, or not in any way, and all this is not with the most responsive controls and average accuracy of hitboxes. It works great on **** story is OK, the atmosphere will do, the gameplay is not good for everyone, and this is the main drawback of this game. Even though my skill is above average in games, I couldn't have as much fun as I was promised by those who gave it 10/10. If you like everything I described above, it's 8/10, but if not, then no more than 6.5/10.. I think it’s an overrated game. The music and story are fine, but the graphics are dull. I feel like it constantly shifts from being fun to really annoying and frustrating, which detracts from the overall experience. Even though there are 8 chapters with different appearances and characters, it mostly revolves around the same concept: finding a way out and collecting as many cherries as possible along the way, along with the videotape if you want to increase the challenge. I also find the controls to be a bit ‘loose.’ I often feel that Celeste doesn’t move the way I want her to. While there are good moments throughout the game, I don’t think it deserves the high rating it has received.. One of the best platformers of all time. Amazing levels, mechanics, story, characters and music.. This game is soo good but its not as hard as people say it is (me bragging about easily beating the game). This game is amazing. Must play. This game tells an amazing and emotional story. The parkour and platforming is also amazing. This game also has a LOT of replay value. A truly fantastic game. The gameplay is just a lot of fun, the music is great, the story is well told and interesting, and the graphics are pretty. The length of the main game (playing to the credits) is just right, in my opinion, and doesn't get unnecessary long, like I think several other games do. In addition, there is a ton of extra challenges that can keep players interested for a long time.. perfect video game, also has good replay value and opportunity for speedrunning. What can I say that hasn't already been said? it's a masterpiece.. An incredibly challenging yet fair platformer that finds a way to introduce a compelling, emotional journey for players.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 16,444 death for full achievement. 10 score if adding maps on banana. 1-7a extremely fun; 7c&9abc so torturous.. Yeahhhh it's nearly perfect. This is unfortunately my current favorite 2-D platformer. It's just so fun exploring every chapter and collecting as many strawberries as I can. Replaying this game is still such a blast with such intuitive platforming controls and a fun story. I will say, I would give it an 8/10 for its simplicity, but the story and themes I took from this game left me utterly surprised and it was something I did not expect to get from here. Overall, it's a great game. A near-perfect one if the price was just lower as I don't tink there's enough content to warrant a $35 price tag. However, I have spent a long time playing this game so I'm unsure.... Maybe the worst experience I ever had playing a game. This game has frustrating gameplay and uncooperative controls. The visuals and art style fail to compensate for glaring design flaws. The narrative themes of self-discovery and perseverance fall flat with clichéd storytelling. There is a punishing difficulty curve undermines any sense of enjoyment or accomplishment. The overall experience can leave players feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. I do see the value in a game like this but it needed to be presented better.. Literally a perfect game. I don't know how that's possible. There's nothing that could be changed about it to make it any better.. Celeste seems to have somewhat of a marmite quality. The game is a solidly designed, difficult precision platformer. The story, theming and music is what elevates this game for me however. The story follows Madeline as she climbs a mountain in order to confront her mental health problems. The game effortlessly combines its varied gameplay mechanics with its theming. The wind blowing against you is a metaphor for Madeline's mental anguish, the more maze-like levels designed to give you a sense of claustrophobia, a chase sequence involving your own shadow etc. I also found Madeline very relatable personally. These are the aspects that make me love this game, but if they don't appeal to you, there is still a great platformer game to be enjoyed here.. Celeste surprised me with it's difficulty. I played this after completing Super Mario Odyssey, which was pretty easy, but this game is harder than I expected. But it is not frustrating: rather, it challenges you to push your limits in carefully crafted levels. Thoughtful level design, good soundtrack and variety in traversal makes this a great platformer that is worth playing.. Gorgeous art style, and fluid gameplay. Heartwarming story. What more could you want?. Best 2D platformer I have played. Contains no combat, and manages to tell a concise, thoughtful story which only enhances the gameplay. Extremely creative levels, introduces a new concept and takes it to the nth degree very quickly.. While the story needs some work, The characters, music, and level design are all pretty good. making for an overall pretty good game. Best indie of all time though? have you guys even played 2017 indies??. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For pure platforming this is as good as it gets. It is so innovative and fun and clever and that's just the gameplay. The art style is simple but effective and awesome and the music is phenomenal. The story is great as advertised but it's a perfect game without that. Celeste is the best 2d side scrolling platformer of all time. I've played the game and DLC probably 5 times through and although I'll never 100% due to the difficulty it stands so tall I can't speak highly enough of it.. Genuine Triumph of a platformer with a great story about self and superb levels and atmosphere, music and charm. The game just lends itself so well to keeping going and trying to overcome so much while having a total vibe to it. Love the storytelling and levels around that along with charm. I wish more basic platformers did this with story, atmosphere and OST, this is awesome.. For what it is, it's amazing. It offers a fairly deep story and has amazing platforming. I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this, since I don't usually like challenging games (demon's souls, elden ring, hollow knight, etc.). Really loved this game and I would absoulutely recommend it if you haven't played it.. It's crazy how most people who disliked this game just think it's too difficult. This game is incredible, its musics, its gameplay, its game design... The best thing is that you can play it as long as you want because of the mods, 10/10. Incredible. Keeps getting better throughout. Farewell in particular masterfully controls your emotions as you progress. Playing though farewell was the best gaming experience I can remember, can't recommend it enough.. One of the best 2d platforms ever made. The graphics are beautiful and give the world so much life and makes every level feel unique. The soundtrack is great and makes for great background sounds. The puzzles are made in such a brilliant way so that there is so much replay ability.. the best plataforming i ever played. This game has an incredible gameplay! There´s not much to talk about, but I can still point out that i got myself not knowing where to go quite some times... and I am not the guy who likes to watch guides, so that was very underwhelming.. Greatest controls for any video game I've ever played. This game is challenging, fun, and with a deep meaning, that will keep you glued to the screen for hours, celeste is my favorite indie game of all time, and i think will be dificulty to replace it.. Quite possibly the most fun modern day platformer (when it comes to pure platforming at the very least). The movement is fluid and clean, and it's levels are long enough to captivate you for hours on end. It's got challenges when it needs to, and I also happen to enjoy the Strawberry Jam mod, which I know isn't base game Celeste. But the creators of Celeste are allowing it which counts (plus the mod has a Mario Galaxy reference [the rose garden level in the beginner lobby] along a bunch of other Mario references).. Therapy.. A difficult but enjoyable platformer that rewards persistence and determination. The levels are extremely well designed and provide a good story for a platformer.. a tough game that encourages you to keep going, rome isnt built in a day after all, and that is celeste.. Celeste is one of the greatest platformers of all time. It is so tight and precise and fun! Every level is perfectly fine tuned, and the strawberries-- Oh the strawberries! They fit so seamlessly into the game, they are the perfect collectable! The story is just so heartfelt and meaningful, no matter where your at in life you can relate to Madeline. Her quest to climb to the top of the mountain for no reason other than to prove that she can, despite her panic attacks, it is just so real. I was invested within the first 5 minutes of playing. Loved it, climb a mountain and experience it without ever leaving the comfort of your bed. The best platformer I have ever played. The movement is very responsive and smooth, plus there is so much advanced tech in the game despite the basic movement only consisting of jump, dash and **** game also keeps encouraging you to keep on trying no matter how difficult the climb seems. And it DOES get ridiculously difficult as you progress. It is difficult, but it never feels unfair or unbeatable.. Definitely one of my favourite games of all time. Very responsive, easy to learn hard to master movement that gets more fun the more you play. The game is good for both beginner players and hardcore players. The DLC is one of the hardest gaming feats I’ve completed and feels fantastic to comeplete. Get the game. Just get the game. Beautiful story, amazing soundtrack, and fantastic level design. One of my favourite games of all time. I'm not going to talk about the story, or the control, or the art, or the music of the game. There are a few games that you don't know because they connect with you from the first moment. Video game ratings are always subjective to us, to our experiences, and even to the moment we play the games. I connected with Madeline from the first minute and I had an experience that reminds me that I still love video games.. I think celeste is an amazing game depending if you like story or gameplay. as either way you can skip the story or you can skip the gameplay (with assist mode). anyways I love this game I have 140 hours on it.. its a great game, it has great graphics, excellent game design, and an enticing narrative, its exploration of mental health is refreshing, and I enjoyed it. However, it is VERY HARD, I gave up on chapter 9, cuz i died like 1300< times. In 3 words, Hard but Great.. Celeste is a game that excels in providing a delightful and responsive control scheme, making it a joy to play. The tight and precise controls allow players to execute complex maneuvers with ease, giving a sense of fluidity and control over the protagonist, Madeline. Whether it's climbing walls, dashing through obstacles, or performing precise jumps, the controls in Celeste feel incredibly satisfying. The game strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and depth, ensuring that players of all skill levels can enjoy the smooth and responsive gameplay. The mechanics in Celeste are brilliantly crafted, offering a wide range of abilities and challenges that keep players engaged throughout their journey. The core mechanic of the game revolves around Madeline's ability to perform a mid-air dash, which adds an extra layer of complexity and creativity to the platforming sequences. The game introduces new mechanics gradually, allowing players to master each one before moving on to the next. The mechanics in Celeste are not just gimmicks; they are cleverly integrated into the level design, creating a cohesive and immersive gameplay experience. One of Celeste's standout features is its challenging difficulty that manages to be both tough and rewarding. The game presents players with increasingly complex platforming sections that require precise timing and quick thinking. While the difficulty can be daunting, Celeste adopts a fair and forgiving approach. The game encourages experimentation and learning from mistakes, providing frequent checkpoints and quick respawns. Overcoming a particularly challenging section or collecting a particularly difficult strawberry feels incredibly rewarding, fueling a sense of accomplishment that drives players to keep pushing forward. Celeste's difficulty is finely tuned to strike the perfect balance between frustration and triumph, creating a deeply satisfying and gratifying gameplay experience.. dying 10,000 times was fun :D Celeste is one of the best platformers I've ever played maybe best. Just play and experience this.. This is a amazing game, wonderful graphics, A M A Z I N G OST (thanks Lena Raine), beautiful story about depression, stress, anxiety… and the gameplay is also AMAZING, it’s fast, precise, and hard (yes, that’s a hard game) and I love it. I can’t say every amazing things about the game because I’d need a full book, so I’m going to stop here.. 2D platformer masterpiece. This is one of the best platformers that I've played. Amazing level design. It's a hard game but a very rewarding one and if you are stuck in a chapter you can turn on the assist mode. There are not a lot of characters, but each one has tons of personality. I finished all of the 7 A-sides and the first 4 B-Sides and I can assure you that this game is truly a huge challenge, yet a pretty funny and addictive one. Celeste is a memorable character struggling with anxiety and depression, so a lot of people could sadly identify with her and make the game more enjoyable.. Incredible game with a simple yet heartfelt and relatable story, all brought together with immaculate art and gorgeous soundtrack that gives way to one of the best 2D platformers ever made.. Best Indie Game of all time, the gameplay is so satisfying and the pixel world design is astonishing.. A work of indie mastery. Inspiration is taken from all the best 2D platformers of the past to create a truly modern title that constantly throws fresh ideas at the player that all work effortlessly. My expectations for future 2D platformer controls are sky-high after playing as Madeline for dozens of hours with her smooth and immensely satisfying jumping, dashing, and climbing. Collecting strawberries and hearts is always entertaining and fun, while completing B-Sides and C-Sides is always challenging and perfectly frustrating. A true modern masterpiece.. Celeste has probably the best platforming physics out of any 2d platformer. It's a simple game about climbing a mountain and it's story is also about climbing said mountain. The music is also awesome.. Amazing game but god did it make me want to break my switch into a million pieces. This game was so well designed it is probably the best game I ever played and since playing it I now own it on everything. It's just a game designers dream.. This game is a perfect balance between good gameplay and outstanding aesthetics. I finished it with 2600 deaths but I can guarantee you that I didn't raged any time, it is worth it, the message the game sends is very beautiful, i recommend it. Even though I am late for this game, I understand that it is almost a masterpiece, the visuals are the best that ive ever seen for pixel, the story and characters are perfect and the movement/mechanics are incredible. I loved playing chapter 1 - 8 and even doing some side Bs which were hard but very doable, because you would spawn very close. The chapter 9 though, I haven't finished it but it is way too hard with very long levels that are annoying. To continue my journey in chapter 9, I had to put assist mode on which I feel guilty doing, but I wanna know the end of the story.. Fantastic thought and clever design makes this tough as nails platformer undeniably enjoyable. A beautiful game that kept me trying over and over and OVER to get those strawberries. Couldn’t put it down! A must play!. An unfortunately disappointing experience that could not meet the expectations built up by numerous glowing reviews I had seen. While the game possesses tight controls and solid sound design, the main draw of the game - its themes and characters - felt ham","Celeste is the best 2D platformer ever made . it has a beautiful soundtrack, clear and colourful 8-bit visuals and a concise and inoffensive story . you will die thousands of times on some of these tough levels ."
152.Forza Motorsport (2005),"Here begins the best simulator racing franchise of all time, waping out all the competition, that's all you need to know.. They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. I wonder how critics and users ignored this game evident lacks. How could you consider this game a simulation if rivals constantly try to ram you worse than Destruction Derby or Wipeout? It seems that if a rival passes you, it will run arbitrary faster, while if you passes the rivals, they run arbitrary slower.terrible rubber band effect.. Great game. Realistic physics, cars, tracks. Fantastic graphics for the time. Brilliant tuning mechanics. Spent many hours playing this baby. You can use your own music for bgm also. Computer AI got seriously hard during higher player levels. Would be a perfect 10 otherwise.. up to about lvl 40, its great, but past that the races are way too hard, even on easy the nurburgring is near on impossible, ive smashed about 10 controllers....... the bar is way too high, its the only racing game that is this hard, im being generous with a 2. I'm not a huge racing game fan but I had a lot of fun with this one, it has a lot of cars and racing options, great graphics, and good controls, my favorite thing about this game is the damage physics, there awesome, if you like racing games then this is one I would recommend.","this is the best simulator racing franchise of all time, waping out all the competition . computer AI got seriously hard during higher player levels . if you like racing games then this is one I would recommend ."
153.Forza Horizon 5,"Best driving/racing game ever made, nothing more nothing less. People who are saying that this is the worst Forza Horizon have little to no idea what they are talking about.. Brilliant game that has given me over 1,000 hours of entertainment! Excellent car selection and a decent sized map even if it is a little samey in places. Festival playlist is a great way to keep the game fresh and unlock new cars every week. I’ve stopped playing now but only because I feel like I’ve done everything to do in the game over a two and a half year period. Would have been a 9 if the DLC maps were connected to the main map, and I also feel the game is quite easy even on the higher difficulty settings.. Forza Horizon 5 is a MASTERPIECE, period. I have never played a racing game that has stunning graphics, big map, and a big car lineup since I played Gran Turismo 7 on the PS4. This is truly a must play to racing game fans. Turn 10, please make sure to work on Forza Horizon 6. This is maybe the worst Forza Horizon. There are so many things they got right, such as blueprints, map size, car sounds, while at the same time so many things they got SO wrong. Track design is very bad, the side missions feel like a chore, the game launched riddled with bugs and while it has gotten better there are still unfixed bugs from launch… it is just so disappointing. Doesn't deserve the hate, in my opinion it is completely okay even compared to fh4. The best driving game for me ! Very fun and huge variety of different races.. My first, and only Forza game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the races and all of the cars I could drive. I'm not the biggest fan of Supercars and Hypercars but I love how this game lets you select any type of car, and brand you want.. Forza Horizon 5 is just great. The map is massive, set in a gorgeous version of Mexico with so many cool spots to explore, from beaches to volcanoes. The cars? Insane. There are almost a thousand to choose from, and they all feel different. Whether you’re into drifting, off-roading, or just speeding down highways, it’s got you covered, especially because you can tune each one of them. The game is packed with things to do: races, crazy stunts, and challenges that never get old. Plus, the online mode makes it feel alive, with players everywhere to team up with or race against. But for me, even better: the open world. Just driving around in Mexico is so chill and fun—off-roading with a Warthog, tuning a Koenigsegg Jesko for a top speed of almost 500 km/h, and drifting in Guanajuato (the main city of the game). I love it, even though I know it’s not perfect. Sometimes the AI is a bit weird, and it can feel a bit restricted and unrealistic compared to other games, but honestly, it doesn’t matter. Forza Horizon 5 is one of the best racing games out there, and even if you’re not a big car fan, you’ll still have a blast.. The developers have improved from the last game, BUT- it still has a glaring issue. Progression. There is none. Yes, you have ""missions"" scattered around that you have to unlock or and beat in sequential order, but this will take you only a couple to a few hours. They are too easy and go by in a blink of an eye leaving you this vast, empty, open world that quickly becomes stale and pointless. YET, I still like driving in it- because it feels good to drive and sounds amazing.. Best racing game to play. But one very serious problem is SBMM (skill based match making) in Battle Royale (Eliminator). I played this mode for 2 weeks, never won single game. I am sure, there must new players, who are also low skilled like I am, which I like to play with, but game never seems to put me in the same match with players of my level.. Stunning details with RT and great gaming experience. This exceeded my expectations.. I hate racing games. Can't stand them. And Forza Horizon 5 is so good I put countless hours into a daggum racing game. One of the best showcases for the Series X there is. Runs like a dream. Really fun arcade-style set-up with fun challenges and a teeming open world. One of the most well-made, pure games I've ever played.. Still not as good as FH 1 or FH2 those games are top notch and 20 out of 10's. But FH is the best type of racing games. I hate racing games like GT that lock you on tracks. I love open world racing games and FH always hits the mark, well 3 and 4 were eh at best, but 5 is such a fun game. If you like open world chose your own speed racers, this is for you.. Forza Horizon offers breathtaking visuals, with stunning environments and highly detailed cars that make each race a visual delight. The game supports both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, providing an immersive audio-visual experience that elevates the atmosphere. However, the driving mechanics feel a bit stiff, lacking the fluidity that would make the gameplay more enjoyable. Additionally, while the cars look fantastic, the human character designs are laughably underwhelming, standing in stark contrast to the otherwise polished visuals.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing game that's provides a lot of fun, beautiful graphics and an incredible game play!. Good game but I still prefer for horizon 4 and 3,but I hate the fact that the game will come to the PS. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best street racing game for consoles, only it doesn't beat Gran Turismo.. Honestly an amazing game with hyper realistic graphics, licenced cars, actual legitimate car sounds and a really interesting story mode. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great, but flawed game. The variety in cars is incredible. Gameplay when driving, and tuning your cars is fun and engaging. The AI is impossibly difficult at higher difficulties due to driving unreasonably fast. At moments, such as wading through deep water, the AI drivers will accelerate at impossible speeds, making it impossible to win certain races. The tuning and physics system is not to the level of a full-on driving simulator, but tire temperature, aerodynamics, and a plethora of other physics mechanics, at least for an arcade racer. There is a lot of in depth customization, both cosmetic and functional. The story is largely one-dimensional with obnoxiously happy characters who experience no arcs or changes. A lot of times, it doesn't match with the story. For example, there exists a 'Horizon Street-Racing Scene', but large venues with huge crowds exist, contrasting the supposed underground, illegal, nighttime racing theme. It's obvious that the game is trying to achieve a lower maturity rating by pandering to a younger demographic. That said, story is not an important factor in an arcade racing game. However, beneath the broad roster of cars, there lies an abundance of arbitrary systems that really do not need to exist, such as each car having a rarity, skill-tree, and score (a letter grade rating). None of these mechanics are necessary or mean anything: a car that is rated 'common' can perform at an equal, or better, level than a car rated 'legendary'. with the right conversions and tunes. Additionally, loot-boxes, or 'wheel-spins', are borderline gambling for kids as the loot-pool is diluted with useless cosmetics, emotes, and car horn effects that the player rarely ever sees or uses. Still, gameplay triumphs all: with in depth systems; satisfying driving; and a broad collection of cars to discover, the game is still a leader in the racing genre of games.. A masterpiece ️ Everything in this game is so well done, a special thanks to Playground Games for this achievement I hope more Horizon games are coming later ️. Graphics 10/10 Sound 9/10 Gameplay 9/10 Characters and story 5/10 The open world is a great aspect but you feel dull and lost after playing for a while and the characters are awful and talk a lot if you are here for cars it's awesome. Forza Horizon 5 isn't a game, it's a Mexican vacation on four wheels. Stunning landscapes, a dream garage, and endless racing joy make this a masterpiece. Races come in a dizzying array of flavors, from high-octane sprints to off-road challenges that will test your mettle. Incredible sound and a killer soundtrack seal the deal. A 10/10 must-play for any gamer.. Forza Horizon 5 masterfully blends the worlds of simulation and arcade racing, creating a driving experience that appeals to both hardcore racing enthusiasts and casual gamers looking for fun, this installment in the Forza Horizon series continues to push the boundaries of open-world racing games with its stunning visuals, diverse environments, and engaging gameplay **** of the standout features of Forza Horizon 5 is its ability to cater to different types of players. The game offers a realistic driving experience with meticulously modeled cars and physics that can satisfy simulation fans who crave authenticity. At the same time, it provides an accessible and enjoyable experience for casual players who just want to enjoy the thrill of racing without getting bogged down by overly complex mechanics. This balance ensures that Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed by a wide audience, making it a versatile addition to any racing game collection. The game's open world is vibrant and expansive, set in the beautiful and diverse landscapes of Mexico. Players can explore everything from dense jungles to arid deserts, all rendered in breathtaking detail. The dynamic weather and seasonal changes add an extra layer of realism and variety, ensuring that no two drives are ever the same. The sheer scale and beauty of the game world invite exploration and provide endless opportunities for high-speed adventure.However, one of the main criticisms of Forza Horizon 5 is the grind associated with its seasonal rewards. Each week, players are presented with new challenges and objectives that must be completed to earn exclusive cars and other rewards. While this system keeps the game fresh and provides ongoing content, it can also feel like a chore. The weekly grind can become repetitive and time-consuming, especially for players who want to collect all the available rewards. This aspect of the game may detract from the overall enjoyment for some, as it can feel like a mandatory task rather than a fun and optional activity.. Absolute Master piece ****, you cant deny the fact of it when you play this Amazing game. The release of this game was such a great achievement in the industry that other open world racing games failed one after another. Very good graphics, more casual than the sim racing that was continued in previous games, and more realistic controls and physics engine than casual racing games help you immerse yourself in this game. The steady addition of new vehicles is commendable. However, network issues and various minor bugs such as the lack of multi-monitor support despite being a racing game are very disappointing.. Amazing Game! Best gamer ever!Its fun its visualy stunning , great game, ihope they add more dlcs. The perfect arcade racer with a gorgeous world and fun to play driving mechanics.. This is probably the part where I was least **** choice of country, the repetitive gameplay since the 1st, no real novelty.. Amazing environments, graphics and cars. Story is okay but is really fun spending time driving in Mexico.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Generally impressive gameplay and high amounts of cars are worth playing again.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 9 Music: 4 Story: 3 Total: 6.50. Best Racing game of all time. Must play. You can use any can you can imagine and do anything u like with it. Graphics - perfect.. i had to pay real money for a car that i spent hours grinding to get enough credits for. whats the point of buying the game if i cant play with all the cars? hate this trend. Excels with its concept and visuals, providing fun even for those not typically into racing games.. BY FAR the best arcade racing game in the industry right now, need for speed and the crew are not even close. Astonishing graphics, great gameplay and cars, marvelous :). verygood graphics but in the apogeo of the new IA this game is a deception, don’t have a minimum of difficult. It's okay game but i has so many flaws the AI is literally cheating they have unlimited grip and weight so its extremely annoying to race againts AI especially in higher difficulties they become impossible to win because they are faster and have better acceleration even with the same car, can drive to corners with max speed without spinning out etc etc. The map is also pretty bland and boring, most of it is just fields and desert, there are no big cities and there's almost no traffic.. It's a good game. Not great, just good. As someone who is really into racing games and cars it's got its up and its down. The ups are that it is definitely a good experience for the first 10 hours I'd say. Plenty to do, exploring, racing, you name it. The problem comes afterwards. Progression is painfully easy and is almost as if the game wants you to be rich quick just to keep you playing. After the first week of release, I already had my first $100m in game currency banked and almost every car with duplicates for exotic upgrades. The game can become boring quickly for those who spend many hours in the first days of them having the game and really the only reason anyone comes back is when the Festival Playlist updates weekly. The map is the biggest of all the entries into the series however it's also the map with the least atmosphere. The ""major city"" if you can even call it that, has almost no life to it and just feels like another part of the map which is also a disappointment. The game feels like a copy and paste of Forza Horizon 3 but with some more features which on paper sounds like a very good formula however it is slightly underwhelming. Overall, I would say this game is still a good game however if you have played some of the more recent entries (3 or 4) you are not missing out on too much with 5. Crytekx. This game is awesome, but FH4 is much better. this game feels so **** when you make almost all the races and the Horizon Stories. This latest entry is solid but in some ways although improving on the previous game with better cars and sounds it still feels like there is less to do. The map is slightly too big and this can result in a bit of an empty feeling. The music selection is not as memorable as in previous games. It is hard to describe why this game feels off compared to the others but unfortunately, it does.. It’s an overall good game considering I have 73 days and 15 hours on it I like the game a lot because the free roam is pretty fun and playing with friends and doing carmeets is pretty fun. This game is the biggest joke ever. When there is an online class race I can't use my car that I built for it. Although it's in the class restrictions. The amount of storage space is crazy. I don't want a game this bad that takes up nearly half the storage. The speedometer is ugly. Not every car has drift suspension. I know its not realistic but this is forza, we don't play for realism. The only reason this game is even remotely good is the amount of cars. STOP releasing new doc's every twenty seconds and most of the cars are horrible anyway. If your going to buy this game don't it's a waist of money. Get a lego 2k drive or even the new forza motorsport game those are better than this. And that is saying something. Those games are horrible. The game is absolutely stunning. Overall, a huge improvement over Forza Horizon 4. Mexico was a clever decision by the devs as a map, since it offers a hell of a lot of landscape and climate variety, jaw dropping ancient ruins and a world of opportunities in combining all elements. The ammount of things to do in the game is at times overwhelming, but delivers in making you lose track of time doing small thing after small thing while driving to get to an event. The downside, for me, is that all the seasons, events and quests get a bit confusing and at some point get me burn out. But it's always an absolute joy to come back, especially if you can crank the graphics to the absolute max.. The game is quite good, the open world races a lot of cars and so on. The graphics are beautiful sometimes in the video I confused it with reality (seriously) a large map and not a few NPC with players, although sometimes I don't want to play but it's still okay to have small shoals but in the chain. A huge exciting sandbox in the open world. The game rewards you for literally everything, a huge fleet and beautiful graphics, an interesting online mode. Of the cons, there is no action and style that is in the NFS series.. This game is the best game ever. the physics are top tier and isvery fun the grphics are incredible. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. fun, well detailed and with the right arcade spirit, and well supported, continuous improving updates.. Best arcade racing game out there. For just gets how to make arcade racing fun. What a racing game, horizon games just never dissapoint. Epic scenes, adventure, and great gameplay, been playing forza since fh3 and i consider fh5 didnt dissapoint, astonishing graphics, thrilling races, wide open world, great car selection, its simply perfect, love it.. FH5 is in many ways, a very solid game on paper. The game has amazing graphics, one of the which I like the most is the particle effects you get from driving through dirt. The cars themselves control great for delivering a semi-realistic driving experience. There are also many many cars of both niche and well-known brands that you could drive forever. However, there is a catch to everything that sounds really good on paper. Personally, the game just lacks any notable ""attitude"" or ""personality"" to it. Every racing events and npc events within the game are extremely generic and forgettable. This wouldn't be a problem for the first 20 hours or so. Later on, these generic events just ain't enough to bring you back to play the game. What keeps me playing every week or so now is the weekly playlists, where some cars are locked through specific missions that you need to complete. This would have been a very good idea if the playlist events the playlist events themselves aren't also so boring and soulless. In fact, if it wasn't for my perfectionism, I wouldn't even bother play the playlist events every week. The multiplayer experience can be both a pro and con for the game. If you want a solid pvp experience, you likely would be able to enjoy the online part of FH5. I can see the fun behind fine-tuning a car to make it an absolute beast on the racetracks (there are cheaters out there, but they are relatively few and shouldn't impact your driving experiences too much). I, however, just wanted to play with friends and find the process of creating convoys with them unnecessarily tedious and buggy. It is also unfortunate that I don't get to send some of my duplicate cars to my friends despite them really wanting it. Overall, FH5 is a good game fundamentally that's unfortunately plagued by soulless and generic racing events and mixed multiplayer experience. Looking past its flaws, FH5 is still a great driving simulator that I am perfectly willing to sink some hours in every week just to drive around and relax.. The console edition is utterly pointless. Why would anyone want a racing game that does not offer split screen? How am I supposed to race my bros? Theres no way I'm buying the game 3 more times along side 3 more xboxs to play with them.. It is an excellent recreation of Guanajuato. It has a good variety of cars and biomes (although the stations of the 4 are missed). With friends it's a lot of fun (especially racing on the highway ). However, this world feels very empty if you're not in Guanajuato, whether you play online or not, which makes it a bit monotonous. (According to a friend, that feeling of emptiness is most evident on Xbox One, but you can understand it from the technical limitations). Honestly, this game was a blast. It's really fun to just race around at 300 km/h and the graphics are gorgeous. I do think the open world is a bit lacking and feels empty at times and that the racing gets repetitive after a while. But as somebody who doesn't consider himself to be a racing game fan, this took me by surprise and I would recommend it.. This game is great! However, there is one small issue. They changed the physics of this game through Forza Horizon 4 so that if you try to turn you will drift.. Amazing Graphics, Fun Gameplay Loop, Cool And Diverse Cars, My Go-To Game When it Comes To Gaming.. Forza horizon 5 spoils you to the point you try to play other arcades and quickly the words “ but you can do this on horizon” comes to mind again and again. An evolution of the car racing games so strong that even competitors like the crew have copy elements because of how good they are. Best racing arcade game ever made.. What a masterpiece ****, this is just the best racing game ever It has good car models my favorite is the silvia S15 The sounds are incredible It's such a superb game that stupid gran turismo fanboys are hating this game thinking the real masterpiece gran turismo 4 is, we all know that that game is dogwater, they are idiots who are trying to hate this gem ****. and ****/watch?v=KkmxCwi6RVs. A very good game with a gigantic map, a lot of cars , beautifull musics and enormly news every months. I payed 30$ for a disappointing game. Dirt 2 it is much better in every way. First I cannot play the game if I don't have a microsoft account, and it was a very unpleasent experience to say the least to make the account. After that, surprise, my wheel is not recognized,I have to play with the keyboard. In Dirt 2 I had no issue with the same wheel. For me, to play a very good rated car game with keyboard it's a no go, but I wanted to play a bit because I payed 30$. The graphics very bad, the car interior it's like 10 years ago graphics, the same in the environment. I don't understand why there are so high scores with this game, I felt in the score trap and thought it is very good... I think I will return to Dirt2. I hope you will not do the same mistake like me and buy this game. If you get it for free, maybe, or a 85-90% discount.... Playground does it again. Tons of levels, cars, quests combined with great physics and excellent level design.Must have for Xbox; even if you don't like racing games.. This game was the best,Incredible Real Life Graphics and great car design and incredible details. Graphics are mediocre, car handling is weird. The world is bland, like desert only all the time. I have only 120 hours in and the game is just mediocre to bad. FH 6 should be better.. Boring broken game on a boring map with car physics like a bar of soap, I'd rather spend my money on the new CREW Motorfest ! The model of cars deserves a special censure as backward from the 2000s. My last car games was gran Turismo 2 for the PS2, when I played ""FZ5"" I feel pleasant, from the beginning the game is exciting, and has much adrenaline, when you finished the tutorial, there are a lot of mission to do, the interactive menu is intuitive and fancy, Furthermore, the variety of cars is amazing, the Open World and the missions are fun, the graphics very fabulous, and the best for me, is the music station, it's nicely heard your favorite track while you drive around Mexico. My final score, 9/10.. Not as strong as it's predecessor but still a great arcade racer. México as a country for the game is great! And definitely ifyou play this (the best arcaderacing game ever) you will never want to play a need for speed or other arcade game. Thank you Microsoft studios. Great job. The best game for race or only driving experience: a fantastic graphic and a very realistic drive system made the perfect title for competitors. The best arcade made ever. Forza Horizon 5 Is The Most Game That Deserves Better 10/10.. this game is totally not a garbage game and that did an 10th anniversary update that was totally not souless and lifeless. This game is great. I think it is improved over FH4 and has some great cars as well. This game is also beautiful in terms of visuals and the map design is fantastic. This was a fun one for sure.. The game forces you to choose your pronouns right at the very start of the game before you can continue. First they remove words from the songs in Forza Horizon 4, words that they deem offensive. Words like ""God"" ""High"" ""Die"" so the soundtrack sounded like a skipping CD. Then in Forza Horizon 5 they force you choose your pronouns. What will happen in 6?. Plenty of other better looking racing games with better graphics and more fun gameplay. The controls are janky and even after being out for this long it still suffers from horrible FPS dips and bugs.A horrible game worthy of the patheticXbox lineup.. Perfect one!! No competitor!. looks Good, feels good, runs good, and fun. Good game.. The best racing game I've ever played. Amazing graphics and environments. Also the collection of cars is top tier. The races and challenges are very fun to play with friends.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the best open world racing games of all times, the car stories, graphics, gameplay and all just feels so exciting. To me, tgis is the best XBOX exclusive. I strongly recommend as a must play game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the best driving game ever created. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good graphics, No story, they give you the best cars right away, no sense of progression. The ultimate benchmark for arcade racing games. Driving model is absolutely spot-on, both on controller and, surprisingly after pretty disappointing FH4 - on FFB-compatible steering wheel. Yes,the game has its flaws - some models aren't that accurate, storylinemight as well not exist, and dialogues were written by people who have no idea about cars. Multiplayer could be a bit more advanced. Still, it's massive step forward. Gameplay does have some drawbacks too, for example, the most expensive cars are very easy to get and the game throws thousands of them at you all the time - that can cause it to get a bit boring and pointless after a while. Despite that, it has the most important thing arcade racer should have: it gives you tons of fun from pure driving and makes you realise how cool the cars are. Even if I get bored of repetitive gameplay, I always come back after a while and I'm having tons of fun.. One my favorite games ever, it's amazing, nothing more to say.. Realistic, fun, too many cars! Forza Horizon 5 has really much to do, races, find old Garages with old Cars in it, Festivals, make own Levels or just enjoy driving around the beautiful Map of the Game. This Game is a worth a try if you like open world racing.. Forza Horizon 5 is like a greatest hits compilation of the entire Forza Horizon series. From the opening seconds when you're dropped from a cargo plane to the moment you put down the controller, you’ll become transfixed by everything that Mexico has to offer. From racing through the cobbled streets of Guanajuato to flying off the side of La Gran Caldera, Forza Horizon 5 is a slice of sheer racing brilliance. Again. TGG – 9 / 10 AUDIO 9/10 I’ll be honest, the Horizon 5 soundtrack didn’t grab me from the start, but after a few hours, I was sold. Foo Fighters, Dua Lipa, the brilliant Jungle, Beastie Boys, and so on. The depth is scary! Oh, and the cars sound stunning too, obviously. VISUALS 9/10 Whether you opt for performance mode on Xbox Series X or quality mode, the game is an absolute stunner. It looks great on Xbox One X and even the One S, too! PLAYABILITY 9/10 There is no better racing franchise out there. It’s as simple as that. I do wish that Playground would do away with the faux-rubber banding, though. DELIVERY 9/10 Not a lot of innovation this time around, but a ton of events, things to do, places to see, and all your old favourites have returned. Forza Horizon 5 is a veritable treasure trove of sensational content.. One of the best racing games but this map is horrible. forza horizon 4 had a better map.. Again, a fun and super engaging open-world racing game. It also looks amazing on the Series X, and I couldn't have asked for more content since it keeps throwing a lot at me (in a good way!) Even if you're not a racing fan but are curious about Xbox exclusives, try this one out, even more so now that it's lower in price.. Very good quality but repetitive. This my **** again again 3rd times a charm. It's OK not as good as 4 but OK. An impressive and massive arcade driving game that can entertain for months. I'm not a huge fan of open world racing games (i prefer games with specific tracks that can be studied over and over and mastered), but that's just my personal preference. this game is a must if you love racing games. Maybe a little bit too easy, I don't think I have ever lost a single race.... Probably the only racing game that has ever held my attention for more than an hour or two. Gorgeous, fun, awesome.. An ok-ish forza game. They've ruined playground games (why? this was one of the best way to spend Friday night with my spouse and our friends) They got rid of ranked, which is just strange — the racing game is by its own definition a ranked challenge.. Ugh...usually this series is top notch, but why did they feel the need to add pronouns? It serves no purpose in game other than to pander for brownie points,. As far as the game goes, its more of the same type of events and grind from last year. and erase man and women from the games. Will cats and dog identities be a DLC? Audio tracks have a decent selection, but need more varied artists. The cars look nice as usual, the tracks are mostly fun, and the atmosphere is usually good.. Generally still has the charm of the forza franchise however it just doesn't quite hit it like fh 4 did. Mediocre racing game. ****. Boring. Why is this a big deal for Xbox fanboys?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good graphics but extremely bad arcade Driving model. The gameplay is also very boring. I’m a big fan of motosport Games but I found this boring after a 15h. I played every Forza Horizon,but this game fails to add something new to the recipe.I is constantly updated,but you can feel on the updates that even the developer feel it asa chore and the creativity pool dryed up at **** game looks nice,but it is the same as the previous one with a different **** a Forza Horizon fan I would expected more from a game like this.. Soy game for those who don’t know what deodorant is. I advise all Forza players to take a shower and throw away the disc with this garbage. Worst racing game ever.. Forza Horizon 5 is a top-notch arcade racer with amazing graphics and content. You can drive over 500 realistic cars in a huge open world that simulates Mexico’s diversity and beauty. You can also customize your cars and join various events and challenges. The game has a dynamic weather system and a day-night cycle that affect the world’s appearance. The title runs smoothly on the Xbox Series X and has great sound design. The only downside is that the cars are too easy to get and lose their charm. Despite this, and some minor AI issues, Forza Horizon 5 is a must-have for Xbox Series X racing fans! It is a game that is fun and gorgeous.. Mediocre racing game. Got bored pretty fast. DLC are not worth it either. 2nd DLC feels like a more expanded WILDS campaign. As always, a very good and beautiful Horizon game. It has everything you need from a racing game and more. It's beginner friendly or it can be a real challenge for experienced user. It's an arcade-sim style game, so not a Forza Motrosport game, just keep in mind.. This was the best experience I've had in a Forza Horizon Franchise game since Forza Horizo","i've stopped playing now but only because i feel like i’ve done everything to do in the game over a two and a half year period . the map is massive, set in a gorgeous version of Mexico with so many cool spots to explore, from beaches to volcanoes . the track design is very bad, the side missions feel like a chore, the game launched riddled with bugs ."
