766.Pokemon HeartGold Version,"Best remake I have ever played. Visuals are great, story is great, and the map is great. Pretty much a perfect game. Adding gens 1-4 really help this game.. A strong remake that suffers from being a gen 4 entry. The DS era of Pokemon wasn't sharpened until gen 5. Fans say the Hoenn region has too much water. But, only for a small % of the gameplay. It comes nowhere near Gen 4's slow pacing for 100% of the time. Despite this setback, these games are delightful.. This is the Best Pokemon game ever. I assure you. The only problem is that you can't get the game.. This is one of the best games ever, it has tons of stuff to do even after beating the game, and it has lots of cool Pokemon to collect. This is one of the few remakes I like better than the original.. Incredible Pokemon Game. Despite being on the weaker end in terms of storiesin pokemon. You get to explore 2 full regions with the entirety of Kanto being opened to you in the postgame. It is an incredible entry in the series highlighting the golden era of pokémon in the DS era.. Overrated why has this game a 9.2. I have played any kind of Pokemon Games but 9.2 average?. I have never loved Pokemon games, but I enjoyed this game a good amount. I think the game is still bogged down by some frustrating mechanics (I have always hated the random encounters), but generally the moment to moment gameplay is pretty fun. The map is pretty solid and the visuals are also pleasant to look at. I don’t think I would replay the game again unless I did a nuzlocke or some other challenge like that, but overall I enjoyed the game.. typhlosion. One of the best remakes of all time. The best pokemon game of all time. You get to explore Johto AND Kanto through the ridiculously expansive endgame, great Gen 4 pokemon and graphics, your pokemon follows you in the overworld which sounds exactly as good as it actually is. The final boss is insane and will test your skills to the limit. Pokemon doesn't get better than this.. Best pokemon ever made imo. 16 gyms and more post game content? Sign me up. I'm getting nostalgic just think about it. I hope they get the sense to remake this game.. A proper remake of one of the better entries in the series, adding the extra complexity of the DS Era and building on an already solid foundation. HeartGold and its sister game SoulSilver, released on the 10th anniversary of their predecessors, Gold and Silver, marking the golden age of Game Freak and the Pokémon main series as a whole. The scope of the originals is very expansive and the dedication put into this remake should be the standard for the industry. The game takes everything good about the old entries and furthers it with some fourth generation enhancements. The Johto and later Kanto regions feel refreshed with updated graphics, making them feel more akin to the prior fourth gen games, Diamond and Pearl. The addition of a safari zone is welcome considering the original versions of Gold and Silver severely lacked a variety of Pokémon to catch, especially in the early stages of the game. While the soundtrack is considerably better than anything modern Pokémon has to offer, it remains quite forgettable in comparison to some of the more popular entries. The battles received a solid overhaul with the addition of the Physical/Special split, and, although panned for the steep level curve later in the Kanto region, a solid challenge makes succeeding in battle feel all the more satisfying. This is topped off by some quality of life features, the most notable of which being the first Pokémon in your party following alongside you, making you feel as though you are playing a character straight out of the anime. Paired with the Pokéwalker, Game Freaks iteration of the tamagotchi craze, this feature proves to be an excellent extension of the Pokémon I.P. that would have been a solid foundation for Pokémon Go to build off of. Designs received a major update, and some of the more prominent Pokémon in the series belong to the ancestor games. Fan favourites like Typhlosion and Tyranitar, introduced in the 2nd generation line-up, and additional Pokémon from the 4th generation are present as well. The legendaries are some of the better designs in the series, and the box legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia are truly iconic. Overall, the decision to remake some of the most expansive games in the series and Game Freaks ability to add to it while keeping the original feeling of it’s ancestors makes this an experience worth taking your time to dive into. It’s minor grievances, mostly being the level curve of the games second region, actually benefit it in the form of providing an extra challenge to an otherwise easy endeavour. The game is far from the best of Pokémon’s offerings, but has more than enough going for it already.. This is exactly what people want from Pokémon.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is not the best pokemon game and is probably the most overrated. ------ ""AnthonySTF will be going away to far ne land from hear that? If you dont hear it"". [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Greatest remake of the franchise, i still feel Johto uncomplete and Kanto so empty but both together are great, technically the best post-game out of any Pokémon game.. It is undoubtedly the best pokemon game that has been created, it is simply fun with the 2 generations and it is fun after finishing the game since it has a very good postgame since the game knows how to perfectly introduce the adventure sensation and of new challenges making the game very replayable and feeling like a very complete game that is worth trying. Best pokemon game with last battle and musics the only thing, game is very easy except postgame. I have never loved Pokemon games, but I enjoyed this game a good amount. I think the game is still bogged down by some frustrating mechanics (I have always hated the random encounters), but generally the moment to moment gameplay is pretty fun. The map is pretty solid and the visuals are also pleasant to look at. I don’t think I would replay the game again unless I did a nuzlocke or some other challenge like that, but overall I enjoyed the game.. One of the best pokemon games of all time. The graphics are great, the gameplay is really good. This remaster is so good that a remaster of this remaster seems like a really good idea.. The best video game remake of all time. Everything about the already phenomenal Johto games is cranked up to 11 with lots of new content and QoL from gens 3 and 4. The visuals aged beautifully and the Pokemon sprites, both in battle and on the overworld, have lots of soul. HGSS added 2 new starter choices, Hoenn legendaries, events with mythical Pokemon, and a Safari Zone unlike anything else in Pokemon. Beyond that, there are gym leader rematches, revamped elite 4 rematches, and much more. Play these games if you have the chance.. (10/10) - It was the first Pokemon game I've ever played and is easily the best Pokemon game to ever release. It also has one of the greatest soundtracks ever.. Johto has one of the worst level scaling in pokemon and most of the best pokemon are trade evolutions and the whirl islands **** Still one of my favorite pokemon games, amazing experience.. Excellent remake and improves in almost every way off the original. Pokemon Heartgold is a whole game and then a whole new game right after.. This game is a great remake! You get extra Pokemon, easier way to obtain them and the gyms were hard. I love post game, you get the entirety generation 1, and extra content. Shiny hunting is easier to obtain and safari zone makes it easy to catch the hard Pokemon to catch.. Pokemon HeartGold & SoulSilver are the definitions of the perfect Pokemon game. Having a massive national dex, two regions to explore, fixes to physical/special attacks, new typings and a story you can’t get attached too. This was all followed up by the Generation 4’s mesmerising soundtrack which can be played in the 8-bit tone **** Colour. These games are truely masterpieces!. The best Pokemon game ever created. Graphics, innovative game systems, incredible events and full of history never seen before. The only flaw: it ends. The beautiful, fun, definitive experience of the back then definitive pokemon game. It is just a little slow in battle.. to this day the best and most feature complete games in the entire franchise.. Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are objectively the best games in the series, and anyone who disagrees is wrong, plain and simple. People can nitpick these games and tear them apart over their few miniscule flaws, but at the end of the day, it's just that- nitpicking. The positives far outweigh the negatives here, from the gorgeous 2.5D graphics, to the sheer amount of content packed into the cartridges. There's no argument to be had. Everything that came before and after HeartGold and SoulSilver pales in comparison.. perfect game. easily one the best pokemon games of all time, and is definitely the best remake. they actually did more than the bare minimum, unlike some really bad gen 4 remakes that came out recently.. Simply put ,this game is a masterpiece for Pokemon. The original content was left intact as well as elements from Crystal version - and a ton of new features brought to the table. The towns are lovingly remade and made more distinct, the remixes are interesting new takes on the songs, and the game is jam packed; With 16 gyms, rematches, battle frontier, and side activities like the pokeathlon which has a surprising amount of effort put into it. The game also comes with a pokewalker accesory to give you something to do even when not playing. There's just so much to do, and it's hard to fault the games outside of the weirdly low level curve which was a flaw of the originals. The postgame and side content more than makes up for that in my opinion though. So much better than the remakes we get today.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a challenging game for competitive pokemon players only pros good graphics good late gameplay decent player guy cons horrible puzzle part worst of the gym leaders except number 8 elite four pales in comparison to pokemon ruby and emerald overall a decent game with nothing more to it. One of the best Pokémon games ever made. Good stuff from the originals, and DPP. Get it if you can. I agree with those who claim that Pokémon Heartgold&Soulsilver are a culmination of all Pokémon games ever made, they’re indeed perfect! The nostalgia is huge! My very first game boy game was Pokemon Crystal and HeartGold is such an amazing improvement in terms of graphics, variety of Pokémons, exploring two continents and collecting four generations of Pokémons into your Pokédex; also my favorite starters will remain Chikorita, Cyndaquil and Totodile!!. Very polished yet grindy game. Progression is good until 8th gym and E4 where you need some preparation. Post E4 is really rewarding for players that played Kanto before. Problem is no good way to grind new pokemons when you run out of trainers. I like addition of new pokeballs in shops. Some parts of the game are time based on day in week or day and night so it's easy to miss some extra stuff. World is pretty compact with a lot of towers and caves so you can travel fast even without fly HM. Overall enjoyable game with some speed bumps.. Content: 10 , Gameplay: 10, Graphics: 10. This is the best Pokemon game, ever. It exceed every other games in the franchise in almost every way, from the amount of content, the way pokemon following you, the graphics,... It's one of the best RPG i've ever played. I never played through Gold and Silver so the nostalgia played no part. This game was undoubtedly what started my love for Pokémon. It looks great, feels great and has just a few ‘little things’ that make it spectacular. Most games nowadays are great but lack the little things, such as having your partner follow you and the little detail here and there. This game really is a masterpiece, plain and simple Rating - 98%. I personally would say Heartgold and Soulsilver are the second-best Pokemon games of all-time, easily, in my opinion, but they do have their flaws which are pretty glaring. Although the large amounts of passion and drive to develop the series further and provide more than any fan could have ever wished for shows in the game.. Pokemon Hgss are the best Pokemon games out there and the best games GameFreak has ever produced. Everything about it is absolutely flawless. Now this is how you make a sequel.. One of the best Pokemon games to date, very fun and plenty of content for a Pokemon game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokemon Heart Gold is the definitive Pokemon experience. With brilliant pixel-art, two of the best regions in the series to explore, engaging battles, and more, this game is a treat for all. The challenge is there but with hard work and perseverance, players of all ages can succeed. The cast of Pokemon in this game is some of the best and the adventure is extremely fun. The gameplay finds its perfect spot and the quality of life is great. The music and sound design is also outstanding. It's a great game and one of the most important games to my life!. The definitive Pokémon 4th generation Game, and probably one of the best Nintendo titles ever created. Graphics are top notch, same goes for the game's speed; the music and the story are just fantastic, fairly improved since the 2nd generation games. This title represents one of the happiest memory of my childhood, and i liked it to the point that Ho-Oh became my favourite Pokémon, and it still is. Gamefreak, this title is worthy being called the ""Golden Age"" of the Pokémon franchise :D. It's the Pokemon game I've put the most hours into. And it's probably the most objectively good Pokemon game, to the point of flawlessness.. This is peak pokemon. It encompasses everything that the pokemon series does well. Not only did it remake one of the most loved generations of the series, it also added stuff from other generations and added plenty of extra activities to enjoy.. This games... Are the best that the pokémon franchise has to offer. Beautiful designed creatures, the longest post-game' experience, the best story of any pokémon game... A true piece of art. Thank you gamefreak for this experience, which I will always hold in a special place of my mind.. Wouldn't it be the most interesting version of the Pokemon series? The main character is cool, and Red appears as the last enemy. That's cool too!. The by far best game of the franchise. A must play for every fan of the series.. I hesitate to call any game ""perfect."" In fact, I don't really think a ""perfect game"" really exists. But by god, if any Pokemon games got close, they would be HeartGold and SoulSilver. Sure, these games are remakes of the original Gold and Silver, but they're also so much more. Even from the beginning, you get a new rival and following Pokemon. There's a new Safari Zone, a Battle Frontier, and so many new events and things to do thrown in that just calling these games remakes doesn't do them justice. The only real problem with the games is the level curve. It was pretty bad in the originals and it persists here. But that's a really minor problem, especially considering how much these games do well. These two games are, hands-down, the best Pokemon has to offer. I would be thoroughly impressed if Gamefreak could top these games, but I certainly invite them to try.. Pokemon Gold on the Gameboy colour was the first Pokemon game I have played and I also consider it my favourite out of all of them. Getting an upgraded version of the best Pokemon game ever was a godsend. HeartGold captures what made Gold so great and with a 4th Generation upgrade, it was even better than I imagined. Out of all the 5 generations of Pokemon, nothing has ever topped the 2nd Generation in my eyes and this game proves it. This game is just complete. Good story, addicting gameplay, huge amounts of content and endless replay value - all needed for the ultimate Pokemon game. Best Pokemon game ever made. The 4th gen mechanics are still the most superior to date, the graphics, music, story, everything is exactly what you want from a Pokemon game. The ability to explore Kanto is the cherry on top.. The big overrated Pokémon game. Story is bad as hell (if it has any), difficulty is null, postgame is boring being Kanto almost empty, but better than the original versions. This game is the genwunner exhaust outlet to defend they're not genwunners because they like something from almost 10 years ago.. This is the sequel to Fire Red/Leaf Green we needed, now we don’t have to go back and play the (because of these much better versions) outdated Gen 1 and 2 games. Honestly I would never recommend anyone the original Gen 1 and 2 games unless they like messing around with the glitches (which admittedly is pretty fun) This is a great standard Pokémon game, it pretty much does what Pokémon does and does it very well If you liked Fire Red/Leaf Green I’m sure you’ll also enjoy this game. One of the best pokemon games to this day. These remakes keep in tack everything was great about the originals with new features and conveniences that make it a great RPG in general. A typical pokemon journey where you try to be the very best while also defeating an evil organization but this time around you get pokemon to follow you where ever you go. The endgame has plenty of rare pokemon to capture, another whole region to explore after you beat the game, and challenging trainers including a final boss that will truly test your limits as a pokemon master.. The best main Pokemon game with ton of additions! This remake really tried hard in every aspect, developing a game for the best made Pokemon game so far. Plus, this game had the best and the biggest post-game in the games I played.. Music: 5/5 Game Play: 4/5 Graphics: 4.5/5 Story: 4.0/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall: 4.5/5. Its a BAD pokemon game, not only that, but the only pokemon game that is bad, all others are at least ok. But this one is slow, bland, not inovative and they manage to make the few minigames weird and unplayable. Its also for the other game's looks what polar express is to reality, this ugliness makes the game even more boring than it adding nothing did. I saw some people praising it in the past but every time I looked up turned out to be some teenager who grew up when this one was new, in other words: if nostalgia and vanity over your own childhood are the only reasons you play a game, go for it but if you want a good game, play Firered, or really any other pokemon game.. This game is a blast! There is absolutely nothing wrong in this game! I played all generations of Pokemon-games and this is the best Edition. Even it's a remake of gold/silver it contents a lot of great new stuff (for example: The first Pokemon of your team walks straight behind you) and also bewares the greatness of the original. The storyline with the ""geisha-girls"", the soundtrack, the overall Japanese-look, challenging gameplay and damn cool designs make this game to one of the best for the Nintendo DS in my opinion.. Besides the terrible level curve. It has the same bad distribution from the GS games and basically fixed nothing: every single problem is back, but with the ugly sprites from the dp games. The legendaries were shoving in at inconvenient places, ruining their original lore completely. It's also highly expensive, in part due an add on app thats underused and you won't need, so I only recomend this game if you are a collector that want them all. Otherwise, stick to gsc.. Pokémon Blue was the first ever video game I played. I was 6 at the time and from that moment on I kept playing all the Pokemon games in the main series and I can say Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, are the best Pokemon games ever made. I feel the problem with the more recent Pokemon games is the amount of unnecessary legendary Pokemon thrown into the games but since Pokemon HGSS is a remake of Gold and Silver with the Pokemon from gen 3 and 4 also available, Game Freak managed to make every single legendary Pokemon count! Every legendary in the game has a purpose to the story! Speaking of story, the event Pokemon such as Celebi and Arceus act as sort of DLC, allowing the player the ability to access otherwise inaccessible places and events in the game! All this added to exploring 2 regions, collecting 16 badges and doing all sorts of daily and weekly events, Pokémon HGSS are, by far, the ultimate Pokemon experience!. Highly overrated. It's unfortunate to me to say it but it just doesn't stand the test of time: the charm, style, music and design of the original GSC games is completely absent, replaced by safe, boring music that's not even a fraction of how memorable the original was, generic sprites and an ugly overworld that doesnt make good use of what the ds could do. Worse: it has good aditions actually locked away through events that are now impossible to get, entire story bits no less that could have made the game better and more unique, not just event pokemon. The level scaling is also made worse than before despite the aditions its gen had. I recommend Crystal instead for the better Johto experience unless you really want the pokewalker app (nowadays hard to get) or want to transfer your cyndaquil to newer games.. A stellar rpg, specifically if you have played Pokemon red, blue, or yellow (or the remakes). Excellent soundtrack with very well designed Pokemon make this my favorite game in the series. There is such a jump in quality from the original series in the form of day and night cycles, two new Pokemon types, wild Legendary pokemon, and many other various minigames and encounters. What really makes this game special to me is going back to Kanto from the original game, seeing how the world has changed. Cities have new layouts, some gym leaders change, and you fight Red from the original game. Brilliant.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game was my first Pokemon game and by far my favorite. However, since it is still Pokemon, it suffers some flaws that others suffer, but not as badly as those. Pros: + Walking around: How did a Pokemon game make walking around with more than just one character fun? (I loved this in Xenoblade 2 as well, but this is a Pokemon review) + Post-Game: By far the best Pokemon post-game + Gyms: Honestly, these are the only gyms I liked out of the franchise. + Safari Zone: The customization was excellent and I loved that you had to earn the extra secret areas. + Variety: Best variety in a Pokemon game ever. + Legendaries: The return of older legendaries was sweet, though the Arceus-event only methods of getting lvl 1 Sinnoh ones ****. Mix: = Soundtrack: One of the better Pokemon soundtracks, but still, not too memorable (2nd best champion theme though). = Gameplay: Same as others, except minus Z-Moves and Megas (which both are overrated anyways). Overall, Pokemon HeartGold version was great enough to warrant an 8.5/10 from me.. While this may be bias coming from someone introduced to Pokemon through this game, I have no choice but to consider this the greatest game of the JRPG genre.. Pokemon Heartgold and Soulsilver make welcomed additions to the Pokemon resume, boasting probably the best post game to date, not to mention great music and being an overall improvement over Gold and Silver. Pokemon Gold & Silver were wonderful games for the GBC and Game Freak created a amazing Remake with Heartgold & Soulsilver. For me they were the BEST Editions of Pokemon (at least until now). But u may wonder why they are the Best Pkmn Games out there for me? i 'll tell ya. 1. It's a really long game: I mean u can achieve 16 Badges, sick huh? they are Rematches, and the post-game is reeeaaallllyyy goood. just great, in our opinion is this the best pokemon game ever. Here are some reasons why lots of legendaries to find being able to go to the kanto region the pokéwalker and much more. Of all video games I have played, the Pokemon series offers one of the most perfect gameplay experiences to me. HeartGold is the best example of this. As an upgraded version of Gold, you can do everything you could do back then, whilst also being able to catch up to Gen 4 Pokemon, and allowing a Pokemon to follow you around one at a time, among other new features. HeartGold feels like an epic adventure, as you gradually level up, and move on to the next town, each with it's own unique layout. Ecruteak City to this day remains one of my favorite video game locations ever, due to it's rooted history and complex atmosphere that embodies the rich culture of Johto. Blackthorn City is relatively secluded from the other areas, giving it a sense of mysteriousness. Even post-game, there is a lot of extra content offered that will entertain for hours on end. HeartGold is truly, a fantastic game.. The best region/map of any Pokémon with the WORST selection of Pokémon. The way to really enjoy this game is to trade over a team of level 5 guys from the start. I always have to wait until I have 6 or 7 badges before I can catch anything actually worth training.. Pokemon heart gold is the worst game ever created pokemon gold is so much better these new johto pokemon look so weird. Like why? In pokemon gold the pokemon were so much better and they looked nicer. If you want better pokemons play pokemon red. Pokemon diamond is the worst game ever!!. Another great remake of yet another classic RPG. Gold/Silver retains everything that made the original R/B/Y classics such great games: charming characters and storytelling, colorful environment, massive world to explore filled with hidden items, pokemon, and quests, and hundreds of hours of gameplay for those who are up to the highest challenges this gem has to offer. I still remember the thrill when I caught my first legendary bird with ultra balls. Highly recommended!. This was my first experience of Pokemon. Born in 1980, I was too old by the time the series began to care about it, and having tried a couple of the Gameboy games through emulation in my 20s I couldn't grasp what had people so impressed by them. Boring, repetitive, pointless was my view at the time. Heartgold as I understand is a remake for one of the early Gameboy games, tarted up for the DS with some ""modern"" additions and of course nicely improved graphics. It certainly looks good on my DSi with its sharp, bright screens! I enjoyed the game a lot more than I was expecting. Yes, it IS repetitive, just as I found it in my attempts to play the earlier versions. But, somehow, I was compelled to keep going, seeking out the rarer Pokemon and pushing through each of the gyms to win the badges. I still don't understand why I felt the compulsion, but now I know at least that there is SOMEthing about the series that addicts fans. Not having played any other version, I can't comment on how it compares, but I intend one day to try one of the later versions (perhaps I'll go to Black and Black 2 before trying the upcoming Moon on 3DS) and as I stated at the start I initially had no interest and found the games boring and pointless - that this has changed my mind leads me to recommend it to any non-fan at the least, as a good way to find out that there is a little magic in Pokemon should you give it the chance.. Pokemon HeartGold is a revisit to the Johto region. Along with many different expansive elements, such as the day/night cycle, battling gym leaders again on certain time based - events, Pokemon from different generations are available, its a giant love letter to the Gold and Crystal games. The world of Pokemon still continues to be expansive. I don't know how many hours I sunk into this game. I highly recommend it.. Pokemon Heartgold version is one of the best Pokemon games there is to date. Pokemon Heartgold revolutionized the Pokemon gaming industry. If you want to start a Pokemon adventure, this is the game you should get!. My favorite game ever, and got me truly into pokemon as a whole. It solidified my love for RPGs, the DS, and nintendo as a whole. A true masterpiece if Iv'e ever seen one.. In terms of innovation and originality for its time it doesn't beat the originals for the GBC, but this is technically the best version of the best Pokemon game ever. Pokemon G/S/C are widely considered the best Pokemon games for their time and their addictive gameplay still shines through with HG/SS. I'm not sure which game would be enjoyed the most if you'd give HeartGold to someone that has never played a video game and the original Gold to someone that has never played a video game. But for today's standards HeartGold wins and with that said I consider HeartGold one of the best RPGs I've ever played. A lot of fun and addictive. The story and quality drops a bit after the pokemon league, but the fact that they added Kanto still amazes me today. 9.1/10. I simply love this game! It has a great charm that no other game in the series has. There are its minor flaws, such as very few Trainer rematches, a lot of low leveled stuff, frustrating legendaries and in my opinion not enough new Pokemon. But this game redelivers what Gold and Silver originally did to make it even better! Team Rocket, while kind of a joke made the story great. The music is some of the greatest in the franchise and I just have great fun with the game. If they just fixed the problems I listed above, it could be the greatest Pokemon game ever!. 40$ and i have played this game for 700 hours! 2 regions, having pokemon walk behind you, the new mechanics gen 3 and 4 introduced, fantastic soundtrack, 14 legendary's without events, the ability to catch the mascot that wasn't on your cover, a gigantic postgame and the inclusian of gen 3 and 4 pokemon, more to the point the gen 3 main legends all help to make this my favorite pokemon and DS game to date. While the story lack the depth of R/S/E/B/W/B2/W2 it still is a merorable journey. Plus STEVEN! Nuff said.. I was a fan of pokemon since the 3th generation and i must admit that no matter how old i get, i like the franchise. So when a remake was announced i was excited. When the game came out, it was pretty good, i do not have much to say about it. You see i usually talk to much about a bad game so the only answer you're going to get is: This game is worth a buy.. If your like me and you enjoyed playing the original gold. Then this game is a fantastic choice for **** graphics have been revamped as you could probably of guessed, This improvement really bring's gold in to todays graphical capacity. The game it self still retains the original story with a couple of changes. All of these little changes really make the game feel new such as the ability to get Pokemon from the diamond and pearl games.There are ton's of Pokemon in this game which makes it all the more fun trying to collect them all. I personally have all-way's loved the music of the Pokemon franchise, The game has a fantastic sound track one which you remember as soon as you play the game after completing it. They decide to incorporate a function known as the poke-walker, which basically means you can train a pokemon by walking real **** game becomes extremely addicting and before you know it you have packed away loads of hours. I would highly recommend to pokemon fans, also people looking to try something new.. Melhor jogo de pokémon ja feito. se passa nos melhores continentes, e tem os melhores pokémons, gráfico bom e muito legal a ideia de 1 pokémon ficar te seguindo. ------ Best Pokemon game already done. goes the best continents, and has the best Pokémon, good graphics and very cool idea to get one Pokemon following you.. I am a 90's kid and always will be. ","a strong remake that suffers from being a gen 4 entry . despite this setback, these games are delightful . typhlosion is one of the few remakes i like better than the original ."
767.Astral Ascent,"Excellent roguelite, feels a bit like dead cells/hades. Worth playing for any fans of the genre. Master Roguelike Piece, tons of builds, posibilitys, metaprogresion, unlockeables, gameplay tempo, beautyfull pixel art and lore. With a devolper team that keep releasing free updates for more than a year with more content and quality of life improvements in to the game. Even Pvp.... Actually its in his version 1.5, wich are 5 mayor updates, each one making the game bigger, better, more accesible and more balanced than ever.. I absolutely adore this game it is a Roguelite in a similar style to Dead Cells with gorgeous pixel art and a fun collection of characters with varying abilities and personality which makes for an entertaining time seeing the different ways everyone interacts. The gameplay loop is solid and hits the craving for one more run with the different builds holding my interest and the way that skills interact, I am fond of the voice work in the game as well the whole experience has just been checking my boxes to make me love the game and I can't recommend it enough. Bonus points: Calie's hands are the right shade for the palms and when that care is taken with art direction it is a bonus point for me.. Fantastic game with great combat, perfect balancing and extremely slick visuals. Basically Hades but from a side scrolling perspective. If you like roguelikes or metroidvanias then you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.. Literally made an account just to leave this review. One of the best rogue-lites I’ve played. Would highly recommend. Hoping for more content in the future!. Perfect Roguelite with a good progression. I played with my little brother and both of us loved it. The bosses are super well made and the cutscenes are impressive. I can see myself playing it for a long time and coming back to it every year.. Really an excellent game. The game feels very fluid and fun and there is always something new to do. The amount of content is really insane. This not game a joke, don't spend your money, clunky gameplay, outdated mechanics. Fast paced satisfying combat especially the bosses fight is mind blowing, Art & Animation is just top notch, fully voiced with almost 8000 lines, solid meta progressions with destiny (difficulty) levels up to 54 (the enemies & bosses can get more mechanics / attack move), 17 unique endings, you can learn more about all of the characters the more you progress. This game is truly among my favorites Roguelike / lite with Hades, Dead Cells. You can tell how the developers put so much effort & love towards their game, i encouraged everyone who likes Hades / Dead cells or roguelike in general to at leash try the game.. A delightfully charming roguelike. Came for the beautiful, colourful pixel art – stayed for the addicting gameplay loop. This game keeps me saying ”one more run”. The skill system seemed a bit complex at first, but when it clicks it’s very rewarding. A fair challenge, but you can land on some insane builds over time.

768.Diablo III: Reaper of Souls,"I think the dlc is even better than the base game every think the soo good in the dlc. Gameplay is perfect. Story is somewhat decent. Some things could've been better, but it improved on the things vanilla did lack. Great fun with friends,better than D4 still. My favorite game of all time. Objectively it has many flaws but subjectively it’s been the perfect game for me since ROS and Loot 2.0. No other game has given me nearly the same amount of fun and joy. I lost count of the hours I've played, but I must be in the quadruple digits. I just love the art design, the atmosphere, the ridiculously easy to learn and hard to master gameplay, the RPG mechanics that are stripped to their bare essentials and OMG the FEEL of progression and combat. It’s difficult to describe the feel of D3ROS Adventure Mode but for me it’s a bit like a gory and bloody Tetris. You can easily get into the flow of the gameplay and achieve a sort of “In the Zone” feeling and all along the way you are 100% in control of how easy or hard your time will be. I'm thankful to the Diablo 3 developers for giving me a game so perfectly attuned to my preferred mode of play and (let’s be honest) skill level. It was a happy place to come back to over and over again for 10+ years and even though I'm most likely done for good with D3, I will always cherish my time with it.. Season 30 and still going strong, almost 10 years since the release of RoS every QoL feature missing from D4 is present in D3 and while it doesn't have the most meaty end game content what you have is still light years ahead of D4.. The Burger King of ARPGs compared to Path of Exile's fine dining experience. The start of a new season up to the point where you've got mostly ancient augmented gear is a 10/10 ARPG experience. Shame it goes by so quickly and then there's nothing interesting to work towards. Still, I've been returning to this for a few days every season and I have a blast each time.. A huge improvement from its vanilla counterpart, with the addition of the Crusader and Necromancer, as well as Rifts/Grifts, improvements to the Paragon-system, as well as making sets very fun, satisfying and worthwhile to use. While the game isn't perfect or in any shape or form lives up to the legends of D1 or D2, it created its own little niche, which was enough for you to jump back into the game, once every year or so. The game was fun up till a certain point (usually full load out), but then once you hit that point, all the fun died immediately. Also, leveling is really boring if you don't do it the first week of a season - Because you'll be doing it alone, all the way to level 70 zzzz.. It's easiest diablo game if you play just campaign. Its so funny and not easy game if you play high level greater rifts.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I waited 10 years to play Diablo 3 after getting mixed messages from friends. Mind you I loved D1 and D2. They are an integral part of my youth! So going in with low expectations, and not really knowing much about the game was, thinking its gotta be ripe now atleast. 10 years of patches and fixes.! **** game was absolutely horrible...? I had to turn up the difficulty several notches, going for the most difficult pretty quickly. Even then I was just standing and keeping my mouse button pressed on an enemy. Watching periodically how they turned into a chicken from my spells whilst being blocked by my ""witch doctor"" creeps as the enemies also were being hit by my frogs(?!) or bat-plasma thing(?!)... the health bar going into the millions. My follower dealing 400k in damage. More then me whatever i did. My units never died during the game. Going through every act fully explored. Allways 100% HP regardless (why even give them health bars if they cannot take damage?!). Me too most of the time. When i finally finished act 4. I realised there was another act. Immediately I uninstalled the game. Knowing I couldn't continue with such a misuse of my time any more, hoping I had finished the whole game. How can a big company that owns such a good franchise produce such a generic, totally time waste of a computer program (game?). Do not play. Its not worth it. Even if its free (like in my case). Maybe I don't get meaning/point of the game at all. Maybe somebody switch out the real game on blizzard servers? Could have watched the game play itself. I don't understand how the game could land positive criticism from established reviewers. I wished somebody would have paid me for playing through 4 acts. I built my perseverance and tolerance a lot. That's what i gained from playing.. Diablo 3 may not be the most complex ARPG, and it may be the worst for those who desire deep theory crafting and build diversity. For what it lacks in these categories, it makes up for in sheer game feel and the constant dopamine drip of its relevant and useful loot drops. For some, Diablo 3’s lack of complexity could be seen as a boon. Games like Path of Exile require a master’s degree to properly gear your character and a doctorates to create your own build and properly diagnose weaknesses. Diablo 3 requires no such dedication to enjoy or understand. It is simply FUN with a capital F. It plays and feels incredibly smooth on PC and transitions well to a controller. Some ARPG’s have become too dense and complex for this aging man over time, but Diablo 3, despite it’s simplicity, is a game I will return to time and time again.. Graphics- 1 Gameplay- 2 Characters- 2 Campaign- .5 Content- 4 Overall- 9.5. This expansion was fun, far better than D3 content, the replayability and loot were far more rewarding and fun.. Made the whole game better I guess. The legendary items now have better sound effect.. 6/10. Reaper of souls is fun. Act V is a lot closer to the Diablo universe than all of Diablo 3 combined. Less chatter from bosses, more creepiness. If you're expecting loot to be any better, you'll be let down. The development team basically slapped a couple special effects on a FEW legendaries. That's it. The issue is this - intervals where you get no loot. When you hit the loot level (70), you should be rewarded for hunting for loot. As you colect items that increase your power, the time should increase between upgrades. Instead, you get to 70 and are stuck in lower difficulties forever because magic find no longer exists on common items. You cannot increase your odds for finding loot that allows you to progress through the difficulties. You will get a legendary ever 2-3 hours because there is a loot timer. It truly is loot on rails. The problem is far greater in hardcore. That perfect item progression from previous Diablo games is still missing, but at least we have bounties and rifts...right? Ahem. Oh, and cinematics? None. Where did Blizzard quality go?. Diablo 3 is in my opinion the best game Blizzard has to offer. It is 0 Pay2Win, has allot of character, Paragon system and much more. But here are the points which makes me give this low score. 1. Lack of stash storage you have in the game. You can increase it but you have to do the season journey and with it the stupid SET PORTALS. I hate nothing more than these stupid HELL of SET PORTALS. This is the main reason for my low score. 2. Low stash. In Path of Exile you can just purchase some stash slots and that's all but not in Diablo 3. If you are an item messy then you will have a rlly hard time in this game. 3. By far not enough char slots. 3. Lag 4. Balancing, yes I hate the balancing in this game. They mostly increase the damage the character can do BUT not the defense. What's the point in dealing billions of damage when you die in 1 hit only. I've been playing the ninja Set for a looooong time just because this is the only Set which is tanky enough not to die just by being smiled at. I even have equiped so many gear which reduces the incomming dmg in % amount but still I get ONE SHOT. Guess the Ninja is the only set / class which is left to me. 2021: Well Blizzard is still not able to balance classes / Sets. Some classes are much stronger, faster than others. It's just a joke that one class can flye through the maps and other is like a snail that is trying to move by itself. Why Blizzard is so bad in balancing stuff like that? Why are some classes so extremely slow?. This expansion like its base game does not exist. It exists only on Blizzard servers. Why does this publisher is allowed to take customers money without giving them the actual product? It gets a 0 because you can only download this game. I will update the review if they release the actual game like they have on consoles.. I played a lot of vanilla D3 at launch (~100 hours) even though it was in a pretty rough state. The action is a lot of fun regardless. Reaper of Souls fixes the loot and gets rid of the auction house. At time of this review, patch 2.7 is out and I've done 4 or 5 seasons total during the course of the game. I spend about 30 hours gearing a character before getting bored and moving on to other games, but I do inevitably come back to do it again because it is fun. You can only trade with people who were there when loot dropped. And for some reason even on my rig, this game stutters a lot in multiplayer, and I'm taking a full point off for that. Apparently it has something to do with wizards and sound issues, but it's really obnoxious and the game used to run better.. Literally unplayable. Game keeps crashing, freezing and disconnecting. I JUST WANT TO PLAY CAMPAIGN MODE. The time I managed to actually play I didn't have fun. It was so boring, bland and too easy I felt I was on pilot mode the whole time. It's a very dumbed down version of the Diablo we know, almost insulting. Not worth the long list of stuff Blizzard tells us to do in able to play a simple story mode. perfect game, good animations, good lighting effects. constant and calibrated mob speed.Chris Metzen once again reveals his talent in lore.. A true redemption for Diablo III. Act V may be a little too short, but this expansion makes it up with lots of content and cool mechanics. Breathes new life into the game.. Best thing happened to D3, but too small for a price. If only they did whole D3 as RoS.. It's an alright game for the first few playthroughs and different classes in terms of gameplay. The grind is real and boring. Nothing much but bad can be said to the story, characters, music and graphics. At least it was fun while it lasted.. Significantly better than diablo 3 without dlc but... still not impressed tho.. I hadn't played this game since 2014, and I just got really impressed playing it the last two months! The end game is very addictive, lots of content has been added, and Blizzard keeps supporting the game and listening to the community with new and adapting content.. D3 is rather poor incomparison to D2:LoD... However, the year is 2020 and I find it ironic, that Diablo 3 is the best product on the battle net app. Everything else there is now crap.. Together with Torchlight 2 and Titan Quest one of the best ARPG I'm aware of. The single player always on DRM ****. The game is a lot of fun as long as you haven't finished the campaign. The modes afterwards only last for a limited amount of time. New content would be welcome.. This game is phenomenal. Every new season is a blast for me and my friends. It's a race to the top and a competition between the clan. We play hard for 2-3 weeks then we are content to wait for the next season and look forward to it's start date. The loot and repeat system that lives in D3 is in fact a rewarding experience, and the builds that you can come up with are a blast. Don't let salty gamers who throw fits when they don't get their way keep you from a rewarding gaming experience. Give this game a chance. Also it's much better with friends when you have someone to have little friendly competitions with.. This game deserves an absolute 0. blizzard's ways have become so disgusting that it shows so much in the future/newer games they have released thus far. My suggestion and perhaps the best suggestion any1 can give is that u stray far away from future blizzard games. The company is actually becoming the new COD series. Every new game they make is always ending up in failure to a significant degree as shown in these ratings and games the released later. Not to mention the random BS that happens in every game. Theyve taken the place where COD left off, money only and little innovation to none at all. A company that was once great is now a company that has lost their ability to create great games and lost their way in life, that be a long time ago. Take my suggestion or not, up to u, but you'll save urself a lot of trouble. If not, well then your just supporting the new COD method.... a blizzard/cod new method. Then it's going to be COD all over again with their ways. I'm glad tho, bc atleast they are cursed with random bs that happens in every game that they make and they don't know how to fix them. More trouble for them. That's one good thing about blizzard, they're stuck with a curse!. I'm glad I only got into Diablo 3 after Reaper of Souls, so I didn't experience the horrible angst we had earlier. I also found that in multiplayer there are many very friendly uber players who would be more than willing to help you level up during Seasons. The only problem I have is that I have so much loot and no space to store them, but that's just a minor issue. Diablo 3, is just a really fun ARPG that satisfied my itch for a quick and fun play each session. And yes, the looting system makes it addictive. Love it.. Unstable connections + rigged win/lose system. The more you pay - the more lucky card draws you'll get. Also a lot of bots that play withour mistakes, farming gold/rank/arena.. RoS fixed many of the problems of Vanilla D3, but the core issue still remains. The game is simply boring. Looting items is an unrewarding experience, identifying legendaries is as exciting as opening and closing a door. Rifts and Bounties are interesting at first, but later on they become a chore. On top of that, in the next year they'll add a new class: the Necromancer, in what they call a class pack. Thanks Blizzard, we have to pay 20$ to do the same mind-numbing, boring grind with a new class. Just abandon this mess and focus on making D4.. I am a long time PC player who played Diablo I as a teenager. I also hated Diablo III and wrote a terrible review of it. Now I revisited the game after years also thanks to my friends. And I have to say that the franchise turned to a perfect state for me. I replayed the story line. I played the game with 3 friends of mine as of Season 8. I may have clocked around 30-40 hours and I have to say that it was a pleasent ride. A summary: 1) Gameplay: Excellent. The game is smooth. I can perform my combo and move around the map almost unihindered. The adjustable difficulty and related rewards make me push me to the limit - but still within the Diablo gameplay. Which means you are the demigod meant to crush the enemies - and die occasionally if you let your wards down. 2) Multiplayer content: Excellent. We have leaderboards that are based on the season which has 3 months duration. If you want to perfect the build and spend hundreds of hours it is there. But you can also just come over once every three months to make the journey again, have maybe 20 hours of fun with new hero and new set and that is it. 3) PC feel: Excellent. Now this is a pet peeve of mine. But the Diablo controls are really meant for the PC gaming. Lately with so many botched console spinoffs this really entered my list of to-watch things. If you have a good PC you will enjoy the game very much. This is the game meant for hardcore PC gamers, And I have to appreciate. Final Verdict: This is solid 8 game for everyone. For me as a long-time Diablo fun and PC enthusiast I added two points. Thank you Blizzard for reacting to criticism and fixing your game. Consider myself as one of the happy customer now. I am looking forward to Diablo IV.. Great expansion. I had a pleasure to complete RoS for a few hours, but it was an incredible experience. The expansion features a great story with a few new characters, locations. Gameplay, however, is still the same. I am looking forward to the next DLCs from Blizzard.. This game is impossible to recommend. It is a soulless copy of D2, that misunderstood most of the game. It runs fine for me the first time, but it never runs like that again. They have an automated system that picks the settings for you and it doesn't work. It actually brakes the game for a lot of people. You can still get it to run again, decently, if you turn every setting to their lowest, available option. Congratulations! Enjoy your unoptimized, stuttering mess.... don't like it? Get it for consoles *troll face* Seriously, how low Blizzard has fallen :(. Reaper of Souls just delivered what the fants wanted! It made D3 awesome again. Most people who still praise Diablo2 over Diablo3 just never played the add-on.. Too little, too late... Diablo fans now are in Path of Exile or Grim Dawn. RoS confirms that this saga will be continuously adding content to maintain us busy but nothing to develop our characters: still no abilities, skill tree, offline, mods... like a webgame that we don't own, the mythical Blizzard from my childhood is no more, this is an online cash register now.... I have never get into D3 end game content, it is just not enough to get me hooked in. But the story and gameplay of D3 are quite good. I think D3 is pretty good game but it is not for everyone. If you like graphics of D3 and like toon of farming, have friends to play with I believe you can fully enjoy it. If you dont like farming like me, I think you can still enjoy the main story of the game and maybe even a little bit of end game content. Graphic - 8 Gameplay - 7 Lasting Appeal - 5 Execution - 7 Overall - 6,75. Not playing in your own region creates tons of posi-glitches and characters are region-locked. PoE doesn't have either. Sometimes magic packs take ages to kill... This problem is created in two manners, how an enemy can have a defensive mod which affects others with the same mod, and how a non-normal enemy has way too much health or resists. Killing rares and bosses is incredibly boring when normals aren't even that fast to kill in general. It might be okay if I were in a high level rift/difficulty since I would be well geared, but you're forcing a slow lengthy grind to find the exact items. It's also a complete waste of time to not get power-leveled if you're new to the game. Oh and... some enemies just knock me over again and again, as if it's some kind of good game design to just dodge one sort of attack many times. Decided to try the game since the market sounded interesting; They removed the market a few days before I bought the game and refused to give me a refund. This game took everything fun about D2 out. I tried playing it since I own it but it's just such a horrible tedious game that it is no fun at all. It's all limitations; you can't trade for stuff you need, you can't give others stuff they need, the game play is repetitive and boring, you could spend years playing but never get what you need to feel like you completed a character.. I was one of those people who refused to buy the RoS expansion because of the pathetic game that diablo 3 vanilla turned out to be. However, the removal of the auction house and the integration of loot 2.0 was a surprising and welcoming change. A few months after RoS had come out, I game the game another chance. Now, after quite a few updates, seasons, and more updates I can say this is a perfect casual ARPG. Perfect, 10/10. Why? Well.. 1. [Variety] From the unique effects of many legendaries and sets, to the endless combination of builds the game offers an extreme amount of replayabilityl especially with the introduction of the LoN set which gives bonus power for each legendary equipped. The LoN set allows any build of the player's creation to be significantly powerful. This set alone fixes build diversity, for the casual players. If you are compeitive there will always be a small subset of builds that perform best. But the majority of the player base is not competitive, so for the majority the diversity and variety is perfect. - [longevity] Seasons were added to keep the game fresh, and ancient items makes it even harder to perfect gear, but all the more satisfying. You will never have perfect gear and although your search for a late game upgrade may be in vain, the possibility of finding the perfect piece of gear will make the hunt feel good, always. -[hardcore mode] despite blizzard's tendency to give in to whining fans (WoW) Blizzard has kept hardcore mode true and has not ressurected any player's hardcore character no matter the reason (even famous streamers who **** up to them). Hardcore offers an entirely different experiences, with identical variety and even more rewarding feelings if you live to feel them. If you want to truly value your character, and truly experience risk, this game mode can provide endless entertainment, especially with friends. Being able to lose items makes them infinitely more precious. In conclusion, Diablo 3 RoS is a game that can be played forever and that can be played effectively in every possible way (thanks to LoN set). Diablo 3 was not in this condition, not even close. I truly believe the expansion has perfected the game. If you are a competitive player, you will most likely have gripes with many aspects of the game, but for people who want to just slay some demons and have fun, this is the perfect game.. Easy fix for D3. This game is a strategic mess as they tried to make it WOW. It has a great storyline, but it is a GRIND. They have never fixed the drop rates (Loot 2.0 is poor) and they concentrate on updating adventure mode only and have abandoned the original adventure completely. This fix is simple ... user controlled leveling and user controlled legendary drop rates. If I can control both of these I can play a quick fun game, other wise it takes hours upon hours to find anything worthwhile, Both Adventure Mode and Paragon were tacked on to the game because the core mathematics are poor (based on the Auction House and users paying dearly to have fun). Allowing user customization would save this game ... many of us have jobs and do not have the time to GRIND! Anyway one at Blizzard listening?. The expansion to the Diablo 3 game has become a joke on the entire franchise. The first thing to notice about the expansion is that everything literally takes place in what is called adventure mode. All updates and content is added with the idea that it is for adventure mode only. The base game and campaign mode (even with the expansion) is now worthless. Secondly the game has become that of a single play style. Grind what is called rifts. Rift when you login, Rift the entire time you are logged in, and then start doing it again when you come back. That is all the game is now. The devs have successfully destroyed all reason to go out into the world of Sanctuary and explore it. Where in the vanilla game you would wander around and grind levels and look for loot or even devise your own runs it is not the case now. Next is that Set gear is the only gear. Before RoS came out you would often see people wearing rare items even and able to play in max difficulty with quality rolled ones. Now rares and legendaries are both junk. You have Ancient quality legendaries which are a must for any item slot you have a legendary in and all of your body armor has to be your Class Set gear and ancient quality not just normal set. What I am saying through all this is the game is pretty much ruined.. After hundreds of hours of gameplay and participation in many of the seasons and changes this game has gone through, I can give a quick overall assessment. I was a huge fan of Diablo 2(thousands of hours), and everyone with experience knows this game does not live up to it as a successor. With that being said, for the money compared to other games, Diablo 3 still provided alot of entertainment for the buck. This is especially true if you like the current format of the game, which includes clearing rifts for the best time, a competitive addition. I overall though have to say I am not thrilled with how this game started out or the directions it went, but I strongly feel giving this game anything under a 7 is unwarranted due to the amount of fun it provided while I was hooked.. The first expansion to diablo 3 really brings some features people longed for. Especially the seasons, the constantly added new legendary items and affixes, the newly developed crafting and upgrade system and the overall constant updates really show that Blizzard tries its best to improve this game more and more. An improvement to the already good vanilla diablo 3.. I gave an high score to this game when ros released, but now i think, after playing many hours in every present arpg, Diablo 3 reserve a score of 7. It has polish, high polish like every blizzard product, but dosent offer enough depth and is catered to much fto a casual crawd. Its okey to target a big audience, but this is to much and the game became just an arcade action game with little choice and depth. 7 is the real score for me now. Diablo 3 started off rough, but the expansion and its future updates - especially the removal of the stupid real money auction house - have rounded it out into probably the best loot-focused action RPG. Insane levels of replay value, but grinding out bounties and Greater Nephalem Rifts does get old after hundreds of times. They have continued to add gear, areas, and the seasons keep it fresh. Worth your time, especially at the current price.. Hello, first of all I would like to say that I was a huge Diablo 2 fan when it came out, so my review is somewhat based on comparing it to Diablo 3 ROS. I did play Diablo 3 when it first came out and beat the game in less than a week and forgot about it - to be honest I was pretty disappointed and found it wasn't quite to my liking. I decided to buy ROS just around the time they released patch 2.4 (I believe) which is Season 5. I could tell upon playing the game again, that they had made a lot of changes to the game and a lot of improvements to when Diablo 3 first came out. The progression feels a lot smoother, (though a little too easy), the gear management, customizing and upgrading systems makes things interesting, and the spells and different character builds are fun to play around with. What is interesting is there are gear incentives to switch builds as well. As a stand alone game (and not comparing it or basing it off of the original Diablo games) it is an entertaining game and I definitely feel like I got my money's worth for around $20 for the expansion pack. The new seasons that come out every 3 months or so give incentives and new content such as gear, and dungeons which, for me, made the end game enjoyable. However the problem I ran into was that after I finished the basic incentive tasks for the season I shied away from the game altogether. It just seems like after a certain point you are grinding into oblivion (which some people may enjoy), constantly upgrading and improving gear, but since playing through the campaign and adventure mode is stimulating you with new content, the end game, to me, seems pointless. Now, I would like to end by comparing it with the previous Diablo games, mainly Diablo 2. Story: What was (more) interesting about Diablo 2, was for one thing the story was dark, grimy very oblique at times and highly stylized. Diablo 3 took the Diablo world and established it for an all encompassing audience, which is fair, but the Diablo 2 environment seemed to have horror elements that intrigued me more-so. Creatures/gameplay: Though Diablo 2 ran on a different engine than the updated and smooth Diablo 3 engine, I found that whilst playing Diablo 2 I paid much more attention to the monsters, and the environments. I think part of this has to do with the difficulty (I'll get to this shortly) - you pay more attention to killing things that really ARE a threat to you. I read another thread about this, and some people speculating on the dimmer lighting in Diablo 2. However, there are some really cool environmental effects, and creatures/creature animations that are in Diablo 3. Difficulty: The difficulty in Diablo 3 was a really big problem for me. For one thing there are at least 10 different difficulties to choose from. The difficulty incentive was confusing for me because you can easily exploit the game by playing minimum difficulty levels and slowly upping the difficulty so you are sort of 'one step ahead of the game', though if you are a speed running type there is a pretty even threshold of difficulty which can make the game worthwhile. Personally I did try to stay pretty high in difficulty to maintain a challenge, but I found the whole difficulty system to be ""average"". In comparison to Diablo 2 where the difficulty seemed to always be a step above you (to Diablo 3's one step below you) so that you really had to work (with character and gear) to progress through just 3 basic difficulties. For some reason that made the grinding more worth it. Multiplayer: I am not a fan of the new **** format, and I found this game too difficult to really bother with the multiplayer aspect. There are pre-made guild channels, and the whole multiplayer format is too 'other-worldly' for me. The old **** (via Diablo 2 for example) kind of defaulted you into channels and guided you into the multiplayer aspect of the game - I found at least - whereas the new **** has it sort of the other way around. Plus the leveling system, which works as something called a paragon, which means once you max to level 70 you get +paragon levels which give you stats, and these paragon levels can range from 60-800 or something, so I feel the multiplayer is probably pretty coordinated around meeting specifications. Trading was also a big aspect of Diablo 2, not prevalent in Diablo 3. However, all in all, Diablo 3 did improve upon what a lot of features in Diablo 2 were frustrating and lacking. The downside is that it dampened on the aspects of Diablo 2 which were dark, epic, and challenging. Unfortunately it feels like an entirely different game altogether, which to be honest I probably would not have played had it lacked the Diablo name. That being said, it is a well designed game, by a thoughtful and innovative gaming company that really did draw me in and was fun and entertaining for the time I was engaged in it.. Waiting queues for a bad solo gaming expierence, good get a 0. still no skill selections, auto leveling, auto adapting monsters to your level wherever you are,no random maps and so on. Fixes everything that was wrong with vanilla Diablo. Adds a functional end-game, and brings lasting content that is also immediately accessible. Unfortunately, it's a little too late for me, since I've moved on to Path of Exile. Vanilla Diablo 3 i'd give a 5/10. Diablo 3 with this expansion is a solid 8/10.. adventure mod is nice. rifts, bounties kanai's cube are new things. more playable after game finished. act 5 is interesting. it is likely diablo 2 and this is good and harder than other acts. new items are more balanced but still no pvp in game and doing same things boring. scenario of act 5 terrible like others. and playable/price is low. I love how they fixed a lot of things from Diablo 3 and always we get new contents every quater. I love this game if love farming u will have to buy this game price is only 20 € :). Reaper of Souls solved many of the origina D3 problems, and dispite I bought, played and enjoyed it, I won't take away the bad taste D3 left two years before. An initial 60€ and a 40€ expansion is way over-priced, s",i'm thankful to the Diablo 3 developers for giving me a game so perfectly attuned to my preferred mode of play and (let's be honest) skill level . every QoL feature missing from D4 is present in the dlc and while it doesn't have the most meaty end game content what you have is still light years ahead of D4 .
769.Little King's Story,"This is literally the best wii game ever made don't @ me like if you haven't played it yet then in the words of scott wozniac get the f*ck out of my face. Quite literally the best game I've ever played. Engaging gameplay, a rich world with quirky yet developed characters, beautiful presentation and music, emotional storytelling, and so many more surprises and story twists than you would expect. This is one of those games that doesn't look like much, but that's what makes it all the more special. It's best played as blind as possible, since the gameplay is very approachable and unlikely to get you stuck (especially since it has three difficulty options that can be toggled at any time). It also supports 6 languages and is very cheap first hand even 11 years later. All I've got left to say is PLAY IT!. I LOVE this game, this game is adorable and challenging which is just perfect!! I lost this game and last time I remember playing it was almost seven years ago, I myself can't believe I still remember the name. Probably because IT'S AN AMAZING GAME!!! GET IT!!! Trust me you'll love it. A thing that I like the most in Little King Story is that it feels and plays like a true videogame, without trying to be a movie or other. After you boot the game, the first thing that appears is the opening sequence which features classical music and a nice introductory sequence to the general theme and mood of the game and does it wonderfully, after that you only need to do the tutorial stuff, pretty straight forward, fun and entertaining, to get the hang of it. The story can be a little weird and some aspects may also feel uncomfortable at first, like the art style that it looks aimed for little kids but a lot of stuff can be more mature that it seems (It's rated T after all) and that's a thing that I commend to this game, is never afraid of doing what is doing or not explain anything at all, at least in a direct way. At first, I was a little confused but as I progressed almost 3/4 of the story everything seemed to make sense and the finale pay off, I'm being nebulous about it not because this game has huge spoilers, but it demands that you have your own interpretations. As for the gameplay and the main reason you'll be playing this, it's a lot of fun. It is a simplified RTS game, its mechanics are simple and have a nice progression system that rewards backtracking in a smooth way. You start with basic units, then with combat specialized units and then with specialized jobs for construction or demolition of several things. My biggest issue comes with the gameplay tho, the selection of your team is quite cumbersome and clumsy and even you start with a clumsier version of it, also, when you're fighting enemies, the control and selection of units can be at times frustrating, this problem is more pronounced with the boss fights, it is never that bothersome but is also consistent and it will be with you through all of your campaign. Boss fights are in my opinion, the cherry of the cake of this game, they're so unique from one another and even twist the genre of this game for good, you'll be surprised with the inventiveness of them, and speaking of boss fights, the music is in charge of Yoko Shimomura of Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy and even Street Fighter fame, there are original compositions but mostly you'll find classical tunes (arranged to this game) which in my opinion were a perfect selection for the general mood and combat, so even when you face frustrating moments given the gameplay or at times tough fights you'll never lose the rhythm or even the adrenaline of this game. As final comments, Little King Story is a solid game that has aged so well in a lot of aspects, you may encounter some serious challenge and at times some technical nuisances but they never are too big to give up this great game.. a truly uniqe game in the strategy/rpg genre, you will probably never play anything like it. it is also quite deceiving, since it looks very kid-friendly, but it is actually very challenging, and recuires a lot of strategy in order to beat the various enemies and bosses scattered across the land. some downsides are the map, and the difficulty of navigiating through it when you get a little further in the game. it also takes quite a long time to upgrade & build your ""kingdom"", since money is a little hard to come buy, at least when you have progressed a bit. all in all, a very unique and fun experience, which you'll probably never play anything like again. definitely worth a pick-up if you're into the genre, it's also quite cheap now.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Wow, what a beautiful surprise that I got with this game! Nice graphics, really original, the game makes you think and gives your the feeling that you game is unique. You will need more than 50 hours to complete it and it will be really worthy. Pretty and funny, but not easy at all. It is a pity that this game has not it´s own saga, but maybe is better like this, because the game is unique.. The more serious gamer has been treated poorly by Nintendo when it comes to the Wii console with a seemingly endless stream of dull mini-game collections and licensed drivel. Once in a while however loyal fans have been rewarded with games such as Super Mario Galaxy and Zack and Wiki which provide something not seen on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3. I can safely say that, with the exception of the two Mario Galaxy games, Little Kings Story is the best of the lot. Little Kings Story is not an easy game to categorise. The closest comparison is probably the two Pikmin titles but by also mixing in elements from RPGs, strategy games and town building sims it truly is something fairly unique. The story itself is fairly simple, the player taking on the role of a young boy who falls into a mysterious world and soon finds himself declared king. Unable to fight yourself the player is able to take control of a set number of villagers in the same manner as the Pikmin titles. These villagers can be lead freely around the large game world to defeat enemies and collect treasure. The income generated from this treasure hunting can be used to improve your kingdom and as the game develops villagers can be trained in a number of skills including combat, farming, carpentry and mining. Balancing the villagers you take with you is vital when traversing the kingdom as each have their own unique abilities, carpenters for example are the only ones who can build bridges to cross rivers. An extra challenge is also provided by enemies known as guardians as well as by other kings hoping to stop your world domination. Simply throwing as many soldiers as possible at the enemy rarely leads to success and the player must quickly weigh up the situation before deciding on which villager types and tactics to use. Interestingly Little King's Story doesn't actually make any use of the Wii's motion controls but while many reviews have commented on the difficulty of selecting and commanding villagers I found that it only took a little practice to get used to the controls. The graphics, whilst perhaps not as crisp as they could be, are also colourful and vibrant helping to create an interesting game world. In fact there are very few criticisms I can level at the game and they are all so minor that they easy to overlook in a game provides well over twenty-five hours of deep and rewarding gameplay that, much like the Mario Galaxy games, offers new ideas from start to finish.. To be honest, when I first saw the game cover and the game pictures on the Internet, I thought ""Wow, this childish game must ****"". Well, that was one of the biggest mistakes I made in my entire life. Little King's Story indeed looks childish, but if you think you're going to play a game where there's no action, no story, and especially with no fun, you're wrong as well. Little King's Story is perhaps one of the best indie games I've played in years. It's fun, it motivates you to keep on making upgrades and EXPLORING. And damn, this is a full meal for people who love exploring maps, discovering secrets, collecting items, making new units, completing missions... Yes, sometimes it gets repetitive, but it's all about how well you play. If you don't play very well, you'll need to keep on doing the same actions to get money do buy upgrades. If you really know how to use your units, you'll be able to do so without grinding. It's a game that somewhat requires you to take a peek at walkthroughs since there are lots of parts where you'll find yourself lost or in need of help, but that doesn't makes the game less worthy of a 10. Even though some people may disagree with me, this game is, in my opinion, the best video-game available on the Nintendo Wii... But it's a shame for the other consoles to miss a game this great. This is a genuine hidden diamond found among the discount bin. A long, extremely fun adventure into a fantasy world which anyone who has a Wii needs to play, and even a reason for other people to buy one.. Little King's Story is the sort of game that is rarely released on a Nintendo console. This is a third party game which is just as good as the best Nintendo games on the console. The story is a funny plot, typical of a good RPG, and the games hero has the potential to become a star of Nintendo gaming. The game can be described as a mixture of the gameplay of the Pikmin games in the world of the Animal Crossing series, along with some of the best graphics on the console. Little King's Story has a charming soundtrack which was made by the same people who compose the music for Kingdom Hearts games. You can notice this throughout the endless hours you can find yourself immersed in this essential game. I can't begin to tell you how good this game is, and a sequel would be a perfect fit for the Wii U. If you have a Wii, buy this game.. Little King's Story, if you liked the style of the original Harvest Moons, and enjoyed Pikmin or Overlord, then you'll like this game. While it does have a cutesy exterior the game is pretty tough. Taking RPG, Strategy, Adventure elements and combining them into one game. Developers Cing (makers of Hotel Dusk, and quickly becoming my favorite new developer) and Town House do an amazing job.. For me, this is the defining Wii game, and one of the great games of the last 5 years. Everyone comments on the charm and I have to, too - it's filled with charm. It creates such a world that you will do any task the game asks of you just to stay in it for one more hour. And then another hour. And then some more. I am often amazed at ingenuity in games, but rarely feel like I really, really like the people who made the game, as is the case with Little King's Story. World class product.. This charming, rewarding, deep, funny and simply awesome game offers top strategy and some of the best music on the Wii. With classical remixes, wonderful enemy design and some nice, bright graphics. Few games offer such a memorable experience, one of the best Wii games ever, and truly essential.","scott wozniac's ""little king story"" is the best wii game ever made . it's best played as blind as possible, since the gameplay is very approachable . the game is also very cheap first hand even 11 years later ."
77.Resident Evil Code: Veronica,"I love this game and everything about it. but the voice acting, characters aged terribly specially steve, he is the most annoying character in all of the franchise. But it still awesome. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. if you want to try the best game in the world ? try code veronica .. 10/10 Worth your time. Excellent stages, very good story, fun puzzles, variety of items and in general terms very good game.. This is the best of the classic games in my opinion. It has the best story, characters and atmosphere. It has the best from each of its predecessor, making it the best classic Resident Evil has to offer. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite its lack of number, Resident Evil Code: Veronica feels every bit like a mainline installment, arguably even more so than the actual Resident Evil 3. While at its core, Code: Veronica is not much more than what you already love about the classic Resident Evil games, its execution is every bit a strong as its predecessors.. first of all, don't listen to kids here who cry about limited ammo and saves. this generation is spoiled by easy games and want unlimited lives and games that hold your hand without having to think. asking why there was a tank control also shows a lack of researching abilities and also intelligence. it would have been first person if the hardware had been able to at that point in time. best RE there ever was but it aged a bit poorly. nonetheless it has the best story, puzzles and settings. amazing graphics, due to the dreamcast ofc. cream of the crop. First of all, let's talk about the graphics. They were atrocious! I could hardly believe that this was a game for the Dreamcast, considering how outdated and pixelated everything looked. The character models were clunky and lacked any semblance of realism. It felt like I was controlling blocky mannequins rather than actual characters. And the controls! Who on earth thought these controls were a good idea? They were beyond frustrating and completely unresponsive. Trying to aim at enemies was a nightmare, and I ended up wasting so much ammunition just trying to get a decent shot. The gameplay was just as bad as the graphics and controls. The puzzles were nonsensical and poorly designed, leaving me scratching my head more often than not. The difficulty curve was all over the place, with some sections being mind-numbingly easy and others seemingly impossible. It felt like the developers were just trying to pad the game's length without any thought for the player's enjoyment. Let's not forget the infuriating save system. Limited save ribbons? Seriously? Who has time for that in this day and age? I want to enjoy my gaming experience, not be constantly stressed out about when the next save point will come around. It felt like the game was punishing me for even attempting to progress. And the story? Laughable. The plot was convoluted and filled with more plot holes than a sieve. I struggled to connect with any of the characters, who were as one-dimensional as they come. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the voice acting was so bad it made me want to mute the game entirely. Code Veronica was certainly one of the most Resident Evil games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely my least favorite Resident Evil game (followed with Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 2 Remake). Very frustrating gameplay, total lack of ammunition, and a dull story overall that just didn't keep me engaged enough to suffer through the poor gameplay.. This was the first horror game, and the first Resident Evil game I had ever played. It was an eye opening experience to me at about 11 years old (I know, but I blagged my parents into thinking it was far less gory) Playing through this about 4 times on my Dreamcast was basically a religious experience for me. Possible some of the best times I had as a kid.. this is the best RE game and the peak of the dreamcast era. best story, super puzzles and the characters are well chosen. it would be a shame if Capcom wouldn't remake/reimagine that masterpiece. Unbelievable, one of the best games in history, without a doubt, the best for me after Resident Evil 4. Absolutely phenomenal, my favorite game of all time. I've played it countless times and to this day I still enjoy it as if it's my first time.. Taking place right after RE2/RE3, Code Veronica combines 2 out of the 4 previous lead protagonist in Claire Redfield as she tracks down her brother Chris in the arctics. Dreamcast version was amazing.. The story of the game is incredible and exciting, the characters are very well developed, the villains are spectacular. With scary scenarios that combine perfectly with the survival horror genre, in addition to a perfect soundtrack, nostalgic, that fully matches every moment of the game, that speaks to you, makes you feel scared, desperate, thrilled, as if it were you within the game. Resident Evil Code Veronica, for me, is the best game in the series, which will be forever in the memory of fans, being a reference in history, setting and soundtrack.","despite its lack of number, Code: Veronica feels every bit like a mainline installment . the graphics were atrocious and lacked any semblance of realism . the voice acting, characters aged terribly especially steve, he is the most annoying character ."
770.Pro Evolution Soccer 2016,"Finally playable after bad pes 2014 and pes 2015 , awesome update , easy to score , balanced ai , very well. Here the change began! PES is approaching its competitor in leaps and bounds! Great Job.. PES is now the undeniable king. What a great game, the most complete football game in 10 years. The only bad thing is still getting official rights but other than that this is a solid football game.. Konami are back on top! Finally a game that is on par with the PS2 era games. Such a long wait. Ok. I preloaded the game and have been playing for several hours since the release. The game is actually better than the demo. You can lower the speed of the game which seems a bit quick on default. GAMEPLAY: This PES just works. The dribbling and passing is very very good. The game is responsive and the shotting feels good. The animations helps to bring the game closer to life. You never score the same goal twice. I have been playing FIFA for the past few years, but I can confidently say that this year PES is the much better game. 2015 was good, but not great. PES 2016 is a much better one. It is so responsive, like PES 5/6. I played the FIFA 16 demo, and the players feel clunky and the game feels so linear compared to PES. PRESENTATION: On the presentation side, this game is a bit of a disspointment. The Menus are bland and confusing, and the English commentary is very poor, and sometimes behind the game. Fortunately I play with Argentine Spanish narration, which is much much better. Konami needs to work on presentation for 2017, these menu's with tiles just dont work in my opinion. Please Konami, new menus, and what happened to the amazing opening videos of the past? GRAPHICS: The Fox Engine is helping PES become a better looking game. While not on par with MGSV graphics, it is quite an improvement to PES 2015. Particularly the pitches look much better, finally Konami focused on this, and I hope they do so more and more for next year. In closeups, it looks fantastic. From distance, it is a good looking game. Not a fantastic one, but does not subtract from the gameplay. About licences, same as always with PES. But once the community option files to patch the license issues are out, the game will be quite amazing. In conclusion, this couild probably be the best football game in 10 years. Good job to Konami and keep working hard for next year. This years game is a solid 9/10. This game is much closer to a 9 than any football game has been this decade. While it feels like FIFA does not know how to improve their game anymore, PES' future looks very bright. If you are on the line, buy it. You will have a lot of fun.. I am a fan of football games. PES i tried, had a good run but ultimately i did not have ""a run"" at all. Won League, cup, champions league to find out YOU don't play the game, PES/Konami plays for you. It is to obvious. Like i said i like football games, mainly as i control the players. In PES you don't control them, sadly. The management system is very nice hence i gave a 2 score. The actual gameplay lets it down and after all that is most important. Rubber band well let's not even start....(UPDATE) I have now found out much off the rubber banding can be overcome with ensuring full fitness, motivation and different tactics being used. Rubber banding still there but less of an issue. No injuries and no fouls is a big let down making me believe Konami does not test their game before issue. I cannot score higher than a 5. Dear konami please can you tell me why your referee not whistle fauls? Big false. Sountrack is badly too, with only +-14 songs. + gameplay good + uefa licences + usb transfer licences. Well i like this better than fifa games playability wise thats wat matters anyway but the music tracks and commenarty are rubbish i have the music off and the volume down low lol but overall a great footie game ;p. Good game with amazing graphics and authenticity. Really enjoyed Myclub. However lacks in licensing, transfer updates poor and online matches often affected by glitches allowing users to cheat.. For me was the referee, this is the worst part, you can not do a nothing because is yellow card, if you see the scene again it is not, but always yellow card. Also why if someone takes the ball the other player does not react, it takes some delay because players are slow to know he is not with the ball.... so stupid gameplay. I am a huge fan of PES 2006, PES 2010, PES 2013. But truly, this is the worst PES ever! Hard to control, no innovation from Konami, players move like robot, such a wasting time and money. Don't buy this game!. The PES 2016 demo and trailers initially seemed like worth enough of a buy for me to ditch FIFA this year, but the game has since then successively let me down, over and over... And over. First of all, when the game was released it seemed highly unfinished and a lot of key details were missing, like team updates, functioning online modes and things along those lines. As you play the game more and more, you notice how wildly inconsistent it is. For example, sometimes your players play well, and at other times the AI is so **** your defenders just stand there like they've seen a ghost when the opposition is literally right next to them, ready to take a shot. Or your midfielders just run with the ball in a straight line until they eventually lose possession. (This is the mode where you control one player on the field) Another extremely annoying inconsistency are the animations in the game, for passing, shooting, dribbling, etc. Sometimes they look really realistic and neat, and other times they look super jerky and robotic. Speaking of dribbling, the controls for it are really impractical. It can be compared to doing the most advanced fatalities in Mortal Kombat while at the same time keeping your eyes on the pitch and players. Goalkeepers are one of the most ridiculous features in the entire game. They are utterly **** horrendous. The way you take shots in 1 v 1-situations often looks and feels bad, so you think, ""wow that was a bad finish, literally in the center of the goal with little to no power in it"", but still they go in like 9/10 times because the goalkeepers are so **** bad. SO BAD. My first games or so I just thought it was another one of the consequences for releasing the game at a highly unfinished stage, but nope. They're still absolutely ****, and Konami seems to be quite content even after thousands of people have complained about it. The last thing I want to take up are the referees. I can find no other explanation for the absolute abomination the referees are, other than that the development crew, was watching the UFC or the WWE or something one night, and thought: **** it. We'll just incorporate these types of referees into to our game, that doesn't give out yellow cards until players are either unconscious or dead."" This game had a lot of promise. Sometimes it has golden moments where the gameplay flows and the animations look pretty, and the AI isn't acting up - but unfortunately and ultimately, those moments are like spotting a falling star. I would not recommend buying this game. (No, I don't feel the need to mention the licensing thing since that is pretty much out of their hands. They can't compete with EA. Such is the industry.). Even at its lowest point during the Xbox360/PS3 days I've always preferred the Pro Evolution Soccer series to EA's FIFA games but, in the last couple of years, PES has really started to find its feet again to the extent where there really is just no comparison as to which is the best in my mind. The 2016 iteration builds upon last years excellent effort by improving the fluidity and removing a few of the frustrating elements (such as the slight delay when passing and unstoppable rainbow flick) and, whilst its still not quite perfect, it is certainly the best football game money can buy.. Thought I'd give this a go having moved from PES to Fifa in 2010. It gets marks for better soundtrack and the gameplay in general is better than Fifa 16 but unfortunately there are just too many bad points which makes it an unenjoyable experience. The Menus look good but the difficulty in doing basic tasks massively lets it down, updating national teams is a chore, no thought seems to have gone into transfer negotiations, players stats dropping significantly if played slightly out of position, inconsistent player ratings, most of the premier league having names like East London and player faces from those teams being wildly generic, West Ham have 2 kits that look nothing like the real thing (one is white and yellow striped?!). The commentators are so tediously boring and often sound out of place. The pitch is just a lifeless dark green with no real vibrant colours that stand out. I found it impossible to get immersed in the career mode (master league) experience with so much that was taking away from it, it didn't feel like I was managing my club, it felt like I was managing a randomly generated team that shared no similarities with the real club other than the player names. It's a shame because the gameplay was an improvement on Fifa 16, but the whole thing just seems lifeless.. I played a match against chelsea on a hard difficulty , they made three first half goals without my team to touch the ball and my only goal this it to jump for nothing , I decreases the difficulty and reniciei the match, Chelsea made ​​3 goals in the first time again, the same way and well fast , restarted the game 5 times and all this repitiu , this game is programmed to win and you can not beat the player this game makes our team stop playing , the catch defenders , goalkeeper does nothing and their defense is unbearable , this game is a thief and never foul , hated this PES2016. The game would be perfect for me, if not for goalkeepers who occasionally let the team down, and the fact that scripting is sometimes more of a factor than quality of play here. I have programming experience, so I understand the need for scripting, but the fact is, sometimes the opponent's quality of play doesn't matter as much as the various things that PES adds up to create a unique in-game opponent. It just isn't very realistic at times, and while the randomness can be fun, it can also be a real stressfest. Negative comments aside, this game has the best outfield play that I've ever experienced in a footballing sim, and the defending is actually fun and rewarding when you get it right. Offense is fast, inventive, and merciless on the break, and scoring a quality goal is a rewarding experience. The pace really feels natural, and congrats to PES for outscoring FIFA in this department of footballing ""tempo"". It matters to us as players and footballers.. It absolutely doesn't deserve high praise. It's a dumbed down Pes 2015, that was already a dumbed down version **** Pes. Gameplay is too basic, some flaws are present since Pes 2014 yet worse. It's too easy to score, too easy to run past defenders and score at least 3-4 goals every match this way. GKs are not good enough, their animations are not good, some are really terrible. Pace is too high. Definitely more than a step down compared to Pes 2015.. Game ****, i have been a big fan of pes but it seems to get worse every here and this is the last of the pes versions am getting Game ****, i have been a big fan of pes but it seems to get worse every here and this is the last of the pes versions am getting Game ****, i have been a big fan of pes but it seems to get worse every here and this is the last of the pes versions am getting Game ****, i have been a big fan of pes but it seems to get worse every here and this is the last of the pes versions am getting. This game is really something good. You feel like you are in a real stadium playing real games. The fact that you can play UEFA Champions league is very satisfying, and makes this game better than EA Sports Fifa 16. Looking forward to play the 17th version of PES, & wondering what new features will be in it.. Graphics: 7.8 Sound: 8.2 Gameplay: 7.5 Fun/Story: 7.2 Not as good as described by media. Overall is a good improvement but it lacks some veracity either in fictitious teams and players, either in gameplay. The way to score goals is identical as much as you play. Like Fifa 2016, is just a good game but a revolution is mandatory in both of them.. Pes 2016 is a footie game for people who actually want to play a very life like football sim. Tactics and skill are as important as the other and any fifa player who steps into pes will instantly hate it because skill moves mean nothing on this game. All the bad reviews are probably from idiots who assume all games should take a leaf out of fifa's which thankfully pro evo haven't. Awesome game!!. There are a few things that make this game unplayable. First of all, this looks like an UFC game, everything is valid and nothing is a fault. The AI for the defenders that are not selected is terrible, they literally stay still doing nothing, and even the switching the players using ""L1"" is terrible. No one said this here, and that is probably my fault then, but i don't know how to receive a pass in this game, i tried everything and every single time the receiver just advances the ball to much i don't know how is that possible. Lastly, and one of the most annoying things is the fact that an action stays for ever in memory. I never reviewed a game before but i felt an urgent necessity to review this game. Don't know how people can rate this game higher than 5.. dont be put off by the lack of licencing - it can be fixed in minutes ;-) beautiful graphics and seamless game play. simply the best football game to be developed to date, period.. Great game overall, We can say this year PES2016 is much better than FIFA16 in terms of gameplay . The gameplay in PES2016 is miles ahead of FIFA16 but its not perfect. The game still lacks of licenses and leagues, online games can sometimes be frustrating because of the lag and you can notice at times a 1 second delay, goalkeepers give weak goals and allow way too many rebounds, high scoring games are pretty frequent because of inconsistent goalkeepers,Myclub mode missing transfer market and I am not a fan of spending money to get random players Not all is bad I like the graphics and the fact that we are able to import kits for unlicensed teams which makes them look better than in FIFA. The last game in this series I enjoyed ""to the max"" was Pro Evolution Soccer 6 on Playstation 2. When the series made the jump to the 7th generation of video games, it appeared to have fallen from grace, while FIFA just done something completely right, all of a sudden. I go for the football game that I enjoy the most each year, I don't have an allegiance and I enjoy whatever game clicks to me. PES 6 was where the series just got it right. It was just, near-perfection. For me, though, between 2007 and 2013, the games just fell flat on their back side. I got my first bitter taste of the series when I played PES 2008. It was just not as good as PES 6 was and since I no longer had my PS2, I didn't really have a good football game to enjoy. I just bought FIFA 08 out of impulse and I loved it. It was such an improvement over the last 3-4 FIFA games, and I have bought every FIFA game since, I even have FIFA 16 and it is brilliant, still. During these times, I did still try out every PES game that was released, just to see if it was any better. While they were..... okay.... they weren't as enjoyable as they used to be for me. PES 2009 was an improvement from 2008 but I believed it still had a long way to go. When PES 2016 was announced, nothing really grabbed my attention until I heard that you could, once again, customize your kits/leagues/emblems, etc. on PS4. (I know it's an obviously permanent feature on PC but I'm in no position in my life to always play my PC. I take my console(s) everywhere I go). This alone sparked my interest, because it was the first feature I was introduced to with PES 3, and it is my most favourite feature of the series between PES 3 and PES 6. As I write this review, I have PES 2016 in my PS4 library, and I absolutely love it. While I do love FIFA 16 for different reasons, PES 2016 is just a bit special this year, for me. I have barely played much matches due to relaxing and customizing/updating/editing everything. I love it. I can make the game look and feel how I want it to. If I want to , I can edit any league I want, I can delete one league and replace it with an entirely new, and different league. I can do anything I set my mind to in PES 2016 and that is what makes this game so different to that of it's EA counterparts. I don't ""hate"" FIFA. I don't ""hate"" rival games, I think that's silly. I love all games for what they are and I don't hate games for not being what I want them to be. A game is what a game is. FIFA 16 is what FIFA 16 is. Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 is what Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 is. It's the football fan's football game. It has so many deep gameplay aspects and tactics. It has the beloved Master League, which is even better now with the likes of the UEFA Champions/Europa leagues embedded into it. I know it was always there with ""WEFA"" but having the license there just gives it some identity, for lack of a better term. The only game mode I have not touched and probably never will is MyClub. It's not an anti-PES, ""I-prefer-Ultimate-Team"" opinion - I don't like Ultimate Team that much, either - I'm just not an online gamer as much as I used to be, so I don't pay attention to it. Enough reminiscing. PES 2016 is, by leaps and bounds, much better. The series has seemingly came out of it's dark cave and it looks to be a strong competitor once again. And competition is damn healthy. Why? Because if you have competition, you will strive to make your game be ten times better than the supposed opposition. And that means PES can only get better from here, if the developers keep their ideas bucked up. Personal highlight for me, and the best PES game in such a long time. 8/10 PROS -Faster-paced gameplay than previous instalments. -File Importing is back! (on PS4) -Commentary is much improved thanks to Peter Drury -Seemingly endless customization opportunities -Gorgeous animations -Official Tournament Atmosphere (UEFA CL etc.), making them actually stand out. CONS -No Option File sharing, making customizing your kits/leagues/emblems a bit tedious for some. -It's a nit-pick, but replays are still a bit slow-paced for my liking. (probably shouldn't include this as a factor into my rating) If there are any more Pros and Cons I missed, it's because these were all that stood out for me and I'll probably see more the more I play, I doubt there's anything remotely worse than the issues I stated, though. Call this a rose-tinted review or whatever, but I am so happy this game is fun for me once again. PES 2016 is brilliant, and I highly recommend anyone who has been ignoring the franchise for a while to come back and try it. I do not think you will be disappointed.. Worst online game I have ever seen. Offline is perfect, but online.... Sorry Konami but this is my last PES. Do it something with online, or bye bye bye.. I swear I tried to have fun, but the game is simply a mess, our players are confused and stupid, not know how to rebound, run and not in 4 attacks from the opponent were 4 goals, while I get some 15 to 2 or fewer goals, this game is a cheat in normal mode and just buggy in commands, terrible waste of money. Its a good thing they released free PES 2016 myclub. My excitement quickly turned into furastration and anger at just how bad this game is. The controls are awkward, making you feel as if your controller is not respobsive and you end up pressing buttons harder than usual with no improvement in responsiveness. The goalkeepers are programmed to rarely catch the ball. They often punch the ball towards opposing players making for the most ridiculous goals. Thats just the beginning. I do not want to ever hear of pro evolution soccer ever again. Avoid this game, do not be fooled by the high critic reviews on this site.. I was a huge fan on PES on PS1 and PS2 and I have to say that I was almost unbeatable on it (:)), but then as all PES fans I was very disappointed by the game on PS3. I just bought a PS4 and PES 2016, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I won't say that it's as good as it used to be on PS2, but definitely much better than on PS3. The freedom of play is back which was my favorite aspect. I'm just reeducating myself to the game but I'm getting really frustrated by two big aspects of the game though. The first one is that the keepers are definitely a joke! Konami didn't work at all on that aspect. Basically it's 1 shot on target = goal, almost 9/10! So as soon as you make a mistake in defense, it's a goal conceded! Then the second aspect is the computer players in your team (which you can't control) lack intelligence. When you are the player having the ball and want to give it to another player, the player almost stays still unless if it's a striker. For example if my center mid has the ball, my other center mid or my wingers barely propose solutions, I'm force to look for my strikers. Apart from these two aspects, I think the game itself has improved a lot. One other downside I've also noticed is in the Master league where it's not realistic. For example, teams like West Ham signing Lewandoski or Southampton signing Rooney. It's way too easy to sign players. Once again I think that they have improved a lot compared to when they were on PS3 but there is still lots of room for improvement.. Periodically I try to get in to football games, be it PES or FIFA and no matter how hard I try I just can't. The time it takes to master these games, the intricacies, controls, tricks and commands; its just not worth it unless these are the only games you want to focus on for the next year. The team mate AI is hopeless, I can't understand why after all these years players run toward the ball in open space, get a metre away from it then turn round and run in the opposite direction. Players are also to stupid to make runs into space to receive a through ball. Controlling, first touch, dribbling, contesting for the ball in the air are all totally random. Shooting is still an absolute horror and remains as broken as it was 10 years ago. The lack of official teams and competitions is a joke. Konami, if you can't get the licenses why do you bother? Yeah, it looks ok but I could be better. Load times are too long. Menu music is repetitive and unvaried. Personally I think the people that rave about this game have low expectations when it comes to football, fun and enjoy bashing FIFA. I don't play FIFA, I don't really play PES but as someone who played Football/Soccer competitively for 18 years all I can do is fault this and pick it apart as the flawed sporting sim that it is.. Im not going as far as saying this is the best football game ever, but its easily the best I've played since the old PES 2016. PES 2015 was also a pretty solid game, and in terms of gameplay was already the best game of the current generation. PES 2016 is even better in that aspect. The gameplay is more fluid, and you get that old feeling you have full control of what is happening on the pitch. For someone who love tactics, there is no football game that is better in that aspect. The customization options is pretty amazing. The best feature is fluid formation, that let you create two differente approachs when you are with or without the ball. While FIFA series is fasting moving torwards the arcade territory, PES is really a football simulator. Playing PES 2016 I remembered what a good football game is about. Its not emulating tv presentation, or online game modes where you buy or sell players. Football game is about gameplay. In terms of gameplay there is one problem: while in PES 2015 the referee was way too rash, here is too lenient. Graphics received a huge improvement from the last entry, and the Fox Engine can produce here more realistic models and kits textures than EA's Ignite engine. In FIFA the players look like wax models, and the kits look plastic, but the pitch, stadium and crowd are still behind EA's game. Master League is improved in terms of presentation and now after each month you receive detailed stats about your team. PES series always lacked the mamoth lincenses of FIFA, but now PS4 players can add kits and badges to unlicensed teams. There are more stadiums available, and now you can even use licensed stadiums as the home for any team. Thats a big improvement, since in PES 2015 we were basically stucked with 4 generic stadiums, and two of them had that South American feel, so if you were playing Master League with a english team, for example, you were basically playing every season game in the same stadium. Now Liverpool's new home might be Allianz Arena. My Team is a poor attemp to emulate the FUT, so if the major FIFA's for you is FUT, you won't be happy with PES. The mode feels too restrictive with RPG elements and you can't even change your team's tactics, instead you must hire a manager that uses specific tactics that can't be change. If you manager to build a decent squad, you must hire a manager with a specific level, otherwise your team chemistry will drop to 1, and that means you are going to lose every match you play. Konami servers are still far from stable, so its not uncommon experiecing delay that makes the game unplayable. Despite not being the perfect football game, PES 2016 renewed my desire to play a football game again. Instead of get pissed, even during my defeats I still enjoyed playing this game. This football for you.. Pro Evolution Soccer is in many aspects a good game, but for me, it isn't nearwhere good enough. Game physics are great, and graphics are good when the sun is shining. Unfortunately, almost every master league match is played at night.. Which makes the game look like a PS2 game. I wont reccomend u to buy this game unless u want to spend way to much money in a game you will find boring after only playing it a week or so. It is alot of potential in the PES series, but they are way behind fifa and many other sports games when it comes to animations, replays, highlights, commentators, match screens, menus, music, game modes, loading time... In general, there are to many things that makes me feel that this game is unfinished and not good enough considering we are in 2015. + player models, likenes and faces ( some faces are absolutely stunning!) + cut scenes, they are really cool, so i wish there was more of them + gameplay, better than FIFA, even though there are way to few animations - the game is dull from the very first moment you play it. Few songs, boring menus and colours and meaningless game modes (u wont earn any money or experience points..., and where the heck is the communication with club owner, players etc?!) - bad graphics, even though it looks stunning in replay sections - it isn't worth the money, because many of the transfers are undone, and you cant import more than 250 kits which is to few. Editing takes way to long time, but you have to do it if you want to play a realistic master league. The game is unfinished, and i reccomend you to skip pes 2016. Pro Evolutions Soccer franquise this time has recovey its magic and it's the best soccer simulator, since 10 years ago I dont feel the soccer too realistic.. Well i like this better than fifa games playability wise thats wat matters anyway but the music tracks and commenarty are rubbish i have the music off and the volume down low lol but overall a great footie game ;p. How ANYONE can give this game a review of 8 or 9 is beyond me. I made the decision to move from FIFA to PES based on others reviews of this game, and it has made me very wary of listening to others again! It's not unusual for Master League games to end 7-5 or 8-3. This is supposed to be a realistic simulation of top level football. It certainly isn't that. The licences (or lack of them) are a joke. And being used to FUT, the PES equivalent is extremely poor. I perservered for a couple of weeks with this game, but couldn't take it any more. Graphics are poor, commentary is OK, not great. The loading times between screens are pitiful. This isn't a game you can pick up and play in 30 seconds. Not many plus points for me. Traded in for another game (not FIFA either, think I'll give both football titles a miss until they make major improvements).. Not perfect, but still magnitudes better than FIFA I've been playing PES 2016 for a while now and I've never had again the ""this game is ****ing ****, I'll quit and just delete the game"" rage which I constantly felt when playing FIFA 16. Sure it has its flaws but overall it's still a much better use of your money than FIFA. The following are details pros and cons: Cons: Throughballs are still a kind of ridiculous and many players would just spam through balls all the game. Tackles are extremely easy to make and almost no fouls will get called whatsoever. I've not even got one single penalty (both sides) up to now which is in sharp contrast with FIFA 16. Though to be honest I'd rather there be less fouls/cards than way too many. The online season mode matchmaking has a huge flaw: having no option to limit your opponent's team to a similar level as yours is incredibly dumb. The whole world is just spamming Real Madrid/PSG/Bayern and playing long balls to death, and thus you can hardly enjoy your favorite team. The idea of earning more points if you win with weaker teams is a nice one but in reality it doesn't work because you mostly don't stand a chance to win at all and thus always get 0 points! Though I'd say playing with a 4-4.5 star team is still passable. Pros: Despite the above, it's still massively more coherent and much less frustrating than FIFA 16 where the whole game mechanics is just hopelessly broken. PES might have overdone some stuffs but it's much better than FIFA's broken ones. In FIFA you easily dribble the whole pitch at kick off yet after that your every move will be a struggle because of the incredibly frustrating passing AI and the otherworldly GKs; also every move from you towards the opponent becomes a yellow card/penalty which is nuts. I don't see the ""dumb GK"" issue in PES: They save about the right amount of goals AFAIK. Maybe it's because I bought the game just now and they made some patches. The only issue is corners where the GKs are basically doing nothing and they're a bit too easy to score from IMO. The commentary is actually OK and I don't get why many people say its commentary is much worse than FIFA. IMO FIFA's commentary is bland as hell and says a lot of incredibly useless and stupid things. In PES while the commentary frequency is not as high, they at least show some proper passion and don't sound much perfunctory/stupid. Sure the game doesn't have Bundesliga and some other licensing. But for me, I mostly follow PL and mostly play online season mode so that's not really a concern for me. National teams are always available to choose from and they should already help you plenty. Sure if you want a truly immerisve experience in the footballing world such as single player master league or ""become a legend"" PES is not as good as FIFA. But for those things I'd be playing Football Manager instead of these games whose focus is just not on these non-game aspects anyways. For me the only point of these games is the match engine itself, and on this one PES wins totally, hands down.. Hey, Fifa fan boys, stop reducing our PES user score here. You can't just accepted that you lost this time. PES is here, best gameplay experience, stunning visuals, improved commentary. PES IS EVERYTHING YOU WANT ON TO SEE ON FOOTBALL SIMULATION GAME. We will, we will ROCK YOU!!!! The","the game is responsive and the shotting feels good . the presentation side of the game is a bit of a disspointment . from distance, it is a good looking game ."
771.Shogun: Total War Warlord Edition,"In spite of the fact this ""new trailer"" doesn't hold a candle to inspiring any kind of mood deserved of this classic and revolutionary computer strategy wargame -- in great contrast to the original dreamtime interactive intro movie which featured a clip from the very fitting, critically acclaimed 1985 Akira Kurosawa film ""RAN"" overlaid with music by BAFTA award winning game industry instrumentalist Jeff van Dyck, this title will always maintain a prominent place on my shelf.. Near perfect! One of the best strategy games available! Graphics are still good for a game of its time. Captures the intense strategic decisions on the battlefield in feudal japan very well.. Shogun Total War is one of those games that allows you dream of how to gloriously command thousands (or, at least, dozens) of screaming samurai. By allowing devious flanking tactics, or encouraging heroic frontal assaults, STW was the first game to depict the frantic action of real time strategy with mainstream success. Which, when you consider that the game was originally intended as a 2D strategy game, makes this game a definitive milestone of the RTS genre. The strength of game is its simplified unit interaction: like paper (spears), scissors (cavalry) and stone (archers) ever unit beats and counters an other unit. Unlike the expansive RTS units of SupComm or SCII, mastery of unit types should be expected in hours rather than weeks. There's no seeking for the 'overbalanced' unit combination or the perfect build-order in this game; only blood and thunder battlefield fighting. Ten years after first release, the gameplay still holds up surprisingly well. The kill rate of units is low (perhaps too low!) but this places a greater emphasis on the paper-scissor-stone principles by which the game runs. Add into this the significant effect of hills (archers will beat infantry with a height advantage in melee) and flanking (even now tying an enemy head-on with infantry and flanking with cavalry is the RTS staple tactic) and you have warfare that is satisfyingly expansive. By expansive I mean there is a real feeling that a smaller army can defeat much larger numbers with superior tactics. Such victories exploit the game's excellent morale model. You don't need to kill every soldier to win a battle. Even now I can remember battles a decade imprinted on my memory - the enemy ushered through a valley to attack my weakened archers; the hidden charge from woods; and the routing of one flank that rolls down the rest of the enemy until a fresh force flees from my emergent (and no doubt grinning) general. The campaign mode itself was pleasingly simplified. I always played as Shimazu (the green ones) not least because they were tucked away in the corner. As always in such strategy games, no-one has yet devised a way to counteract strategic AI. In the end game, I always faced off the Hojo clan who had horded dozens of armies into a few spaces. While something that I accepted at the time, these days such a gameplay facet would (rightly) demand a patch, or simply recognise that the campaign is won when 50% of map is yours. The expansion pack (part of this game) goes some way to addressing these problems but it still lets slip with the overpowered brutality of the mongol heavy cavalry. Having spent 100s of battles watching body counters drop a man at a time, the shock at seeing multiple people die at once is enough to make the mongol expansion feel like the challenge of countering a truly warmonging race with what are essentially a civilised people. So should you own and play this game because it defined a genre? The graphics are, admittedly, pixilated with a 680 resolution. The campaign can drag on. Heavy cavalry aren't my first choice when I have infinite money. And the bridge battles are immensely arduous tests of attrition. But the immersion is still there. The sound is evocative of the Sengoku period and the battlefield principles are still refreshingly straightforward and effective. If you win a battlefield, you really feel a sense of control. Even more so than a ctrl + A then right click on their general. I've owned three copies of this game - you should grace your collection with one.","""shogun total war"" is a classic and revolutionary computer strategy wargame . the strength of game is its simplified unit interaction . kill rate of units is low, but this places a greater emphasis on paper-scissor-stone ."
772.Serious Sam: The First Encounter,"This game can be a SERIOUS challenge, but fun. Having 100 enemies on screen was revolutionary for 2001 (Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead would expand on this) but this is overall a great game. You get a good amount of guns to play with and the enemies just keep on coming. The map layouts can get confusing at points and the skeleton kleers are so **** annoying I hate them. This game is good for people who like boomer shooters and like to shoot everything in sight.. Classic boomer shooter. Better than 2 (I hate Serious Sam 2). Not too much else to say except for that I would recommend if you wanna get into some boomer shooter action.. While this formula for a FPS at the time was a bit more novel, a second look at it will show it wares thin quickly and way over stays it welcome.. 2001 GOTY, just one of the best single player FPS you can find, multiplayer is fun as well, and a gigantic amount of mods, make this one of the best games of its genre. Definitively a must-play.. Yeah, it's all fun and games untill somebody loses an eye. . . . .. the game of my child hood i have tears in my eyes after playing it again those days and it is still playable.... The original Serious Sam is wild, non-stop action-packed adventure with hordes of enemies and fun weapons. A cult classic gem.. This game is very good in terms of a first-person shooter, Sam's arsenal is huge. The number of cards to pass inspires as well as the number of enemies (the most infuriating of which is the Кleer Skeleton). The phrases of The Main Character are simply gorgeous. Definitely 10/10.. Serious Sam The First Encounter Serious Sam The First Encounter Serious Sam The First Encounter. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best old school shooter i dont know what to say more they want me to write more. All I can say is... AAAAAAAAAAAAAA yourself One of the few games that reminds me childhood.. That game was huge at this point of time. Loved it, can't count the playthroughs.. great game!!!!great game!!!!great game!!!!great game!!!!great game!!!!great game!!!!. I really like this game this game is perfect but sometimes so many enemie comes and its hard to fight thats why I rated 9 out of 10 THIS GAME IS **** PERFECT. Mass murder is funny isn't it? Now that that's out of the way let's talk about a unique franchise called Serious Sam. Serious Sam which has had a lasting legacy, not on the gaming industry but on the fans. Serious Sam which, despite being relatively archaic in culture and design, has survived to this day. Serious Sam which is a franchise I've now ran out of grandiose statements to make about. Serious Sam. And I play this game and I wonder why. Why has this strange cult classic had the staying power that better games failed at? I'm not saying this to reproach the game or fans. I genuinely believe it's an interesting case study. Let's discuss why: I played this game a lot when I was younger and had fewer games to play, and it was great. I played it again just now and I did not enjoy myself nearly as much. Narratively, it's good. It isn't intended to be a philosophical space opera. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. So narratively, all we're asking for here is slight context for the gameplay. It does just that and adds a few punchlines in for good measure. Nothing hysterical, but a few good lines that truly reflect the early 2000s absurdist comedy culture in the games industry. In so many ways this game parodies its predecessors, DOOM and Duke Nukem. But it doesn't stay long. Some scrawling text at the beginning and cheap one-liner at the end. We're losing a war against an alien empire and Sam travels back in time to stop it. I have no idea what our goal is in travelling back in time. But hey, Sammy is an improv kinda guy. Art-wise, the game once again reflects the time and inspirations. I love ancient Egyptian aesthetics in games, but not much is really done here with it. It's basic geometry tailored to create a functional battle arena rather than look interesting or accurate. It works and it's not ugly. The resolution and menus don't scale well to modern systems, but that's why they released the HD versions. What's important here is gameplay. It's the early 2000s approach of gameplay first. As it should be... EA. Regardless, this is where it loses me and will likely lose many others. This game can be hard. Irksome even. The core loop relies on run-and-gun mindless action, which usually means the devs hoped the simple mechanics and waves of viscera will carry the entire game. Personally, it doesn't. Gaming pet peeves of mine include stun-locking, bullet-hell level of dangers in non-bullet-hell games, and difficulty which simply increases enemy count, health and damage. This game presents all of these to varying degrees. Stun-locking only happens with a couple of enemies, and only in high enough numbers so I can give it a pass since that's inherent in their gameplay design. The other 2 are as well. There aren't as many stars in the sky as there is crap on the screen at some points. And that's all the difficulty settings really do. I understand that kind of dumb fun works for people and I don't begrudge them. I just can't relate. That fact is made worse by the pacing in this game. Levels begin a reasonable length, but eventually increase to marathon levels. That's tiring enough, but all the enemies barring boss-types are introduced in the first 3-4. So nothing new is introduced to the gameplay loop for 70% of the game. Instead, they rely cheaply on the same few encounters. I thought I was playing Groundhog Day the game when I fought my 50th arena of 500 bulls or kleers and nothing else, despite mastering the tactic for that fight 10 levels ago. It's the speech-stutter of level design. You just can't quite spit it out and keep repeating the same 2 syllables over and over again. If this were a child, I'd have given up on him in infancy. After all that, most bosses, including the final, are a bigger disappointment than I am. That is Seriously saying Sam-thing too. The hardest fights are just before the final boss or about 3 levels ago. Like I say, game pacing is just whack here. Obviously the large enemy number and complexity is integrated into the game design. I don't want to give the impression I thought the devs were dumb. They're most certainly not. The variety in weapons of mass destruction is where things even out. So it is a thought out and crafted experience in the end. In fact, the minigun, laser gun and cannon are just the ""I don't feel like doing this right now"" guns. I also love that cannon balls have a small bounce if you fire while jumping. I don't know why. So how did this underdog franchise win? Well, it most definitely shines more in co-op. Otherwise I don't entirely know, but I'm honestly happy it did. It may not be for me, but I can respect others enjoying this interesting piece of culture. There internet. You have my approval to like this. You're welcome. Don't say I never do anything for you.. İt's a Classic! İf you want classic fps game go download Serious Sam The First Encounter.. The best game is better than doom. In this game, you fight against aliens and big aliens.. It's an entertaining game and very exciting. It manages to merge ancient history with sci-fi technology proving the developers were keen on providing its players some kind of edutainment while going crazy with action and its sci-fi setting. Not the best FPS ever but there’s a seriously good time to be had here plus Mental had it coming y’know.. Great old school action game! Excellent shooting, a sea of ​​humor, wonderful dynamics of battles.. The game is sorta repetitive and frustrating to play, I really don't think it stands up to 2020 standards, no reason to purchase it or play it outside of nostalgia nowadays.. I grew up on this game during my childhood. I clocked hundreds to thousands of hours on it and I memorized every single secret in every map. I learned how to rocket jump to the highest possible heights, even higher than the other online players. It was the greatest fun I ever had as a kid, and I loved the community and how they were really cool to hang out with. Serious Sam is definitely a gem that everyone who is into arena shooters needs to play. Modern titles like DOOM can't even hold a candle to an oldie like Serious Sam and how chaotic it is. It can get insanely hard at times (especially on Serious difficulty), but it is always satisfying. I definitely recommend it for everyone, since you will love every single minute playing this.. A challenging FPS with different types of enemies so you`ll have to use all your weapon arsenal to your advantage. The levels look gorgeous,with beautiful soundtrack while killing all those aliens. Also Sam with his one liners never gets old.. Unlike many games back then, this game takes the cake with great graphics (for 2001 standards), wonderful soundtrack, and the great big worlds you explore as you shoot your way thru the multiple Kamikazes, Kleers and Beheaded Rocketmans. The game has a weird plot, as the entire story is cut into two. The game is way better on the Xbox port. However, I feel like this game is more for the action than the plot. You should have a fun time killing monsters. Yet you think I was done, my only true complaint is the enemy placements, screw them to hell. However, if you're looking for a challenge, Serious Sam: The First Encounter is for you.. Nothing wrong here, just a legendary shooter and a childhood game. Pickens approves!. This is a great game made by Croatian Game industry: Croteam, It is fast, funny, totally crazy, I love it. I bloody love it..... hell it is one of the best games of 21st (so far). Game: Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter Genre: Shooter (First Person and Third Person) Developer: Croteam Publisher: Devolver Digital System: Steam (PC) Year of Release: 2001 Length of Playthrough: 6 Hours Total Score: 78/100 Value Score: 7.8/10 • Story: 6/10 • Characters: 8/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 8/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 7/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 8/10 Pros +Can switch between first person and third person view +Four player split screen MP is supported on one PC +Online Co-Op supports up to 16 players via Campaign that can have modifications of health spawns, enemy spawns and item spawns +Death match and Score match are two competitive modes for online MP Cons -Single player content is bare minimum in the form of a single player campaign -Game takes place in one setting but was intended to be more settings, but was cut short due to development. You will need to play the ""Second Encounter"" to enjoy the rest of the ""Serious Sam 1"" story.. I played Serious Sam 2 and finished on hard solo. Liked the game with it's wackiness. This game however, I just can't bare one moment of it. The very first levels are literally made just to: 1.Prank you 2.Fool you **** you in annoying situations that without the quick save feature are impossible to beat (I played on hard TBH, but normal is probably the same). It's tight corner **** arenas where I have to put on the 3rd person view to spot where the god damn suicide bombers are coming from, and let me tell you, YOU-WILL-GET-SURPRISED-BY-THEM. F*ck you and you who ever thought it was funny to spawn enemies in the most annoying way possible.. Serious Sam alone revived the adrenaline fast-paced shooters. It inherited fast paced action and high difficulty from Doom while also having it's own unique style.. The game is the best classic shooter. It's great non-stop action. It is worth plaiyng. It's a fast paced FPS with good controls but gets very boring very quickly. It starts out awesome but about halfway through the rest of the game is the same exact thing over and over again. If you get the game free its worth playing until you get bored but definitely not worth playing the whole way through. During its time it was probably one of the better games around, but nowadays there are just so many better options to play this one really doesn't hold up.. This is a great game, this is old school, this is more blood, this is epic soundtrack, this is hardcore, this is one of the best schooter for all the time. An excellent shooter which doesn't take itself too seriously. You are frequently challenged with huge armies of enemies running at you from all directions. The battles of such large scale and intensity were novel at the time time game came out.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It seems, Very old i didint Really hate it or liked it i like the second encounter way more i know its an classic but for me its not enough to be a good rating Sorry.. The best game of 2001. Excellent gameplay,super enjoyment,outstanding multyplayer, charming environments, great story. Fast, funny,brutal,devastating game. Serious Sam series games are always my favourite games. Serious sam is my favourite FPS series. Thanks to croteam for this game. I have played SS3. Its now my favourite game.I also want SS4 Soon. Definitely the one you should start the game series with. A very efficient way to unleash your rage. Don't worry about the plot and graphics you don't need them.. After completing the game, I personally found it to be one of the best game I ever played. While the game play is pretty basic, it's really enjoyable. There are also traps and secrets in the map to make things more challenging. Another great thing is the environment, it looks fantastic even for a 12 year old game. The levels in the game are pretty quick (15-25 minutes) which can be good for some people but not so great for some people. Overall, this game is recommended if you like FPS games and feel like using ""beefy"" weapons against some crazy swarms of wacky enemies.. I started this game just after playing BFE and I liked it very much even if BFE is way superior (better enemies, better graphics, better cut-scenes, better maps). But TFE is still a very good game both in single player mode and in co-op.. From my childhood memories,this game is still exist in my mind and its the game that is still kick ass till now,the graphics are much impressive for old times and it runs really Fluently without slowdown at **** humor that is funny for the old time,for me...this game deserve 10 and its the best 2001 game ever made,till now,people still playing this game :). The best kill-them all shooter. I like it for hardcore. Good graphic, difficult missions and dynamic gameplay. Classic Shooter. I played for many times.. Just plain fun. If you're looking for a game where you just want to have fun, mindless fun and nothing but this is it. It also has a ton of funny and interesting easter eggs.. It never claims to be more than the straight-forward shooter, and it manages that admirably. It fares much better than Duke Nukem, but it ain't as memorable as Quake 1.. This is a great game made by Croatian Game industry: Croteam, It is fast, funny, totally crazy, I love it. I bloody love it..... hell it is one of the best games of 21st (so far)","the original Serious Sam is wild, non-stop action-packed adventure with hordes of enemies and fun weapons . the map layouts can get confusing at points and the skeleton kleers are so **** annoying I hate them . the main character is simply gorgeous ."

It was originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and then remastered the following year with an alternate title, MGS 2: Substance. The title was also completed for the Xbox 360 in the HD **** SNAKE:This chapter of the Saga begins by boasting fantastic direction right from the first few seconds, as Kojima started testing in the first installment. After just a few hours of watching the first in-game cutscene, we will finally take control of the great soldier Solid Snake in all his glory. We find ourselves aboard a mysterious naval ship suspected to house a new prototype of Metal Gear. Our task is to infiltrate the ship to uncover more about the matter, discovering various familiar faces and new, extremely well-characterized characters along the way. The quality and attention to detail in the game are immediately **** NEEDLE IN THE DETAILS:The gameplay in this title is both complex and detailed, as well as simple and limited, depending on the selected difficulty level. Many basic stealth mechanics from the predecessor have been retained, such as stun guns, first-person aiming with weapons, and basic actions like using items or hiding in various spots. The noticeable differences lie in the intelligence of the enemies, who exhibit realistic patterns and interactions, from calling for reinforcements if they suspect something to engaging in banter with other guards. Countless other details can be discovered as you progress in the story, some of which are very secretive and subtle. Some game areas can be explored in different ways with alternative approaches, utilizing secret areas and acquired items. Moreover, a significant portion of the game features different movements, which I won't spoil. The bosses, while limited in number, are extremely well-structured and offer various approaches and secrets to defeat them. Finally, the codec serves as an endless source of story and assistance for the various puzzles throughout the game, which are scattered throughout the campaign to keep the player **** SEA IS MOVING:Aesthetically, this game was at the forefront of the PlayStation 2 (until its sequel). This is because it had a substantial budget and development time, as well as a new facial animation system that made characters expressive and clean. The environments, thanks to the console's technical advancements, were made much more complete, detailed, and immersive. Unfortunately, the backgrounds may appear sparse but are never a real hindrance to gameplay. The aesthetic care given to certain posters, walls, clothing, and in-game objects has made it an immortal gem, still enjoyable in modern times.!:The audio department, while simple, follows the same standard as the other aspects of the game, featuring music appropriate to the gameplay situations and accurate sound effects. Furthermore, the limited voice acting available in a few languages allowed the voice actors to give their best, resulting in several iconic voices in the world of video **** WHY A 9?PROS:It's extremely difficult to talk about the immense strengths this game offers without giving away spoilers, but I'll try. This is one of the very few titles that manages to bring together all media to their maximum potential, not just in gaming. This is because Kojima, that genius, managed to develop a terrifying meta-narrative that is still remembered to this day. Furthermore, the perfect characterization of certain characters is astounding and makes one wonder why there are still titles that cannot replicate it, even to a fraction. The dialogue of certain characters is so well-written that it made me, in first person, ponder how realistic they are. The character design, music, story, together form a unique and unforgettable experience. Without giving away spoilers, thanks to this title, Kojima managed not only to critique the society of its time but also the current one, predicting a detailed future nearly 20 years ago.CONS:Incredibly, what doesn't work in this game is what Kojima did not oversee and what resulted from fan complaints, which were somewhat misguided. I'm referring to the ""Snake Tales,"" which are essentially a reproduction of the entire campaign, played only as regular Snake, without voice acting, animated scenes, and with extremely annoying walls of text to read. To make matters worse, these are at the highest difficulty level, and without the exploration possibilities of the base game, it quickly becomes a nightmare. Additionally, the VR missions are excessively exaggerated, with a completion time of about 20 hours for missions repeated more than six times.RATINGSGameplay: 9Music: 8Story: 10_. An awesome game on an underrated console that deserves more recognition in the console genre of gaming. Game still has cool twist.. Being fair, this game was good, it had good gameplay and an extremely well polished interface system. However the plot line was far to long and involved to the point that I could hardly understand anything that was going on. The story changed direction at so many points, had so many random thing stuffed in it, and tended to be so overly dramatic at some points that it was only moderate at best. It was, however, (putting the story aside) a good game and was rather enjoyable. If you want to play this game, it is good. Just disregard the story (or at least the part in the big shell).","FUTURE FROM THE PASTBEFORE WE BEGIN:MGS 2: Sons of Liberty is a video game produced by Konami and directed by Hideo Kojima . it was originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and then remastered the following year with an alternate title, MGS 2: Substance ."
776.Zero Escape: The Nonary Games,"Incredible duology of murder-mystery visual novels, especially the second game. Captivating puzzles with multiple endings through the extensive flowchart. The story is definitely hard to follow but not necessary to the overall pacing and charm.. I love the first story, the second for reasons I cannot explain made me rolly my eyes. Still, its well worth the money.. If you like puzzle and story games, you should get this game. I've played all of 999 and some of vlr and i think this is one of my favorite games of all time. The story is truly a masterpiece and should be more recognized.. Crazy mind bending stories! Basically just 2 visual novels with a dozen or so escape rooms per game but the story is absolutely nuts and will hook you. The second game is better.. One of the best video game stories of all time, perfect escape room puzzles, 10/10. I think 999 is a much stronger entry but I enjoyed both games. The escape rooms are a lot of fun with some great puzzles to break up the story moments. It's fun figuring out how to get all the endings and piecing together the narrative as well. I think vlr has too many escape rooms, too many endings and the story gets a little convoluted towards the end. However the characters in both games are excellent and the story is certainly worth experiencing. I also wish you could skip sections in vlr more easily. I think I watched sigma's abduction 9 times for example. I also much preferred the art style of 999. The 3d models in vlr were ugly. It's unfortunate when a nintendo ds game looks far superior to a nintendo 3ds games. That said this these are some of the most enjoyable visual novels around :). The only downside is that vlr sets things up for a final entry so I didn't come away feeling satisfied. Rather I'm just curious to know what happens next. Luckily the third game has already been released :).. In my 30+ years of playing games, 999 (the 1st half included in this game) is simply the best game I've ever played, none can match this. VLR (2nd half) has some minor plot holes, but vast majority of the game is still masterfully done. VLR's story might be weaker than 999, but the puzzles are simply the best.. Fun and entertaining games, but make sure to NEVER EVER play the third game ""Zero Time Dilemma"", it is extremely bad, so bad that it can ruin the memories and experience of these first two awesome games. Jut play Zero Escape: The Nonary Games and pretend the third game doesn't exist.. Amazing visual novel. Lots of reading but story is amazing. The second game is my favorite of the trilogy. I think fans of psychological horror will like this game.. I tried Danganropa Reload before this, and was completely appalled by the lack of interactivity. It just seemed like I was hitting X to no good end. I was assured that the Nonary Games were better, and indeed they were. However there was still an awful lot of hitting X to be done. So I played the game for a while and solved some of the puzzles. Every now and then there seemed to be a choice to be made, but it wasn't clear to me what I was trying to achieve by those choices. And then all of a sudden the game ended, badly. Whut? So it seems that the choices were meaningful, and had I understood the consequences of them, I might have done better. However every other thing I had to do had been explained in such excruciating detail that I figured that these choices were of no great consequence. Now, I could go back and make different choices and achieve a different ending. But that would involve a whole lot more tapping X to get through the really boring stuff I've already seen. Sure, I could do some different puzzles, but the puzzles really weren't very good. So I have no motivation to return to this game. In fact I think I'll avoid anime games altogether, I am not seeing the value in them at all.. Fantastic story on both games The puzzles are really well done, especially on the second title Being a visual novel may not be for everyone, though, but if you want to try one, this game is a great choice. This is an amazing game for people looking for good storytelling, but don't mind limited game mechanics and graphics. This is a bundle of the first two games in the series. The mechanics are similar in each, so I'll cover that first. I was initially under the impression that it would be a point-and-click adventure, like the numerous PC games that I played from the 90's: the ones were you arbitrarily rub items together until something happens. There wasn't much logic in those games; there was normally no way to know that two items did something together until you put them together. This game is much different: Almost all of the item interactions make sense, and can be deduced though reason and logic. The same can be said for the puzzles: There's clear hints for what needs to be done, but require some thought and analysis. The puzzles in the first game are easy because the other characters frequently give you hints about them. In the second game, you have to switch to Easy mode for them to do this, which makes puzzles more challenging. You can switch from Hard to Easy mode at any time if you get stuck. And there's a bonus to completing puzzles in Hard mode: You'll get a gold file with additional game background information if you find the second, and normally harder, solution to the room. During my playthough of the second game, I switched to Easy mode a few times. Once was because a puzzle was a little arbitrary, although I found later that there was a similar puzzle in a different timeline that I could have done first to make the first one easier to figure out. Another time was when I thought I had clicked on everything in the room, but had missed a filing cabinet, that I didn't know was clickable. One downside of the second game over the first is that interactive objects are much harder to differentiate from everything else. Also, many of the puzzles are math based, so having a calculator and notepad handy helps. There's a built-in calculator for the first game, and both games have built-in notepads, but having your own makes things easier. The stories and branches within each story are where things get better. These are stories for people who like mysteries, murders, conspiracies, sci-fi concepts, and solid plots. And the numerous choices (branches) in the game makes most other games with story-based choices seem amateurish. Each branch in the story tree can potentially be wildly different based on your choices. But there is only one true ending and you'll inevitably reach it as you work through each branch. Each story is heavy on fictional scientific ideas. This is normally a bad thing in most stories since the science heavily conflicts with real science. Thankfully, the creators did their homework and the science is believable with no major conflicts. The initial plot for each game is the same: You've been abducted and are trapped with a group of people, who you need to work with (or against) to make it out alive. And each game gets much more complex as things are revealed to you. The story in the first game starts out okay, but gets much better as you progress. Some parts seem a little forced and the amount of complexity is a bit unrealistic, but it manages to hold itself together quite well. Near the end, a villain gives a speech about why and how he did it, which I'm not a fan of, but at least it makes the plot points clear in case you missed something. The ending is also a bit of a cliff hanger, but thankfully the second game is included in this bundle. Shortly after starting the second game, you might think to yourself that this isn't anywhere near as interesting as the first story. Well, you'd be wrong. The story complexity ramps up from being a bit unrealistic to insanity. Experiencing story twist after twist while the plot manages to stay solid is quite the experience. I've seen less complex stories fall apart from plot holes. The writers did an amazing job with this one. The second game also ends with a cliff hanger, so you'll want the third game in the series (Zero Time Dilemma) ready to go. So there you go. I can't go into any specific story details since that might ruin your experience. These games contain some of the best complex stories I've ever experienced. They're a must-play for anyone who likes good storytelling.. To find games like this on the PS4 is a bit of rarity, apart from some indie titles, visual novels or graphic adventures aren't easy to come across. Whilst i have yet to play the 2nd game ( virtues last reward i think ) the first game has so far left a really good impression. despite it being voiced in Japanese. The style and energy from the start are instant hit, yes there are a few issues as you do have to drag the cursor from time to time and movement is not that fluid,the game is also very short if you are doing just one or 2 run-throughs. But where this game really excels are is in its replay ability and character design and creation, you are lumped in with 9 random people at the start, who are all vaguely connected to each other, as the game progresses and people start to drop like flies, the story develops suitable twists and turns to keep you edge. Its worth noting as well the story is also particularly good and with multiple endings working out who is the real killer can be leave you on a knife edge The game also has a story tree which you can reference, and you will begin to see multiple playthroughs will be required, this could be a chore but given each playthrough would need you to make different choices and often play different puzzles, repetition is kept at bay. The puzzles themselves can be a bit tough and slightly un-logical, but game has a gentle way of giving you hints so getting truly stuck on a puzzle that will make you want to bin the game is not really likely happen, oh btw a little hint, learn what a digital route is! On the whole its really hard not to recommend this, its a sharp port ( Nintendo DS original ) with nice added features and a decent soundtrack, and from the small part i have already played at the time of writing of the 2nd one, its without a doubt this game is going to leave me with a desire of wanting more. Brilliant!!!. Master piece Only things that could make it better Cut Scenes with more anime movement? Better lip Sync? A camera that doesn't snap when your trying to look at the sky. A 3d enviroment you walk around in rather than rotate in. ----------------- This game is a Masterpeace for story telling. Its 2 games with a total of 22 endings in one and 8?? in the other?. Get the third game later this year too.!!. i did really not care for V.novel games before i tried this one and damn i got me hooked on the genre after i beet the trilogy i moved over to danganronpa. To those who love mystery/puzzle games I think this is the main attraction for Zero Escape It's kinda like Danganronpa but it tells more of a mature, and dark story with lots of plot twists :D This bundles two games from the three volumes and you're getting a really great deal out of this. There is VA for the two of them so you wont need to worry yourself reading too much of the VN The stories told from these two games are a masterpiece and you probably wont be forgetting it for a while.... The characters too each have their own unique side stories to them as well Look I'm probably not giving this game justice but all I want to say is if you want a REALLY good VN, this is a must buy for the reasons stated above; You wont regret it :D Get the third game if you liked these two! Hopefully there might be a bundle sale for all three in the future?","999 is a much stronger entry but i enjoyed both games . vlr (2nd half) has too many escape rooms, too many endings and the story gets a little convoluted towards the end . 999 is simply the best game i've ever played, none can match this ."
777.MLB 12: The Show,"Immersive, beautiful, realistic, and fun to play. The folks at San Diego Studios have done it again, they have raised the bar and made another amazing baseball game. You can play like a realistic game of baseball, arcadish, quick, or any other way you can dream up, this game has some great customizable game play options. The graphics are some of the best you will see on the PS3, the popular players of the MLB, look and play like they do in real life, and the stadiums are nothing like you see in other sports games out on the market. The development team that make this game, know the game of baseball, they focus on the small things and they show what makes baseball great. This is a must play for a baseball fan who owns a PlayStation 3. Loads better then any attempt by 2K sports.. MLB 12: The Show is a great baseball simulator. Very addictive and realistic are the best ways to describe this game. If you own a PS3, The Show series is a must have.. best game for baseball fans hands down. The multiplayer is fun and challenging if you play the game the way it's meant to be played (there will always be some **** trying to gain the upperhand). home run derby online was fun, the franchise mode was ok (kind of broken if you sim through a season because top pitchers will get like 10-10 4.50 eras while nobodies who you call up will go 10-5 2.80 era. RTTS is good not much changed, but I mostly play this for the multiplayer challenge.. I bought this game expecting to see it be as good as MLB: 11 the show and MLB: 10 the show. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT ANOTHER LIKE THE LAST 4 in the series. This game brings great dishonor to the other ""The Show"" games. All the mechanics are different. You cannot control the fielders anymore, instead the computer does it for you. WHICH IS SOOOOOO BORING AND FRUSTRATING. to see a computer make an error and you face the consequences for it, THATS BULL ****!!!! I gave this game a 0 because I feel completely ripped off. DO NOW BUY MLB: 12 THE SHOW!!!! P.S. this game **** donkey testicles.. This franchise is still the route to go for fans of baseball. Be warned though: players who have never played an MLB: The Show game will probably be overwhelmed at first by the sheer number of features. However, if you have played even just one of the past iterations, this game is an absolute blast. Sure, online play is still laggy as hell, but that's a small complaint in regards to the finest game in one of the most consistently brilliant sports game franchises out there.. Possibly the best baseball game ever created! The hitting takes some getting used to, and you may have to adjust a few settings and sliders while you get used to the new physics engine, but once you do it'll be the best virtual baseball experience you have ever had. 10 / 10. I've only played this game about 2 days and I had 09 The Show before this and let me say...this is a BIG **** didn't do overboard though. It's really the same game play set (but that's of course it you choose Pulse or Pure Anolog) with the different presentation and that's not a bad thing. I haven't used pure anolog or Pulse or Move in the game...I just simply go with the meter pitching (as is was in 09 the game I had before) stats got a huge upgrade and you only really get joy outta that if your Joe Buck or something. The new animations are a very nice thing for this game and look really good... I really think the new parks(Marlins and twins) look great even if twins got their new place in 2010 It still is my first time playing in it. Road To The Show was ok but I played as a Starting **** seamed more relistic but it still had it's simple problems. In the end this game is amazing on visuals but with minor freezing issues (in start intro videos and when trying to upload my highlights on to my xmb screen) and frame rate issues that I didn't notice in 09 which can turn out to be a big let down...even more because I downloaded the 5 gigs on to my ps3 which i believe is a new thing but it takes about 30 **** in all this is still a good outing at the ballpark. Year after year the best sports game out there, and this year is no exception. I can play for hours and not get bored, I prefer manager mode so I can control the team that way than actually playing, but I'm weird like that.. It is impossible to hit consistently. Nothing but ground balls and double plays. I could understand if it is tough to hit on a high difficulty level, but it is the same on every difficulty level. Don't waste your money. You will have more fun playing World Series Baseball '95.. t's that time of year again when you can comfortably walk outdoors, hang up the jackets, huff on pollen, and get locked up for weeks because of your allergies. The perfect game to pass the time? Well why not America's Pass Time, in an actual playable form, with MLB '12: The Show. Continue reading on **** MLB 12: The Show Review - Greenville Video Games | **** ****/video-games-in-greenville/mlb-12-the-show-review-review. Still better than that other baseball game which will not be named, but ultimately disappointing, just like it is every year. A lot was made of this year's overhaul of the physics engine, which supposedly created a more realistic baseball experience. While the physics and gravity have improved while the ball is in play, a batter can still swing early to pull the ball, make contact, and hit it to the opposite field. Look at a replay from a top down view of the batter to see for yourself. The timing and the angle of the bat often don't make sense. The pitching system, while I like the idea of the pulse control, can be quite frustrating. Your location and timing can be perfect, yet the ball can still end up out of the zone, which wouldn't be that bad, except that the cpu will very rarely swing at a ball that is even an inch off the plate. So far I've played about 20 games and I've seen an opposing batter chase a curveball below the knees maybe 2 or 3 times. Their plate discipline is way too good, and adjusting the CPU contact slider doesn't seem to help. The character models are pretty good for the most part. They've captured individual batting stances quite well, although every player is the same height, which is just sloppy. Another frustrating aspect of this game is that your cpu opponent's ""big innings"" feel predestined. Again, your timing and pitch location can be flawless, but if your opponent is due to score that inning, they will. Every ball will find a hole. Baseball is all about timing and physics, and this game has problems with both. The only game(s) that came close to perfecting it was MVP 04 and 05. I'm tough on this game because I feel like, with some tweaking, it could be great. The fact that it is close is very frustrating for someone like me, who takes baseball waaay too seriously.. Best baseball game to date. The move motion controllers are so much fun for pitching and batting. The fielding is a bit strange as you only have to time the ball goin in your glove. Overall awesome graphics, gameplay and new scenes that adpat to what's really going on. An absolute pleasure to play.. This game is absolutely beautiful. The game is by far the most graphically advanced show over the past years. The crowd has never look better and even some of the counters on the stadiums work (for example the bucco blasts at pnc count the amount of home runs hit in a franchise). The commentary is just about as good as last years model and it uses some of the same calls from the past years. However there are a few mixed things about the game. The game occasionally freezes a bit in-between pitches or swinging at pitches, but more importantly the game is extremely hard. Sometimes you can guess the pitch and the location with perfect contact and timing and ground out to second base, and other times you will hit a home run. The computer never ceases to amaze me sometimes where it will hit a fastball perfectly painted on the low outside corner out of the park like its nothing. And even the infamous 9th inning 4 run comeback that started to occur in last years model. While the computer winning games in franchise no matter what you do is frustrating i can not tell if i like it or not. In most sports games the ai is so bad you never really have to worry about losing games, but in the show its different where the computer will occasionally put up a really tough fight and eventually win the game. Ive noticed that these the two mixed user reviews are about this. If you want to go 162-0 in franchise then this game is not for you. But if you want an extremely accurate and fun sports game then you picked a winner because the show is by far one of the best sports games out there.. If you have always wanted to feel like ""wild thing"" from major league this is the game for you! It doesn't matter which pitcher your using or where you place the icon for where you would like the pitch to go because 90% of the time its nowhere near where you placed it. It is by far the most frustrating aspect of the game. I have it on rookie for pitching and hitting after owning the two previous titles and playing on all star. The computer routinely makes 9th inning 2 out comebacks to beat you. The hitting also is a joke most times, unless you enjoy watching over half your hits no matter your timing or location fly foul. I have never seen so many foul ball in any game. I hate to see a game take a big leap back, but this game is so cheap on the above mentioned problems it really just kills the fun for me.. I own an Xbox and a PC so I have only had access to the MLB 2K series. (one of the worst series of games in video game history). So, I have spent numerous hours imagining all the ways I would like that game improved and about what I want out of a baseball game. The main thing I always wanted was a realistic and immersive experience. I borrowed a friends PS3 finally and played The Show. Wow! Most of the things I have been looking for, and dreaming of, in a baseball game are present. Amazing and realistic game play that actually challenges the player. Great physics engine. Incredible attention to detail all around. Great game modes. I can't put this game down!. This years edition of the show keeps the series long track record of an excellent baseball sim intact and adds enough new features to make it a worthwhile buy again this year. The new ball physics, improved broadcast presentation, new pulse pitching mode and improved lighting and shading make this year's edition stand out. I was not a huge fan of pure analog pitching, I wasn't very good at it, but pulse pitching is a nice balance between the pitching being stat based and skill based. The idea that you can aim your analog swings is a feature I like. I felt last year that pure analog hitting was a bit too easy. The game has a few shortcomings. I've seen a few too many ground rule doubles and comebackers hitting a pitchers. Outfield throws might be a bit too strong, I've heard reports of sharp hits to RF resulting in runners being thrown out at first. Stealing bags at least in RTTS mode seems to be a bit easier than last year. When you are baserunning in RTTS show mode I'm not a huge fan of the camera movement but it's not a huge deal. One thing I want to comment on specifically is are the comments about the difficulty of hitting. There are no less than 4 hitting modes, five hitting difficulty levels, and a pitch speed slider with 10 notches. I find it hard to believe that all of the people complaining about the difficulty couldn't find some set of adjustments that make the game hittable for them. If you are a baseball fan please do not be scared off by the reports of the difficulty, there are enough options here to make the game playable for a wide range of skill levels.. I wanted so desperately to like this game, but, once again, it is just too damn hard. Hitting is infuriating because you'll swing and miss 100 times, then finally make contact and it slowly rolls to the shortstop. Pitching is better, but intensely frustrating because you have so little control over where the ball actually ends up. I suppose I'll get better the more I play, but seriously, I love baseball more than anything, and I have no interest in playing this darn game right now.. Another great baseball game by Sony San Diego but Diamond Dynasty is limited by the same online lag that's plagued past games. Presentation was nicely upgraded without being too much like just watching a game and the new Pulse Pitching control scheme is easy to learn and a fun challenge. The Show is full of minor advancements that really make a difference with immersion like correct base coaches and all minor league players wearing correct dual-flap protective helmets.. This is a fantastic sports game! It is challenging but extremely fun, and has the most realistic graphics for a sports game ive ever seen. The controls are decent, and hitting a homerun with the camera angles feels like you truly did something special. Between Franchise, RTTS and Diamond Dynasty theres plenty to do. The Show blows 2K12 out of the water, and fokes its not even close. The show owns the baseball market, and Mlb 12 the show is the only example you need.. The first few years of MLB: The Show offered gamers an amazing product with a rareness not often seen in sports games. Unlike EA releases, The Show improved with each year and did not stagnate, rivaling the likes of the NBA 2K series. Fans started to get nervous in 2011 as it appeared SCEA was running out of fresh ideas. While MLB 12: The Show is not a completely new experience, it is not a complete rehash either and continues to appeal to the most dedicated fans. THE GOOD: GRAPHICS (8/10) - With a few new animations thrown in, little has been done to improve on this aspect. But it really does not matter. People joke that HDTV was created for Baseball and Golf specifically. It's not a joke anymore. Old or not, The Show is beautiful. HOME RUN DERBY (8/10) - After this year's upgrade, I'm really not sure what else they could do with this game mode. A few new camera angles here, a little polish there, and a ball trail showing where your homers went after everything is said and done. Grab a few friends and enjoy. DIAMOND DYNASTY (7/10) - This is a very new concept and you will find this game mode discussed in Good, Bad and Unproven perspectives for that very reason. It's too soon to tell how it will play out. But as it stands, it has immense potential. Tons of customization options for team logos and uniforms. The ability to train and customize Dynasty players alongside the option to hire MLB journeymen is a lot of fun, and makes it unique from EA's Ultimate Team formats. SETTINGS CUSTOMIZATION (10/10) - My absolute favorite part of MLB 12. In the past, if you wanted to play with a plate coverage indicator, you HAD to be playing on Veteran difficulty. Likewise, if you wanted timing based hitting, you HAD to be on Rookie. MLB 12 not only allows you to mix and match settings, but it will accomodate your choices and try to match you with a similar opponent in Online play. Amazing! CROSS PLATFORM (8/10) - I do not have much to say about this. It is a brand new feature. It's the Seventh Inning Stretch and you need to leave for work? No problem. Sync your Playstation Vita with your PS3 and finish your game on the run. Just please don't do it while you are driving. THE UNPROVEN: DIAMOND DYNASTY (7/10) - There are many things which may or may not work in this game mode. Like Ultimate Team, its success is contingient on players buying and selling cards. We've seen both good and bad here. In NHL and FIFA, the market is bustling. In MADDEN, the market is so dead they had to implement trading. Who knows what will happen. CHALLENGE OF THE WEEK (Not Rated) - Yet to be activated. Looks interesting. THE MIDDLE: COMMENTARY (6/10) - A complete rehash from prior games. If there is a single line that has been added, I have yet to find it. ROAD TO THE SHOW (7/10) - The only real change is that you are now a Double-A starter from the beginning of your career. This may reduce the time it takes to get to the Bigs, but overall, this change is underwhelming. FRANCHISE (6/10) - Once again, no changes. RIVALRY (7/10) - No changes, but I've always felt as if this was an underrated game mode. If you have a friend who loves ball as much as you do, it's not hard to spit out 15 head-to-head games. This format lets you do that competitively. ONLINE PLAY (7/10) - Only change here is that Diamond Dynasty head-to-head games count for your online win-loss. TOO MANY GAME OPTIONS? - A personal pet peeve maybe, but it feels to me that they are changing the game mechanics too much. Guess pitch 1/4, 1/6, 1/8. Meter pitching. Analog hitting and pitching. Timing hitting and pitching. Zone hitting. And now Pulse Pitching? Pulse just feels unnecessary, and most diehards of the game stick to the classics. Guess Pitch 1/4, Meter Pitching and Zone Hitting all day baby. The bad: KING OF THE DIAMOND, removed in 2010, has yet to return. The last remaining ""arcade"" piece to what is now a very ""sim"" game. DIAMOND DYNASTY has no trading as SCEA admits they ran out of time to fit it in. Also, one season in DIAMOND DYNASTY lasts five games. I hate, hate, hate this. When you play a head-to-head match, it only shows the current season. You are basically being misrepresented on the experience level of your opponent every single time.. MLB 12 the show is **** new ball physics make hitting the ball quite difficult, while this makes for closer games with the cpu it can be severely frustrating, to the point where you wanna throw something! Even putting the sliders up to almost full (ie contact, power, solid hits sliders) still results in plenty of choppers and foul balls way to many for a **** i know its trying to be realistic and they've done a great job..looks very **** its a game at the end of the day , something thats supposed to be fun, not make you wanna throw your controller! That aside there are plenty of the usual game modes with the new dynasty mode, not tried that , but online problems still persist so cant see the point of **** animations new cut scenes , new lines of dialogue ..but freaking hard game play. Im going back to 11.. The updates to last years iteration don't seem all that major at first, but the sum of the parts add up to be an awesome game. If you haven't owned The Show previously, this is the best version yet. Only the stale commentary holds this back from being an all-time masterpiece.. I've played The Series for years and somehow every year they pack in more features and improvements. I really want to see how Diamond Dynasty pans out. The ball physics and new animations are awesome. road to the show is still addicting and I do think online timing has improved. I have yet to check out the Franchise improvements, but on to that next.. I won't lie to you, MLB 12 is the exact same game from last year with minor tweaks and one new game mode. But that's not a bad thing really. MLB 12 is leaps and bounds ahead of MLB 2K12 in terms of just authenticity alone, even by repeating the same formula. Everything looks and feels great, the graphics and controls are still great, haven't found any glitches or bugs in the game. Season mode and Franchise mode are still as addicting as ever. I haven't tested out Diamond Dynasty mode just yet, but i'm sure it's just as addicting as the other modes.. MLB 12: The Show is one of the best sports games ever made. San Diego studios has been pumping out the best baseball game on the market this console generation. I've personally owned every single one and its always the best 60 bucks i spend a year. This year however shows the effects of years of fine tuning. With an unprecedented broadcast presentation, graphics, and animations. MLB 12 is one of the best looking games ever. Player models are - mostly - spot on. The days of having a generic batting stance or pitching mechanics for several players is long gone. Each play oozes with detail and uniqueness. Anybody who has played these games the past couple years will notice a graphical advancement, while those putting on the cleats for the first time will be spending most of their time picking their jaws off the floor. But, once again, its what Sony has done under the hood that makes this game a true standout. The new ball physics are a huge leap forward in sports games. Each ball, hit, pitch...play carries its own spin. Where and how you hit the baseball affects the spin on the ball which in turn makes each hop, bounce and hit off the bat lifelike and completely unpredictable. Your games will keep you at the edge of your seat as the game forces each ounce of your attention. A showdown in the 9th inning with the game on the line in MLB 12 is an experience unlike no other for baseball fans. Your palms will sweat. Your heart will pound as the pitcher-batter duel is refined to perfection in The Show. All this and i haven't mentioned the all-new Diamond Dynasty mode, the best superstar creation in Road to the Show, cross-game suports for Vita and PS3, and reduced load times. This is an amazing game and a must-buy for any baseball fan!. On the fence with this one. It's by no means a bad baseball game, however, I had issues with some of the controls on it. And while I appreciate tough games, the controls shouldn't be method through which difficulty is conferred. All in all, another baseball sim title, however I'd like to recommend that these baseball games change by telling the story of some of the most famous ball players, and then re-enacting their careers in a semi-RPG style affair, right up to their position on their current ball club. Every year you could do a ball player from a different team for the same effect. Moreover, you could still have the season mode and create a player features incorporated. Someone needs to revolutionize the sports game genre, and this time around, it wasn't san diego studios.. This game is OUTSTANDING. Not perfect, but with realistic ball physics, more realistic sounds, better broadcasts (yes, all of which you can notice), this edition of The Show is the best baseball game of this console generation. The Diamond Dynasty mode is very cool. It has been compared to Ultimate Team, but trust me, it does it at least 5 times better. You can customize just about EVERYTHING about your team, from logo to uniforms to name. It is truly something you have never seen in any sports game before. It is also relatively easy to pick up. Play 5 games, re-evaluate your standings, and standings is what you ultimately play for, just like it should be. The Move controls are cool, they work well, but there is a definite learning curve associated with it, however, they do work intuitively. The only criticism I have of MLB 12: The Show is the still dodgy online, but rest assured, it has improved over MLB 11 noticeably. If you own a PS3, this is the baseball game to buy, hands down.. Good for the kids of San Diego Studios, have embroidery again this time with the physics of the ball almost perfect, everything is richly detailed, stadiums, uniforms of the players, the franchise mode is great, and also online. For me the best game of baseball and far exceeding MLB 2K12. This game series is one of the reasons I made the switch from Xbox to PS3 many years ago. They keep making minor improvements while keeping the core game play the same. The presentation has really being reworked this year. Cut scenes in between pitches and after a play further enhances the realism. The new ball physics are also a welcome addition. Only gripe I have is every once in a while the game will ""hiccup"" and pause for a brief second in certain stadiums which affects the timing of a pitch, at bat or throw. It is random and doesn't happen often but still noticeable. Otherwise, baseball season has officially started with the release of this game!. Why I gave this game a 9: - Completely redone realistic ball physics - Improved graphics - New and improved animations from swinging the bat to throwing the ball - New front end that efficiently integrates online and offline modes - New and improved sound - Improved presentation that lends a very authentic feel to the flow **** - Improved online This game keeps getting more realistic every year. SCEA is an awesome development team in my opinion.","the folks at San Diego Studios have done it again, they have made another amazing baseball game . the graphics are some of the best you will see on the PS3, the popular players of the MLB look and play like they do in real life . the multiplayer is fun and challenging if you play the way it's meant to be played ."
778.Pokemon Black Version,"Best animations and visuals for the pokemon series. Also the best music. Really the only issue with this game is the pokemon designs. I think they nailed everything else.. The game is just brilliant. The region is beautiful, the pokedex is the best in the series, the characters are well written, and Team Plasma asks us some very logical questions about the use of Pokemons. The only negative point is that the main characters aren't particularly memorable like Red was.. Really cool visuals, music, story, and strategy but the pacing is awkward amongst questionable game design descisions. This is everything a Pokemon game should be. Pokemon Black exceeds every expectation for a Pokemon game on the DS with visuals exceeding almost everything seen on the console. The 3d integration creates a super immersive region. The story is one of, if not, the best narrative created by Pokemon. The animations of the 2d sprites of the pokemon makes battling the best it has been on the DS. The art direction and sound design is incredible with the soundtrack providing some incredible tracks.. The best Pokemon game. Nothing more to say. The story is perfect and it is also really fun to play!. Is perfect, the idea to a “new kanto” basically a restart of the Pokemon games wasn’t good in the year ir was release but today the most Pokemon emjoyners know Pokemon white and black and white 2 and black 2 are the bests Pokemon games. Has the best soundtrack the series hands down. Box legendries are strong. A classic Pokémon experience at its best.. These game often has mixed opinions and I can see why, but I'm on the positive side. One of the biggest complaints is the new Pokemon. There is a fair majority of stinkers, but that is to be expected, especially when the game adds the most amount of new Pokemon in series history. It switches things up by making these new creatures the only ones obtainable, but it does provide a different feel from old games. The game further changes things by showing that Game Freak can, and sometimes want, to give a story to their games. The writing and characters are stellar. The villain is intimidating, and the ending is a memorable one. As with most Pokemon games is the amazing music, as there are a lot of killer songs. The game also looks pretty good for the hardware it's on. Overall, this game does a lot of things right. It has a pretty good selection of Pokemon, with some being among the best in the series. It tells a unique story that works really well with the music, characters, and atmosphere. The game, even outside of Pokemon standards in truly an ""N""credible game.. This was pokemon at its peak, it started going downhill after this with X/Y, Sun/Moon and don't even get me started on the Switch games. The best story Pokémon's ever told, with some actually interesting ideas and characters for once. Rest of the game is good too, though being forced to use the pretty mid Gen 5 pokemon until the post-game was kind of lame.. I like how the game looks, the region, the characters, but it does little else for me... Still enjoyable.. Pokémon with good writing. Game Freak took a bold move with this generation, and it paid off extremely well. Animated sprites, incredible environments, and a story that is much more potent than other entries in the title, combined with a decent difficulty curve. There is much to love about Pokémon Black, and it earns it's well deserved place as the 3rd best Pokémon game.. Not sure if it's nostalgia but the pixel art and sprite design in this game is so **** beautiful omg. Story is interesting and the best of any Pokémon game.. Pokemon Black improves so many small things that in the grand scale of things, Pokemon has never been better, but there also seems to be something lost in transition from old to new. Black most certainly is a different Pokemon then from what I’m used to, and although I don’t like some changes to the series, overall it’s a good transformation, and I hope to see more of it.. Very good game, the story is among the best in the series. I really like the new Pokemon, and I underappreciated the Fifth generation in the past because of my strong nostalgia for third and fourth generation, but I like it quite a lot nowadays. However: I must warn you to definitively get White version if you have no other available Pokemon games. It has 100 extra version exclusives not in Black because of a postgame area called White Forest (Black version has Black City instead).. Much better than Scarlet and Violet.. I first played it in 2023 so 12 years after release date. Does it hold well today? Should it be played? I've played it on physical console and I've had lots of fun. I've tried it previously on emulators but such approach doesn't ignite a spark of joy. In terms of story-telling, lore and world-building this game should get straight 10 - but after reaching some point of the game near the end the grind becomes unbearably dull and legend hunting isn't as good as in previous (and later) installments in series. Even though I've spent about 150h on this game it doesn't have factor that would make me repeat whole adventure any time in the future.. Good but im not too fond of the ""only gen 4 pokemons in this game"" thing, its a bit lack luster. After getting lambasted for making pokemon players try new things (ie not use charizard), I’m very glad that the playerbase has turned around on these games, because I truly believe that gen 5 is the best the series has to offer. They did an excellent job with the new pokemon- you’d always find a few new things in every route, making you feel like there’s always more to discover, and the pokemon themselves are some of the most well-designed in the series, even if some of them don’t evolve until very late. The story is excellent (a first for the series), and as formulaic as it may be, I believe these games truly mastered the formula.. The pinnacle of 2D Pokemon Games, and most likely the best of all mainline pokemon games. Rich story, lore, good map design, banger music 11/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Now this is a pokemon game right here. One of the very best ever made. So many new polemon. Great story. The sprite art is top tier. A game I'll always go back to for a new play through.. I was writing a review but got hit with a 403 forbidden and my review got removed. I'm just gonna leave it at this. tl;dr - Pokemon Black and White, as GAMES, are kinda mid. the climax was epic. the story was flawed and really boring much of the way through. the gameplay is super dull and barren for a pokemon game, almost as much so as the gen 1 games. this was disappointing for a game 5 generations in. Even games like XY people find are barebones have so much more to them in the gameplay aspect than Black and White. BW added detrimental features like the critical health theme, holding hostage the quality of each fight, the postgame was overrated, as it was simply 3 cities you explored with little incentive and not much reward. The Battle Subway is heavily lackluster in comparison to gens 3-4 battle facilities and gens 6-7 battle facilities, despite being the only battle facility in this game.. This an BORING GAME! B2W2 is so much better. The progeinsoions is so slow. The fire starter ****, the anime ****, this ****. Pokemon black is not a good game, probaly one of the worst. 4/10, and B2W2 is a 10/10. A fantastic game that was given a hard time due to people's refusal to accept change. With a brand-new cast of 156 Pokémon to catch, the largest amount introduced before or after, many people grew hostile to many of the monsters due to not being allowed to use any old favorites in the main story, which is a shame as Pokémon Black and White have the strongest story out of the entire series with the best engine to date both in and outside of battle. A region brimming with life and diversity of location and people alike, Pokémon Black and White are fantastic games that are deserving of being the series' penultimate sendoff for the Nintendo DS.. This is my first pokemon game and I say I had a pretty ok experience. It's fun to discover new pokemon, new evolution etc. The gyms are creative and the soundtrack is good. But it doesn't have the deepest gameplay of all time it's mainly to chill and have fun with your siblings and friends.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokémon **** in 2023.This game,it's instead the best of the main line. N is the best character of the series and even Komor and Belle are perfect rivals.. Best history, best antagonists, and my favorite Pokemon as legendary of the game.. Without a doubt the best game in the Pokemon series. The decision to limit the Pokedex to only new Pokemon definitely helps freshen the experience. The characters are all interesting and the game has the best story in the series. The only downsides that come up are the sometimes questionable level curve and the occasionally lacking Pokemon designs.. I would give this game a 10 but the sequel honestly is a bit better. Still an amazing game though!. Just started playing this last week and I have to say I am impressed. This is still shocking how such a good looking game as this is working on a DS but the gameplay is what seals it all together. Its truly the final Pokemon game thats not brain dead easy like the new ones which is something I miss from the older games. Would recommend if you can afford it considering it is one of if not the best game in the series.. UPDATE Pokémon Black introduces us to the Unova region, a bustling melting pot of diverse cities, settlements, folklore and ideas. That is the stage of the player's adventure as playfully vibrant, resounding musical pieces accentuate the lively nature of the region and permeate the journey with an endearingly exuberant feel. A journey characterized by a surprising amount of interesting character arcs, in a much more story-driven experience tackling unusually mature topics for the series like one's purpose in life, the clash of different ideologies, abuse and propaganda. Regrettably, all of this is done in a pretty simplistic way to avoid straying too far from the intended target audience, but it's nonetheless the most engaging plot and cast of characters in the series yet. Gameplay on the other hand doesn't do much to innovate the series' core formula, which can often be quite monotonous and repetitive especially by today's standards, but at least a pleasant level of challenge keeps the player on edge against the strongest adversaries, and the layered level design provides some rich, engaging exploration. Pokémon Contests do not make a return to leave room for Musicals, which are a dramatically worse side-activity with less depth, content and player agency.. The BEST game from the franchise that was ever released. The designs and the story were so cool, and the fact that none of the old Pokemon are there before the post game is very, very clever to make an old game feel fresh. Recommended to everyone who wants to play some DS games.. Was not a fan and made me kinda drop pokemon entirely for a while. Nothing memorable.. I just finished beating Pokémon Scarlet (believe it or not), and I, naturally, started to wonder ""Is this really Pokémon at its best?"",""Should this be the direction for all of the future games?,""Do I want it to be?"". I just want to say, that Pokémon Black. Damn, what a game. This was my second pokemon game, but the first non ranger i have ever played. Can't really explain why but training my pokemon and the realization i felt when ending the game are feelings i will never forget. The story is not that memorable and the graphics just nowhere close to what you can get in a semi-decent game nowadays but i will never forget the experience. A must play for all the pokemon fans.. Easily the best story Game Freak has ever written, with the most compelling characters in the franchise.. Pokemon Black is peak Pokemon. Something I never expected a Pokemon game to accomplish (especially by modern standards) is tell a compelling, deep and lovely story from start to finish. Characters such as Cheren, and Bianca are great rivals throughout the adventure, going on self actualizing arcs of their own to figure out what they want to be in this world. The show stealer in characters, however, has to be N. A trainer without a heart fostered by Ghetsis, who admittedly I was a little disappointed by his overall goal not to separate people from Pokemon, a motive that a lot of people can easily get behind, but was instead to take over Unova. Unova itself is a great take on the ‘UNited states OV America’ taking you on very different biomes, Castelia City being the obvious stand out, not to mention it’s soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole is outstanding, my favorite theme being the amazing ending, with the bittersweet ‘farewell.’ Another particular stand out is the low-health theme, whenever your pokemon are on low health. Be prepared to listen to it a lot during the Elite 4. My favorite part about the game was probably the Elite 4, in how clawing your way through them you face Team Plasma’s hostile takeover of the Pokemon League and have to face the culminating battle of N, and then finally Ghetsis as your final challenge. Difficulty in this game rocked me, I blacked out multiple times, especially on the Elite 4 and champion. Unova’s selection of Pokemon is staggering compared to other titles, this being because you can only catch new Pokemon until the post game. Personally, I like the roster introduced in Gen 5 so I was very happy with my team that I took to the end. Zebstrika you were the GOAT. It’s hard to give this game anything but a 10, Pokemon in itself is so charming, especially during this era, and Black is undoubtedly the peak of the series. (yes there is a little bit of nostalgia talking). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokemon Black is a Good Pokemon and My First Pokemon.I dont Know why is it so Much hate on the Game.. Probably the best of mainline games which don't have third versions. A far more responsive battle speed (my god, the Generation 4 battle pace were horrible), probably some of the best graphic style for DS and sprite work bar a few give so much life to the creatures and the environment. The new Pokemon roster is also quite diverse enough to not make different playthrough monotonous. Story is a bit more thought provoking and better than previous iterations. The map progression leads it to being a linear game, but due to various features like Dream World, Entralink and others (Musicals, they aren't that much liked or used by people), it feels decent enough room to explore. The main story beat ends in a bang. Post-game areas (Black City and White Forest) and the Looker quest were nice but the main draw is Battle Subway. Fantastic facility. While it is a solid entry in the franchise, the extra facilities and features brought by its sequels (B2W2) makes for the best Unova adventure then these. I do recommend playing through BW once through the post-game since our progress can be synced for rewards on the sequels.. Really good main game, people will say it is linear, but that's just the layout of the map. The routes offer a satisfying amount of exploration, unlike Swsh, for example. It's only lacking in meaningful post game content.. Being a large Pokemon fan, Pokemon Black and White version are still one of THE best Pokemon games to ever come out, and that is still true over a decade later. The story is perhaps one of the better ones, with a theme of 'questioning' and 'opposites', and it was a great take on something that wasn't really done before, and it was a game where you could actually understand where the villains were coming from with their ideals. The characters are very memorable, the music is memorable, and of course, the game mechanics - Triple, Rotation battles - is memorable, and sometimes dearly loved within the Pokemon community. In 2022, the time of this review, this game is still highly in the recommended list for 'Best Pokemon Experience'. I really liked playing this game as a kid but now everyone praises it so much it feels over rated and i feel like if i give it anything more then a 9 ill be one of those joining it in the over hype. garbage. i regret purchasing it, even unworthy of being pirated. to this day the bottom of the barrel of the entire franchise. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best legendary's and It as a great ending and Its Evil team in this game Is the most Actual Evil people. If your a Pokemon fan and haven't played this game U need to now.. Pokemon Black and White is sprite-based pokemon at it's best. The world is even more animated than ever and captured in a beautiful art direction and color palettes. Brilliant character designs and consists of many new pokemons, one of the Nintendo DS's highest quality game.. A really beautiful Game! A good soundtrack and a really good Dising! Please Nintendo give us a Remake for the switch, because thats the best Pokemon i ever Played.. This is my favorite Pokémon game I have played in my entire life, the best thing of this game is the world, it just feels alive and the gym leaders are not only challenges, but they have their own goals and motivations, it's a very special game.. Amazing. Honestly my personal favorite Pokemon game. Many people say that some of the pokemon they added are really ugly but I don't think that they are really bad. Plus there are also lots of amazing pokemon they added. Also the music is amazing.. Best soundtrack in a Pokémon game with one of the best stories. I love the fact that you can only use unovan Pokémon as well. It's great to see the game that was so hated by the fandom at the time of its release become so popular and loved.. Still the best pokemon game ever. No old pokemons in main story and the fact that they spend 1 year just to write plot is great opportunity to show quallity of game. Wish there was more games like BW1 Best pokemons Best story Godlike music. Great graphics, one of the best plot of the franchise, amazing soundtrack and a great amount of replay value, whats wrong then? Im not a big fan of the new exp system, the grinding is excessive, lack of innovation, some of the Pokemon designs are horrible, the level curve of battles are a bit excessive sometimes and the pacing is still very slow, so it gets boring.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Pokemon game to date. Incredible story with incredible characters. Animation and music are outstanding. Gamefreak outdid themselves on this one. Oshawott is the best starter ever no cap. 9/10 Great.. Story is bad, but not as bad as before, Pokémon designs are horrible, more inspired by Kanto than ever and most of them evolve at high levels so you won't be able to see their final form in the maingame this time around, maingame is short and difficulty is a joke... But... The game is pretty fun to play and it improved a lot all of the flaws Diamond and Pearl or Platinum had. It really feels like a DS game, not like those. Also the music is as always very good.. This is the last Pokemon game that I played so far. I didn’t go beyond generation V and I have stopped right there. This game is still solid, however I found those new Pokémons a bit distasteful and weird (as if someone was running out of ideas). I am a Pokémon fan of the first four generations; maybe I grew up from Pokémon, but Pokémon Black didn’t impress me that much, although the region was fun to explore... when I heard that the following games would contain Megaevolutions, that ruined Pokémon world for me forever, unfortunately. This game is in my opinion the best Pokemon game by far! It tells an really interesting story of three friends finding out what they want to do with their live which i really enjoyed! But i wouldn't like the game as much if it wouldn't be for the characters. There are very cool written chars like N, Adler, Cheren, Bianca and so on. It also has the (imo) best Soundtrack of the series, i could just listen to it every day, without getting tired of it! That's why i like this game so much!. not great game. I did not have much fun playing it. lots of room for improvement. I like the songs they are very good I also like Pokémon wooper is a good Pokémon. Not perfect, as the ethical questions come across as fake deep and there are some forgettable characters... But still, these are probably the pokémon games that feel the most epic. You also get lots of moments that work by resulting to become memorable fight moments plus building some kind of relation ship with both characters and tour pokemon team.. The best Pokemon Game ever sorry not sorry. It's the totally truth, even more with the bad games that we're recieving actually. I haven’t ever beaten this game and I recently started playing it for the first time. From what I’ve seen so far this game is amazing and I can’t wait to see what it has in store for me!. This game was absolutely perfect. Amazing story, amazing music and new amazing pokémon. This game was very challenging, unlike recent pokémon games.. Best generation of Pokemon without a doubt. Not only has the best story out of all the games but also it reached its top with pokemon sprites (that I prefer over 3D models). I feel like it is one of the most underrated Pokemon games, having one of the most distinctive and visible split opinions out of all the games. Some will say that the designs are awful and uncreative but in my opinion, these games contain some of the best Pokemon designs, being Chandelure, Victini, Volcarona, Bisharp, Reuniclus and so much more, ones of my favorites. Another counterargument I hear a lot is that it's just a gen 1 rip-off, but even though it is true for some cases, the possibility to experience a similar gameplay experience with a 151-Pokemon Pokedex with only new Pokemon it's worth it. Of course, there's a lot of crap, but what do you expect from them, the had to make 151 new Pokemon, 151! That's not even close to the number of Pokemon we are getting these days! My point is that they ran out of ideas, of course, but is it too difficult to appreciate the effort they put to create these games and some of the good designs? Is it too difficult? According to most people and the rating, apparently yes. I'm just leaving this around here, and if you found this and made it through this whole comment, congratulations! You're probably either entitled and disagreeing or you were searching for a comment like this and you're nodding with your head, which seems improbable, but who knows. Either way, I'm reposting this on White Version too, hoping for a person with a similar opinion to find this. And please, if you haven't played this masterpiece yet, just give it a try, you'll definitely enjoy it.. A strange title that didn't please the fan but the improvement in graphic, mechanic and storytelling were personally amazing to me.. Everyone says that this games have the best story in the franchise but they DON'T. Story is silly as hell, Ghetsis is dumb just revealing his ""master plan"" to everyone every time he appears, Team Plasma is just a bad filler full of stupid dialogues doing incoherent stuff all the way. It's just really DUMB and childish. The game only tells you something interesting at the beginning and at the very end, because the rest is just the same dull characters repeating their favourites words to remember you what to do. Disgusting. The plot make no sense at all since the moment they say you are the chosen one because: yes. And let's not forget the bad Pokédex type balance, the MOST linear region of them all, the ugly and Kanto inspired Pokémon designs you must use (thanks GF for improve designs in the new generations), the pretentious the plot is always trying hard to be, the region being bland and similar to Kanto, the short main game... This game can be one of the worst games in the franchise with XY.. Overall a very solid Pokemon game. I like the ""soft-reset"" idea, with 150 new Pokemon and none of the old ones available until post-game. Some may see that as a downside but I like to see what's new when it comes to Pokemon games. The story is probably the best in the series to date, and it all comes to a head when you reach the Pokemon League. I'd rather not spoil it for those who somehow haven't played it by now, but the climax is amazing. There's quite a few interesting dungeons and secrets scattered about the region, even places you might initially miss on your first playthrough. There's a lot to explore here, and I love it. The post-game is basically just checking out a previously unavailable portion of the region. The sprite work is phenomenal, and really helps the Pokemon feel alive. Overall, this is one of the best in the series.. How can you not love these games? This is what pokemon should've been from the start. A nice basic storyline that questions morality of not just villains but yourself for basically enslaving living creatures. The soundtrack of this **** is the best to date of the entire series. If Platinum wasn't so amazing I'd definitely choose these as the single best games in the series.. Hand holding started here. Difficulty in this game ****, being the final boss the only ""hard"" battle, and it's in fact easy. Pokémon got boring with this generation. Unova map is linear as hell. For me this is one of the worst Pokémon games. This game doesn't have the essence of Pokémon, even the interface is boring and dull.. to this day, this is still my favorite pokemon game. i don't think gamefreak will ever make a pokemon game better than black and white.. The second best Pokemon series game for me. Some things were cleared, but many many completely new additions were added and the plot was the best for the Pokemon mainline game. Difficulty and post-game were excellent too!. Easily the best of Pokemon, with beautiful sprite art, a compelling cast of characters, and 150 new Pokemon to discover in the world of Unova.. It has made my childhood happier; because of it, 10. I could never complete the Unova Pokédex, though. Landorus and Thundurus are the ones that are missing. It makes me feel incomplete :(. This was originally written in White version: Don't get me wrong, it was a good game, maybe a 4 is little note... But I expected so much from this game. Someone told me this was the BEST Pokémon game to date and I decided i had to played it... So i did it and... Well... It's FAR from the best. And i'm not talking about the ugly Pokémon designs or whatever... People that love this game, always talk about an 'amazing' plot, but it's not. It's just another Pokémon game like the previous generations but now with a green hair male talking and bothering you so much through the adventure to repeat almost the same things he said to you before. And you don't care at all, because he's not your friend, he's just a stranger, why the hell is he talking to you so much? The bad guy Ghetsis is... SO BAD. Maybe not the worst villain (Hello XY) but it's just a stupid that don't know how to hide a plan. He spends 90% of the game revealing you and the rest of the people that he's bad and wants to destroy the world. What the hell? People tend to romanticize this plot with 'the ideals', 'not everything is Black and White'... And yeah the idea is good, but it just doesn't work. You can't sell 'not everything is black or white' and then create a villain that is purely black and without reasons to be. Ghetsis it's bad because yes, because he born that way. N was a good innovation in 2011, he was the first character to take away some prominence from the player, and that's great. Because although he has boring and redundant speeches, he's charismatic and memorable. But let's be realistic, we are in 2019, 'Sword & Shield' is near and 'Sun & Moon' has a much more catchy and interesting story, with little plot twists, great treated relations and well developed characters. For me the best game to date is Sun & Moon, at least talking about the story, and we'll se what happens with SWSH. But for me, this game is good, has some problems with flaws in the Pokédex, linear map and things like that, but has great music, interesting topics, a great champion, good postgame and well... It's a Pokémon, it's a good game. The thing is that it's NOT the best, and if you're looking for the best one. For me you better play 'Sun & Moon' (not the USUM version please). Hope this don't offend anyone, is great if you loved this game!. Story: 9, Gameplay: 8, Graphics: 8.5. The new graphics, new pokemons and new mechanics and especially the story in this game are great, a great start for Generation 5. Story is a main focus for this game. Pokemon had been adding more and more story to their games up to the release of Pokemon Black Version and this game delivered one of the best stories yet. It challenges many things that you think about the Pokemon world and treats you more like a true hero than a kid playing a video game. Almost all of the new content to this game is memorable and fantastic, especially the season changing feature, where the seasons in game will change every few weeks. Pokemon Black Version also had the cleanest graphics and art out of all of the 2D Pokemon games to compliment its variety of music, moods, and events. The reason this game falls a bit short is mostly its ambitiousness not quite paying off. The quick connection feature is something you rarely use, that Game Freak seems to have put a lot of time into. It seems like they wanted to expand into an online oriented game before moving the series to 3DS, when they should have waited for their next main series game instead. The ""triple battles"" was something I was so excited for when the game first came out, but I'm not sure I ever even used it. Most of what Game Freak did for this game, was a massive leap for the series, but they tried to do too much, too fast. The game is definitely an exciting and engaging one, but too many features were a let down.. I always never liked that the Pokemon from previous generations weren't in this game.. Music: 4.5/5 Game Play: 4/5 Graphics: 4/5 Story: 4.5/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall: 4.0/5. While the whole only new pokemon could and should be better implemented, and it removed the undreground, following pokemon and contests, it did a good job with the story, which is now a staple in the series but not something they risked meddling with before, and also had interesting looking routes and the urban theme was a creative take to go with (I personally find it better than White's rural one since all pokemon games are already nature-bound in their layouts). One of the best stories in a Pokémon game EVER, Pokémon Black and White are the games Pokemon fans have been asking for a long time but weren't able to appreciate. The story is great, the music is superb, having 150 new Pokémon until you access the post-game made me super excited to play this game when it came out and I couldn't tell enough good things about it. On the downside, I feel these games marked the sort of downfall of the legendary Pokémon. 13 legendary Pokémon is simply too much and apart from the cover ones and maybe one or two more, the rest didn't add much in terms of story and therefore I feel like they're useless.. This game will always hold a place in my heart. The is probably the most ambitious entry into the franchise yet, due to implementing a completely new Pokedex with all new Pokemon to enjoy! The music is amazing, maybe bias is talk but the must is probably the best in the series, alongside Black 2 and White 2. Do get this game.. With many new ideas Pokemon Black is definitely a good game however many of its new Pokemon are quite forgettable and the experience overall just isn't as memorable as its predecessors. Huge dose from nostalgia right here. I have soo many memorie","the only issue with this game is the pokemon designs . pacing is awkward amongst questionable game design descisions . writing and characters are stellar, and the villain is intimidating ."
779.Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster,"Aight. I get why this is fan favorite for many. The game is well polished. Unique steampunkish setting. It's hard to say something bad about this. If you don't like the style of the game then you won't probably like the other older/turn-based titles either. Just like the second and fourth game, this one had more of a unique story too and not the ""warriors of light"" thing going on. Again the music and the graphics top tier. If I had to rank this game from the 1-6 titles. overall this is probably the best. Story-wise I liked the second game a lot but I think the fourth and this game are also close at the top.. As far as 2D Final Fantasy games I think this one takes the cake (not that easily mind you), it has everything to make it exciting, fun, intriguing, etc and goes above and beyond. Pros: • Excellent music and art direction, from pixel art to immersion and cutscenes. • Addictive combat that is rewarding and super customizable. • Great main scenario and side quests that are well scripted and engaging. • A high number a characters to develop and choose from.• Amazing pacing. Cons: • The handling of some female characters is not that good in a few parts, nothing too severe but definitely is worth noting, it is a game from another era so it's kind of understandable but not except of critique.. Square Enix’s Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster is everything a fan of the original could hope for. This release is a lovingly crafted update that maintains the spirit of the 1994 classic while adding just the right amount of polish to appeal to both longtime players and newcomers alike. The visuals are stunning, with pixel-perfect artistry that elevates the iconic sprites and environments without losing any of the original charm. Vibrant colors and dynamic backgrounds bring every scene to life, reminding us why this entry holds such a special place in the hearts of RPG **** soundtrack has been re-orchestrated beautifully, offering a modern take on Nobuo Uematsu’s beloved score that captures every emotion, from the eerie tones of the Magitek Factory to the sweeping, hopeful strains of the World of Balance. Each piece of music feels revitalized and yet wonderfully familiar, transporting players back to a golden age of RPGs with fresh **** terms of gameplay, Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster stays true to the mechanics that made it a masterpiece. The unique characters, innovative combat system, and deeply engaging story have all been preserved, allowing players to dive back into Terra, Locke, and Celes’s journey with fresh eyes. The game feels as balanced as ever, and quality-of-life improvements like the streamlined UI and auto-battle function make it even more accessible without losing the challenge or charm of the original.However, if there’s one flaw in this remaster, it’s the font choice. The modernized, thin font feels out of place amidst the pixel-perfect art style and nostalgic presentation. It’s serviceable, but it doesn’t capture the retro vibe of the original, sometimes pulling players out of the experience rather than enhancing it. A pixel-based font would have felt more authentic and fitting, especially for such an iconic title.Despite the font, Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster is an incredible love letter to fans of the series and a must-play for anyone who wants to experience one of the greatest RPGs ever made in its best possible form. Square Enix has crafted a faithful, visually stunning remaster that both honors and enhances the classic, making it a triumph for the genre and a true celebration of what makes Final Fantasy VI unforgettable.. Good game but I think it is a little overrated. Didn't establish as much of a bond with the characters as other final fantasy games.. My favorite Final Fantasy, such a likable cast of characters and some of the most powerful moments in Final Fantasy's storied history.. I haven’t played this game in maybe 20 years now. I had my memories of the game I wanted to preserve in case the game aged poorly, but surprisingly this game holds up extremely well. In fact, I’m willing to say it surpasses most JRPG experiences I’ve had since then. I’m about halfway through now, and I now remember why it was one of my favorites. The story is exceptional, but what really stands out are the characters who are all so extremely well written with their own backstories and story arcs that progress through the game. It’s actually impressive how they manage to tell such a cohesive story with this manager characters. The esper system was way ahead of its time and plays very well to this day. It allows you to create a fully customized team, but unfortunately that makes a lot of the characters pretty useless in the second half of the game. Otherwise, it’s the classic turn based game. I appreciate the two major “acts”, the first being a little more linear, while the second gives the closest thing to an open world RPG experience on an SNES (originally). The Pixel Remaster is also phenomenally executed. Most (not all) improvements are subtle changes, but they really make the game feel like it exists in your memories of the first time playing it. The graphical improvements are impactful but subtle, to the point where I had too look up what they originally looked like on SNES. The music is orchestrated but not grandiose, so that it still sounds appropriate to an SNES era game. The only gripe I have with the game is the weird font selection, but that’s easily fixed with a mod that takes a couple minutes to install. They really treated this remaster with the most respect, and the game itself holds up so well that it surpasses most other similar games on the market that have come out since the original SNES release. This is the ultimate way to play a timeless classic.. As a fan of this game ever since it first released in North America as Final Fantasy III, I now regard this as the definitive version of the game, with a couple of caveats. First, it doesn't have the new Espers introduced in the Game Boy Advanced version, or the Dragon's Den bonus dungeon. I personally never felt those additions to be essential to the experience, but players of the GBA version may miss them. Second, prepare yourself for the Opera House scene. The rearranged orchestra is great, and visually it's never looked better, but.. well, I'm hesitant to provide more details than that, as it felt like it was meant to be a surprise. You will have to take my word for it and judge for yourself when you hear it. Finally, I highly recommend taking the time to download one of the many mods available to fix the font. There is one available for the SNES version's font that is superb. I only ran into one potential issue, where at a certain part of the game one of the longer dialogue prompt choices was cut off because the default font is quite a bit smaller than the one provided by the mod. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how this version of my favorite Final Fantasy ended up. The new orchestral arrangements of the songs are excellent, the backgrounds during battles have never looked better, and--with sincere apologies to Ted Woolsey's fans--the localization this time around is absolutely spot on. Must play.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this sixth game in the series.. The orchestrated musical score enhances an already magnificent game. The gameplay is just like the SNES version but tailored to fit touchscreen controls.. Wow, realized too late they removed the coop feature. Albeit very basic it is the only thing that I needed. I don't want to play this game a hundredth time alone, my only motivation was sharing it with wife or kids.. Probably THE definitive edition of FFVI anyone should play - newcomers, or series veterans. The new music arrangements are definitely the highlight though.. I loved the game since i played it in the SNES, and yes, the game looks great, but that is all, it doesn't feel good, y has just partial controller support (as far as i played, when you enter a character name, you have to use a keyboard), it crashes just because, it is just not a good port/remaster **** game. Note: i've finished the game on everything (SNES, GBA, iOS, Android, PSOne) and this might be the most frustrating experience, even worst than the loading times on the PSOne, because it didn't meddle with the gameplay and overall experience, it just made you wait for it. Made game easier which was a bit disappointing and no gba extra content but ff6 is still one of my all time favorite final fantasy games.. Thank you square for doing this! As a long time fan of 6 from my child hood I can honestly say the quality of life changes to this remaster is well thought out. The music score is fantastic. Would of been nice to have used the characters in a sequel and keep the same art as. Final Fantasy VI marked yet another leap forward for the franchise in terms of storytelling. This grander, more operatic narrative features a large ensemble cast -- each fully realized characters and each with their own complete arcs and storylines. Final Fantasy VI is a masterpiece, and one of the franchise's very best installments.. great remaster, obviously the devs a lot of work to bring the best of FFVI, it's great to see SquareEnix care so much about the FF fanbase. One of the best games and jrpg's of all time returns ! It's a must play ~ i do hope that they release it on console tho !. + Great update overall. + Fantastic remade soundtrack with a few exceptions. + Auto battle ends up taking a lot of the repetition out of the random encounters and can help with the grinding. + Great visual enhancements that make FFVI's world look the best as its ever been. + Great story with arguably one of the best villains in video gaming, period. + Fair difficulty with a great leveling and ability system. + Faithful script to the SNES version. - There are a few tracks that don't hit as hard as the others. - The saturation on the over the world feels too bright but it's easy to overlook. This can also be fixed via a simple mod for PC. - Font is horrible but can easily be patched on PC. Also, screen tearing issues but NVidia Control Panel can fix that if you own an NVidia card. By far this is the best version of Final Fantasy VI. They delayed this port to add extra polish and it shows. While the other pixel remasters were good, this is near perfection. While there are some very minor issues, a few of the songs don't hit as well as the SNES version, the rest of the OST is fantastic. The visual enhancements they did decide to implement look wonderful but you'll probably wish there were more. All and all it's a very, very faithful remaster that has the quality of life improvements that further make this game's world that much more immersive. Despite the few small issues it does have, it is a great remaster, and if you have a PC I'd highly suggest picking it up because it's the best way to currently play FFVI. If you never played FFVI before, this is your chance and you'll see why it is regarded as one of the best, and many people's personal favorites in the series and one of the best JRPG's of all time. The story is still very relevant today, the characters are all well written with a few exceptions and it has one of the best villains in a video game, followed by a detailed world with great world-building and one of the best twists in games.. good game, I feel like I'm back in my childhood, but it's expensive for one game 2D. Russian localiasation first time in final fantasy series! THANKS to square soft and square enix ;)","if you don't like the style of the game then you won't probably like the other older/turn-based titles either . just like the second and fourth game, this one had more of a unique story too and not the ""warriors of light"" thing going on . overall this is probably the best ."
78.Burnout 3: Takedown,"This is my first 10/10 on Metacritic, and I reviewed Ocarina of Time. This game is literal perfection in arcade racer form. The soundtrack is perfect, the graphics are perfect, the events are perfect, the feeling of smashing an opponent into a semi truck at 160mph, oh you better believe that's perfect. This game is what all other arcade racers must measure up against. It is the gold standard of the genre. It doesn't matter if you get it on PS2 or XBOX, (or on something else if you catch my drift) just get this game. It's one of the only two games I have 100%'d.. One of the best arcade racers of all time. This was the sleeper hit of Fall 2004. It came out of nowhere and rivaled the best games from that year. The first ""Burnout"" distributed by EA Games, it is easily the best entry in the series. Featuring an exhilarating sense of speed, slick vehicles and amazing track designs, ""Takedown"" simply astounds. It is intense, exciting and unique. More than just a racing game, this sequel borrows elements from car combat and sports titles. Like ""SSX 3"" and ""Tony Hawk"", it's a pure joy to play. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. This is easily one of my favourite arcade racing games of all time. One thing I love in this game is the AWESOME TAKEDOWN mechanic. It's a timeless classic!!!. Awesome game, fast action, Crashing into other cars is so satisfying. amazing overall. i mean this game is a masterpiece. One of the best, fastest andmost fun games of all times. I miss this era with every inch of my body. Only game that is better imo is SSX3.. Super fast, gorgeous to look at and thrilling to play. The ultimate arcade racer on the Xbox.. One of the best racing games ever released. It's fast, crazy and has a cool soundtrack. Only the difficulty is a bit too high. Overall rating: 9.0.. With an emphasis on reckless fun at insane speeds, no other game makes player aggression feel this good. It is easily the greatest arcade-style racer of all time, and it’s a shame nothing has topped it since.. Burnout 3 is a racing game that is fun for fun's sake. It's extremely addicting and has better control that most modern day racing games. There are so many challenges to do in this game that you begin to simply fade away into the carnage of mashing cars into each other. Crash mode is one of the most fun and cathartic modes in a game, trying to get as many points by crashing into other cars and exploding. Soundtrack is a bop also, but in later races, the quality starts to stagnate, and borders into unfair territory, but still a perfect game to play with friends.. I like Burnout 3, but I kind of prefer Burnout Revenge more. Burnout 3 is considered the best in the series, but I guess I might feel the same way if I had grown up with it. Don't get me wrong on all this, I still like the game. it's one of the best Burnout games, but even though Revenge was just an expansion of this game, I still like it just a bit more.. this game is amazing with well-aged yet still old-school graphics, amazing music and now-classic race tracks. 10/10. Burnout 3: Takedown is still one of the best racing experience ever. The big difference between the Burnout series and games like NFS or Gran Turismo is the craziness. You can feel the incredible speed and the crashes are pure fun! This game is filled with great content and the multiplayer is just incredible. This is what I call a great quality game!. For me this game will always be the best racing game ever. No other racing game has ever given me as much fun as Burnout 3. That's it 10/10. The sense of speed and adrenaline-charged spectacle hasn't aged a day. The AI can be bone-crushingly rubber-bandy, but every last moment is engaging to the highest extent possible.. After 15 years since release, this is still by far my favourite racing game ever. Everything about the game is done so well, the way career mode progresses, the racing itself, the detail, you name it. It's impossible to get bored of it, and if you fancy a break from racing, you can just go onto crash mode and launch your car into varying amounts of traffic for fun. The soundtrack is also fantastic, it will forever be an absolute must play. If you haven't, get hold of an original xbox, and get this game.. favourite game from childhood. soundtrack is one of the best in any game. man, the memories of this.. THE best racing game ever. The original Burnout was a decent attempt for Acclaim to challenge the Gran Turismo series but didn't age well. Burnout 2: Point of Impact improved on everything over the original but then Burnout 3: Takedown was the magnum opus. The graphics for the environment and the courses looks astounding and pitch perfect to their counterparts. I loved many songs from the soundtrack. I love the realistic car models and the takedown/crash physics. The gameplay was amazing. Crash mode was somewhat fun. The only problems were that the soundtrack wasn't really that great and that the game could be beaten within a few hours or days. A must buy.. It has been over 13 years since this game has been released, and it has stood the test of time. It remains one of my favorite games throughout my entire life. I did take a break from it, what with the new consoles and such coming out and me not having room for my old Xbox, but I finally bought a monitor, AV to HDMI converter, and some speakers, and now I'm back into it. To sum it all up, this game is fast, fun, and will remain unrivaled for years to come.. Just A Nice Racing Game Full Of Destruction! And The Game Feature The Perfect Opportunity Of Road Rage, And A Lot Of Action, I Have To Get It, But I Do Not Have An Xbox.. One of, if not - the most innovative racing game of all time. The burnout series introduced a fun, fast paced game engine with the introduction of the takedown - ability to takedown your rivals with various car maneuvers. As well as a refined career mode, crash mode and online mode. This is the definitive racing game of the 6th generation. Fun, fast, smooth, intense and cool are all feelings and vibes I got from Burnout 3: Takedown. I also discovered some of my favourite bands from the soundtrack of the game. Burnout 3 is by far the most beautiful looking game of the 6th generation and should be looked to as the benchmark for pure fun. The online community continued until the close of the xbox original servers and holds a special place in the hearts of Burnout fans.. This is one of the greatest racing games of all time without a doubt. The crash mose is genius and I've spent more time playing that than actual racing.. Burnout 3: Takedown is a masterpiece, even though it's eleven years old (in 2015.) Its so fun and racing is fast and furious (pun not intended.) But the Crash events really stand out. Plowing you're expensive supercar into trucks and buses intentionally to cause as much damage as possible is good fun, quite funny and even challenging at some points. Play this game if you love arcade racers, it's a blast to play!. 17 hours it took me to finish this(didn't care about the golds). Dang that's good. The world tour is split into 2 parts: Race events and crash events. Crash is simple and fast and you're give a small intersection of part of road where you gotta drive up as fast as possible and crash into traffic causing the most collateral damage and picking multipliers. Very fun stuff. You also get you're race events going from simple races to trying to takedown tohe most racers in the alloted time. Good sense of progression with cars mostly being unlocked in categories such as musle, sport, super classes. But at the end of the day it's all about speed and the ragdoll car physics. The game rewards you by driving dangerously and crashing in this game is a thing of glory. Your car will simply flip out sometimes 30 feet in the air and with a press of a button you can control your fall in slo-mo. Seriously it's hard to beat this franchises for a rotation game in between more serious fare. It's perfect escapist and fully worth any price given what it gives back. I will review the other titles in the franchises so look'em up to see which the best in the end.. A beautifully made game. The takedown is flawlessly implemented with endless variations, addictive gameplay with controls that try to be the opposite of NFSU2 (and does it well), Tons and tons of different car choices, and crash mode, in which take out entire freeways of cars with only your own. It's hard to describe how fun this is, just play it yourself. 10/10. Burnout has come a long way since the good ol' era of ""racing around a track with little else to do other than avoid totaling yourself"". Burnout 3 was the turning point, and the true evolution between what Burnout used to be, and what it would become for years onward. Burnout 3 introduces new mechanics, the main being the new ""takedown"" feature, in which you may smash opponents to pieces in order to score a takedown. This also spurred up the new and interesting way of steering your car once you have crashed, through a slow motion view. Known as aftertouch, these allow you to score ""aftertouch takedowns"", effectively steering your wreck into other racers to batter them up. The involvement of aftertouch also seeped it's way into the new and improved crash mode, where you must damage as much traffic as possible. This game mode makes it's way from Burnout 2, where it originated, and manages to add upon it, with pickups and, of course, aftertouch being the main improvements. Whether this game mode is better than it's predecessor is down to opinion, but I found that the original crash mode was more raw, and felt more devastating when you hit down upon the traffic. Also, having no control made it feel like a true crash, rather than one that seems as though it was just designed to be as arcade style as possible. In terms of collectibles, the game is plentiful; lots of postcards, signature takedowns and vehicles to be earned. This game has a lot to do, and the crash mode is just as expansive as the race mode. Ultimately, this game is legendary; it seems to have been widely considered as the best Burnout game, and has earned itself a large following. I, however, still prefer the raw feel of burning along the road, dodging traffic, and hoping to stay as far ahead as possible. Some of the new features just take this full adrenaline rush away from me, and unfortunately, I can't give this game a perfect score. Very respectable, but far from perfect.. Best racer ever seriously just buy it. buy it now. So much destruction but i wonder if people in other cars die that would be sad but i like racing the car and there are a lot of variety in them. Best racing experince on the the oringal xbox. This game is filled with tons of content. It has a classic racing mode, time trials, and crash mode which is my personal favorate). In crash mode you just crash your car and try to cause the most damage possible. In this game there are hundreds of unlockables to go for, The graphics for this game would be considered dencent in decnct 2013. That is amzing considering it's nearly 10 years old. If you have a xbox or a ps2 this is a must buy.. great, simple concepts executed perfectly, with little in the way of unnecessary additions. Race with an insane sense of speed to the finish, but not before your opponents crash into pieces, while your custom soundtrack plays in the background. Arcade racers dont get better than this. 6.5 user score? You are kidding right? This game is hands down the BEST arcade racing game to ever grace a console! Risk = Reward Music score is perfect for this kind of game and seems to have been very well thought out. The game immediately grabs you and is hard to put down. It's exactly what an ""arcade"" style racing game should be.. FUN! The game isn't without flaws but most of them are very minor. I tried to buy this game on XBLA (re buy) and unfortunately my save game slots became corrupt and are now unrecoverable and there's no support :( So now I cannot even get the game to load up despite my best efforts so I'm stuck so I guess I'll have to look to playing it on my PC some how in order to relive the awesome. Seriously though if you are looking for a fun no so serious racing game that is FAST and a lot of fun - this is it - I still haven't found anything to replace it.....","""Takedown"" is one of the best arcade-style racers of all time . it borrows elements from car combat and sports titles like ""SSX 3"" and ""Tony Hawk"" it's fast, crazy and has a cool soundtrack ."
780.Mass Effect Legendary Edition,"It's great to go back and replay the series with upgrades and enhancements, I just wish they would have fixed the bugs and glitches that are still in the game from the Ps3. Mass Effect Legendary Edition ReviewReviewed by a first-time fan, January 2025I started Mass Effect Legendary Edition in December 2024 and finished it on January 22 at 1 PM. I bought it for $5, drawn in by the Star Wars: The Clone Wars vibes I loved as a kid. As a 20-year-old with no nostalgia or bias for the series, I went in blind, and let me tell you—I would easily pay $30 in 2025 for this masterpiece. It’s a 10/10 experience in my heart, though my official score is 9/10 because of its **** story made me fall in love with the characters, and I truly cared for the people I interacted with. I could express my emotions—anger, compassion, or humor—and the game made me feel like my choices mattered. Halfway through the first game, I already knew I wanted to replay it to explore different paths. I was so invested in the story that I’d randomly text my girlfriend about events, character names, and what they did—even though she doesn’t even know how to play Mario Kart. She loves hearing stories, and she was drawn into the game’s narrative just from how excited I was about it.BioWare created something extraordinary. A game originally released in 2007 now feels like a cherished memory, even though I only just played it. The narrative broke my heart, made me yell at my TV, and gave me a journey I’ll never forget.Despite Andromeda’s reputation, I’m buying it tomorrow because Mass Effect has made me a lifelong fan. To BioWare and everyone who worked on this series: thank you. You’ve created something beautiful. I'm super late to the party, but I'm so grateful I got to experience it.. I got this game at a crazy discount for about 5$ and I think it is one of the best games I have ever played before. Three genre-defining action RPGs in one updated with high definition visuals and a host of downloadable content. The best games of their type, full stop.. The Mass Effect trilogy is a must play for anyone remotely interested in Sci-Fi. 3 really great games all with a fresh coat of paint that remains remarkably faithful to the original artistic intent, as well as bringing some much needed tweaks here and there that never got addressed in the original games. Don’t be put off by the negative reviews ripping on Mass Effect 3. The game is much better than people give it credit for, and I doubt many new fans would take issue with the ending in its current state, disregarding historical context. Overall, the Mass Effect trilogy It’s a gem that only classic BioWare could ever pull off. After all, someone else might have gotten it wrong.. From a day and age when Bioware were kings of the RPG and could actually write competent stories, Mass Effect: LE opens a window back to those times for the modern gamer with the offering of one of greatest trilogies in gaming. The classics are brought back with improvements (which are optional) to game systems and a new sheen of paint. You carry your Shepard through the three stories where your choices matter and show consequences as the story unfolds. This probably as good as you'll get with Mass Effect after the disappointment of Andromeda and the utter state of DA: The Veilguard, it's a chance to revel in a game from when Bioware were great and I highly recommend.. The GOAT now in Ultra HD! Absolutely loved it. The only reason I'm deducting one point is the lack of ME3 multiplayer.. I love this trilogy; it's a very beautiful experience. However, I hope the remake doesn't change the cut scenes, particularly the appearance of Miranda. I look forward to Bioware listening to gamers and fans to preserve the original game without making updates based on their own judgments or current agendas. In short, please no ""woke"" changes in the remastered games! And Bioware please don't screw up new Mass Effect like you did on Dragon Age Veil Guard…please listen to gamersor the studio will fail!. With all of the cuts, censoring and changes, it's better to just play the original games instead. This release is pointless.. The Legendary Edition claims to provide a comprehensive experience of the original Mass Effect trilogy to gamers in the present day; or at least to those in 2021. The remaster efforts are a 6/10: somewhat decent graphical overhaul that brings three titles closer together but not much beyond 2014 graphics; less than a handful of QoL; and a modern hardware compatibility update. Due to subpar adaptation, the individual Mass Effect titles lose a full point or two in ranking, compared to the original, as the gameplay experience from a decade ago is not necessarily all that exciting. Especially ME1 which is way too mundane even on the highest difficulty level. While ME2 has a problem with uniformly balancing its encounters and two specific mobs (Scions and Praetorians exasperate the bejesus out of me). That being said, there is an incredible value of the experience provided by the entire trilogy as one. The entire story from start to finish is something I would recommend to people unfamiliar with it despite any shortcomings of the remaster. Then again, I cannot rate it higher than the lowest favourable grade because of what the remaster could've been.. Literally the best game I've ever played! The way that you can choose your decisions throughout the game for a pretty good ending is awesome! I hope Mass Effect 4 is as good.. So this contains 3 games, two of which deserve universal acclaim and one of which I felt was only decent. The first Mass Effect started off promising but as it progressed, only the story mattered. The gameplay was kinda booty and just didn't go anywhere. There was no progression and often boring. Thankfully, along comes Mass Effect 2 which is MILES better than the first. This is where the series took off. This is the definitive Mass Effect experience with rich graphics, great characters, memorable story, and an immersive Star Trek like setting. The third one is even better with high stakes and amazing gameplay. The characters and graphics are rich with detail. The ending tho...well that's the sad part. What a god awful ending! Everything about the first game is just too mediocre while the other two are 9/10. So average them out and it's around an 8/10. Great series with 2 of the games being acclaimed.. As a remaster, it's more like a 6, but seeing as how this may be the first foray into the series for many people, I figure it should be judged as a trilogy of games, not just as a remaster. Incredible worldbuilding, characters and impactful choices/roleplaying mostly make up for a good, but flawed central plot as well as a more mixed gameplay experience throughout the trilogy. Gameplay has been definitely improved in 1, such that this and Mass Effect 2 offer some solid fun. However, the third game is still the only one in the package with truly great combat. Writing flaws in the third game also sink the experience a bit. The ending may not be the absolute worst ever, but it is still pretty lame.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. When I think about how old the game is, and what a perfect experience it can still offer to the player today, it can't be described as anything other than a masterpiece. Whatever good foundation ME1 and ME2 have laid down, are destroyed by ME3. Character's fates are often decided by a single conversation checkpoint, and the reason for their survival or death is so laughably explained in game. There are 3 endings, two of them are horrible, the other one is supposed to be bittersweet, but it is so rushed that I just can't feel the bittersweetness. What a failure, I should have stopped at ME2.. Must have ! (Of course, the ME3's ending is still here but I think it is time to move on... ). Mass Effect 1 is my favorite game of all time. Mass Effect Trilogy is my favoite series even though the 3rd game isn't the best. The first 2 games are Legendary!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I recently completed the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. To summarize, all three games are good games, each game improving on the next in some way. The story is excellent that carries on through all three games, making your decisions matter as they affect the story. The first game shows its age, but it’s still fun. The graphics, music, performance (played on PS5), and voice acting, especially in ME3 is all very solid. What really holds the games back for me is the button layout and the weapon/skill wheel. The button layout is awful and there’s no option in any of the games to change it. For instance, “X” is the interact, take cover, dodge roll, and sprint button when held, because of this I found it difficult to manoeuvre around because as you sprint by a wall, or anything the game will force you into cover. In addition, the inability to hotkey more skills. You can only have one of your squad mate’s skills on hotkey, if you want to use another skill you have bring up the wheel, which pauses the game and is inconvenient to use. The game goes on sale periodically for dirt cheap, which is most certainly worth it. 8/10. Well, what can I say that hasn't been said already? Genuinely one of the best trilogies I've ever played, dare I say, one of the best videogame experiences I've ever had. After 3 games and 94 hours, I just can't stop thinking about this trilogy and everything it has to offer, the impeccable worldbuilding, all the beautiful stories, one of the best casts of characters in any videogame ever, and even the great soundtrack, it's just simply unrivaled! Playing through the games really made me feel like I was part of this huge world, and I never wanted it to end. I think my favorite game of the trilogy is 2 mostly because of the characters, where's 1 has the better story, and 3 has the better gameplay. I don't really have any negative things to say other than the fact that the ending just isn't as satisfying as it could've been, it's not bad, just slightly underwhelming. I'll never forget my experience with these 3 games, and they'll always hold a special place in my heart. Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.. Second best RPG I’ve played (behind only BG3 and tied with Cyberpunk). The storyline is great. You fall in love with the characters , the decisions you make actually impact the game. Very immersive experience.. The greatest trilogy of all-time gets an update and includes almost all DLC.. 1 doesn’t age well, 3 was disappointing. 2 is amazing and carried this edition.. Truly a jaw dropping game. Never played a game that made me feel like my dialogue choices actually mattered, captured the scale of dread, tension, destruction and the stakes. The writing made me feel so apart of the world the game was set in while the gameplay convinced me I was an OP super commander/soldier. Every game established a certain tone and really honed in on it. Every planet I landed on or every action set piece I experienced was so intricately designed that these games never got boring and always had me on the edge of my seat.. its crazy to think this came out at 2007, the story is extremely compelling. the mechanics are somewhat janky but the guns and constant weapon/armor upgrades are fun to cycle through. it reminded me of destiny in many ways but better because it has actual substance. I have never seen a game with so much dialogue, I could barely last 5 hours, there is dialogue in everything, we will go to war, dialogue, dialogue, I didn't like it, I don't know how I played you in the past.. This is one of the best trilogy’s of all time. The score is brilliant, the narrative is brilliant, the characters are brilliant. It makes me cry like a baby every time.. Awesome series, even better with new graphics. But there's something poorly done in the audio mixing, sometimes it's too loud, other times you can't hear what's being said. Still great tho. In my opinion the greatest trilogy of all time. I’ve never been so captivated by every character and every story arc. If you enjoy sci fi then it’s the closest you’ll get to perfection.. Amazing collection of all 3 games and DLC especially fun for someone who played the originals when they came out but never played any of the DLC and the citadel DLC may be the best of any game. The best versions of the best games ever made. There really isn’t much else to say.. Loved It as my first time and my favorite game with fun gameplay, great characters, great story and graphics looked great aswell, This game is my favorite and I'm giving It a 10. One of the best trilogies ever made!. I mostly played this old trilogy just to understand the hype. The story and gameplay are just okay, but your decisions from game 1 having some real game changing effects as far in the future as game 3 was really interesting.. I don't think there is a better value in gaming. Having 3 great games, plus the DLCs, plus updated graphics makes this one of the best purchases you can make.. It's the best triology I've ever played in my life.. Without doubt my second favorite game/s of all time behind Total War Medieval 2. Got into these way after they came out, fantastic story great replay-ability. The DLC’s make the game just that much better. You wanna save the universe be commander Shepard. Wish they had changed the first ME more than they did. Still my favorite saga ever, though.. Best trilogy!. Big Mass Effect fan. Can't stress Mass Effect enough, because 2 & 3 have been and remain utter garbage, an insult even to the core fans of the franchise and BioWare itself. The fact that I paid $70 on release for them to simply update graphics, and have them not even take the time to fix known bugs is shame-worthy and a bit of a disgrace, as well as a nail in the coffin, of what that was once an honored company, known as BioWare. If you have never played the franchise, which you should at least entertain, I suggest either buying this on-sale, dramatically, or waiting for a re-release of Mass Effect (1) alone. Don't play Andromeda, and don't even bother playing the sequels. Trust me.. Best trilogy, one of the best storylines, music...everything! This is top 2 of my favorite games ever!. It's one of best RPGS ever! The remaster is good, but the game earns 10/10 just for its story.. one of the best video game trilogy of all time and commander shepard being one of the most charismatic and unforgettable protagonist ever.. I've played through the trilogy four times over the years and now a fifth time as Legendary Edition. The best story game I've ever played. Unfortunately, even though it has been revised, the first part of the trilogy in particular seems very outdated. The overall gaming experience makes up for it though. Parts 2 and 3 still look pretty good though. A fantastic game. I'm already looking forward to the next part, which is currently being made.. I was looking forward to an easy platinum but I found myself running around talking to npc’s for the first few hours. Very frustrating you need to manually guess where to go next using the journal and that the game doesn’t indicate where to go to next on these mazes of space ships. Did they pay for good ratings on this game ? It is no way near an 86 !!!! I gave up and am returning it this week.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nothing can EVER come close to the GREATNESS of this Trilogy. Yes there is witcher, yes there are some great games but they All come Right after this Absolute JEWEL ****. Can't even call it a game, this is a whole world of emotions that flow through the most beautiful part of this masterpiece- the characters and the relationships between them. My Only Hope especially after the latest teaser, is to somehow get each and every member back and go through an Unforgettable journey through the galaxy without any major threat. I want my Shepard to be back, and all my favorite characters of course. Perhaps one day we will see another great trilogy, and Mass Effect will forever remain the best on my list! Thank you developers you deserve very big praise. Incredible and engaging story and Lore. Interesting Characters besides commander Shepherd (the most boring protagonist ever). The gameplay is kinda bad.. Life is too short to replay games and I never do that. BUT - This is the only game I have replayed and spent over 100 hours doing so this is a by far one of my favorite games of all time. I love the adventure and the story this will be a 10 out of 10 for me.. Played mass effect 2 on ps3 on release. Started mass effect 1 legendary as never played on ps5, sure graphics are old even with updates, but I ended up playing all three back to back because the games are that good. Graphics and gameplay improve through the 3 games and yes there are bits that don't work but as whole probably the best collection of games ever made. Modern games just do not have the same depth of storytelling and immersion. (did not like andromeda as a side note). Had a lot of fun with the trilogy. Mass effect 1 and 3 are in my top 10 games of all time. Must play.. does not have subtitles in Portuguese and the graphics are from the last generation. Final Thoughts: From its lore-intensive beginning to its frenetic action-oriented sequels, Mass Effect is arguably the defining sci-fi experience of the last couple of decades in gaming. Characters shine with crackling chemistry and player choices add the desired flavour to the epic space opera. Monumental stakes and uplifting themes create a strong canvas for the gorgeous vistas and unique races the series creates. Sadly, all that fantastic force is undermined by an ending that renders every player choice moot and betrays the core plot with odd choices. It takes a while to lose, but I was left with a bitter, unsatisfying taste after what's largely been one of the most delicious RPGs. For the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: ****. A pioneer in great story telling and must play for lovers of Sci-fi, Mass effect is back. The beautiful art and unforgettable characters make this one of the best series to ever grace platforms. With tons of side quests and multiple outcomes, replayability is high. The ending was a little to be left desired and seemed to be rushed, hopefully to be fixed in the next installment.(Mass effect 4 not Andromeda). However for the price you can't really beat the many hours of entertainment you will get out this series.. I just played the ME1 through in a ps4 legendary edition and went to me2. Limited ammo. Freaking limited ammo, in the world that invented a mass effect technology, which made limited ammo literally obsolete. It's like shooting flintlock riffle after an automatic. And when the gun is out of ammo(""heatsinks"")? Yo guess it it stops shooting.. Masterpiece trilogy. The feeling of being a space ship's captain cannot be conveyed better than through Mass Effect. From the compelling story to the mysterious and yet terrifying great enemies you have to face to save the galaxy, you really feel like a true hero.. Pros - remake of one of the most iconic trilogies in gaming - some of my all time favorite characters - the story gets its epic and quiet moments to consistently hit the correct note - the gameplay gets better and better as the series goes along - all dlc included (besides Pinnacle Station) - the OST and the overall sound design is beyond perfect Cons - missing the ME3 multiplayer - will always feel better on pc due to the limited number of abilities you can quick use on the controller For about seven years, the Mass Effect trilogy was my favorite series of all time. As a space opera of truly epic proportions, the trilogy has its ups and downs, but as a whole, is one of the best series ever made. The original Mass Effect had a task of introducing a new universe filled with opportunities to the players. And it understood the assignment perfectly. Within a couple of hours, you have interacted with every race occupying the known universe. You are given quests to deal with some of their problems, giving you more insight on their culture. It feels very natural. For the main story, you become a special agent for the government and you are sent to hunt another of your kind. Getting to visit a world after world, resulting in you being even more grounded in the reality of this universe. This game features one of my favorite villain speeches as well as one of the most iconic decisions in gaming. The main story ends in a perfect crescendo that sends you off to the next game. Mass Effect 2 had the hard time of following one of the most competent introductions ever made. And it succeeded with flying colors. Dropping the stiffer combat from the first game, every action you take feels a lot more fluid. The rework of abilities makes them feel more active and fun to use (Biotic Charge being my all time favorite Mass Effect ability). The main story of Mass Effect 2 is kinda meh. The very beginning and the final Suicide Mission are some of the most iconic moments of the series, but between that, the other main missions are kind of generic. What saves the storytelling hard, is the fabulous side content with the main cast of characters. The loyalty missions are some of the most fun content, giving you more time to fall in love with all the characters on your ship. Also some of the best stories found are in the included DLC packs like Overlord, Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival. Then comes Mass Effect 3. Ok, to say this game was a little controversial is one of the biggest understatements you could make. The ending of this game is one of the most reviled things in gaming history, by people who only consider a plot thread ended, if it appeared in the final cutscene. To me, this whole game felt like an ending that tied the story throughout its entire run time. If people want to act like this game is worthless over a final cutscene, then they are willfully ignoring some of the best moments the series ever had. The Genophage decision is one of the most multi-faceted decisions in the series, taking in account a spider web of decisions made in the previous games. The solution to the Geth-Quarian conflict is one of the most epic moments within the entire series. Thessia truly shows the desperation in what you are facing. The only thing I will give to the people who needlessly hate this game, Kai Leng, is the lamest weeaboo insert I have seen in gaming. Where Mass Effect 3 also shines is the combat. By taking what ME2 introduced and polishing it to its final form, Mass Effect 3 has undeniably the best gameplay in the series, allowing for fast and fluid combat that will never bore you. In conclusion, each game in the series offers something slightly different, while keeping with the main theme of the story. You come to Mass Effect for the best main story in the series. You come to Mass Effect 2 for the best cast and side content. And you come to Mass Effect 3 for the best gameplay and for some of the most iconic moments within the series. What a fantastic series that everyone should experience.. Just went through the 3 games and platinumed all of them. Last time was plaing them when they where cooming out. Such a great trilogy. Had a lot of fun with it. Love Mass effect, hope they bring it back someday with new good game. Ok a big fan of the first game. Not much a fan of the second game, because everything was dumbed down with gear and exploration way to much. Fan of the last game up to the ending. ME/LE looks dated now and I was not really impressed by the performance on the PS4. I do still have original PC versions and all DLC on EA PC client. We fans got this ME/LE, because MEA failed. Played and finished MEA and I would of prefered EA take a risk on something new. MEA2 or even ME4 than just giving us old nostaliga bait stuff. I reward new inovation not lazy easy cash grabs. So EA I got it pre-owned at 25% retail price.. I can confidently say that this is the best sci-fi rpg game I have ever played as well as being one of my favorite games. Mass Effect encompasses everything you'd expect from a game of this caliber - a stellar storyline, which takes you deep inside and conveys what it means to have the chance to shape the fate of the galaxy and Shepard's life. Ah as for the protagonist, Shepard in fact, from the first minutes of the game it is possible to notice how much personality he is able to convey. Yet over the course of the entire game it will be up to the player to decide how Shepard will evolve: whether an incorruptible paladin of the galaxy, willing and good, or whether to make him hungry for greed and characterize him with an icy ruthlessness. So yes, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a must have for anyone looking for a story that can capture you deeply and always have a place in their heart.. One of the best series ive ever played. Strongly recommend giving it a try.. Too much hype, very overrated. Maybe I was expecting too much for an admittedly old game, but I found it absolutely unattractive, and I do not mean the graphics and the gameplay mechanics. I really wonder why people find the story interesting. For me it was a complete mess and I simply did not ""get"" it. Perhaps my IQ is too limited.... Bought it on Steam for 20€ had more than 100hrs of fun. Great Story telling, great character development.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such a deep experience. Each character, each political crisis, everything in mass effect are legendary since the xbox 360 game.. Mass effect legendary edition, is one of the best games I’ve ever played. I haven’t played the originals, but this game made me love everything mass effect. My favorite thing about it Is the amazing story, and characters, they really make this game worth it.. They did not fix the ending of Mass Effect 3 and so it still hurts the experience. To be fair they used the “Extended Cut” which is an improvement (but no fix). Mass Effect was the (good) Star Wars for video games. It created a universe full of interesting characters, stories, history, conflicts, alien species, politics, technology, ideologies and cultures. The lore was so good that I had many good discussions with friends and read many articles in the Mass Effect Wiki. You have also a codex in each game where you can look up things for more details. Then they had a unique idea for the Mass Effect games. You can import your decisions into the next games. This was as interesting as impactful. Many of us had again so good discussions and arguments what the best course of action was or which outcome the decisions will have. There were a lot of mayor and some minor decisions that gave you different results in the follow up games. Then came the conclusion for the trilogy that shatter everything. I mentioned in my reviews for the individual games that I wanted to replay all of them to get my favourite (and satisfying) outcomes. Now this is not enjoyable. Again to be fair the journey was beautiful and well worth my time while the end undoes nearly everything. Technical they overhauled the games and it hits more than it misses. I shorten it with you get what you expect. Overall I still feel a strong disappointment for the ending as this could be the best trilogy in gaming. I give a 5/10 and say that I loved the games.. One of the greatest games/series I've ever played. Been gaming since the 90s, and grew up on Sony and Nintendo products. Recently finished the series and it's been hard to get into other games. I've restarted Bully twice already, probably a 3rd time since I haven't played in weeks. But back to topic, this series was a breath of fresh air. Narrative in ME1 will hook you in desptie some outdated aspects, but ME2 and 3 are loads of fun and have phenomenal gameplay. I played on PS4 Pro and enjoyed both the 1440p60fps and 4k30fps modes. Kept switching back and forth but ultimately kept the 4k resolution. High frames is smooth but you don't notice it much after you play on 30fps after awhile, only right after you switch. ME3 was pretty so ultimately kept it at 4k30fps. Single player experience resolution is better, multiplayer more frames is better. Nice to revisit the game with updated graphics, bug fixes, and all of the DLC I missed the first go around.. I wanted this series to get remastered for so long, but then they censored it. 0/10 I don’t support censorship.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A really nice remaster of the beloved ME trilogy! It's still one of the best RPGs of all time, and definitely my favourite RPG series keeping my favourite character throughout three games. There are some glitches, but it's nothing game breaking. It's a pitty there were so many problems with dubs, but I wouldn't give this game a negative rate because of it - you can still enjoy it with English dub and subtitles in your own language.. Sure Garrus is a jackboot military ACAB thug, but he's MY jackboot military ACAB thug. That's got to count for something, right? Right?? On second thought, keep him away from Tali.. Mass Effect is a must-play trilogy for any gamer. A story driven 3rd person shooter that will have you invested in the world and it's characters within the first couple of hours. Choices you make during your playthroughs matter in each game going as far as carrying over to subsequent entries. Even though I've already completed all 3 of the original games on the initial release it was still a treat to return to the series.. This was my first ME experience, and what an epic journey, I am so impressed by ME1, it is my favourite of the series, due to the twists, turns and consequences to my decisions, ME2 had a brilliant story, I enjoyed building the squad however this time I was far more cautious of the consequences of my actions. ME3 ending aside, I had. lots of fun and it was amazing to witness the complexity of the consequences of decisions I'd made in 1&2. My crafted yet unique story experience was brilliant.. This game brought back some old memory's i had of the second and third game and i missed it was so good to enjoy the games. Never experienced the original version and this remaster was a total blast to play. The 1st game feels pretty dated even with remaster and controls were clunky. 2nd and 3rd games were awesome. 2nd game was definitely the best of all.. The three Mass Effect games are one of the best games ever made. Decision making and the attention to detail and nuances connected to it throughout all three games are amazing. This great story with great characters is a must-have for both nostalgia players and newcomers.. ME legendary edition gets an 8 for the nostalgia factor, its a decent compilation of the ME trilogy with slightly upgraded graphics, and retains most of the elements that made ME, a favorite for single player games. The controls are smooth and responsive, load times are few and tolerable, everything else seem the same as the original release. Except for the censorship, yes -1 for the censorship that is not even obscene, music videos can show artists excessively twerking and song lyrics contain profane and obscene words, but a butt shot in a videogame gets censored, WTH? Update: Got the platinum trophy and finished the whole trilogy at insanity difficulty, story-wise and gameplay, ME2 is still tops, but graphically ME3 just looks superb on the PS4. The ME3 DLC character made the ME3 experience much better, story-wise, and the finale was better executed with Legendary edition.. One of the most engaging Action-RPG i have ever played, if only the ending lived up to the rest of the trilogy i would have given it a 10. 70 hours of great entertainment from this game and it is one of if not the best game I've ever played. Horrible, looks worse then original, want proof? Go watch some of ScifiIsMyJam videos on youtube. Just horrible.. Mass effect games are the best! Sto","despite Andromeda's reputation, i'm buying it tomorrow because Mass Effect has made me a lifelong fan . despite andromeda's reputation, i'm buying it tomorrow because Mass Effect has made me a lifelong fan ."
781.Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,"Early game difficulty is a bit much at times, but it's integrated well with the story and the mid-game level up, coming by way of a patently absurd twist, makes the grind worth it. The hub world is great and the perk system continues to encourage different combat experimentation. The enigma code drops and subsequent assassination missions are fun side content.. Wolfenstein II feels like a missed opportunity, heavy on action but light on meaning. The story drags, lost in its own chaos, and the characters don’t connect. Combat is repetitive, offering little new beyond shock value. The world-building is there, but it doesn’t grab you. It’s not terrible, just forgettable—too much style, not enough substance. No game has had me so bored. Trash! This game and franchise are Uber trash, the storyline is incredibly stupid, the main character is a joke. The action and gameplay is clunky and not intuitive. Overall I would say this series is not worth playing let alone even mentioning.. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a first-person shooter released by Bethesda in 2017. on PC and consoles and so far it's the latest mainline entry. We follow B.J. Blazkowicz directly after the events of The New Order. Similarly to the previous title, B.J. is critically injured and he again falls into a coma (but this time in a shorter one) where at the beginning of the story he wakes up. The U-boat he is at is captured by Irene Engel (previously met in The New Order) and she has captured Caroline (the leader of the resistance). Since B.J. is unable to walk, in the prologue, he fights his way through **** in a wheelchair, showing that even without legs, he is still a major threat. After capturing both Caroline and B.J., Engel kills Caroline. Fortunately, B.J. manages to escape using Caroline's power suit and manages to release the U-boat so that they can escape. Even without Caroline, the resistance still decided to carry out the next step, which was to liberate America from the grip of the **** regime. The story overall is not as good as in The New Order, it's less serious and more goofy and bloated with many cutscenes, which in my opinion, about 25% of them are unnecessary and sometimes too ridiculous. Only Grace stands up from all the newly met characters as she takes the role of the new Caroline, the new leader of the resistance, while others are completely irrelevant. I don't think that even the ending is as strong as in The New Order, I barely noticed when the final boss fight was. I was more excited after killing Rip than Engel, the ending wasn't just memorable enough, at least for me. Since I mentioned Rip, I have to admit that I am pleased that we finally got the opportunity to explore Blazkowicz's past much more than before, learning why and what made B.J. into what he currently **** gameplay has improved, both the stealth part and gunplay, offering new weapons and heavy weapons (every heavy weapon is very fun to use) for you to use and new enemies to kill. The upgrade system is for me, in its best version so far, where you can choose which upgrade you want to implement on your gun (there are three possible upgrades for each gun). Graphically, the game is beautiful, using the power of the new id Tech 6 (The New Order and Old Blood use id Tech 5), they captured the essence of a post-nuclear area. All in all, if you loved The New Order, It's a must-play, even though the story and levels aren't as strong and memorable as in The New Order, the game is an improved version of The New Order, offering better gameplay and graphics.. Great Narrative/story with a very memorable interesting cutscene,but the shooting/level design gameplay pretty boring. I love wolfenstein . another extreme example how fun a FPS can become. great story telling, great imagination. I enjoyed all the moments of the game. perfect characters.. New Colossus does slightly falter with the story compared to The New Order, but it makes up for it with gameplay improvements, and a more ""Inglorious Basterds"" vibe. Add on one of the most underrated soundtracks, and being able to revisit old levels to find collectibles, and New Colossus makes the improvements to the first rebooted Wolfenstein.. A solid shooter for fans of the Doom series. Amazing graphics and smooth gameplay. Recommended.. It's a decent game but I enjoyed more the first Wolfenstein. Sometimes I found it difficult to find the right way to go on. Plus, towards the end a bug happened. Tried to fix it but every time the voices of the next scene changed from Spanish to Italian; luckily, it was the only scene in Italian, then it went back to Spanish. It took me almost 11 hours to beat it searching not in all the places but in many. I think this game deserves a 6'5 or 7 at the most.. I'm playing on PS5 and it's very satisfying to kill enemies with the shogun or the axe! But it's a very difficult game. History is great. Great FPS, very atmospheric, great enemies and script , dark thriller with nice humour as well. played campaign several times. Uneven game. It has the best soundtrack of the recent series. Its gameplay is the most refined. Upgrades are thankfully simplified. Graphics are massively improved. A lot of the settings where the story takes place are very interesting to explore and roam around. But its story is very inconsistent. Easily the worst one with a set of forgettable new characters and a poor understanding of how to balance tone between humour and seriousness. Its significantly harder than the previous two games and is prone to wild difficulty spikes. It also feels like its the most repetitive of the new games. On the right difficulty, its lots of fun. Especially when you don't think about the story. But i'd easily prefer the other two.. Amazing game, bettter than the first one in my opinion .. i enjoyed every second it was really funny especially when you became a spy on venus more need to play this. The story continues and it was good. Gameplay is the same but I don't like it so much like first one.. This is a masterpiece! The graphics, the gameplay, the story, everything is just right.. Fun interesting game but i did not find the Gas chamber and the **** did not talk german in my version.. Great shooter with a nice story. Recommend for everyone who is looking for game which is brave enough to try something original and crazy at times. No woke ****. This game has improved everything from the previous game, the story is interesting, the levels are pretty cool and the gameplay is a blast. I didn't like too much the ending but overall is a great game. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, is simply amazing. The game has a great story, you actually care about these characters, the story has many twists and turns which makes it that more amazing. On the other hand, the gameplay is also amazing, yes it's a downgrade from The New Order but still keeps its spirit. A damn solid game.. very good single player game overwall, the story is very interesting, i just wish it was longer.. it feels like it gonna to make a game like dishonored . partly story partly fight . but actually it was more like COD , fast ,quick shot without reading any words . I think the battle system is better being slower and less ammo . Or you may finished this like CS very quick . the map is well **** need too much emotion screen , the woman is william his wife ,not mine . the story is **** , but I can't skip because I don't want to mess any clues . I agree that male's balls is weak and can't stand for courage , ""gut"" is better.. I was surprised at how good the game was: beautiful graphics with an actual storyline, which is not always common for shooter games. The story even dives a little into the main protagonist's childhood. The game is quite detailed - NPCs will interact with you, and you will have an ability to move/look around during what is meant to be a cut scene. There are plenty of collectibles, while the weapon choices are, thankfully, not overwhelming. A solid dozen hours of gameplay, with side missions available, as well.. played.. This game offers ample replayability, and I have a deep appreciation for alternate history/reality worlds. The Wolfenstein series' overall look and aesthetic resonate with me, and I'm particularly fond of how this installment fully embraces its hokey, sci-fi B-movie inspiration.. bad The game does not miss a step from the New order. It's a direct continuatio. The gameplay is nothing to write home about. It’s the shame fps stuff we’ve seen a million times. The story… is complicated. Some scenes are very well written and make you genuinely feel for the characters, other times, they are just plain stupid, to the point where I was rolling my eyes and sighing aloud. I love the world though. Something about **** winning ww2 and conquering Earth is really cool. Hell, **** was the best part of the game. Now, let me explain. He worked incredibly well as this insane and drugged-up lunatic. He felt historically accurate and I copied see real **** becoming like this if he won. The music is honestly kinda forgettable. I didn’t care about it. I also want to bring up how bad the sexual and nude scenes are. I usually don’t care about stuff like this but this was next level bad. A lady kills some bad guys then rips her shirt off and reveals her breasts just cause… I don’t know to be completely honest. Overall, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus was an okay game. Not bad, but I kinda hesitate to call it good. Just play Doom.. It's a really fantastic fps game, but it can cause problems with the mechanics in ps5. The game is really not relatively fast compared to other ps5 games for mechanical speeds. The camera angle is really hard to get used to. If you're playing for the first time, of course, other than that, it's a super. it deserves to be a game in my eyes.. It's really better than some reviews seem to say. While W:TNO looks dated now, and a little too-serious for its own good, this one has good animations, fluid gameplay and a very fun story with a number of heartfelt moments. Get it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have no idea why this is so highly rated. There's at least 15 minutes of unskippable garbage dialogue at the beginning of the game that nearly had me deleting it instantly. Then you're stuck on a wheelchair for the first level which is a frustrating experience, it should have been much shorter. Then the main game kicks in and enemies are the same colour as the scenery, it's all very grey. 45 minutes in and I want to give up. I think I will.. repetitive... didn't surprise me at all. or I just got burned out by the time I grabbed this game from my backlog. Short, Simple and Fun thats all. Pick it up if you want a fast paced FPS shooter. Wolfenstein II is one of those bigger, better sequels. A fast-paced FPS with tons of collectibles, gore and tough challenges. Fans of the previous Wolfenstein will find it to be an improvement in every way. This entry has a better narrative, bigger levels and plenty of guns and abilities. Graphically, it's an upgrade over its predecessor. I would rate ""New Colossus"" with a 9 out of 10.. Everything is on the top level, production quality is simply stunning, not less than parent company (id Software) has. And this is just the best Wolfenstein game. And one of the best games ever made.. i hate shooters but honestly i love the concept of being able to absolutely OBLITERATE **** so how can this game not be a 10/10 for me? throw in great graphics and this cool dieselpunk aesthetic to the weapons and overall aesthetic and i'm sold.. Great as expected although the ending could have been better, still exited for the future.. A really good sequel but certainly not as good as the first one, but it has a really unique and amazing story and the gameplay is still solid. Enjoy the story for how much **** punch it is at the Beginning well. BJ is just losing the will to fight but still moving towards it in autopilot game really enjoyed the story all the way through my problems with the game is there's no New Game Plus so it's not a specifying to play the game again with all your perks on dark and the game is a bit more story than game for my liking. I think it is about 25/75 percent gameplay. I prefer the tone in the first one word filter more ground. Weird stuff still happend But always feels like you were still in our world. Just more f***** up when in this one. It feels like we have went a bit more into the fantasy. .. This game is an exact copy of the first part. Change moon for venus and Angele for ****. But still it has a lot of emotional moments. I hope new DLC will have something to improve.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Worts game i have seen so far. Story is boring full of ideology. Not a true wolfenstein game. Waist of money. Can no longer trust reviewers.. This game ruined so much good will from The New Order. I love that game. This game just completely misunderstands The New Order.. Brutal! I love this kind of shooting games. KILLING **** HAS NEVER BEEN SO MUCH FUN. Terror Billy is the best. Pretty cool graphics, soundtrack the best of all Wolfenstein games. A very well done game.. Being one of my fav on the PS4 the Switch version does not skip a beat. OK maybe its not as sharp as the other versions but it still looks and plays damn good. Hard to belive they pulled it off so well porting it over. So much fun. Great Job Nintendo/Panic Buttton. Always lovely to kill some ****. Unique cool vibe to this series. One of the best games ever made in sweden.. Please note, the average user score has been dragged down by people who are opposed to the politics of the game. This is a loud, colourful, game that is a pure joy to play, but also has a story, characters, and voice acting, that will give you more than just **** fun. Clearly a lot of thought went into writing the story and the dialogue - yes, it's over the top - but it's still quite something. At times, it was a bit shocking, and certainly topical, even 4 years after its release. Gameplay is similar to the predecessor, with a few nice tweaks, such as weapon upgrades, more perks, and the ability to dual wield any two weapons (which for me was a minor game-changer.) It feels really smooth - in the first level you're in a wheelchair the entire time - but it doesn't feel clunky at all. I'm sure you can get this game cheaply now - definitely worth doing so.. This was one of my favorite fps games of all time, the best thing that comes to my mind when remembering this is that crazy plot twist. The gameplay itself is one of my favorites too.. Great moments but a bit inconsistent. Maybe kill more KKK? Some body horror. Enjoyed what body changes meant to me. Weird how they leaned into comedy but they made it work decently well. The action could have been better though. Great notes. Great **** depiction. Felt more real than I would have expected. Might have felt like a miss with people who don't know what later war **** was like. Enjoyed the acting as well and BJ's atypical masculinity.. Wow. Just WOW. The best FPS I’ve ever played hands down. The game that finally made me comfortable with the at times disorienting view of a FPS game. I’m literally in love with the story, visuals, gameplay, EVERYTHING. I don’t think there’s ever been a more perfect concoction in a FPS game, literally everything has been turned up to 11. The only thing I think The New Order has that was better was it’s soundtrack, but The New Colossus has some bangers too. Mick Gordon doesn’t miss. Play both of these back to back if you haven’t, you’re truly missing out. *chefs kiss*. It's refreshing to play a game with serious tones, but doesn't take itself too seriously. The gameplay pacing here is excellent and I really felt immersed in this dystopian alternate reality. The characters are very believable and I found myself rooting for them as they ventured from mission to mission. The gunplay is super fast paced and feels grounded in its old-school FPS roots. Very satisfying.. I hate to say it but Wolfenstein II The New Colossus just doesn’t improve on The Old Blood or WNO. The game is definitely harder but that’s not the real issue. The story is just meh. I wasn’t excited to continue like I was during the first two games. I wasn’t truly motivated to kill **** as before. Not because I was bored or burned out it’s because the story is lazy & boring. Don’t pay full price unless you don’t have another game to play. If you can wait buy it on sale, rent or borrow. To be clear it’s not a bad game. It’s just not a good game by Wolfenstein standards.. Wolfenstein II: TNC is a true, brilliant example of a sequel done right. The overall plot and dialogue writing are top notch and the performances are Hollywood calibre. The gameplay is improved and varied, with the awesome addition of dual wielding any two weapons of your choice. The only downside is the damage-scaling on the normal difficulty setting - you will get shredded in literal seconds. This forced me to select the easiest difficulty setting so that way I could enjoy game in terms of story and gameplay (because I believe that videogames should be fun to play by balancing entertainment value whilst also testing your 'skill' level). Nevertheless, I can't wait to see how the next sequel (Wolfenstein III) wraps everything up.. Its really nice game. It has really good alternate world with Amazing history. The model of play unfortunatelly mekes this gamę tiring so i had a fex rest in play. Despite it, I will remember this game good.. Positives: bad ass story, great acting and music, dual wielded weapons still feel amazing. Negatives: bad level design, bare bones stealth mechanics which game constantly pushes you to use, AI is lazy and unfair. To survive any decent difficulty you have to be constantly on the move but absence of auto pickup makes you stop in the middle of the fight and pixel hunt for pickup icon to get any ammo, armor or health. Aiming is quite rubbish basically and build around shooting upclose. Most of the levels have terrible flow, each time every NPC will gang up on you at the beginning in the first two rooms and then you running around empty rooms looking for a way out.. We needed this sequal like we needed nazzi killing machine Blazkowicz in a new form so the game was good I enjoy it but he have lot of problems too.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Extremely fun with memorable characters and interactions. I've rarely been as excited for cut scenes as with this game. (Looking at some of the other reviews, seems like some people are getting triggered with the **** killing part). These new Wolfenstein and Doom games are some of the absolute best and most fun first person shooters in recent memory. Good on you Bethesda, ID and whoever else is all responsible. It's so refreshing that these games can be such a blast without having to rely on the multi-player aspect. The story here is so-so but where else are you going to get a pregnant top less woman dual wielding machine guns blasting through a fire breathing robot **** dog as blood rains down on her? Fantastic. The gun play is awesome. Blasting through **** is always satisfying. A few small complaints. There didn't seem to be very memorable boss fights this time around. The trophies aren't as easy as last time. You don't get to kill ****. No zombies or aliens this time. And the weapon selection/ swap system was sort of annoying. The stealth didn't feel like it worked as well as it should have but I think that's just because I **** at stealth and have that same complaint with every game. That's more of a me problem than a game problem. This game has plenty of replayability. I love alternate history/reality worlds. I love the overall look and aesthetic of these Wolfenstein games. I love that this one went full on hokey and dove further into it's sci fi B movie inspiration.. This game is pretty cringe worthy and doesn't offer anything new or makes use of it's mechanics it's watch story Cust scene there shoot. Then it goes into some **** cringeworthy sub storyline.. In the era of pay-to-win games with the terrible microtransactions this first person shooter is a breath of fresh air. Most FPS games these days are multiplayer focused with a weak - or in many cases none existing - campaign mode. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus however is the total opposite, and that is awesome, it has a great story with interesting characters and creative set pieces, plus it does a great job continuing the story of a classic video game franchise. It is a violent game but I don't think there is a single gamer out there who does not know what this series is about - killing ****. It is done in such a fun and creative way though, that these games just simply don't get boring. I enjoyed the flash back parts as well, as we learned a lot more about our hero's tough upbringing. I also truly hated the main villain (which is very good I guess), she is so evil you really want to do your best to finally kill her. Very satisfying... So all in all it is an outstanding game, that us gamers should support. This one deserves our money, unlike many other ones on the market with greedy publishers!. Wolfenstein II's old school gameplay mechanics are a breath of fresh air in the age of regenerating health and linear level design. Scripted sequences, that seem to be a staple of FPS games these days are a few and far between in Wolf II. While the gunplay is solid, Wolfenstein II really drops the ball in the storytelling department. Bethesda game developers created an interesting world, reminiscent of the one in ""The Man in the High Castle"" but failed to use it to its full potential. Besides a few levels in rural Texas or the ruins of New York, most of the game takes place in underground military bases and factories. The writing is nowhere near as good as in ""The New Order"". Sorry but the over the top cut out scenes are too much. Relax, we have all scene multitude of **** movies etc.. Everyone knows what they did. The characters in the sequel (including the main guy) are not worth following. Don't remember the first being anything like this one. The game play, and most maps leave me scratching my head. Will the developers of this game to create the same gory theme with Stalin, Pol Pot and Japanese generals of WWII?. Best game I’ve played in a few years. The story is crazy!! Multiple jaw dropping moments!! So much fun wrecking **** and everything is just over the top. Beautiful graphics and I couldn’t put it down, give this game a go, it’s so worth it!!. I liked this game. The First was good but The second was great. Characters, narrative.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played Wolfenstein 1, The Old Blood and now I am in the last chapter of Wolfenstein 2. Wolfenstein games have always been fun to play but this one is especially hilarious. Good story telling and never ending action are in the genes of these games. Wolfenstein games lack puzzle elements instead they throw you countless **** and **** robots. It is just childishly fun to play those games and Wolfenstein 2 with some plot twists and clever upgrade elements (at the beginning of the second half) will humor you a lot.... Good movie, but bad game. New Order was way better in all. + **** dlc with 0 new content. Enjoyed as the previous one, great solid FPS, I love the ambient and the story, founded in the PS Now game collections.. Very good game! I like this part of amazing history! I want to see Wolfenstein 3. The boring and meaningless compulsory side tasks in-between the main missions make it even harder to effectively enjoy the game. It definitely had some major bugs as well to make the gameplay even more frustrating. The campaign, however, is decent enough and sometimes it's just so damn fun to shoot up the bad guys in the game. This game gets a 7/10. Nothing more, nothing less.. I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from for this game, because it's a pretty good game. It seems a lot of people are complaining about cut scenes or comparing it to past predecessors. The cut scenes are literally between missions... what's the big deal? They're not interrupting gameplay or anything else of the sort. As far as comparing it to past Wolfenstein games, that's going to be hard to do considering how far back this franchise goes. The graphics in this game are outstanding for most of it. The gunplay is tight and the ability to make upgrades is a good addition. It never felt repetitive in my opinion. I'll say the worst part of the game is the water... I mean seriously, was the person in charge of water graphics on vacation for the entire development? Mario on the NES has better water than this game does on my PS4. It's a fun game. Cut scenes are entertaining and go right along with the story. I feel like there's something else going on with the negative comments here, because this is **** killing goodness.. Honestly I have mixed feelings about this installment of the game series. Pros:great graphics, great storyline, great gun play, great choice of weapons light and heavy. Cons:Way too much inner monologue, rag doll physics are ridiculous, map is too clunky, help function is hardly helpful when really needed, & no way to improve your health or armor like in the last game. When going after the Übercommander the games extracts you immediately after the kill with no regard as to if you might have side quests till to complete.. After playing Wolfenstein The New Order I was excited to play The New Colossus. After completing this fast paced gory **** killing game here are my pros and cons: Pros: - a lot of gore and nice visual effects and animations. - weapon upgrades are nice. - save system i loved because you could save anywhere which was a LIFE SAVER! - The story and characters were good as well. Cons: - bullet sponging with some weapons. - no pause in cut scenes which can be a pain. Misc: - an option to see enemies through walls would've been a nice addition, but then again I think i have been spoiled by other games. - the objective marker could've been bigger. During this game i realized that stealth works for so long before you are spotted and i am not the type of person who runs in guns blazing even though that is what this game is intended for. I put 20hrs into this game and more than half-way through everything just seemed seemed repetitive and just kind of wanted to be done with it. Overall it was a good game.. PROS: Storyline - Was entertaining, absurd, and had a very much larger than life feel to it. There was a ton of cut scenes, but, IMO this was the game's bread and butter. Music - Whoever produced the music for this game is awesome! There's a super heavy song at the beginning menu that was great. Even for the silly cut scene's there is a dynamic and well performed music parts that I thought sounded much better than other games in its genre. Simple mechanics - Very simple gameplay in the sense that you'll never be confused in upgrading weapons, collecting items, or using weapons. It's pretty dumbed down which I like as it doesn't overcomplicate gaemplay. Saving: Although some people may complain this takes the difficulty out of the game, I like this feature as the difficulty and amount of enemies at some points in the game are frustrating. CONS: Gameplay movement - I felt B.J. moved too fast and it felt too cartoony in that sense. The melee kills are a little over the top but hey, thats Wolfenstein. The aiming is fine but I feel the player movement somewhat takes away from it. Difficulty - WOW! Even on Medium this game can get tedious. Thank God you can save whenever you want otherwise it would ****. Some parts enemies will come literally from every angle, and on Medium it takes about 5 seconds to die when this happens. A bit too harsh for me. Towards the end of the game it becomes hilarious for all the wrong reasons. The stealth **** too. Even when carefully maneuvering through levels, you'll always get caught eventually, and then literally every enemy in that giant part of the map swarm you relentlessly. It is god-damn awful and honestly not fair. Graphics - I don't know what it is about Bethesda, but their graphics always are weird. There is a mastered 'shine' in the game, but at the same time their are moments where large pixels are noticed and it just looks sloppy/lazy. There was one point where I was throwing nades at an enemy through a hole through a ceiling, an the grenades just bounced off the hole like it was solid ground. SMH. Overall, good/funny story that addresses real issues in the world today and yesterday. The music was great, the overall gameplay was OK but also felt rushed. The graphics looked like standard Bethesda style. The difficulty felt stupidly overwhelming at times (imagine getting the 'Mein Leben' trophy?!). I think the Bethesda could've added a little more to this game. This game could be an 8 if its serious technical/gameplay flaws could be addressed and updated.. For better or worse, the old school gameplay is once again placed in a highly detailed, modern looking wrapper. If you like attention to detail above all else, you will love Wolfenstein II. If you like modern gameplay above all else, then you may just be frustrated to death with this game. The detail is amazing. Although the levels are not big, they are well thought and designed with more items than exist in most games. The detail is a such a supreme effort that Bethesda even included original music for the **** occupied 1960s. The cutscenes are simply insane, and I give kudos to Bethesda for topping one insane scene with an even more insane scene. In terms of look and feel, this game is an 11 out of 10. The gameplay, however, is stuck in the past. There is a reason that Halo was so popular in 2001. The game dispensed with the usual gameplay of clearing out a level and then scouring the area for ammo and health packs. Scouring a level slows down gameplay and is not all that fun. Halo had a relentless drive that made it so fun and replayable. Activision soon followed the Halo formula for Call of Duty and now every modern shooter benefits from Halo-like gameplay. This is why I am befuddled that Bethesda relies so much on the old school shooting in Wolfenstein II. You might notice that the Doom reboot also has the same old school gameplay, and Doom also has only so much appeal. I think Wolfenstein might have benefited from going in a direction of either more action or more of exploration. The level of detail is well done but only goes so far on a small scale. The enemies are interesting but paced because the mechanics do not support mass encounters. Some enemies like giant walking tanks are easily destroyed by shooting through a doorway. Waves of low level enemies are deadly because the computer has no problem with hitting a moving target. (Even the great Halo understood this, and all the enemy weapons have significant travel time.) So you have a game where the boss fights are uninteresting and the low level fights can be frustrating and un-fun. Some fights are inspired, like the time I destroyed a half dozen **** in the one tight corridor on an underground train or the utterly gratuitous sequence where I piloted a giant flame throwing robot dog. Most of the fights are the same old same old. It is good to see the laser rifle back. Less is done with this weapon than in the last game, but it remains a great time for all. Full disclosure: I bought this game used off of Gamestop for about $5. I feel bad now because despite the gameplay, I enjoyed the full package. The campaign is meaty and well worth the cost of admission.. Almost all games makes you, the player character, a all-task guy, but in this game is ridicolous. You rescue a bunch of people and they become the liders of the group without move a finger. All they do is to order and do nothing (espe","the story drags, lost in its own chaos, and the characters don’t connect . combat is repetitive, offering little new beyond shock value . the action and gameplay is clunky and not intuitive ."
782.Call of Duty: United Offensive,"Pretty good addition to the first entry in the series. I honestly enjoyed this more than a lot of other entries in this series.. first Sicilian mission for GB felt bit of lazy, then got better, American is good; Red Army got tanks from the Future during the Battle of Kursk (t34-85), which never the less infinitely better than myth about one rifle for two in regular troops in Stalingrad in original CoD. Generally good game.. Just a continuation of the game, a set of companies from several missions, I want to note that I liked these companies more than the main ones, so 6/10.. That was something. I lost count of how many times I died here, and it was good. Ah, those days when **** was too similar to its predecessor it would be sold as an expansion, and not a new full game.... All misssions in Call of Duty : United Offensive are incredibly well crafted and are as good and some even better than those in COD1. A must play that puts all new COD games to shame.. United Offensive plays like an expansion of the first game probably because that's just what it is. More or less the same experience just with some minor additions and streamlining to make it play smoother. The game is a bit more cohesive then the original because it splits up each nations perspective as its section instead of jumping back and forth with American and Soviet missions. I would maybe give it a better score but the last section of the game at the train yard was so aggravating for me that it keeps my score the same. The rest of the game is good with some interesting levels like in the bomber plane but that last level and a few other small parts of the game are annoying to play.. Great expansion of the first game, definitely recommend it if you played the first game.. I don't recommend it even on sale for the price charged. Playing in 2022 this game is very boring. Same mechanics and gameplay as 1. Just an Expansion with some new missions for the campaign. At the time it must have been good, for being so acclaimed, but today it's better not to buy.. it could be good but not and :( whenever I was going to play it crashes in the menu and when a mission starts after about 30 minutes the game closed by itself ..... If you're going to play this game, it's better to play COD 2003I really regret buying this damn DLC. Huge improvement comparing to the first game. Surpricingly is played more complex and fun for the game that developed 18 years ago. But good direction screwing up with the poor detailed environment (even then) that is ruining good experience from the game.. This game was the best FPS game of its time... I think it's a classic and a great old game.... It does not worth a 10 like the Call of Duty but still very good. More guns than in the first game. The levels are not that realisitc as the first game. Now the multiplayer Made my entire childhood waaay more better. In this Call of Duty , You can drive cars,tanks , destroy the enemy bunkers , It's like battlefield but different.. COD United Offensive is the first and only expansion (known today as DLC) that featured a bonus campaign before COD switched to just MP maps. United Offensive was developed by Grey Matter interactive who previously work on Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a game that is know for been one of the hardest shooters from the golden age of gaming, so... this game is though!!! really though and brutal at times, not recommended for casual gamers. The game features new missions and tree different campaigns: The American, The British and The Russian. In comparison to the first game, United Offensive has better production quality than the base game, more detailed environments, more variation on levels, visually it looks better. The game adds an important component that the base game lacks off... and that is a sprint bottom, now you can move faster to take cover on time to prevent die, which is something that will happen way to often here. As i mention United offensive is not as casual as the base game, here you will need fast reactions, move quickly and have a quick finger, enemies hates you and will crush you fast, part of the difficult relies on the aim bot system that enemies have... this guys won't miss a shoot!!!, still is not impossible to beat, but the failure screen will display a lot during your play time that it will become your new best friend, sometimes you won't know who hit you!!! The story is... still generic as hell, still lacking from memorable characters, but... the battle are now memorable and frenetic. Grey Matter did a good job with this one... shortly after this they were merged into Treyarch.. This game is the probably the best game since doom. I bet some people are saying ""Its not enough like Black-ops!"" Well i can tell you one thing. Shut up, seriously I'm not trying to be mean but its not supposed to. All games are not supposed to be the same, honestly. Fro. As good as the first Call of Duty. It has very good story and maps and objectives.. Excellent. Good addition .. Call of Duty: United Offensive is just the best part of the series, even better than the 4 parts. Amazing as the 2004 game seems more interesting and variable than Battlefield V and Call of Duty WW2. The plot is excellent, the Soviet company turned out much better than in the original Call of Duty. Properly realize that the COD series began with such beautiful and games and turned into a parody of itself.. Game: Call of Duty United Offensive Genre: First Person Shooter Developer: Grey Matter Publisher: Activision System: Steam (PC) Year of Release: 2004 Length of Playthrough: 8 Hours Total Score: 73/100 Value Score: 7.3/10 • Story: 7/10 • Characters: 7/10 • GamePlay: 8/10 • Graphics: 7/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 6/10 • Replay Value: 6/10 • Player Value: 6/10 Pros +3 Campaigns with about 13 missions +Multiplayer mode +Great voice acting and sound effects +Multiple difficulty modes +Variety of Gameplay styles (Solo, squad, tank, etc) like the first game Cons -Sometimes the game's checkpoints do not save (uncommon) -Glitches where player can get stuck in certain locations (rare) -Can be tedious and unforgiving in regards to difficulty -Requires the first Call of Duty game -Shorter than the first game. For DLC, it is quite ok. I mean I wanted some time next PC. It is not long feld's game. original, that's why precisely is the DLC. but anyway, is good.. An excellent expansion mod for the extraordinary original Call Of Duty. New weapons, tougher challenges, and most importantly, huge number of German soldiers approaching you from everywhere trying to take you down in one shot. I feel my heart racing insanely whenever I play the game.. Best FPS game ive ever played, the multiplayer is just amazing, better than any of the new cods, cod2 this one and 1 maybe 4, are the best, all these new console people just have never witnessed the fitness.. This game has all new weapons and multyplayer maps that add more realism. And new multiplayer modes This game is intense. best Call of Duty MULTIPLAYER EVER.. period. i have been waiting for the CoD UO part II... but i don't think we will be awarded with such an incredible war multiplaye experience. i'm a CoD veteran since the very first CoD title. CoD4 was the last very good CoD. CoD UO best ever. Modern WarFAIL 2 and it's expansion pack (MW3) are probably the worst. IW & Activision abandoned us PC gamers for the console market.. This game is the probably the best game since doom. I bet some people are saying ""Its not enough like Black-ops!"" Well i can tell you one thing. Shut up, seriously I'm not trying to be mean but its not supposed to. All games are not supposed to be the same, honestly. From the battle at bastogne to every other battle in the game. I mean the graphics, there awesome for there time. Don't say ""oh there horrible!"" because that was top of the line. And also, mods. Oh i love making mods, its my favorite. I've made a Civil war mod, and a GI Joe mod. Both of them very fun. thank you Grey Matter!. Best WW2 multi-player. Dedicated servers with public files. Mods. Balanced weapons. Excellent maps. Large number of players in multi-player mode. Excellent community-created maps and even new game modes.. Having not played this before, the single-player campaign holds up really well! I daresay the expansion is more challenging and compelling than the main game. The british campaign that begins in an airplane is superb! I'd recommend it to any FPS fan that doesn't mind cranking back the graphics and enjoying a compelling WWII experience.","i really enjoyed this more than a lot of other entries in the series . a continuation of the game, a set of companies from several missions . all misssions in call of duty : united offensive are incredibly well crafted ."
783.Odin Sphere Leifthrasir,"I became a fan of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Unicorn Overlord, and after discovering that both were developed by Vanillaware, I decided to explore more of their games. That led me to Odin Sphere, which I dove into without any prior knowledge. The moment I saw its captivating art style, I knew I had to play it. Initially, I thought it was just a visually appealing platformer, but as I delved into the battle mechanics, the game became even more enjoyable. The story also became increasingly engaging as it unfolded. My only complaint is that I had to replay the same stages multiple times. Overall, I had a fantastic time with it.. Played this after playing 13 sentinels and unicorn overlord and I can see why all the games are great. Really love how the story comes together. My experience with this title way back in 2007 on PS2 left me spellbound. I was captivated and literally enraptured until I wore out the Play buttons. Five characters that revolve around a fantasy universe that is as beautiful as it is destructive. Moving around these 2D environments, facing hordes of enemies that attack us from both the left and the right, in an environment that seems hand-painted, truly leaves you speechless. Always fluid even in the most hectic situations despite a good amount of detail on the screen. Once the ""run"" with the first character is over, we move on to using a second one which changes the way we have to approach combat. As this second adventure comes to an end, new protagonists, bosses, environments and ever-varying events are discovered that will complicate the **** map representing the setting of the game is divided into eight areas which do not differ when switching from one character to another. Some of these macro game areas can only be visited with certain characters, unlike others which will be closed off for an entire ""run"". Each territory to be explored will have its typical creatures that populate it, forcing our character to adapt to various situations in the best possible way to emerge unscathed. For example, arriving at the ""Magmavolcano"" area, our protagonist is threatened by lava, by the poisonous plants of the forests and by the cold of the high peaks.Once our fighter starts the game, a large number of chapters will appear (up to five). For each chapter you will access a new area, with different biomes (forest, castle, underworld, etc.) within which there are a series of further game areas to explore.They are all circular areas: moving in a lateral direction, right or left, we will end up finding ourselves back at the starting point, like a dog chasing its tail. There will be areas where it will be possible to save the game and make purchases of objects useful for the character and other game situations where there is fighting. The latter will have a different level of difficulty depending on the number of stars that identify the mini area (as shown in the photo above). Based on the character's skill level during combat in terms of speed, effectiveness and ability against enemy attacks, a rating will be obtained: From the most negative one E → D → C → B → A → S to the one that will allow you to obtain valuables objects. During the excursion it will be possible to come across mini bosses scattered along the route that will hinder our path.Since the map will be initially unknown and will be discovered gradually by venturing into the game path, we could also come across the boss of the chapter and end the adventure without having explored the entire area. This eventuality is extremely inadvisable, as there is a strong risk of losing rewards, upgrades, objects and experience that cannot subsequently be recovered. As far as the audio sector is concerned, the soundtrack is **** an artistic level, the sensation is that of moving inside a real painting: the Vanillaware artists are real graphic masters, from the characters to the setting, everything visible on the screen takes shape before our eyes in a apotheosis of colors and style.Finally here's the juiciest part: The gameplay. The battles are in real time and are activated as soon as the character enters a game area. As long as each enemy is not defeated, the passage to the next area will be precluded.Each character holds his own weapon and has particular peculiar abilities which can be used to facilitate the task of eliminating the antagonists. In addition, it is possible to draw on a significant number of objects, including magic potions and pieces of equipment capable of enhancing the effectiveness of the character.Taking leaps, gliding from one side of the map to the other, feeling every single blow hitting your enemies is very rewarding, especially against bosses. A mini map at the top showing the creatures that surround us will always be visible, as will the enemy's life bar to indicate their position.Come and visit us on **** for the full review. This game seamlessly merges a JRPG with an action platformer setup, showcasing a successful and unique combination.. This game deserves all the love it can get, and the saddest thing is knowing we will never get anything like this ever again. There's so much attention to detail, so many improvements as well done to the original version, and in an oversaturated market of ironic and edgy stories, this very down to earth story of love and how it can be expressed and challenged in different ways is the most charming thing I've seen in a long time. It's been a long time since I've ""fallen in love"" with a game, and I couldn't have picked a better one. It was so good I instantly bought the next game from the same developers despite it being a completely different genre. I hate 2D side scrollers, I think they're the laziest thing a company could ever do, but this one is fantastic, and it shows that it's a gem of the PS2 era.. Very bad game. I think that pshysics are not ok and I saw that for otakus is fine so for that this game is a 0. Odin Sphere is fun and immersive, the story is well-told and cleverly interwoven between different characters, and their relationships are fleshed-out. Its incredible to think this used to be a PS2 game, that up to now is able to immerse the player into the gorgeous 2D world. The characters are interesting, each with their own story to tell and unique skills to keep the player engaged. The stages, monsters and bosses can be redundant across each story, but somehow, it did not feel like a chore or a grind, ""cough"" Dragon's Crown. Instead, the game urged the player to move forward to find-out what happens next in the story. Odin Sphere is a must-play classic that all gamers who enjoy RPGs and good story-telling should play.. Terrible and boring game. All the stories are the same, with same levels and bosses. The difficulty is unbalanced and the story is awful. I don't know why this game is considered a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I recommend Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir for fans of its aesthetics, beat 'em up gameplay, and its fantasy story. It's honestly worth looking into the inspirations Vanillaware used for this game. Fans of fairytales and games like Valkyrie Profile will appreciate the supplemental reading material.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An extremely gorgeous masterpiece that was already way ahead of it's time in the PS2 and is still a very good action RPG with an artstyle that only Vanillaware can make. It looks and feels like as unforgettable fairy tail that has a great Game of Thrones feel with multiple characters with different stories and visions of the same conflict. One of the greatest of all time. An almost perfect game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ** OVERALL 8.5/10 ** Gameplay 9/10 - Creativity 9/10 - Music 9/10 - Visuals 10/10 - Characters 9/10 - Plotline 9/10 - Emotional Engagement 8/10 - Replayability 7/10 - Difficulty */10 This game was a real joy to play. The hand-drawn characters and backgrounds (though animated with splines and modern methods) are absolutely gorgeous. The gameplay is smooth and fun, even if most of the special abilities aren’t all that useful, so you end up using a handful only. The music, while not the kind of thing I’d listen to outside the game (like I do with Nier: Automata), was very well done. The characters are interesting and well-developed, though my favorites were Mercedes (the fairy), and Velvet (the unfortunately oversexualized fire mage). The replayability is okay because of the structure of the game and the New Game+ mode, but the game is a bit repetitive in general, so it's probably not something you want to immediately restart upon finishing, like maybe some of the Tales or Disgaea games are. The difficulty is another weird one. It’s whatever you want it to be, from easy to impossible. Like Nier: Automata, however, there’s a huge jump from Normal to Hard. There’s also a Heroic mode where one hit kills you - that’s pretty insane, but if you want a challenge, go for it. My one complaint is that several women in the story are oversexualized. Only the playable character Velvet is, but every single female fairy or female efreet is your typical barbie doll with huge boobs popping out of their clothing. Overall, a highly recommended game. It’s not super long - I beat it in about 45 hours total, but with replayability involved, it’s longer. Even just at that length, it’s still worth it. If you like the 2D old-school Tales games, definitely in particular give this one a shot.. I am totally agree with Vanillabear, please find his review below. Pros: + Good Graphic Design + Epic Story + 60fps + Gameplay Cons: - Repetitive bosses ( some are acceptable like the dragons and the repetitive fight sound reasonable in the story) - Inventory seems not the best way to manage items in PS4 but better in PSV. Let's just start by saying that the art design is beautiful and the gameplay very fluid. The game is like a mix of Child of Light and Street Fighter. I don't like these 2 games very much but the result is quite interesting. The story, the gameplay and the length are much better than Child of Light Officially it's a mix of 2 styles : side-scrolling beat-em up and RPG. At the beginning, I played it on hard and I found it to be relatively easy, except a few bosses. After a few hours, I ended up switching to easy/normal because on hard, some bosses became just way too long. I think the game would be even better if the difficulty was a little improved. Harder normal areas and shorter boss battles. Many mentioned the repetitive aspect of the game. Personally, I played the first 2 books so far and yes it's a little repetitive but it's really not that bad since the story is quite different and there are new areas in each story. What I find a little repetitive is the gameplay itself. I think they should have made it a little slower paced and more strategic, at least in some areas. Maybe just bosses. Indeed, at some point, there are so many fights and since I'm trying to achieve the best score that I end up using the same overpowered strategies/skills/potions that the fights became just a huge mess of me spamming enemies without letting them any time for attacking. I think it would probably deserve a 9 if it was not for the few issues described above.. beautiful artwork!! moderately unique side-scrolling, hand-drawn, action rpg is a refreshing treat... well-polished, slightly metroidvania style a' la Dragon's Crown, Dust & Muramasa, with moderately fun, customizable combat chains, loot & leveling system -- but it gets repetitive & suffers from childish english translation & semi-frustrating maps. the charm wears-off relatively quick -- was not compelled to run through the same inventory, levels & skill-tree all over again after the first main story finished; the second ""story"" lacked a compelling connection with the first & doing it all again with a seemingly random kangaroo(?) character just didn't motivate me... as others have noted, raising the difficulty setting merely turns enemies into bullet-sponges offering little-to-no motivation for playing it on normal or hard... worth a taste, solid fun for approx 30 hours, low-replay value, not as great as all the 9's would suggest. No doubt that Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is a remarkable 2D scroller RPG game. + Unique and detail-oriented art style + Fluent combat + 5 different character design (lancer, saber, archer, berserker & caster, lol) + POV-style development of story - Repetitive gameplay, repetitive gameplay & repetitive gameplay ================ I finished the first 3 characters on EXPERT but lost my patience and finished the rest of the game in SWEET. The battle takes much much longer in higher difficulty and I don't think I can enjoy them after getting familiar with the combat strategies. The combat is all in all great. But it is just too much.. + beautiful 2D world + interesting story + You can see Organized by time of story + Easy control. but had a great action + Many routes + sound track + good voice actor. I have played Odin Sphere around 15 hours+, only reached second character, then started feeling tried to continue. Here is my quick brief honest review. Story - Fantastic so far, but not very unique, it is mostly about love and lore, romance stuffs. I am not a fan of love story. I personally would like it to be more harsh, more plot twisted. Graphic, Art Design, Eng Voice Casting - Top notched Gameplay - The best 2D action game I've ever played. However, it is still a 2D action game and thus it has limit. Even though, the devs tried to make a game various as much as possible such as adding new three skills to every mission and keep changing character. In the end, it is still not enough to compete with 3D action games nowadays and mostly you will use only few skills that you are familiar with anyway. This game also highly rely on leveling up your character and using items. Therefore, having good or bad skill does not matter, you will be able to beat the game anyway if you keep grinding for lv and stuffs. Evading and Blocking are not that necessary since you will want to keep attacking all the times, whatever enemies come at you, they do not matter, you need to hit first, that's all . With this reason, the game become repetitive very fast because you will always do the same thing regardless of types of enemies. Reused bosses and map is what mostly disappoint me. It is too cheap and devs want us to continue beating those guys for every character we play, really ?. Moreover, the scale of difficulty is also not decent. Normal difficulty is pretty easy but when I change to Hard difficulty, it is very brutal. HP pool of enemies is huge and even more absurd with hard difficulty. You have to keep spamming attack all days. NOT FUN. Music - Great, but very few BGMs if compared to games nowadays.. Should have more Length of content - Great, it might take you 40 hours+ to finish all characters. In sum, Odin Sphere is great port and may be great game in the past. Right now it is an old schooled story - hack slash game. What great is art design, voice casting but I could not bare the repetitive gameplay, reused bosses and childish love stories. Clearly not a game for everyone but 2D action soft gamers. cons - maybe a bit repetitive for some gamers inventory system first time use will cause frustrating pros- artwork combat BGM story overall this game is perfect for playstation exclusive title , must tried for ps4 gamers. Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is unique in the visuals. The effort they've put into the art is brilliant, beautiful hand drawn sketches and colours, the story and voice acting is pretty good too. Its such a shame the gameplay is extremely repetitive and not in an addictive way. I had enough of the gameplay after 30mins. You could compare the combat similar to Castle Crashers but O.S.L has more combos. If you liked the gameplay in Castle Crashers you'll probably like this. But my opinion is to wait for it to go down in price. This is coming from someone who had never played the original, who is a huge fan of rpgs (specifically jrpgs) and who loves side scrollers and hand drawn backgrounds. This game was very pretty to look at, I loved the music and I think the concept is fairly original. It is also very playable considering how old it is. The combat is also fairly fun and customizable, I was surprised at that especially. However, the game is very repetitive. The story and voice acting are extremely lackluster and although playing with multiple characters is fun, you are essentially just repeating the story instead of building on one character. For people who haven't played it and are on the fence, I don't recommend it.. At a lower price tag this game would be an excellent choice, at 60 dollars its a rip-off. I was honestly shocked it received such good reviews. It is extremely niche. You'd be better off considering something like I am setsuna for 40 if you're looking for a jrpg (not a sidescroller, however). Wait for this to drop in price (it inevitably will).. I'm really surprised that more hasn't been made about just how repetitive this game is. Great graphics can only take a game so far. You essentially have to complete the same game five times. About 15 hours in I hit the wall and it was drop to easiest difficulty and skip all story scenes. Playing on higher difficulty levels just means enemies take more hits to kill and the story is childish boring and derivative. Excellent artwork with superb presentation and voice acting but who cares when the gameplay makes you not want to play anymore.. Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is a beautiful game when it comes to the art design, Music and Story though is does have some flaws that we shouldn't let rose tinted glasses makes us ignore. Art Design/Performance - It is a beautiful game and is stunning to look at, It naturally runs smooth as butter and is basically just a treat for your eyes. Story/Music - The story of each character is very heart-felt, from a Valkyrie fighting for her fathers love to a Fairy struggling to honor her mother, Odin sphere did well in making you care for each story. The music is beautiful and you could just sit there and listen to it all day, no issues there. Gameplay - The gameplay is the main draw of course and it is great fun hacking and slashing your way to victory and building up your 200 hit combos, You have a surprising amount of special attacks to pick from in your skill tree and are bound to find something that works for you on each character. Negatives - The biggest negative to this game is it becomes HIGHLY repetitive with only a handful of maps and using the same bosses over and over, Do you fight legendary warrior? or legendary dragon? if they were so legendary they wouldn't get beat down so many times! All in all it's a decent game, very repetitive after awhile and this is used to extend the time of your playthrough quite alot, My playthrough took roughly 22 hours and i don't regret it, so if you're into action rpgs then give it a go! Due to the repetitiveness i can't in good faith give it an 8 or over, I'm just being honest with myself, Maybe you will feel differently.. This is a good remaster of a charming, aesthetically accomplished genre-mashup but after 20 hours you feel like you've had everything the game has to offer. The combat system is polished and fun, but at normal difficulty the game presents little to no challenge so to get the most of it you'll want to play on hard. I would also argue it's barely an RPG; your character powers up in a linear fashion, it's mainly just a side-scrolling beat-em-up in fantasy clothes.. Vanilla wares underrated masterpiece from ps2 is given justice in this remake that many others never see. Not only is the beautiful signature art brought to HD, the gameplay has been updated to have the speed of Muramasa with an upgrade system similar to Dragons Crown. Not only is this update more accessible it is also much more replayable. The original version of the game is also repackaged for those who missed it and for purists as well. Untouched though is the masterfully Norse inspired story of love, deceit, destruction and war nearing a post apocalyptic event. The fame is still separated in five distinct stories of several memorable and very likable characters. Any fan of Japanese RPG's or action RPG's should do themselves a favor and experience this wonderful game as well as any of Vanillaware's products for they are all A+ in gameplay as well as presentation.. Perfect game. It's exceedingly rare how a video game nowadays can keep the player guessing and playing for hours just to see how the story unfolds bit by bit until the very last moment, not to mention a story that appeared to be quite mainstream at the first sight. The feeling of seeing everything gradually fit together until the finale is incredible. The author certainly knows his stuff. He seems to have mastered all the European mythologies and legends by heart to be able to mix and match them at ease without any jarring feeling, while keeping an unmistakably Japanese core at the heart of the story. Also, apart from certain chapters, which felt a bit artificial and prolonged so that each protagonist/individual drama gets the same number of acts, the story is almost flawless: You keep thinking about it even after you finish, and everything just clicks naturally, unlike so many ridiculous money grabs which simply leave gaping holes here and there or make you cringe. Actually, a lot of plot treatments make much more sense than the abrupt turns of events in the original The Ring of the Nibelung by Wagner, which a part of the story loosely adapted. The convincing voice acting (the Japanese version at least) and atmospheric arts also played a big part in it, as well as all the typically Japanese attention to details. In fact, if you take out all the gaming components, this in itself is a top notch hours-long stage drama to be enjoyed on its own. I'd recommend anybody to buy it just for the drama alone. The gaming aspect is quite good, enough to keep you playing and feeling satisfied between acts of the drama. Each character's style is distinctive and enjoyable enough. It's definitely not perfect, though, with difficulty being the major issue. The ""normal"" difficulty felt a bit too easy and sometimes I didn't sweat at all during a full chapter, with some bosses being extremely easy to deal with, and only felt totally geared up for less than 10 boss battles in the whole game. However, once you get used to ""normal"", which is the default, it will be really difficult to switch to ""hard"", which guarantees you to die a few times even battling a middle boss. There should be a reasonable middle ground between them. On repetition, I'd say it's just a minor issue, since although each character revisits the same place in theory, the actual map and battlefield each time is different enough to keep you intrigued. And even the same type of boss has variations in details when battling different characters. 9/10. I definitely recommend it to anybody, no matter you're interested in JRPG or European mythology, or just simply enjoys a good story with soul (which is really rare nowadays), you'll find this game amazing.. I have not played the original PS2 title of this game which is a shame cause I missed out all these years on such a beautiful game. I can say that I have finally found my all time favorite game that I will go back to play a lot more of it in the future. The charm this game has is incredible- the beautiful visuals, characters with different touching stories and different combat in each and one of them, the combat is so simple yet so much fun. From my personal experience I was so touched by this game that in every story of the 5 characters I couldn't hold back and cry a bit (which honestly doesn't happen that often I can tell you that), Honestly just go and try the game yourself and you will see the charm it actually holds, this game is a diamond among the sea of Playstation games and I am glad I have bought it.. It's a beautiful game with fun gameplay and a compelling story. Vanillaware did an incredible job making this game I loved every second of gameplay that it provided.. Got this game, the Storybook Edition. Fantastic art style, 60 FPS, 1080p, top notch animation. Even if it's a remake it's my first play with Odin Sphere. It's amazingly complex and intuitive at the same time. The story is great. I wasn't able to put it down for the entire night. I wasn't sure I would like it. The best c. Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Vanillaware and I have played the original Odin Sphere on PS2. The Odin Sphere was an amazing game and definitely defined what features i thoroughly enjoy in a video-game. However, as fun and as mesmerizing as Odin Sphere was it fell short on a few things which I felt werent game-breaking but many younger games might. Frame rate lag, repetitiveness, and lack of variety between characters other than storyline and slight changes to gameplay were all issue that Odin Sphere fell a bit short in. Enter Leifthrasir~ Leifthrasir is Vanillaware's attempt at taking an already breathtaking piece of work and make it better. And if you don't read the rest of this review Ill sum it up right now and tell you that they were extremely successful. Leifthrasir takes all of the issues with Odin Sphere fixes them. Frame-rate issues? Gone. Lack of variety between characters? Out the window. About the only thing that is still present is the repetitiveness of the levels. Now i know that might sound game breaking, but the thing is that even though level repetitiveness is still present, each character feels like its its own game now. Think Castlevania: Symphony of the Night except instead of just being able to play Richter and Maria, they now have their own storylines and exclusive areas as well as a complex fighting system unique to their character. The battle system is nothing to cough at either. Every battle feels like a street fighter match, where as before it was just a hack and slash. The controls are very fluid. pulling off combos and evading attacks feels natural. All this coupled with new items, revamped alchemy system, and access to Odin Sphere as well as Leifthrasir? 10/10 would buy again. Vanillaware does great work and Leifthrasir is another S rank on their play-card.. Got this game, the Storybook Edition. Fantastic art style, 60 FPS, 1080p, top notch animation. Even if it's a remake it's my first play with Odin Sphere. It's amazingly complex and intuitive at the same time. The story is great. I wasn't able to put it down for the entire night. I wasn't sure I would like it. The best comparison I can give is this: it's a bit like a cross between a Tales of game, old gen brawler and Child of Light. The combat are fast and dynamic, with heavy emphasis on crafting. This is a gem.. It's a remastering of a damn fine game that has been upgraded to near perfect! Odin Sphere on the PS2 was an under-appreciated gem that was swimming in charm, beauty and solid game play but, it wasn't without it's faults. The faults in question were never game breaking or frustrating but rather just tiny little nitpicks here and there that just stopped it from being a near perfect masterpiece. This remastering, however, has fixed any issue the original had and turns Odin Sphere into a game that can sit along side the greatest games ever made. The combat is as fluid and solid as action based combat can get with minor improvements taking cues from Vanillaware's later title 'Muramasa: The Demon Blade' and the more recent Indie game 'Guacamelee' from Drinkbox Studio. The crafting and upgrading systems have been tweaked to be more modern and coherent. The ground breaking graphics and animation have had a crisp make-over and the stunning music and well acted voice work has been cleaned up. This is exactly what a remaster should be; take a classic game and modernize it and make it more accessible without compromising it's original integrity. What else can I say? If you liked the original; this is a better version (and for purists, there is 'classic mode' where the original game play is in tact). For fans of more recent Vanillaware titles like Muramasa: Rebirth and Dragon's Crown; Odin Sphere, in my opinion, is the definitive Vanillaware title. Hell, anyone into action JRPG's in general will find plenty to love in this game. It was an absolutely wonderful experience on the PS2 and it's just gotten better. 10/10","a fan of 13 sentinels: aegis rim and unicorn overlord, i decided to explore more of their games . the moment i saw its captivating art style, i knew i had to play it . the story also became increasingly engaging as it unfolded ."
784.Wipeout HD,"The visually and sonically brilliant Wipeout series is given a HD facelift and some additional modes to compliment the excellent challenge-ladder system introduced in Pulse. Perhaps a little too tough for the casual gamer, but Wipeout veterans will relish the new challenge.. I completed a few of the tournaments but it felt like a chore to play. I don't get the praise, this is a PSPortable game rebranded! and it shows in its short tracks (shorter than the ones on PS1 games) and the simplified physics, ships don't feel like ships anymore, very stiff, very arcadey. The Wipeout series deserved a proper title on PS3 instead of a port of a PSPortable game with cleaner graphics which imo art design wise is a lot inferior to the Blade Runner esque look of 2097/ Wip3out.. Different than most other racing games but nevertheless I still don't feel comfortable to play this game.. I've always enjoyed racing games more than I've been good at them. What I liked most about this game is that it accomodates players like me. One doesn't have to get first place in every race to advance on to the next set of maps, and I was able to complete the whole game without ever getting any better at sliding around corners without running into things. It's pretty, sounds great, and successfully imparts a sensation of zipping past things at barely-sub-sonic speeds.. I played this game round my friend's house last week, and it was a terrible F-Zero clone. The graphics (obviously) are better than F-Zero, but overall it is bad. The controls are under average, for the most part they are fine, but my vehicle kept stopping, even though I didn't let go of the button.. This is a terrific addition to the Wipeout series, and definitely one of the best racing games ever. Great graphics, great gameplay, fun and simple controls... And the sound... The sound is just amazing! Fans, and people who are not familiar with the series, will enjoy this wonderful new installment to the franchise, and I definitely recommend it to any gamer who enjoys a good racing game. It may not be perfect, as far as track designs single-player replay value goes, but it's still really good. 9/10. Besides the obvious mind blowing graphics Wipeout HD also offer a delightful sound experience as well as a enough challenging career mode. Well worth to invest in, even a few years after release date.. Wipeout with excellently smooth controls and polished graphics. Career mode has decent length, variety of game modes, great stuff. Downside: only tracks from past games. Upside: all your favourite tracks again.. Same old Wipe Out. Entertaining, addictive and very, very fast. I have the same thrill as more than 12 years ago when I played it on PS 1. Again, it is the same game with remastered graphics. Do not expect anything more than it provided you with 12 years ago. Just pure and simple fun!. Mildly entertaining, a good diversion from disc-based games. Ive definitely played better racers before, and I'm sure i will play more in the future. Graphics are ok, but not great. Weapons are somewhat fun. Not really my genre of game. Vehicles have barely any variety, they all handle pretty well the same and look the same as well.. The sound, graphics, and presentation of this game are absolutely fantastic. For aesthetics it gets full credit completely. You can read about those anywhere, so I won't go into detail. Unfortunately, it's a game you have to get into and learn fanatically to have any chance at winning. This would be great if I had to develop a skill set - I go nuts for deep and difficult games, like Demon's Souls for example, that make you concentrate and get better to win. But memorizing tracks is pure tedium, not any kind of creative design choice, and that's all the challenge comes down to. Whether or not you know what's coming up, and if you can run the track perfectly enough for that gold to advance to the next track, which you'll have to memorize in the exact same way. There's no depth at all to the skill, it's just whether or not you know exactly what to do for that particular track. With some leeway and better difficulty options it would have been so much better to me, but as it is it's only for those who want to devote their lives to it for a few weeks. And that's why you haven't heard of it more, because it's impossibly difficult, and who wants to go through that just to win a game?. it is impossible not to enjoy yourself when you play this highly addictive arcade racer. Absolutely worth the download. Wipeout HD is among the best games on PSN. The DLC, Fury, is also worth downloading as it expands the singe-player immensely.. This is not the best Wipeout game in the series. This game is in no way better than Wip3out on PSone in terms of gameplay, level design, sound or graphics. It is a hodgepodge of the different Wipeouts. I felt it was average and not rewarding in the end. Gameplay wise, the level design and physics aren't polished. The ships don't feel like planes anymore and are more stuck to the track. Up and down controls on the joystick does almost nothing, whereas in Wip3out they were required to get a good time. With the blatantly cheating pilot assist option this ceases to be a game. A mentally challenged person with a candy bar in their hand could win with this on. No Wipeout game should have pilot assist. Unfortuneate its required for some of the final levels in which the computer almost cheats, then final levels become blatantly easy. The new Zone and Shooting modes are so easy as to be useless filler. If they had increased the difficulty or expanded on them more it could have added to the game. Zone battle is so bizarre I'm not sure its a game. I never lost. The graphics aren't quite as focused as other games, but some of the cell shading and gradients are excellent. There is also good use of 3d forms. Regular Textures and off track scenery are kind of poor, and not very conceptual like Wip3outs mega mall and industrial zones etc. Ship Design was excellent however. The sound design is okay, but the music selection is very bad. It is so grating to the ear and so violent that it doesn't match with the games graphical feel. I had to use my own songs. I felt the music was really poor. There are still some dynamic sound issues, like the music being stuck muted when your ship is low on damage. Lastly the game froze during loading once and I don't know why. So there are still glitches somewhere. I got this game for free, and it is only so-so. I can't recommend anyone playing this when Wip3out is still the better game in the series.. WipEout HD is an enjoyable futuristic racing game that launches the WipEout series on to the PlayStation 3. Anyone who's played a WipEout game will instantly be able to dive into this game. It's great to have something unique on the PlayStation 3 for once. You pick from a selection of lovely designed ships - which their designs match the futuristic look and feel of this game - and pilot them through tracks and try to claim 1st place in WipEout HD's race modes. As well as race modes, there are other satisfying modes such as time trials that race you against the clock and try to complete 3 laps around the track as fast as you can, speed lap which is similar to time trial but you just do a single lap trying to race around the track as fast as possible, tournament where you race through several races and have the most points at the end of the tournament and one interesting and fun mode, zone mode where your ship starts out at slow speed and you progress through the speed zones and passing each zone makes your ship go faster until your eye sockets bleed and your heart jumps out of your body (by the way, the throttle is disabled!) and the more you travel, the more points you earn. This mode in particular shows off some stunning, colourful visuals with beautiful patterns and the pattern changes when you advance to other speed zones. The modes maybe great and keeps things interesting in this game but the visuals are mind boggling. The futuristic tracks, environments and even the ships look gorgeous and the graphics are polished. The visual effects are also colourful and vibrant like from the charging of the plasma before it fires (the explosion it emits when it hits a target or barrier is just as good) to the wavy pattern of lines that the missile leaves as its chasing its target. Speaking of weapons, Sony Studio Liverpool has brought back some of the ace weapons from previous WipEout games like the plasma and rockets and they work just as well in this game than in previous WipEout games. They are fun to use and makes races more exciting and it's a good thing that the weapon selection covers all situations no matter if you're far behind or in front of the pack. Now the game play: The pace of the game is electrifying. WipEout HD provides you with fast and furious racing (and in some instances like the Phantom Class races and later Zones in Zone mode, insane) and the controls are just perfect for dealing with the quick pace of the game. A.I and event difficulty has 3 difficulty settings to choose from: Novice, Skilled or Elite. This makes the game accessible to more casual gamers where they can just enjoy themselves and not get too frustrated playing the game on Novice and more experienced gamers can be given a tough challenge on Elite. This is a game (especially in the higher speed classes) that demands quick reflexes and perfect use of the ships airbrakes to navigate through tight corners without hitting the boundaries of the track. It may seem hard at first to master cornering quickly and the boundaries on the tracks are quite small, practice makes perfect in this game. The track design is simple but well executed and couple with the excellent visuals that this game has, it makes them look striking. It is a shame that all of these tracks are taken from the 2 PSP WipEout instalments, WipEout Pure and WipEout Pulse but I haven't played them so I guess it doesn't matter for me anyways and anyone else who hasn't played the PSP instalments. As with most WipEout games, you need some awesome music to listen to while flying around the tracks and blasting your opponents off the track and WipEout HD has you covered. The soundtrack is excellent with a good selection of electronic/dance tunes which sound as though they belong in the WipEout world. Sony Studio Liverpool even composed original music for the menu screen (which by the way is one of the most well designed and eye catching menu screens ever) which kicks ass and if you've bought the WipEout HD fury pack, it's even more pleasing to watch. Anyway, WipEout HD may be quite a tough game to play but it's easy enough to be played by casual gamers. Costing 12 pounds, WipEout HD is remarkable value for money and considering that your getting a solid campaign and multiplayer modes, there is no reason not to own this addictive racer.",the visually and sonically brilliant Wipeout series is given a facelift . this is a PSPortable game rebranded! and it shows in its short tracks (shorter than the ones on PS1 games) i completed a few of the tournaments but it felt like a chore to play .
785.Grindstone,"Would be a 10 if there was no violence.. Grindstone is a puzzle video game that starts from the base of making colored lines by killing monsters but progresses to excellence due to its setting, the polish of the mechanics and the careful combination of them. Without any monetization mechanics and many updates over the years, it is still extremely addictive.. Although Grindstone may at first glance appear to be another match 3 puzzle game, it does actually have a slightly more original premise. Essentially, the player is required to trace a path through monsters of the same colour in order to kill them, once you’ve killed enough enemies the exit to the next level will open. Staying on a level for longer does offer more rewards, but also greater risks as increasing numbers of enemies attack, and this adds a nice risk/reward element to proceedings. As you progress through the levels further complications are added, such as more powerful enemies and boulders that block your path, but since the core gameplay remains relatively simplistic, this can’t prevent the game becoming a bit repetitive after a few hours and as such it’s probably best suited to short bursts every now and then.. the most enjoyable switch game hands down!! its a puzzle rpg with bosses and great variety of puzzles. i counted more than 300 hours because i finish and start again pro- its relaxing while challenging with enough eye candy its original. cons- DLC cosmetic only other players dont try because it comes from ios/android before. Fun puzzle game with brilliant animation. It was very addictive early on but does start to get too difficult as you progress.. Somehow Capy forgot to convert this from pay to win trash. One of the most overrated games I've seen in a while. Don't bother.. Very addicting. Interesting characters, satisfying game play. Everyone should add this to their switch library!. The game is pretty addictive, and the visual presentation is really nice. However, if you can get it on mobile, you probably are better off playing it there. At its core, the game is a mini-game without much depth, similar to candy crush or minesweeper. A lot of effort has been put into making it seem like it is more, but most of it does not work. There is a ton of gear, and almost all of it is flat-out useless. There is a world map, but no branching, so it is only a glorified ""next"" button. There is an inn, and it becomes tedious pretty much right away, when you have to go back there every time between stages to refill your hearts and repair gear, . At some point, the levels increase in difficulty by making it harder to build chains. But it does not feel challenging, just tedious, when you flop around the board without ever really getting things going. Seems like a lot of effort was put into all the wrong places. Ironically, I would probably rate the game higher if it was the same game, just without all the dysfunctional fluff. The core mechanics are fun and addictive, and I got a lot of playtime out of it. And it could be a really great game, if the RPG elements worked. As of May 2021, the game has a bug, where it does not recognize when you complete a certain type of challenge. All in all, buy it on sale if you are really into casual games or look for something to waste time on the train. It's perfect for that.. What an addictive puzzler. And relaxing in a way. Great atmosphere too. Must have on Switch!. What will you got, if you take some puzzle-solving gamepaly, mix it with barbaric violence, sprinkle it with a pinch of humour and wrap it all up in charming visual cover! You got it right you get the Gridstone! I could say a lot about why I liked the game and what's interesting about it, but I don't want to waste your time so I'll be very brief and just tell you what I didn't like. I have only one complaint about game interface, it can be a little bit clunky when using a controller, but it is understandable, since the game was originally made for mobile (iPhone/iPad). 9 gridstones from 10!. This game is the perfect escapism for me! Not because it builds a world in which I can get lost, but because it is just plain fun! And it fits the switch perfectly! You basically have to get rid of some pesky enemies while combining your moves in order to attack foes of the same color (which you can mix with a simple and easy to use mechanic), and combo the max number of attacks. That's the gist of it, but then you have enemies which grow angry and can attack you, you have special enemies which require stronger moves to be taken down, enemies which give you rewards for defeating them, enemies which actively attack you, and even super cool bosses! Each level takes just a few minutes, the animations are beautiful as in a goofy but well drawn cartoon and the mechanics are super easy to learn, but with room to let you improve (aka ""get good"") and perform really powerful moves, which feel super nice! I have a tone of games on my backlog (like most do I guess), many considered to be the cream of the crop in their genre, but this is the type of game which when I saw some gameplay I just had to try for myself, and once I did... all other games went to stand by! No regrets! This is a truly great game!","without any monetization mechanics and many updates over the years, it is still extremely addictive . without any monetization mechanics and many updates over the years, it is still extremely addictive ."
786.Divinity: Original Sin,"The opening was quite difficult which is an issue. The ending dragged **** the middle was incredible, I couldn't put it down. I think it was awesome that most of the sidequests were the same quality (approximately) as the main story, some sidequests I couldn't even tell were sidequests, and in a market where we barely even get a finished game released, to say nothing about quality of story or sidequests, this was nice. I picked this up with Divinity; Original Sin 2 to decide if I would like to buy Baldur's Gate 3, I wanted to see if the DND type of gameplay would interest me, and it did. I think I might pick up Baldur's Gate 3 in a little while. We will see if I play through the sequel first.. God does not play dice. Game is pure overhyped garbage: dull quests super slow unfair turn-based combat map traverse is slow and tedious UI - makes you literally hurt. Was an amazing game for it's time, paved the way to make it's even better sequel DOS: II. Larian hitting it out of the ballpark as usual.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. the absolute worst. GOOD LUCK GOING THROUGH THE DAMN DOOR TO FINSH THE GAME. After 50 years if you somehow manage to kill everthing in the game, searching every corner for those stupid stone, and find the last stone buried in a **** random place to be able to go through the door, there's a **** bookshelf blocking your way. GREAT. YOU STIUCK. you have to solve more stupuid puzzles BUT WHERE PUZZLES. This is the pinnacle of **** game design. After playing the game for the first time, I played as if I was possessed by something for two hours I ended up with 140 hours of play time and watching the ending It was my first time doing this genre and it was shocking. Few good ideas but not addictive. Addictive similar games: BaldursG2, X-Com, Xenonauts, (Pillares1 - until castle was upgraded to the max). Quests - emotionless, boring. Sometimes i felt like in Plan Escape Tournament hoping ""it would be better next time"" - it wasn't. Second map i was so bored, once another ""point and click"" quest with some barrier, and talking with mushrooms. Dont remeber much except there was some investigation and fantasy dimension (dont like it). I hope DOS2 or BG3 are much better games with more open world tasks. Here World behind is useless and empty - cleaned from monsters. Realtime with pause was good essence of BG2. But this turn based system is better than X-Com. Moving many characters at once is with each concept little bad. I would like more if i'll control one character and rest would be AI which i could send command or design some situation plan.. very nice RPG very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. My favourite RPG so far, i like everything in it, it's just perfect. If you're a fan of great old school ""smart"" and very funny RPG, it's a mustplay!!. One of my favorite split screen games! I wish they would make ""Original sin III"".. Divinity: Original Sin( i will call it just DOS) is first from the wave of ""modern CRPGs"". And it was quite revolutionary for it's time, i must say. Is brings interesting story, quest and characters. As RPG it is very good: you can be an altruistic hero or a veeery bad guy. The main disadvantage of the is, as for me, it's tactics. The thing is that it is based on random stunning effect, and you easily complete the game if you are lucky( or ruin if you are unlucky). The second disadvantage is that it becomes quite boring in the end. I thing it is mainly caused by tactics system. So, i think that DOS is a good game, and deserves 8/10. I can recommend this game to anybody, wgo likes RPGs, CRPGs or love good games.. 6/10 + 1 because of the perfectly executed couch coop. Short: The game with great combat system, but generic setting and the plot that you don't really care about. I loved levelling up, and hated music and visual style. Longer: What ""Divinity: Original Sin"" does very well is the combat system. Levelling up is slow and you rarely gain any new skill - and this was a great decision. After a while you perfectly understand every action you may take, its pros and cons. I played the whole game with my wife in a couch coop way and it was a great way to experience this game. However, I was expecting more from an RPG when it comes to plot and atmosphere. When playing it, I felt like I was playing a hack&slash game with turn-based combat. The atmosphere is dull, generic and the dialogs are poorly written. We either skipped through them or was bored by them. The silly tone both in visuals and in dialogues was more annoying than entertaining. We also hated the music that was so much anti-climatic. Especially that you have to listen to it over and over again during many many fights. The quests were designed in clever way, presenting many ways of solving them, using the game elemental interactions. But beware the riddles. I usually love riddles in the games, but most of them in this game, are based on finding a correct object that you don't know that you are looking for. Overall, it is a good game, but based on reviews I was expecting more. I was constantly comparing it to Pillars of Eternity, which I liked much more. If you want a good gameplay mechanics I encourage you to play ""Divinity: Original Sin"". But if you are looking for a good RPG, keep away from it.. Maybe too small sometimes, maybe story is not toogreat. 10/10 anyway and much better than second game.. One of the advantages of wait to buy this game is that now (2019) when bought it, I get two different experiences. I get the classic version and a enchanted version. It may not seem significant, but it is. They are two distinct experiences of the same fantastic game. I have not finished the game yet, because it is an immense and challenging game, but honestly I think I will not going to finish it for now, at least on this classic version of the game. Little more than 20 hours of playtrough in the classic version I think I have a good feeling of what the classic version have to offer and going to do the same with the enchanted... But back to the game, it is simply incredible. Visually, mechanically. A pure role playing game experience, where the roots of the genre were transposed to the maximum. Fighting for me is the most interesting and challenging element and it is necessary to use the head and the elements that surround us against the enemy. It is a game of elements where fire, earth, water and air annihilate each other in a perfect circle. Its a game where an ""area of effect spell"" reaches not only the enemy but the ally in that area. And it's so perfectly done every single way, every moment on every fight. Those small details are also huge and make this game unique. For me it is a masterpiece of the genre, that I strongly recommend.. OK I initially gave it 9/10 but closer to the end game becomes ridiculous with its quests. The door to the final boss is locked and I need to find 17 star stones in order to get through. Every star stone is kinda a secret in the game, you don't get them that easily. So I'm 90 hours in to the game and now I need to shovel-through the whole 5 areas again in search for these bloody stones. Devs, REALLY!!?? WTF. It's just fckn ridiculous.... boring combat, old mechanics, ugly graphic and terrible story and lore... once again cash grab from glitchstarter end up as failure... go buy something thats actually a game not dead-genre corpse. It's a pretty game, with fun story. The only reason in the end, I found it's good, is that it's voice acted. The AI is broken, making the game easy. The loot system almost seems discouraging and tedious. The lewd mini stories are also questionable. Overall I have it a 4, due to the AI breaking and lewdness. If you can look past, a tedious loot system, a broken AI in the late game and the sexual lewdness then, you maybe think better of it that I.. clocked 51hrs in this game and enjoyed most of it. A very good old school rpg, makes you want to start over mid game to make your playthrough perfect. Would be 9, but the game lost me a bit near the end and I din't have it in me to finish it. Definitely worth trying.. Terribly overrated game. Let me tell you something kids, as a hardcore RPG veteran with decades of experience: Just because you are starved for a new RPG, doesn't mean that every piece of garbage that arrives at the stores and has character stats is worth it. Back in the day, we experienced a similar RPG drought, which ended with Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, and Final Fantasy VII. See? We celebrated with real classics, not this overrated garbage. This game is huge, but only because it is tedius. You will go pixel hunting like a mad man for no reason. It is filled with containers that have nothing inside. It has plenty of mechanics and stats to master but once you finally understand the system it lacks serious depth. The turn based combat is slow, boring, and has no reason to be turn based. The story is meh. The dialogs are cringe-worthy. Decent graphics and voice acting, and after patches is at a very good shape, but this is not enough. It will demand a lot of time and patience from you, but it won't satisfy you. It doesn't really deliver as an RPG. Those who compare this to the classics like Baldur's gate, are out of their minds and i am fairly certain they have never played it. I suppose if you like co-op with a friend, it could be worth it. As a single player experience, just replay BG again. Deserves around a 6, giving it a 1 to counterbalance the overinflated scores.. I have no idea what is with the high scores. The killer of this game is turn based combat. For a genre that is based on a fantasy setting and rpg style, the story should be told at a pace that is immersive. This is no XCOM, I am not trying to play tactical combat, I am trying to live in a fantasy world that is 100 times more interesting than my life; but if I have to play 10 hours for what basically a couple of pages of a books content then **** you. My life is faster paced than this. The combat is not that interesting either, hated the loot due to the distinct lack of explorable sites and random useless items, hated the magic system due to having to collect ****ing books to learn one (really, should you be playing a game where you keep alt+tab'ing to see where to find **** that is ESSENTIAL for your characters). Besides the main story line itself is too short but you have to player hours and hours until yours eyes bleed to get a single step on. Examples of good RPG in fantasy setting that has very good and immersive story and rightly paced: Neverwinter Nights 2, Witcher 2 and 3 etc. Examples of insufferable bad storylined games that are slow paced and relies on annoying side quests instead of their short main quests: This **** Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim etc.. This game ended up being to slow for me (its turn based) But the graphics, lvl design and story is great. Not a game for me but if you like ""turn based games"" give it a try.. Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition New School RPG with an Old School Feel Divinity Original Sin tells the story of 2 source hunters that you get to customize at the beginning of the game, customization is pretty basic so you’ll be lucky to get a character to match your likeness even a tiny bit These source hunters are out to solve a town murder, but while solving this murder they’re sent down a path and realize they need to solve something much larger than this. Before you play this game, you need to be self-aware with the kind of gamer you, because while this game is fairly new, the way it’s delivered isn’t. Don’t expect a top down Skyrim… I was reminded many times of Pokémon, in the sense that every city you go to has its own story that still connects to the main story.., you set out on a journey and that’s it, you’re on your own, see you later or never, the game doesn’t care. It will not hold your hand, other than marking the occasional few important places on your map for you to go check out This is a 60 hour journey that you’ll need to figure your way through. And the only way to do this is to listen to the conversations… At first this doesn’t seem like too much to ask, but every character you run into talks longer than your mom does when she bumps into somebody she knows at a grocery store, I’m almost certain 15 of the 60 hours was spent sitting through dialog.. You can skip through any and all, but this isn’t advised as again, it’s the only way you’re going to figure out where to go to next, you have to literally immerse yourself into the game world to beat it... you have become your character… That being said, if you don’t have the time or patience to literally almost live another life you’re not going to like this game…. Sure you can follow a guide, but who wants to do that for 60 hours? Otherwise, you’ll find this game to be quite the masterpiece You’re solving mysteries and puzzles, there are side quests that can help with main quests, tons of npcs to interacts and trade with, and you want to talk to every npc, helps them, get on their good side and sometimes be able to bring them along your journey.. Their help is much welcomed because outside the city walls the wilderness if full of enemies ready to kill you Beyond the problem solving that’s going on, there is a turn based combat system here… This fighting system is very simple to understand with tons of skills and spells to learn based on your characters skills that you get to freely choose as you level up... You could easily turn a brute to a witch and vice versa…. Through shops, chests, and bookshelves, you’ll find tons of skill books to teach your characters new moves for battles… You have your basic elemental attacks which come in handy since enemies do usually have a weakness, and the environment is completely interactive… You can catch things on fire, blow them up, throw poison grenades, it’s all fair game... My favorite though is the ability to summon creatures to help you… By the end all 4 of my characters could summon at least 1 creature, while only 1 of the 4 were a witch… You aren’t forced to stick to certain skills based on your characters stats... there is an insane amount of freedom here… Still, it took me a little over halfway through the game to get my team so stacked... so for the first half I had to rely a lot on scroll, which can be used to regenerate a fallen member, summoned creatures, or do elemental attacks… I did however feel that I was a little too over powered in the last 40% of the game… I hardly had to think during battles.. It seems as though I’ve figure out the best strategy and it failed maybe 2 times onward… but even the final bosses were a breeze… This made the final few maps feel like a drag, and you kinda get to see just how repetitive the game real is… Still the first half of the game can be insanely challenging at times…. some bosses 1 hit killing your entire team, having to force you to approach their rooms differently so all of your member don’t take the damage… Luckily you can find some epic loot to help with elemental damage, give you some stat boosts, and if all else fails, there is a quick save feature to let you retry as many times as you’d like, or leave, stock up and come back… The journey to the credits though is well worth it.. Especially since your characters feel so real to you They will interrupt when they disagree with your dialog choices, causing you to have to rock paper scissors your way through a decision and this really an extra layer to the immersion.. OF course even better if this other person is sitting on the couch with you, as this game does support split screen coop as well Despite feeling more like a puzzle game for the final half, Original Sin is one of the best RPGs in a long time. But if you aren’t willing to put in the time and effort this game demands, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it I give Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition a 8.5/10. Turn-based RPG games have had a terrific revival this last year, not least spearheaded by this marvellous title from Larian. I played Divinity II a few years ago, which was a small budget but fairly decent title also from Larian, so it really is no surprise that they managed something quite remarkable with a stronger, crowd-funded budget. I hope they keep this level for the next release as well! The game revolves around dual protagonists with one optional companion each, so a group of 2 - 4. The RPG system is kinda new but easily recognizable by seasoned veterans of the genre. There's a lot of fun to be had with the way elements interact and a lot of interesting choices to be made in the levelling system. Mastering the game takes thought and experience but playing the game is easy and intuitive in itself. The story is fun, nothing THAT special narratively, but the true quality is in the telling. Humorous, colourful, varied and sometimes outright dark, it comes together nicely in the end. Lots of little details to explore and combat is very rarely repetitive. It revolves a lot around the four elements and how they interact mixed with some crowd-controlling abilities, buffs and debuffs from other lines (do NOT ignore these if you play on a difficult setting!). The only problem I encountered was that I often mess around with different classes and ideas on a difficult setting while I learn the game mechanics well enough to create my exact party concept. In this game, there is a bit of a lull early on in the game with a lot of story-driven gameplay which can be a bit tedious to replay seven times before you get the party balance right. Apart from that, this game is just quite simply excellent. If you're into RPG games at all, you should definitely check out this title.. Simply a fantastic game in my opinion. I've always been a **** for these types of games. And I wouldn't mind having a few more *hint*. The world is big. And the surroundings are filled with color, life and activity. And when there isn't supposed to be that much life and activity around, there isn't! Enemies are varied throughout the game and battles are often tactical and pretty enjoyable most times. I absolutely love the fact that it's turn-based. I've always loved turn based games like the good old Heroes of Might and Magic games, the Might and Magic games (both from 3DO), Fallout 1 and 2, Wasteland 2, Civilization games, Lords of Magic, Wizardry 8 and even Etherlords games. So understandably, I liked this game a lot. There's a lot you can do, side quests and main quests and general exploring. There are some secrets too and I really like the fact that your two characters can converse with each other. It's also really fun to play with a friend, your friend controlling one character and you the other. Overall, I really recommend this game for any RPG fanatic, and if you like turn-based games, even better.. Baldur's Gate-like quests, Fallout 2-style turn-based combat system, very open character building, tons of crafting, combined effects (make an oil puddle with one spell, set it on fire with another). If you are a gamer, like RPG and aren't against (or are fond of) fantasy theme, this is an excellent RPG game with modern look, far superior to Fallout 4, Dragon Age Inquisition and other semi-casual console ports.. Looking for a real RPG (as opposed to a Hack n' Slash or a platformer with skills tree), I start DOS, and immediately notice I'm in amateur territory: barely readable fonts, and no way to increase them. If you asked me 30 years ago, I would have guessed that the bigger our monitors would become, the better we could read. How it came to the exact opposite is obviously due to a conspiracy of ophthalmologists bribing game developers. Anyway, barely, but still readable, so I keep going. Instead of resting my eyes 15 minutes per hour, I'll just have to swap and actually play 15 minutes per hour. Character creation time. A very exciting step in an RPG for sure, and usually a long one. Here, we start with a surprising surprise: we create 2 characters. Hmm... I'm a bit confused. I like talking at the singular 1st person about myself, and my avatar. That's what happens when a player feels invested in a game, and that's a plus for said game. So, will I have to use the plural, like the famous British tapeworm, Queen Victoria ? We want to be amused, and we are all for experiments, even doomed ones, so we keep going. Characters creation was actually very quick, and very underwhelming. A few skills, some of them opening a talent pseudo-menu (pseudo because it offers actually no choices,) and we are done. Also, there are only 2 races: male and female. Err... I meant... only 2 species: bodybuilder and barbie doll. Anyway, you get our meaning. I mean, my meaning. I both hop on a beach (confusing, isn't it ?) It's a pretty 3d world, not gorgeous like these 2d painted games, but it will do nicely. Someone is talking near the west edge, but stays invisible. These long range constant chatters will prove very annoying in the future, specially in town. They'll make you want to go away instead of doing what you plan on doing. And then, the pixel hunting starts. Pixel hunting is the meat of this game. In the following hours, I will have hovered over, then opened, hundreds of crates and vases. Most of them empty, yet my dreadfully cumbersome inventory screen will look like a huge pile of junk. And that will be enough for me to quit and have no desire to come back. I feel like I've been playing a hack n' slash without the hack. And, mostly, pixel hunting. In 2015. Sure, a few nice things happened in the mean time: playing mostly a thief, I discovered an amusing take on the sneaking trope, and a challenging and interesting pickpocket mechanism. I got involved in a couple of fights, and backstabbing proved satisfying at this early stage. Using magic scrolls also proved very helpful, unlike in any other game (I usually can't be bothered, but here it felt natural.) And that's about it. It's an RPG, so there are dialogues and interactions and story lines and stuff, but one word is enough to summarise them: childish. After the disappointing PoE, I let myself be influenced by the reviews here. Now I will avoid kickstarted games like the plague, since backers suffer from a very peculiar mental block that renders them unreliable.. + light humour, think Terry Pratchett + tactical co-op + personality system + you need to think while fighting - it's refreshing to execute a swift, one-shot strategy instead of slashing hordes of enemies. killing + tactical co-op + unique individuals (NPCs), unusual atmosphere + did I mention tactical co-op? - you cannot finish the game without killing anything/anyone - loot RNG - if played in single player, state of role-playing capabilities is painful Despite the flaws, it's awesome game. It seems Larian tries to back to the golden era of RPGs, recreate what made RPGs great - looking at Planescape Torment, Fallout and Baldurs Gate, instead of following First Person Sword-Swingers trend which spawned from... Diablo. Thanks to this gem, I'm actually able to enjoy playing games again.. Good old-fashioned isometric RPG. So it should look like a true RPG - the sea and freedom of choice, you can make your character anyone. A game with a friend to add a lot of fun.. Divinity: Original Sin is the first in the Divinity series that I have played. Yes, combat is turn-based, but it feels less tedious and more stimulating than than RPGs such as Baldur's Gate. Elemental effects in the environment figure prominently, and are of utmost tactical importance. Rain, water, oil, fire, heat, cold, poison, clouds, lightning -- they are present in spells, in arrows, in weapons, in the environment. A lot of thought went into the elements of combat and it makes for a stimulating and satisfying experience. Hit your fire elemental enemies with a rain storm, which weakens them. Now that they're wet and weak and unlikely to set your own comrades ablaze, move in and follow up with freezing spells to take them out of the action for a couple of turns. It's a lot of fun figuring out the best way to turn the environment against your enemies. The character system is part WoW and part Fallout. You get character attributes, abilities, and talents. Everyone is familiar with character attributes. Abilities are skills that you may level, like talents in WoW. Abilities can be leveled up to 5. Talents are like traits or single-rank perks in Fallout. You either have a talent or you don't -- there are no levels. It's a fair and engaging system with plenty of room for refinement. There are a few things about the game that get on my nerves, though. I'm early in and the story seems a tad weird, even for a fantasy game. The map could use some love. Inventory management and crafting are inferior to WoW, although I admit they are better than Skyrim (but not by much). I also think the game should always auto-save prior to entering combat. Despite these drawbacks, I'm still giving the game at 10 because combat, magic, weapons, and environment are so well done. Also, the game is stable and not buggy. It's almost sad that I have to include that. If you love RPGs, get this game. You won't regret it, especially if you've been disappointed by the current trends in RPGs with boring combat systems (I'm talking about you, Diablo III!). Original Sin outdoes Diablo 3. There, I've said it. The combat is great (do your self a favour and choose a difficulty level that fits your capabilities, you'll be glad you did) and the game is polished in every aspect. Also, a down voting campaign? Seriously? Who in their right mind spends time on the internet handing out 0 scores to great games. Jeez. I guess that's the price of fame, Larian Studios.. This game is more like an adventure game with illogical puzzles and quests. I could not progress anything without a walkthrough, then it becomes a tedious errand running exercise. And when you leave the starting town, it is either empty or full of higher level enemies who kill you quickly. Space is way too slow. Levelling up is weird, the game will not let you increase certain stats to 2. Sank in 6-8 hrs and apart from a few errand quests, could not do anything. If you like slow paced RPGs and adventure games, you may like this, otherwise stay away.. Probably the best RPG of 2014. Absolutely fantastic game, scenario, maps, theme, music etc. The only con is that since it was crowd funded, the cinematics were just animations of images. Definitely worth playing. Tons of content, twist of scenario, many paths to follow in the conversations. This game is a MUST PLAY.. I bought this game 1/2 year ago and was stunned right from the start! I love the graphics, I love the mechanics, I love the freedom, I love the classless system. The story is nothing special really, I confess, but the side quest are very worth the effort! I played it alone, but a friend of mine played it with his wife and they too had a blast. We all cant wait to play the Enhanced Edition also :-). One of my most favorite RPG games of all time. The interactivity is beyond comparison. This game is more like Ultima 7 than BG, though. But that is NOT a bad thing. Its just a different approach - and mind you: Ultima 7 is/was also one of the best RPGs ever made! BTW: why are you still reading and not playing?. Captain Jack dropped us off at a beach instead off at the harbor of Cyseal as the town was besieged by orcs, mostly from the sea. The town, with its sizable harbor, apparently lacked a navy of sorts, which left it at the mercy of the orcish incursions. Well, not quite, for it did have an army called the legion, which would also have failed to defeat the orcs if it hadn't been for some magical crossbows the local hedge wizard had put together. We didn't really mind to disembark as Jack seemed a bit too much like a pirate with his eyepatch, wooden leg and speech spiced with harrs and yarrs. In fact we were certain he was one as he knew the situation in Cyseal all too well.Since pirates prey on local shipping by hiding out in coastal waters, it stands to reason that they are perfectly aware of the comings and goings of ships and people in that harbor and the associated opportunities and dangers. Anyway, he was crash enough to tell us about the plight of the town only when we were about to reach it and proposed ditching us on a beach as if he was offering us a way out. We suspected that the only other option would have been walking the plank. We were source hunters. Source was a thing that sourcerers used to power whatever needs powering. Actually we forgot the last part as we were stuck thinking about sourcerers/sorcerers thing. Somewhere a guy behind a screen in a universe far away thought this brilliant or hilarious and he was even able to convince some other guys in other rooms of that fact. It is indie and therefore it is excusable we were informed. Somewhat further inland we ran into a dead guy. The note on his corpse informed us that some statues convinced him that he could fly. Apparently he took some time to write this down, either before or during his leap of faith. We suspected foul play as it was far more likely that he was killed and then the perpetrator took time to cover this up by planting this note on him. It is that level of (N)CIS writing we are talking about. We found out later that nothing of the sort happened; he actually did write the note(!). But at that point we actually didn't really care one way or another as we were not the law in those parts, in fact we soon found out.. nobody was. After an encounter with a poetic shell(the only highlight) and some undead summoned by some guy which we dealt with by summoning stuff of our own, we encountered two drunk soldiers, then ran into a group of orcs headed by a mysterious man, which would have made mincemeat of us if three sober soldiers had not taken care of them for us. Finally we reached the town Cyseal which was noteworthy because of three things. The first were the dozens, nay hundreds, of barrels, chests, caskets, baskets filled with random content running from nothing to incredible powerful, if you happen to require stats improvements for two stats that are diametrically opposed. The second thing were quests that started someplace, continued at another place, without being clear how to go for one place to the other, and then earned you a trifle experience if you finished them. The last was that exiting the town on the other side too soon resulted in instant death as you need at least one or two levels and be equipped with some good stuff to beat even the three undead lurking on the outskirts. And once we did have that we found out that our gear deteriorated at such a rapid pace that we had to repair our gear every second battle. Furthermore we ran into an imp called ZixZax who was the historian of all events in time, which was really funny, if we had been eight perhaps, a morai who had migrated out of the Greek legends(or a norn out of the Norse mythology) and dozens of more stuff stolen from history, mythology and stories that hailmark this game as superior uninspired as it comes to storytelling, which would not even be so bad if it just had added something original to it, like a twist instead of a silly play of words. At this point we gave up and went to read a book or watch a movie or redo tombraider. Original Sin is a LRPG. A looting role play game which is the wet dream for anyone who wants a nickname that spells micromanagement. You get to loot and loot some more and do that save-before-opening-the-random-chest-and-reload-if-it-doesn't-give-you-anything-worthwhile thing. The loot only marginally improves you scores as does the leveling. The whole thing is aimed at having you spend most of you time on deciding things like: should I use this dexterity +1 and strength +1 / + 10 % poison resistant swo","larian hit it out of the ballpark as usual.. very good game . after playing the game for the first time, I played as if i was possessed by something for two hours I ended up with 140 hours of play time ."
787.Unavowed,"Masterpiece. GOAT. A top-notch game. A top-notch point and click This game is criminally underrated. My favorite modern point and click. Writing is top notch, and puzzles are superior to most similar games. Certain other aspects such as the user interface seem good rather than amazing. Looking forward to other games from them.. Great game, unique. Keeps you playing until you finish it. Developed characters, interesting story.. Unavowed is a very charming point-and-click adventure. It has a great plot, likeable characters and an interesting setting, but its gameplay is somewhat limited and very simple. The game plays very classic, you click on the screen and your character will talk with people, interact with objects or pick them up. You can combine the objects later, use them on something, or give them to someone, with the goal of progressing in the story. The game is divided into several chapters in which you visit certain neighbourhoods and try to solve some mystery that happened there. The most peculiar mechanic is given by your companions, every time you explore a new place, you bring with you two of them, and their skills will help you in discovering the truth. This structure is interesting but also the main limitation to the game: each location is completely standalone and once arrived you cannot leave it, you bring there no object, thus you'll find everything you need to solve the chapter right in the location, and this means that you'll have very limited options, and probably end up trying to combine the 2-3 objects in your inventory with everything in order to progress. Another thing that don't help is that there is no button or way to highlight the interactable objects, so the game feels a bit like a pixel hunt sometimes. Companions are fine, but once arrived in a place you cannot change them, and you start chapters with no idea on what kind of help you'll need, so you'll simply end up always bringing your favourites or trying all of them without any particular strategy. Luckily you can end every chapter with any combination of characters. To summarize, Unavowed is a short but stylish adventure that can be enjoyed especially for its plot and setting, and is recommended to the fan of the genre, but don't expect a masterpiece from it.. Unavowed spins an excellent plot, interrupted by enough puzzles to make the gamer feel smart. A good premise is an excellent way to hook a player at the beginning of the game, and Unavowed has one of the best, in my humble opinion. It begins with an exorcism on Player One, and once that’s done, the successful exorcists explain that you have been possessed for a year and that the demon wearing your flesh has been cutting a bloody swath across New York. Worse, the slaughter served some unknown agenda. Luckily your erstwhile rescuers are professional hunters of the supernatural, and they’ll have your back across six missions plus the finale. And it’s up to you to follow your own trail of corpses and clean up the mess. Thus begins The Unavowed. I was immediately hooked, and that engagement didn’t let up until the credits rolled, and it only slightly tempered off until they rolled a second time. The Unavowed is a great plot told in an adventure game fascinating between competent and excellent. With regards to gameplay, there is little to be said. The Unavowed is an unapologetic adventure game, with long conversations and a lot of inventory puzzles. A twist is proved by your companions: Every chapter you can pick two out of four companion characters to go with you. They provide background chatter, but into your conversations and serve as inventory items to rub against parts of the game world to unlock progress. As fantastical as the plot gets, the puzzles and riddles are all based on sound logic. They make you feel clever without you necessarily having to be clever. Also, whenever you get stumped, which usually happened to me when I solved a puzzle and wasn’t quite sure where to go next, you can ask your companions, and that would usually help me along just fine. With regards to the plot and the script, they are what helps The Unavowed become an excellent game. The story is cleverly structured into chapters, each about a game session long and providing a satisfying arc and an antagonist to defeat, and each chapter tightly connected to the central mystery of what your demonic squatter is actually up to. Add to that a Sixth Sense level twist at the eleventh hour and a very satisfying conclusion, and the judgement can only be: Dave Gilbert’s script is excellent. The dialogue is also excellent, not only because of the word, but because of the cast. Logan Cunningham brings his unbelievably sexy timbre to bear, but everybody really brings their A game. The score is just as great: Excellent mood pieces, effective stingers… What more can you ask for? The visual side of things is where your mileage may vary. The Unavowed is an Indie game, and here is where it shows: The lovingly crafted pixel art that unfortunately looks worse and worse the bigger your monitor is. I hear some people are fans of this art style, but my proclivities go more in the direction of Control, so I merely tolerate it. It may still mark it as excellent among its peers that the game nevertheless got me to care for the mass of pixels I was piloting. Still, even I was wowed by some of the Hopper-esque backgrounds. All of this adds up to a great time at the Keyboard. Highly recommended. TLDR: If you like the classic or even Telltale school of adventure games, do not sleep on this. If you are a fan of Urban Fantasy, don’t sleep on this. There is little here for the Follower of the Twitch Reflex, but everybody else should not miss out on this excellent yarn.. the best game about ssupernatural and horro and the music verry great and the good writting. All the elements are either barebones or underbaked: puzzles, characters, story, the short stories making up chapters, animations, you name it. Choices are there, but they do not carry weight. I would recommend playing The Council instead, each of these elements is better realized.. Pretty cool mash up of classic point and click adventure game with ""Bioware"" companion and dialogue choice mechanics. I really enjoyed it and it modernises the old school formula a lot.. One of the best games i ever played, it was really fun and i would play it again probably just bcs of sheer amount of choices u can have.. Fun story with some really excellent writing. There's a couple of cool twists I never saw coming, so kudos to writer David Gilbert for that. The game has many of the shortcomings you'd expect from a low-budget indie project, but the writing generally carries it through pretty much effortlessly. The puzzles do get a bit samey towards the end, and they typically range from amazingly simple to bizarrely specific (the latter referring to an instance where you have to know about a particular riddle from outside of the game, which I know of but the game never showed any expectations for me to need out-of-game information so it came across as a little unfair). Overall though, the stories within each mission are all well told and interesting if you can ignore the gameplay required to reach them, so I'll forgive it somewhat. The ending is pretty cool and as a whole, the game is well paced, so if you like point-and-click adventure games and the fantasy genre, check this one out. It's sure to be worth your time!. Favorite Thing: Having multiple ways to solve puzzles based one which characters you are using is pretty cool. Least Favorite Thing: I got stuck a few times because I could find the pixel wide objects. Date Completed: 2019-04-07 Playtime: 8h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: It's another solid Wadjet Eye adventure.. One of the BEST old-school Point-n-click Adventures! Enjoy a Game that even has re-play value!. I thought i couldn't find perfection in point & clicks adventures. I was wrong, I found it in Unavowed. Thank you Wadjet Eye Games.. Excellent narrative adventure and lore. Don't expect many puzzles or an inventory full of items. Almost everything is straight forward, this is usually boring but the story itself keeps it really interesting. While i'm not fan of this genre I enjoyed it!. The puzzles didn't make me want to pull my hair out! I never stumbled on the answer of a puzzle by randomly combining objects; the only time I had to confront a guide it turned out my game bugged out and I had to restart. So that aspect is great. I liked the supernatural detective agency feel and the game goes out of it's way to reference lore that makes the world feel fleshed out. Story has some cool/surprising moments and there are multiple endings. Characters feel like real people just with fantastical powers. This game does everything right from a point and click perspective. Very good mood, I was waiting for something like this since The Wolf Among Us. Unavowed has a few clever ideas and adds something new to the old genre. If you like point&click adventure games it is a must play!. The story, the characters and their conversations are boring. No voice acting for the player's character. Instead there are multiple characters which make only tiny differences. There exist some ugly animations and some nice background graphics. In my opinion they should increase the resolution even more. The music is good. It's not Wadjet Eye Games' best adventure. I wish they could evolve more.. The story if ok, and the game is fine. If you like Lovecraftian aesthetics you might like it, but the story and the universe aint really so spooky. This isnt a horror game per say, there is nothing scary in it, just ""otherworldly"". Ok. It's overhyped. It's a good indie adventure game. It does the job well. Experience is great, but not unique. Music is awesome. And it's the only ""awesome"" thing here. The rest of this game - you probably have seen it somewhere else. For adventure/point click games lovers it's must play. For everybody else (99.8% of Earth population) it's meh... if you are bored, you can play this. For me, it's a game just to kill some time before next AAA. You will forget this game in a week. But after all it's good product in Money-Entertainment-Time terms.. Excellent writing, acting, music and art. Clever, moving and (a rarity in adventure games) *very* replayable. I cannot recommend it enough... For years now, if you like clever point & clic adventure games, Wadjet Eye Games is the company to look for. With Unavowed, they've really outdone themselves again releasing an exciting, fun, compelling game ! Honestly, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.. Another hit from Wadjet Eye Games. If you like adventure games, this is a must play.","a short but stylish adventure that can be enjoyed especially for its plot and setting . writing is top notch, and puzzles are superior to most similar games . the game has a great plot, likeable characters and an interesting setting ."
788.Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts,"Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is the first expansion to the amazing WW2 RTS Company of Heroes. This time you get to play as Tommy and Jerry. The effort to distinguish the gameplay styles of the two different factions is very apparent in this expansion. But it is not at the expense of enjoyability. The campaigns are again based on major WW2 operations and they are pretty realistic. Overall a good value for the money. Final Verdict: 84 %. pluspoints + two factions more with cool units + a true strategy game + in the time it released,very good graphics + a lot of maps + good campaign + fun to battle others ( i still do it with my dad ) negative points - multiplayer matches could be easier to set up ( like , finding somewone in multiplayer and start the match) but i am not gonna give it for one negative point a 9 no a 10 because this is the best strategic game ever. Completely awesome and as good or better than the first. Adding the brits my fav class adds a whole new gameplay, camping never was so much fun with awesome artillery and garbage tanks these guys know how to stay away from combat and blow #$%^ up. Campaign switches up gameplay mildly still fun and worth the time. Worth $50. Epic expansion to the best RTS of ALL TIME! What are you waiting for.. BUY your cd key, plug it into steam, and start enjoying yourself. See you on the front lines!. An excellent expansion to an already great game. This expansion made the original Company of Heroes so much better. Much more depth and more intensity to the game play online. Very well made. 10/10. I love this game!, the reasons that I do not give a 10 is because they are very few factions and in multiplayer of classic or skirmish you can't play as a fictitious faction with the units of the American vs. Americans, or Germans vs. German. And with the original game, together I'll give them a 9.. If you loved the original game you'll probably like this expansion as well. It offers two new campaigns which are worth playing, if not fantastic. Overall I liked these significantly less than the original, due to short length, limited unit selection, and insufficient information. I found that often you just had to figure out on your own what the new units/buildings did, and this was even more frustrating on the German campaign because all the unit/structure names were in German. Despite this, Opposing Fronts was a fun experience and I wouldn't let these shortcomings deter me from recommending it.. Since I'll be getting CoH 2 soon I thought I better step back in time and finish the Opposing Fronts expansion which I put off for some reason. The campaigns are split in two so it is about the same length as the first game but it just feels shorter. The campaigns seem a bit forced and rushed while lacking any depth. Relic reused maps within the campaigns instead of creating new and interesting territory to fight for. The gameplay is similar but the challenges are too simplistic; defend here, destroy a bridge, set up a roadblock. Someone else mentioned it below but the AI artillery is automatic and deadly in this game and designed to be a hindrance to the point of frustration. Another bad design option was the use of sequenced timed missions which can be triggered by capturing points along the map so you'll be in the middle of completing an objective and suddenly be on the timer for the main mission. It's a fun game if you like RTS but not as good as the original.. This game adds my favorite faction the British 3rd Company and 2 more campaigns. A Britsh Campaign featuring the liberation of Caen, the British Airborne and Canadian volunteers. The second campaign features the Panzer Lehr holding back Operation Market Garden. Both the campaigns have excellent plots, great characters and emotional depth. The new factions add more tactical depth to the game. The new Factions make Multiplayer a much more varied experience as you struggle to hold off the versatality of the British with their mobile bases and the Panzer Elite with their interesting style of Armour warfare. The campaign alone is a good 8 hours of gameplay and multiplayer adds dozens more.. One of the WORST!!! Games i have ever played... just a bad camera position, far too close to get a good overview, especially because you have to micro your soldiers all the time!! all of your units... they get nothing done and often do things first after the 3rd or 4th direction. They are unable to find the shortest way and some times just run in with enemy fire instead of attacking, very unuseful for a mortar for example. The online don't run anyway and there is no support... i am scared of THQ giving their name for such a crap. If you want do something good, don't buy this!. The best RTS there is in my opinion. Best played with friends against each other or with friends against the AI. The animations are not really necessary in this type ****, but bring in lots to the overall experience. This game is pretty pretty pretty. Old game yes, but very much worth a try.. Great game....many hours spent with my friends. To be honest this game has paid for itself over and over with the time played. If you are a FPS type of person only, then dont bother, but if you like RTS games even a little bit then you will love this game. Lots of custom maps made by the public is a plus. Check out the D-Day Co-Op ****..... This is quite an old game but maybe somebody will still decide to buy it know. This is THE best RTS game ever. The single player is very good but multiplayer is grand. The newer games like warhammer series may have a more detailed graphics but they fill to me more like an childish arcade game. In CoH you have by far more tactila options, there is a greater variety of different troops. I really hope that we will see a new addition to this franchise.. One of the best expansion packs ever and more missions to play back with another story to tell. This is where some of the best modification add-ons come to life with this expansion.. Definitely one of my favorite RTS games. The Company of Heroes series offers many great campaigns to enjoy, different factions and a true to history feeling. The Squad-based strategies are easy to get into yet are challenging to use correctly. Upgrading and equipping your troops with specialised weapons is an essential part of the game, and the balance is nicely achieved; you can counter the biggest tank rushes if you use the right units, use cover or hide in buildings. Great franchise, amazing value!",company of heroes: Opposing Fronts is the first expansion to the amazing WW2 RTS Company of Heroes . this time you get to play as Tommy and Jerry . the campaigns are again based on major WW2 operations . overall a good value for the money .
789.OutRun,"+ Acrade experience brought home+ Pick up and play+ Makes you feel fast+ Multiple endings~ Remake makes the game easier~ Short, but thrilling experience- Nothing else to this game than going fast. Great, I was playing crazily then my laptop just shut down, now I have to play Run 3 game from the beginning, **** had better let users save their progress.. Out Run is a classic game that just about everyone should know. For me though, it was surpassed by its sequel so it is a shame that is not available on 3DS. However this version of the original arcade game has been made with so much love for the source it is hard not to be impressed. The widely-touted 60fps certainly makes for a smooth experience, and should help persuade some naysayers that the higher framerate is quite important to the experience. You can unlock a 30fps arcade mode that more accurately emulates the original machine, for purists out there who want to play the game as it originally existed. The 3D effect (I had to turn it down to about 3 quarters for comfort) is, like in Sonic The Hedgehog, very well realised and more so than Sonic this game was made for it - any into-the-screen racing game surely will benefit from the real sense of depth seen here. The music, legendary as it is, is probably the most important part of the game and all three original tracks are here. There are also 2 new songs created to fit in with the originals. I haven't spent enough time with them (against 30 years with the originals!) to really get a feel for them, but initially impressions are that they are very good and welcome additions to the track list. You can unlock upgrades to your car to make the car handle better, or otherwise change the game mechanics. These are switchable once unlocked. Different combinations change the colour of your car, which is a nice touch. Arcade cabinet emulation is added, including the option to have the screen move side to side as it did in the original machines. I found this disorienting but better with the 3D turned off, but won't be using it. Still it is a nice addition and makes the package complete. If you haven't experienced Out Run this is a great place to begin. Unlike home console ports of the time, which were naturally lacking thanks to less powerful hardware, this game is a perfect recreation of the actual arcade game. The only way to improve this would be to create a similar remake of Out Run 2.. This is the best version of this majorly iconic game in the history of gaming, arcades, racers and SEGA, and a s well as a must have for all 3DS users who enjoy playing games in 3D. Many options and extras including new songs, car customization and the ability to simulate the different arcade cabinets (including the physical sounds they make!). This is such a great fan service and an impressive job!. I cant write a better Review than MusicManiac1965, so I just say it is worth every Dollar / Euro whatever. All the SEGA 3D Ports are excellent and they are getting better with every new Release. So, if you are on the Fence and like Outrun / 2D Racing Games, this one is a no brainer.. Every oldschool arcade gamer have been waiting for this release. With the Sega Saturn having the honor of having the best home console port, the 3DS has now the best version on the handheld. So, what makes this port so special? Here are a few points, ranking from graphics to sound, and not to forget: Playabillity. - Framerate has been improved upon. The arcade game ran 30 frames per second, the 3DS version 60, making for a extremely smooth oldschool arcade racer. - 2 new songs that where played by the hardware of the game. So the sounds are from the 80's hardware, but the compositions are composed also with that feel of the 80's in mind. They fit the game very well. - Unlockable extras. They are: 4 tuning parts. With one that improves steering, speed, less speed penalty when you collide with traffic and road furniture, higher top speed, and no speed loss when driving off the road. Also a Arcade mode is unlockable, where the game runs 30 frames per second, with it's own highscore table. - 3D effect looks cool, especially in tunnels and between those high rock wall this gives the speedy feel of the game a positive boost. - All buttons can be re assigned. I prefer A to be Acceleration, B for Brake, and R for gear swap. You can also go for a different way of gear use: Hold down the button for low gear, and release for high gear. This is most usefull for the gamers who knows how to do that gear shift trick to keep speed if you get off the road without using that unlockable option. Also you can stear the car with the thumb stick or the D pad, witch you don't need to select, both of them work stright away. - Lots of dificulty settings. Just like with the Sega Saturn version, you can give yourself more or less time, and choose to have a lot of traffic, or even a empty road! So for every play level, there's a skill level, everyone can at least finish the race, no matter how good or bad you where in the past. So all those positive points, and i did not even came to the best part. I think they did a brilliant job on the controlls. With the D pad i am a little more comfortable than the thumbs stick because before this release, i played Out Run a lot on the GameBoy Advance on Sega Arcade Gallery. So i was used to the sensetivity from a D pad, but in this new version, the D pad even feels more smooth than on that older version. There is only one thing that i feel is a shame, and that is that because this is not a big release, they did not go for the Ferrari licence, so the car is a red fictional car. At first, i thought this would remove that oldschool feel i have with the game, but play for a few minutes, and you don't even notice this anymore, mostly because they still did a great job of animating the movement, crash sequence, and somehow it still looks a bit like a Ferrari car, be it without the iconic stripes on the door/side pannel. So there you have it, and all this for just a small fee. This is not just a game that has been emulated, it has been re programmed, and done superbly! All fans rejoice, Out Run is back!","the 60fps makes for a smooth experience, and should persuade some naysayers that the higher framerate is quite important to the experience . the music, legendary as it is, is probably the most important part of the game and all three original tracks are here . you can unlock a 30fps arcade mode that more accurately emulates the original machine ."
79.Diablo,"A great classic which I couldn't finish back at the time, but now I've finished it and I had a lot of fun.. The game that almost caused me to fail a grade. The game that started it all.. I played this game a little too young, and I was absolutely gripped with terror. The bloody, demonic hellscape, the 1990's digital graphics, and a piercingly potent soundtrack created an unbeatable aesthetic.. Since I don't have nostalgic feelings, it's easier to comment objectively. The game hasn't aged well, unfortunately. It has no QoL updates by today's standards that will allow you to play the game for long hours.. my first serious game on PC. Game isn't perfect, but its atmosphere, music, characters... you close your eyes, play Tristram music, and back to your desk on 1996.... It's a decent game. I wish the character could run... but that'd probably sort of ruin the atmosphere. It's a fun play even in 2024.. Having played Diablo 2 before this atrocious mess, I had savoured just how many improvements had been made since the original Diablo was made. Not only were the graphics vastly improved, but the gameplay too, plus more. Let me annhilate Diablo 1 to explain myself. Graphics...good, fro a 1996 game, no doubt about that. Music...dull and pointless; are we playing a horror rpg or dungeon crawler? WHATS WITH ALL THAT LOOPED SCREAM!?!? The menu setup is horrendous, you have to click here and there just to choose one item, and there's not enough room. Also, whilst you may power up and beat the hell (pun intended) out of the demonic hordes, when it comes to the main boss per area, boy, does he knock seven bells out of you (your so -called improved armour not only disintegrates per boss blow, but your health gets zapped too, and yes, the flimsy menu does not help either, when u need health, mana, etc). Also, the storyline would have been fab if the game play etc would have been implemented correctly. The monotonous slashing/arrowing flinging, coupled with spells that cant faze the bosses, is just so annoying and repetitive. I gave Dungeon Siege 1 a bad score, but after suffering the repeated humiliation after hours and minutes of leveling up, really made me grind my teeth. Needless to say, I gave it to my local charity shop so someone else could suffer its bizarre shenanigans. And people say this is a world-renowned eye-opener...pfffffffff!!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Playable game even from todays perspective. Random generated dungeons pretty interesting to clear. But game not aged that well. Character controll is bad, mobs sometimes too hard too kill. It was a revolutionary game, but I don't like it, only click&click to kill enemies with no history or special concepts, no enough variation, only push down floor by floor. I really liked Diablo 1 when I first played it. A dark fantasy game with challenging gameplay and nice art? Sign me in. Nowadays FromSoftware is doing it better, but the OG Diablo 1 have its place in my memories.. Well-crafted playground. Simple yet charming. At that time, Blizzard was completely different from what it is now.... Diablo 1 is still great game but needs mods like DevilutionX. It's superb when playing with The Hell 2 mod.. creepi, scary, every monster can kill you and makes exploration terrifying. I played it again in 2022 and the charm is still there, 100x better than D4 XD. a better game than diablo IV I've spent over 2000 hours in it and I really recommend it for the experience and gameplay. An absolutely amazing game. If you pick this up in 2023, and you should, then play it with the mod called The Hell for the best experience.. A masterpiece that made me feel scared while playing games late at night. I was 20 years old.. i thınk this game not realy because this game perfect and better than other games. Please all hail before the mighty Diablo franchise. This game created a term for average gamer: ""Diablo like"". Possibly ancestor of hack and slash ARPG.. It is pretty good, old but good, nothing more to say really, it is like diablo 2 just older and less fun.. What's there to say!? It's THE ledgenday Diablo, from the time when Blizzard was the best game studio in the world. The stuff that Sweet childhood memmories are made from.. Atmosphere, music, voice acting, progression pacing, this game is a masterclass in all of the above. Only the gameplay and abilities/spells show their age a little, but if you go into it expecting an old school classic arpg that defined the genre, you will not be disappointed.. Very cool game, cool spooky atmosphere. The game is fun to play. It's had a great impact on the industry, so you should check it out.. I recommend giving it a try. This game are awesome. 10/10 2022 Diablo Epic. My first experience with Diablo 1 was on playstation and it was the worst thing that happened to me... I'm a Blizzard fan (not anymore after WoW SL release) but this game was such a garbanzo back then. I bet it would be different if played on PC.. Grew up on this game. Sure it has old mechanics, and it feels somewhat clunky compared to today's (2022) games... but this game is still a hardcore gem of an adventure. If you don't mind the old school game once in a while, you should try it.. This game launched a new series. A new genre. I played it way later than I should have. But the RPG and grindy elements really got me.. The start of my game life literally. My first game ever. And I played it two months straight until I realized I played the demo only. Still better than any other game at that time.. Still a go-to game. If I could have the hours I've spent playing this game back, I wouldn't want them. I am the rogue. I'm no milk maid.. The legendary game is the progenitor of the genre created by those Blizzards who created masterpieces. The first of its kind. Whoever digged this at 86, found a goldmine. A designer must always look back on what has gone well with this game to find answer about the current age.. piece of history and the best diablo... Must play game... Diablo 2 sometimes is boring but Diablo 1 is a jewel.. The nostalgic feeling I get form thinking about this RTS trend setter for so many games. Made me start getting into the genre I will never leave. Just epic.. A helluva start to this series. Easily the second best game in the series. Its only draw back is its lack of depth compared to D2. If not for that game, I would rate this even higher. Also, still feels like a better game than D3 to this day.. The music, sound design, and aesthetic are all great. Generally, this game holds up surprisingly well, but it is held back by its often frustrating level design and poor AI.. I loved the mood of the original diablo but compared to its sequel Diablo is a bit outdated.. In rating this game as if its 1996, but ill tell you how it holds up now. The atmosphere is the main thing and the village music is stuck in my head with the walking patter sound. You can still enjoy this game if you just forget that its 2021 and imagine you are in 1996.. Hard to rate today. Back then I would give a 9/10 and would praise the dark atmosphere, good gameplay and mechanics that keep you going on to improve your character. My negatives would be that it could be longer as I finished the game quite fast and that the conclusion is not that satisfying (but a great set up for Diablo 2). Today it is not that good anymore as newer games have set the bars higher and Diablo 2 is better in all regards. So today I am more in the 6/10 range but must say I am under the influence of nostalgia and it could be worse for those who have not played it before. It is an action RPG and for many a primary example for hack and slash. A mayor aspect is getting better equipment from loot or merchants to steadily improve your character (There is the newer term “Loot porn” for this kind of games;-). The game is set in the town Tristram which was build on / near the ruins of an old monastery. There strange things happen as people vanish and live in a state of fear as there are rumors about the things that lurk in the underground of the ruins. Your character is an adventurer that wants to solve the mystery and explore the ruins. Good set up and atmosphere. Story wise it does a bit more than is needed and I appreciate this especially in its genre. For the gameplay: You chose between 3 characters: Warrior who focuses on melee, rouge who focuses on ranged combat and sorcerer who is specialized in magic. Each one has a unique ability and different limits for the attributes. I used all characters and favor the rogue for ranged attacks as they made the game easier. You get experience by killing monsters and side quests. For each level up you get 5 ability points that can be put into the 4 stats strength, magic, vitality and dexterity. These are connected to lifepoints, mana, hit% etc. There are of cause also items that raise these stats and you are always on the hunt for better loot / equipment. There are ability point restrictions for items and spells. For clarification: You can in theory learn all spells and use all items for all characters. However a warrior has a much lower limit for magic than the sorcerer so that higher level spells are not possible to learn (Don't remember if you can outmaneuver this with equipment that raises the stats). Also it would be a waste to nullify the class advantage but you are free to develop your characters as you want. You explore the underground of the ruins and go deeper and deeper while fighting stronger and stronger enemies. If you do not get better items and level up you will be at a huge disadvantage. The items have rarity levels and the rarer the better as by genre standards. Remark: Uncommon items must be identified and there is a degradation system in place. You can of cause repair these in the town. I already point out the negatives that the game is too short for me and the conclusion can be a disappointment (But is fully justified by lore and story). The graphics were good for its time but did not age that well. Maybe a bit to dark in some places but that is the set up for a dark scary dungeon so I cant complain here to be fair. Overall this was an excellent game for its time and started a successful franchise. I have fond memories of it (“Fresh **** has one of the most loyal fan bases and is well know. I can not recommend it today for new players as I am too biased by nostalgia and newer games make this look inferior. However I can recommend it for those who want to experience the basic of franchises and it gives a clear example how a game series can evolve. I give an 8/10 with a nostalgia bias warning.. Now *this* is a true timeless classic ****. As much as I enjoy D2, this first entrance into the franchise is what does it for me. It is likely due in some part to nostalgia bias speaking, as I grew up watching my mum playing this when I was little, then playing it myself. But I will do my best to speak from an objective point of view. tl;dr: 9/10 only because there is of course that retro game clunkiness present in a couple of features. I'm trying to be objective here but for the record my nostalgia would give it a 100/10 :P Pros: > Replayability. I've played and re-played this game countless times. Its replayability is off the charts. Fully randomised maps, randomised enemies from a pool, randomised quests from a pool of I think 4 for each section. So many ways to make each and every play-through unique. I've never had the same run experience twice. > Art style. Hoo boy, that dark and gritty gothic style lends itself so well to the subject and the setting, and complements the graphic capabilities of the time. Even today in 2021 I would say that graphically it holds up decently. It's not perfect by any means, but it looks almost like something faux-retro that an indie team might put out today. But it IS actually retro, and back when it was released, it was ground-breaking in its detail and variety. > Music. Holy christ on a biscuit the score in this game is SO. FREAKING. GOOD. Atmospheric, chillingly eerie and dripping with creep factor. The orchestral choir vocals of the dungeon theme. That little guitar riff in the catacombs. The deep, booming drums in the caves. The distorted baby cries in the hells. And we must not forget those iconic opening strums of the Tristram theme, which creates such a safe harbourage in tone from the chaos of the descent below the cathedral. I cannot express enough how much I adore the score, I listen to it casually on the regular. > Horror. Just go look at the butcher's room. For real though, the game can get downright suspenseful when you're waiting for the next enemy to come running toward you out of the shadows or from around a corner. Sure, it's not P.T. or anything, but it achieves what I think is an impressive amount of thrill and suspense for such a simple top-down dungeon crawler. > Gameplay. Gameplay is in the middle for me. On one hand, I love the way each class is characterised and has its own strengths and weaknesses. There's a little bit of overlap, but not too much, e.g. every class can theoretically learn spells or use every type of armour/weapon, it just depends on how difficult you want to make the game for yourself. :P But, that being said, it is still a click-fest. Careful not to get carpal tunnel here. The generalised stats also leave something to be desired, but I'll give them a little leeway as it's just a dungeon-crawler, not an open-world RPG. We need to be careful not to get too carried away with comparing a game from 1996 to games from 20+ years later. Cons: > Clunkiness. Yeah, the game can be a little clunky. I personally find it charming and am used to it, but I can understand that someone trying to play it for the first time today may struggle a little with slow movement speed, lack of scrolling for vendor item lists, negligible inventory space (which is probably due to monitor sizes at the time), and in the lowest levels often pretty disproportionate enemy spawns that can all but halt your run if they catch you off guard. There's also the distances of Adria and Wurt from the town centre that can grow tiring. Oh and the fun of loading and reloading your game to get the right stuff in the vendors' lists. I recommend muting or you'll have ""well, what can I do for ya?"" and ""I sense a soul in search of answers"" burned into your subconscious lol All-in-all I think that Diablo 1 is a fantastic example **** classic title. It plays well to this day and is short enough to enjoy casually over a few sessions, or even one if you want to and have lucky drops and quest/map pulls. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience something truly atmospheric, timeless and made with love. Go forth and slay those demons!. the elixirs that pump up stats unnecessarily is meaningless and destroys the hype of the game totally.. great atmosphere. Graphics, remnant fiction, music. Incredible. even after nearly 25 years.. This game was a milestone, but after some years it was outdated. With the mod belzebub this game is a masterpiece again and works great on modern systems: Better graphics, resolution and some little changes in the gameplay. The story was always great, just read the manual.. This game was pure brilliance. It defined a genre and revolutionized gaming. That is not an overstatement. It is still being cloned to this day and even now with the advances in technology most of the copycats are still worse.. Well. It's Diablo. If you never experienced it and like loot and dark tone, you should give it a go. This one might lack in gameplay compared to the sequel, but without doubt has the most heavy atmosphere.. Classic! Could be a bit repetitive due to grinding and simplistic click-based gameplay. Rich atmosphere and user-friendly difficulty is what Diablo is all about. Back then - absolute hit, today some mods can enrich it.. I've lost count of how many times I've played this game and age of empires at the time. In fact, I just finished and I don't even know what year I'm in. Essential.. Played on PC. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. A milestone in gaming history. It was the first game I remember that I was falling for big time. At that time, Blizzard was able to make games that would become immortal classic for the many years. An interesting plot and game-play, but the second part, as it seemed to me, was much more significant for the history of the gaming industry. Still, it was very good game for its time.. better than diablo 2 and 3. the closest game is this game of course diablo 2 but wthout expension. diablo2 ex makes the serie like loot game kills the mood mostly. diablo1 was about first dark mood and music gameplay then the loot or items.. This is the game that started it all. This classic is one of the best games created. This is where the dungeon crawl and looter started. This game is a must have.. A lone hero arrives to a dismal village and receives the quest to explore a dreadful dungeon reaching from the accursed damp catacombs of a desecrated church down to the flaming depths of hell. This isn’t about raising numbers, it’s about going down all alone. The strong sense of place and momentum, a remarkably simple yet effective combat system and a prodigious soundtrack which cannot be complimented enough push the player into descending through walls of wailing demonic flesh until reaching Diablo himself -this is a horror tale with nightmarish sounds, grim visuals and a bare-bones RPG system fueling an aggressive gameplay more akin to id’s shooters than to anything else. Everything works like a clock, even that which taken by itself seems unfitting -such as the limited inventory and speed of the playable character- forces the player into constantly making relevant choices with both delayed and instant consequences (i.e. life or death), which account for the rather slim character building. As a proper masterpiece, Diablo is the father **** characterized by a brutal immediacy, set apart from the hordes of clones it spawned -a classic.. I visited this site out of morbid curiosity. I can't understand how some people get so adamant over a mere game. But anyway, I love Diablo so much that I frequently have wet dreams over it and I have been known to **** while playing. Oh, and once I was so engrossed in the world of Diablo that I forgot to eat for about six days...I lost about ten kilos. No joke, man. And one time I felt so in love with the game that I couldn't help but lick the screen for a while. I'm not proud of that. I know it's weird, but stranger things have been known to happen amongst game freaks.. I remember asking my christian mother about things I had encountered in Diablo after playing it at a friends house, and how that made me really contemplate the grey areas of morality for years to come. Where the fallen really deserving their fate? Can a crown really hide a persons madness like that for real? Was it stupidity or nobility at display at the ending scene? The thick atmosphere made my young imagination venture to places it had deep yearnings to shape and explore, and the poetry, the tales and books slingshot me into halls from which I had previously been blind...Experiencing Diablo was an honing of my soul, it was testing me on so many levels. Maybe the greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing us that he was god.. Diablo is a classic, on all perspectives, on all categories. It transcends time. I probably will play it again many times before i die.. The original diablo was a whole new style of gameplay for me and set the scene for all future point and click attack style games. Incredible story line as well.. Excellent game, nothing like the trash diablo 3 we see today from blizzards mishaps. They need to re visit why diablo 1 and 2 were so much better than diablo 3.. Now very dated, and 'in comparison' to modern titles seems like a laughable attempt at making a game. BUT - I think this game is among three that I will always hold to be 'top-level' games I still remember the nights poured into this game, I still remember the moments of tension and relief at achieving the various milestones of game play, killing certain bosses or surviving certain levels. And knowing now that this spawned a sequel which in my mind is still unsurpassed in the Action RPG genre - Diablo 2, that fact alone means that this game has to be recognised as part of the pinnacle of PC gaming. Even now I occasionally like to have a little nostalgia and install Diablo 1 just so I can take a big old dose of happy memories. I can't honestly say that anyone should go out and get this game now, but just want everyone to understand that even before today's vast game budgets, before the dedicated teams of artists and environment designers, before all of the impressiveness of modern gaming there were games like this that shone out because they provided fantastic experiences and enticing game play. Times have moved on, but my memories are better than a hundred new releases.. Great game by Blizzard again, the game when it came out was difficult to master, but it was an enjoyable experience, and had several different ways that you could play, and there was a lot of replay ability.. A masterpiece, even though not perfect, I give it the perfect score as it was the first in its genre, I used to play this game as a kid and it was the scariest feeling. The colors have low contrast, everything is dark, the asmosphere is scary and adventurous. The music composer Matt Uelmen is a genius and so is the rest of the team. This game influenced hundreds of games in the following years in the gaming universe.. No doubt one of games I played the must in my life, incredibly replayable, I could never get bored. This game was so revolutionary that up to this day we say ""Diablo style game"". It's a classic that a player from today world may not enjoy because of it's outdated graphics and a character growth system that is too simple. Even so, at the time, I couldn't believe such master piece. It's one of those addictive games, kill tons of sprites to develop the character until we are strong enough to kill the last boss. And them we are ready to do everything again, because dungeons are aleatory, different characters offer different game-plays and hack n' slash is so fun. Not to mention nice background story, go underground and kill the devil in that gothic environment, I felt medieval. It's a shame games don't use this kind of environment, orcs and elves can get really boring.. This game was completely impressive when it came out, the graphics, the music, the dungeon crawling, the combat system, it defined a genre and it was definetely very very exciting. Maybe if you play it nowadays and you're not an old-school player it feels a bit slow and rusty but it does definetely deserve all the praise it gets.. Great Game, loved it as a kid. For the time it had a great level of detail and diversity for the player. It really was groundbreaking at the time and Blizzard has continued to excel with the Diablo franchise. By 1996, everyone was tired of the dying, cliche, turn-based RPG formula. Diablo saved the genre by bringing it into real-time. Another triumph by Blizzard. Diablo 1 is still very much fun to play, also in multiplayer mode, 20 years after it was released. From today's perspective, it's basically simplified World of Warcraft, because Blizzard honed their concept of character and gear progression from Diablo 1 to Diablo 2 to World of Warcraft. The strongest feature of Diablo 1 is (and was at the time) its randomly generated dungeons.. Wow! What a game! Back then it was like ""Dude, you know Diablo?"" ""As if! It's like the best game EVVVA!"" :) Yeah, those were the times - the times when ""replayability"" actually meant playing the game a gazillion of times, until the CD became razor thin from constant reinstalls, until you could, like, run circles around bosses at character level 1 with your eyes closed, and still enjoy the game! THAT'S REPLAYABILITY. And that was Diablo.. Best in the series, in my opinion. Had that dark, grim 'n grity feel. I lost interest in Diablo series since then. It just went arcade, caroonish. Not my preference.. this is very fun arpg. graphics has aged well and gameplay is ok. It has some problems but it's no't bad like some kids in reviews say. Diablo 1 is fun nostalgic game.. There may be a little nostalghia to my maximum rating, but I also believe this is a perfect casual game. - a simple, smooth and motivating gameplay - different playing styles through items and magic - enormous replay value - involving sound and story If you need to whack some time, this is it. Is it mobile already?. This is the most atmospheric game ever made. Even Diablo 2 pales in comparison with this masterpiece. There is always a sense of dread and some of the monsters can actually become dangerous and feel like a real fight (something Diablo 3 completely lacks). There are some flaws like black deaths permanently screwing you up and wizard being totally overpowered but there are mods to fix that.. I remember when I first played demo of first DIABLO. It was just amazing. Music was just perfect. Its way better than those in all new instalments. Dark, heavy atmosphere - again perfect. Innovative loot system. Even story was quite interresting. in 1996 gameplay was really perfect for me. For couple of years to come this was really one of my favourite titles. When I come back to this game now it seems almost like some indie game, its so slow compared to D3. But it still is one of the most important game in gaming history.. I can still re-install and play this game. That should really say something saying that my only real re-playable games are ff7 and xenogears other then that its truly hard for me to pick up and replay games. In its time it was great and frankly i still like to dupe (dupelicate items) and hax the hell out of it. its just good old fashion fun. Hell if a **** server was going id be on it once in a while.. This is best Diablo in series. This is how it should look like, exploring dungeon and not running on desert, because open area always look the same even if its random. Torchlight1 was also good game because it keep that style and atmosphere, where am just say best clone, not better game. D1 is best in own style.. When first Diablo was released in 1996 it blew everyone's mind with it's beautiful visuals, fantastic music, dark atmosphere and incredibly fun and addictive gameplay. I loved and still love every bit of it. It still plays and holds up well until this day and it's by far the best from the trilogy imo. Just listening to the soundtrack and that music is just pure classic. 10/10. One of the most important games ever made. It is STILL scary if you play now. The butcher doesn't make me wet my pants like he did the first time anymore, but knowing that if you die, you're going to have to get all your stuff back is just nerve-racking. Possibly the most atmospheric RPG ever made. Or if that's going too far, then easily the best music. The only thing that makes it an adjustment to play today is the lack of run/walk. I play this at least once a year and have since it came out.. Greatest game of all time. It's too bad that time has not been kind to Diablo. Original and great addictive gameplay that became the face of the hack and slash rpg genre.. All hail blizzard north the one and only true blizzard.DIABLO(1) is the best game in the world.Respect and best regards to north and Matt Ulman,Brevik and the rest... I can see what you see not— Vision milky, then eyes rot. When you turn, they will be gone, Whispering their hidden song. Then you see what cannot be— Shadows move where light should be. Out of darkness, out of mind, Cast down into the Halls of the Blind.. Diablo is one of the icons of games. It showed the world that the game does not have to be difficult to be good. As in those days was a good graphics and the music even better. Randomly generated underground-that's something!. It is a pity that the disposal were only three character classes (warrior, mage and rogue). The worst thing about this game is that it is a short .... One of the best games I have ever played. Dark, evil, mysterious, adventurous, exciting and so much re-playability. Outstanding. Wish they still made games like this these days.. Diablo started my love for PC Games and i still play it today. if you haven`t played this game before i seriously recommend you do! A good 10 of 10 score in my part!. It's a good game to most. In my opinion I never like the game play. I don't like point to move nor button mashing. Its very suspenseful with a fantastic story line. The music fits well into the game. Voice acting also was a great feature for the game.. When I was a child, I played this game for over a year, over and over again. It is the apitami of good game play, and as such will be forever classified as the classic and original rpg of my life.. My favorite PC game of all time. Truly the most monumental and inspirational action dungeon crawler ever created. It was the game that paved the way for its genre to grow and one of the major reasons why Blizzard became among the greatest game developers of all time.. I really love the people who judge this game a decade or more after it's release and hold it up to ""current"" standards and rank it badly. Yes it's a really old game today (or whenever you're reading this) but in its day it was legendary. That's not nostalgia talking, it's fact. While I do have fond memories of the game myself I do remember exactly what I thought of it at the time. A great unique game that was extremely fun to play, but also a tad repetitive and without too much depth. Diablo 1 did change the scene and really gave birth to the modern Hack-n-Slash genre. Overall: While I dod have great respect for this game I also must look at it objectively and not just with nostalgia. A great game of it's age, but also a bit limited and rough around the edges.. This game is a masterpiece. Best graphics for his time period. Story is superb and the sound is **** game includes a fantastic gameplay. This game changed the video games world- from RPG to action. This game is one of the best games ever, if not the best, this is absolutely the finest work of Blizzard Entertainment.. If you like this dungeon runner style, you will like Diablo. Aside from the lack of deep story, the action is fun. Playing a melee character, I found difficult as it seems you spend more time chasing enemies than actually attacking them. Once you switch to mage, it is a walk in the park. I ended up using one spell through the whole game, which shows how repetitive it can get. One strong element in the game is the limited but fantastic music. There aren't many tracks, but they are very well done. Very similar to the recent Torchlight I game.. When Blizzard made this game, they made a revolution to RPG world. Everything a real RPG gamer wants is in this game. Let's face it, RPG's were never about graphics, but how invested in your character, in your game, in your mission can game make you. And this game was, and still is one of the BEST games I've ever played. Sadly, Diablo franchise started to deteriorate after this game. Neither of the sequel lived up to this game. Diablo had a real story, and it was like a movie, a novel. Diablo 2 was here and there good, but had some flaws, such as no classic save game in singleplayer, but multiplayer solution to it, and Diablo 3 was a massive failure, Everything that was wrong with Diablo 2, they exaggareted it about 1000 times. Diablo 1 had both simplicity of gaming, and complexitiy of storytelling and questing. That's why Diablo, especiallly with Hellfire expansion is the game, that i play till this day.... I should really just sum this review up in two words: ""Diabl","the game isn't perfect, but its atmosphere, music, characters... you close your eyes, play Tristram music, and back to your desk on 1996 . i wish the character could run... but that'd probably sort of ruin the atmosphere . the storyline would have been fab if the game play ."
791.Katamari Damacy REROLL,"Weird, wacky and wonderful; roll up some joy!. It is a happy, funny, enjoyable game with unique idea and controlling method. It chills you up when you want to refresh your mind. It also gives you unbelievable experience that anything can be stacked into the Katamari!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Never got to play Damacy when jt came out but I loved , ""We luv **** if ReRoll is accurate I missed nothing . Firstly why just the first game what a rip off as there is not alot of content in any Katamari game so why not vombine a few if your remastering or porting..Greed off course.. And they could have at least done a good job.This port has input delay, you get stuck on air , clunky controls and no improvements. I replayed ""We luv Katamari"" on my PS2 after being disappointed by ReRoll and its still amazing and as good as ever. ReRoll is either a bad port or the origional **** much like Katamri Forever a Buetiful **** input delay alone is enough to kill the experience and while not surprising its still dissapoint not a single paid / professional reviewer nothing this...Goes to show how fake and useless games Journalist's are. We luv Katamari on the PS2 is really the only game to play.. Even 18 years since its initial release, Katamari Damacy has few rivals which match its zany originality. Building up your katamari is infinitely addictive, and exploring levels for new objects to grab or for better pathways to exploit incentivize repeated playthroughs. It still looks and sounds fantastic. The control scheme takes some getting used to, but otherwise, Katamari is a classic everyone should try.. Just a very fun gameplay loop. Very easy but the real challenge comes from pushing yourself to create the perfect route and make a perfect Katamari. One of the most satisfying endings I've played through and has a great soundtrack. My biggest issue was with the ""collect one of"" missions just because I'd roll this massive Katamari and then get blasted by something off-screen and roll into a tiny object with no option to retry immediately. Just gave up on those levels entirely tbh.. I have 3+ hours in this game, and I've quit in frustration four times, successfully played three levels, and enjoyed maybe 15 minutes of the game. I don't mind the weird plot, or the weird concepts — it's actually what I came to this game for. However. The controls make this game horrible. Even the ""simple"" controls (which *are* relatively simple) don't play very well. They're awkward at best, and manipulating the camera either takes a significant portion of your level's time limit, or you have to give up and be unable see most of the level. It's such a fun concept, and I went in *knowing* I'd love it... and then it was awful. I don't know how to describe how the controls feel. It feels more like you're on top of the ball, trying to move it around, instead of push it around. I understand why it feels that way, and while it isn't a great experience, frankly I wouldn't mind it if the camera was easily moveable. Think Mario Kart except the angle doesn't change even when you turn unless you come to a full stop, then slowly (slooowly) turn the character so you can see. Then you can move again! ...until you have to turn again. Which is often, btw, if you ever want to see. I'm absolutely devastated, because I'd been waiting *years* to finally play it. And now.... well. I'm uninstalling it. It's absolutely unplayable for me, and frankly I don't know how so many people gave it good reviews. I hope your experience is better than mine, if you get it, but if you like camera control, this is NOT the game for you.. in my experience the game had a lag that made it borderline unplayable, the ps3 running a ps2 emulator ( the ps2 classics ) ran the game much better than this port. I was like a toddler bumping into everything, because the response time was nearly 2 seconds. the cutscenes look really bad too, idk what they did to upscale the original or if they redid them, but they look bad. also, where is the english voice acting? it was a lot of fun. the timing is off too, instead of lingering on to be continued at the end, the tbc text just kind of blinks. it's easy to miss it. something that boggles me is, why did they port the first one and not we katamari? the sequel was so much better in every possible aspect, i love katamari but the first game is kind of boring. it pains me that this game will likely not sell enough for them to bother porting the sequel. PS: the lion in the king's belt buckle melted apparently, it looks so freaking bad... it is awesome, the music is sublime, i really think it is a must play game, it brings a lot of nostalgic feeling UwU. This game is uhhh....cool but sort of weird. I really like the concept of it though.. I love having this game on a handheld system. Never played it before? I can sum it up in one word: bizarre!. This game is pure genius. I played the original one on PS2, and this game still stands out both from its era and from current trend of generic open-world games. And my 8bitdo controller with symmetrical analog sticks fit the gameplay better than joy-cons. Pros: + Animated story is crazy and blocky humans fit the overall aesthetic of the game. + The assortment of objects is both funny and recognizable (from the real world). + Rolling your katamari is pure pleasure no matter the size. + The tension grows as levels progress. Often you finish mere seconds within the time limit. + Both the Moon level and End credits are the perfect high note to end the game. Cons: - The removed Father's voice over. - Some zodiac sign levels could be annoying.. I love this series. I wish they would have done something to update it but, aside from that, it's a perfect port.. I cannot give the game anything other than a 0 at this time. The controls haven't changed after all this time. Turning your character is absolutely annoying and breaks the fun of the game. It's not hard to just have the controls make sense. I couldn't play past the first level, it was not enjoyable.. It's quirky & fun but be warned - there's difficulty spikes. I thought this would be a relaxing game. It can be frustrating. Also, the in-game graphics look fine, but the menus and loading screens feel a little old. All in all I think it's a positive experience.. It's katamari, so yes, its funny and beautiful and absolutely bananas, although i really thought i would love playing it on switch but, i was wrong: the right analog stick being lower than the right one made it really akward for me, maybe because my hands are too big? I dont know. But still its an awsome game, it's fun as hell, and i still highly recomend it. Karamari Damacy is a fun, totally unique and incredibly charming game, who's design and character stood the test of time, and Reroll brings it back without changing much, but realizing the original team's vision. No loading in levels, smooth as hell assets in combination with Katamari Damacy's brilliance create an almost perfect game. But, unfrotunetaly, Reroll doesn't adress the lenght of the game, which it's lacking in greatly, leaving you wanting so much more after the credits roll and you've beaten every level dozens of times. Can't wait for We Love Katamari to get the same treatment. a game With amazing style and music , Can you play is one of the most unique experience I have had on the switch, Just nice to play a game when you don't have to fight a kill Or Destroy anything just rolling over everything, And it is really fun and addictive the way that you spin the ball around and just keep growing and growing a proving prime enjoyment in seeing it getting bigger. Super trippy all around fun game. Controls are whacky but it makes it a challenge. Wish it was longer.. Fun game. When I seen it was for switch, I immediately purchased it. I used to play it on PS2.. Really fun and weird, but kind of short and inconsistent at times. Really enjoyed it for the few hours it took me to complete though.. Katamari Damacy Reroll is a widget game from Japan. Weird games like this appear periodically, but Katamari Damacy is perhaps one of the strangest. The game has an almost psychedelic nature to it, with the plot of the game – such as it were – being that the King of All Cosmos went on a bender and accidentally blew up all the stars and the moon, and you, his son the prince, must now help him make new stars by wandering around the earth and rolling stuff up to make into new stars. The actual core gameplay of the game is quite simple – you roll around a ball, and as you run over stuff that is smaller than the ball, it adheres to the ball. The more stuff you roll over, the bigger the ball gets, allowing you to roll over more, larger stuff. Thus, the actual gameplay of the game is to wander around the world trying to find stuff that’s small enough to roll up into your ball while avoiding colliding with big things, which will knock chunks off your ball that you will have to pick back up if you want to keep your size up. The game is one about scale, and as you go through the game, the scale becomes ever larger and more ridiculous. You start out on the same scale as tacks and pins in the first level, and in each level, you are expected to make an ever-larger ball. Sometimes you start out larger, sometimes you start out smaller, but as you progress through the game, the scale keeps going up and up. At first, you start out in a house. Then you go around a town. Then “the world”. Indeed, in the final level, you go from the level of rolling up small plants to rolling up entire islands and mountains. Unfortunately, there are only really three major level layouts, though they are populated slightly differently with objects in each level. While this allows you to familiarize yourself with them a bit, it also means that they get a bit played out by the end of the game. There are also some side levels where you “make a constellation”, which really just consists of mostly the same challenge, except you mostly are just trying to roll up as much of a particular type of object as possible in a level which is often full of them. Some of them switch things up by instead making it end the moment you roll up ONE such object, with your goal being to make a big enough ball to grab the biggest possible object. Overall, the game is weird, but not tremendously challenging; it took me only about 7 or so hours to get through the whole game and get all but the 100% completion achievement. And unfortunately, the game’s single, simple note wasn’t really enough. While it was fun when you finally reached a new level of scale and started picking up larger objects, a lot of the levels were played out on the same few scales, so it got a bit dull and tedious. If the game had been any longer, it would have been worse, but as it is not hugely so, it managed to end before it totally wore out its welcome. Still, this isn’t really a game I’d recommend. It’s a weird game, but it didn’t really feel particularly fun to me. It was mostly interesting for its weirdness, but honestly, that wasn’t enough to carry it even as short as the game was.. Is this a perfect game? No. But I sure as hell can pretend it is. Katamari is one of the most style-heavy games out there, yet the style to substance ratio is still probably around 6-4, which is really impressive. The whole colorful, unorthodox look of this game is so pleasing to the eyes, and the remade graphics make everything look more smooth and nice. While the game is incredibly janky, I can't imagine the game without it, since it adds to the surreal charm of everything. Anyone who does not idolize the King of All Cosmos will not be invited to my birthday party.. Despite the simplicity of Katamari Damacy, I struggle to define it with any sort of genre label because of how unique the entire experience ends up being. Whether it be the vibrant art design, the hilarious writing, the addicting gameplay, the eclectic soundtrack or the unique control scheme, Katamari Damacy finds ways to impress in almost every single regard. You play as the son of The King of All Cosmos, A.K.A God. He accidentally destroys most of the universes stars, and also the moon. And now it’s up to you to take responsibility for the impacts of your irresponsible father’s action and make some replacement stars on Earth. How do you make the replacement stars? Well by rolling up random junk of course. The game has you push around a large ball (Katamari) and roll up objects and creatures that are smaller than the Katamari in an attempt to make it as big as possible before the time runs out – there are other level objectives in the game too which make for some nice variety. Despite having a timer, Katamari Damacy rarely feels tense, but always feels exciting. Levels are absolutely jammed tight with various items and creatures for you to roll up, and it is such a joy to see all of these different creations in play. Creatures have different behaviors, each model is just as detailed as the last, they all have their own sound effects and all of them are placed in clever spots and situations throughout the whole game. Objects and creatures must be smaller than the Katamari for you to roll up, this means that certain routes and areas in levels will either open or close to you as you play. For example; you might make your Katamari too big and will be unable to find hidden items under a car, or your Katamari might be too small and will mean you’re unable to get up some stairs. This means levels and the way you navigate them are constantly changing as you play, and it never gets old. This core mechanic of tracking down the next right sized thing to roll up, plus trying to get as big as possible in the time limit paired with the fact you also need to be observant of your surroundings makes for a really clever and fun little game. As well as obviously trying to make your Katamari big, you also amass a collection of different items throughout the game which can be viewed from your home planet in between levels. This is a fun little addition which makes for some good replay value, as well as making your time rolling up random junk a little bit more meaningful. There are plenty of hidden items and other hidden bonuses that make for some great optional content and expand the games length significantly. The most contentious aspect of Katamari Damacy would have to be its controls. Both analogue sticks are used to control the direction you push the Katamari in while the camera follows whatever direction you’re facing in. In a way, it actually simulates the action pushing a large object. Holding up and holding down on different sticks at the same time will make you turn around in place, pulling in the opposite direction you’re moving in will cause you to suddenly come to a halt, quickly pushing each stick up and down in succession will cause you to boost and so on. The controls take some getting used to, but once you master them you’ll be glad that you don’t have to control your movement with one stick and the camera with another like most games. And in all honesty I don’t know if I would even enjoy the game as much without the controls, because of the control scheme you’re so much more invested in the movement of your character, and it makes something as simple as moving forwards feel more enjoyable than it would be otherwise. The only nitpicks I have with the game are sometimes the camera can get a little congested in tight spaces, and sometimes your character will get stuck in between things which can be extremely frustrating. But all in all, the good far outweighs the bad, and Katamari Damacy ends up being one of the most enjoyable games out there. It’s simple and joyful gameplay is addicting and doesn’t get old in the short time you have with it. The writing and the music is always surprising you in new ways and making for some fantastic and unforgettable moments. The narrative is virtually non-existent, but it doesn’t need to do anything. The game is silly, and it knows it. It’s an absolute blast to play, and I couldn’t recommend it more.. This plays very poorly with the Pro Controller. Was much easier to control on the PS2. Pretty bummed.. just some weird trash japan dont know what it is, endless and pointless, unfortunatly. Such a unique experience. It's just crazy, silly, colourful, japanese fun at its best. The controls did take a lot of getting used to for me, but once you get it down, you don't really have to think about it anymore. It is quite short, but it does have a lot of replay value because the mechanic of picking up stuff with your Katamari is just so much fun. For me, this is the perfect game to throw on if I just want to calm my brain down, maybe listen to a podcast on the side.. I really, really wanted this to like this game. The concept is great, the music is quite fun... but this game has one of the all-time worst control schemes, even worse than many other early 3D games of this era. The game is virtually unplayable, particularly in the final levels. I appreciate difficult games, but not games that are difficult due to poor controls and an unwieldy camera. Save your money for some of the other much better remasters on Switch.. I always wanted to play Katamari Damacy, but never had the chance until this Switch release. It's wonderful, of course. It's like a purified little droplet of video gaming. The core gameplay mechanic of rolling up stuff into an ever-growing ball is unique, ingenious, and pure satisfaction. What surprised me is that the controls are also weird, and initially difficult; I admit I was a bit annoyed at what seemed like intentional over-complication. Don't be put off, however. After persevering for a short while, the controls feel natural, and moreover, you realise that they are in fact perfectly designed, forming a large part of the fun and depth of the game. They give the katamari a palpable weight, and allow you to manoeuvre it around, which is useful for preventing the katamari becoming an unwieldy shape. The katamari can sometimes get stuck somewhere bad and start breaking apart, which is frustrating, but this is rare and never broke the game. The game basically has a single-minded focus on this core mechanic, meaning its short play time of around 5 hours is the correct length. I do wish there could have been some more variation in the gameplay, or more complex levels, for a longer and more fleshed-out game. Then of course there are the weird and wonderful aesthetics. The main character designs are brilliant, the dialogue is bizarre and genuinely funny (although a little repetitive), the art style is lovely, the sound design is great and the music is absolutely incredible. Overall, for both its aesthetic sensibilities and its ingenious, polished and joyous gameplay, I can definitely see why Katamari Damacy is so often held up as an example of video games as art. Strongly recommended.. I'm going to keep this one brief, this is probably one of my favorite games of all time and if you haven't played it yet, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. Every single thing in this game is oozing with soul, even as a remake for crying out loud, this is one of those games where I just feel like you can't mess it up, it's fun, it's enticing, it's unique, it's charming, it's got an amazing soundtrack. Play this game if you haven't, you haven't lived until you played it.. The person who left the bad review literally does not know what theyre talking about. if you are familiar with this series you know what to expect, and this game DELIVERS. This is a remake of Katamari Damacy, and while i cant really tell if they changed anything, it still feels fresh, the levels dont feel exactly the same as the first, while i do remember some of them. This game is easy to pick up and exciting, but also hard to master. Visually, its beautiful as always, i think the graphics are actually a little too good (coming from the ps2 games lol) , but im glad they kept it more or less the same. The music, as in the last games, still 10/10 one of the best and most high production music soundtracks featuring tunes played by renowned musicians and jazz bands from japan. If you're a Katamari fan this is a must have. If you've never played the game this is a great introduction. The Katamari series is one of a kind. its artistic, funky, japanese vibe, colorful, psychedelic, funny and cute. Even if you're not a fan of this series i think you will feel like a kid the first time you pick up this game, it's a silly experience and oddly gratifying.. Mmmmmmmmmmm vary goob vary fun. Only leik 6 hours but still very fun. Wish there were different characters. Mmmmmmm still nonetheless vary entartaning. This is great! Katamari is a fantastic franchise with a simple but insanely fun concept. I've played several Katamari games in the past and this game works great on the switch. Full of charm, humor, and creativity with lots of fun little surprises. All the levels are fun to play over and over again, and it's fun to try to find the hidden gifts! There were a few disappointments for me, however. There were some features included in Katamari Forever for PS3 that I wish were implemented here. I miss being able to choose a different cousin to play as as well as finding them within the levels. I also wish that the pause menu in single player gave you the option to restart the level rather than just the two options of going back to the home planet or continuing. Not being able to jump took a bit of getting used to, but being a damacy remake I understood why that is. If you've played previous katamari games, the asymmetrical control sticks can be tricky to get a hang of at first but if you keep at it it becomes second nature. Definitely one of my favorite games for the switch!. Incredibly creative game, excellent soundtrack, if you like new mechanics and fresh ideas (ironically, the game is a remake, remaster) then check it out, is a blast to play and the port is really good.. A delightful reprieve from the monotony of switch games hopping on the metroidvania-train. Katamari Damacy is 14 years old, and is still a unique and entertaining experience. This is the perfect opportunity for new players and veterans to enjoy Keita Takahashi's wacky world on the go or at home on their TV.. This game is boring and a total waste of money. Was looking for a new switch game and was disappointed.. Guess the game that got me to stop playing Super Smash Bros for Switch? You guessed it! I'm addicted to this highly original game, that has one of the greatest soundtracks ever! Use the regular controls NOT the simple controls. The controls for this game do have a learning curve though once you get how it works, you truly do feel like you are controlling this giant ball!. It’s the same katamari as before. There doesnt appear to be a change to frame rate but the images are a little more clear. I love this game. It was a 10/10 before but the lack of any real framerate remastering makes me feel it’s 9/10. The music is so good though. Maybe they updated the bitrate on the tracks because they are the best chillwave tracks on any game. It's bright. It's happy. It's fun. It's Katamari. This is an all time favorite, and the port onto the Switch is in HD and has never looked better. The colors are bright; rolling is as smooth as ever, and the quirkiness of the game will have you rolling your worries away far into the night. Very few games are a must have, but this one ranks above just about all of them. It's perfect for kids and adults alike. Nothing beats the King of All Cosmos waking up the day after a huge bender making his son fix yesterday's machinations to one of the best soundtracks in gaming history. Na... na na na na na na na na na na na na na... Enjoy.. Excellent game. I played all of the previous in the franchise including the terrible PSP version. This is perfect for the Switch. The artistic graphic style holds up really well in HD. Got while at the Gamestop Smash launch. I think I was the only dude in line picking this up too lol. Im not going to reduce my score because the asymmetrical analog sticks take a little away vs a Dualshock. This is a must have game for anyone on the switch if you like quirky Japanese games and want something different. Have not tried to 2 player mode yet, really looking forward to it.","""we luv Katamari"" is a happy, funny, enjoyable game with unique idea and controlling method . port has input delay, you get stuck on air , clunky controls and no improvements . ""we luv Katamari"" on the PS2 is really the only game to play ."
792.DiRT 2,"My god, dirt is an incredible game but playing it on a controller is horrible! I was the master at playing dirt on PC but here on PS3 I don't do anything. It is in my top 5 racing simulators. The best Colin McRae game in my opinion.. WHAT A GAME ITS ONE OF MY FAV! THIS REPRESENT MY CHILHOOD, FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME, and for me DiRT 2 are more better than DiRT 3.. This game for my oponion is completely awesome this is like the second best game in the colin mcrae rally series first one being colin mcrae rally 2005 is really awesome. Dirt 2 is a great game. The gameplay and race variety are great once **** addition of a limited use flashback feature which would be used in the 3rd game really lessens the frustrations of the **** game is on the short side however,clocking in at around 8 hours. The graphics are great,with a smooth framerate. Sound design is great with a decent **** in-menu announcer is back,but he isn't as annoying. Overall,Dirt 2 is a great rally racer that is definitely worth playing.. Codemasters really seemed to show their racing pedigree this generation and that's saying something as they have been at the heart of the genre for years with a games list as long as Pinocchio's nose when he's asked if he's been sniffing his mother's knickers. I really love how Codemasters have mastered the art of balls to the walls rallying with excitement, near misses and lots of speed through beautifully designed countryside terrain, the gameplay is just phenomenal and is really fun to try and master a course. You know when a driving game is good when you don't get bored of replaying the same level over and over and Dirt 2 is one of those games. The game fails on top marks by steering away from rallying and generally being Americanised, I would have loved to play the old PS1/2 Colin McRae games with this game engine and graphics, the other problem is on disc DLC, which is a big no no but I will take that out on Dirt 3. Overall a must own for the 360.. I first played it on PC (steam version) for more than 20 hours, and recently I got this Xbox 360 version. It is amazing that it is still a very good looking game on Xbox 360 console, very comparable to the graphics of PC version (mid to low setting of course, not comparable to high settings). The control is also very comfortble, and I think it is set differently from PC version. Because PC version also requires Game for Windows Live account to play, I actually use the same account for both PC and Xbox 360 version.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Picked this up at a 2 for 40 sale and loved every minute of it, while it's presence has changed since the first game, it still shows class and presteige and pays tribute Colin McRae themselves. The cars handle suburb and the soundtrack is excellent. The voice acting gets a little grating at the start of the game but you'll quickly soon to love Ken Block and Travis Pastrana talking to you. Though Dirt 3 is out at the moment, this is still an excellent rally game and an Incredible racing game.. Great multiplayer. Really well designed. Balanced. No customisation or upgrading, and the tuning is very pointless since it doesn't make a huge difference to how the car feels to drive. You do get **** view, but it's actually more fun in third person. This game isn't like Motorstorm where there's no track, no skill in driving and fake vehicles. It's real cars, real places, real rally drivers and lots of events in single player. Unlike Forza, the events don't feel like a chore to run through because there's not a huge amount. Nor are there long events. It's of the right length and endless more fun online. Must try if you like racing games.. I don't particularly enjoy this game as much as I should. It is absolutely nothing nothing at all like it's predecessor. Dirt 2 completely ignored the fact that the rally racing is what Dirt the game it was. Dirt 2 has very few rally racing maps, you hardly even touch them in the any part in the game. Some of the newer game modes such as Gate Crasher are complete rubbish. The music in Dirt 2 is god awful, enough said. The majority of the racing events tend to be in SUV's and those silly Buggies, you have no freedom in picking any different kind of car you prefer. The Americanized maps and x-games themed single player is dull and wasteful, rally racing originated in Europe, not in Baja California or Japan! Despite the sad flaws there are some enjoyments you can find in Dirt 2. They have a decent selection of cars for each type of event, you can change the color to any kind of preset color you can earn throughout the game, and no, you cannot choose your own. The menu's interface is beyond awesome, really neat. The multiplayer is good, not great, everything is randomized, even your car.. If you enjoyed Dirt for what Dirt was don't buy Dirt 2.. I usually don't like car video games but when I first saw Dirt 2 I immediately said "" I have to buy it NOW "" and I bought it ! No regret I spent 30 dollars but I can say that it's the best car video game now - I love it and all is wonderful about it I mean graphics sound details and game play ... so run to buy it NOW !!!","""dirt 2"" is a great rally racer that is definitely worth playing . the game fails on top marks by steering away from rallying and generally being americanised . i really love how Codemasters have mastered the art of balls to the walls rallying ."
793.Rayman Origins,"Great gameplay, soundtrack, & atmosphere. It was a challenge while not having to be mandatory. Incredible.. great game, i love rayman, i recommend this game to all people who love rayman. nice. Brilliant return of a series that wasn't in his best days before this dropped, a really complete experience that i would consider to be the best of his franchise.. An underdog classic. This is one of the best platformer of its age and on the console, definitely. An amazing soundtrack and funny levels for both kids and grown men. The best thing to come out of France, and an affordable price for this colorful game that honors the rayman saga. I can't give it a 10 in 2024 just because of Rayman Legends. Played on Xbox Series X in late 2023. 87/100. Rayman Origins was my favourite 2D game ever I had absolute no problems with the game and had a blast playing the game. Rayman Origins was the platformer gamers needed, but not one that they deserved. I think that fits Rayman Origins situation quite nicely because honestly this game kinda came out of nowhere. Considering the rein of First Person Shooters had after the platforming genre left off it seems almost too surreal to really get a big retail release of a platformer game, especially one that doesn’t feature Mario or Sonic. It’s not really because everyone didn’t like them, but they just didn’t seem to sell well with today’s crowd, and it seemed like all other developers seem to quit making big bucks around them. In comes Rayman Origins, an amazingly gorgeous looking game that has a bunch of pretty backgrounds, fluid animation, and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Everything in this game was just top notch and to see it drop down in price and widely ignored by the majority of the public is a sad thing to see. While I personally didn’t really come into the light till Rayman Legends it was too late and the damage was already done. Thankfully Origins is still celebrated today and hopefully Ubisoft or some other game company will keep making solid platformers like this, but for now Origins is a gem from the last **** game works on such a basic level that it can feel right at home with anyone holding the controller. The hovering and attacking is simple to do, and the run button’s placement makes it perfect for gripping the controller. Jumping and running up walls is also very responsive leaving very little lag time, and hardly ever feels like its the game’s fault that you didn’t jump properly. Level design is at its finest due to the large amount of variety of going through each level. The majority of the time though it’s running up walls and platforming throughout the level, but a lot of levels change it up by either chasing something or having a wall of death chase you. A lot of these levels are fast paced, and are a nice break from the regular platforming and wall jumping because a lot of the actions are often fluid or go hand in hand with the music. Making a lot of jumps or runs easier to handle at such a fast pace because of how in-sync the music is with this game. A few other levels also include a shmup based element by having you ride a big mosquito that shoots things at upcoming enemies. Needlessness to say that a lot of Origins is very original in its delivery and always knows how to keep the pace going from being boring.Everything about Origins just feels so right at home and really makes the platforming genre work in this day and age. While the game is still quite challenging, even more so at the very end, the game levels the playing field by simply taking out the life system completely. Origins takes care of this by simply having the checkpoint system work as a save point in the level and lets you die enough times till you get everything right, or at least close enough. See by taking out the life system it’s able to impose a lot of tricky jumps and bosses by simply making it where you start out exactly where you were troubled at, and it lets you do it over and over again till you get it right. Course this doesn’t outright take out the challenge of platforming because you still have to do all the platforming yourself, but also because the ranking system Origins gives you at the end of each level. With each level there are a certain amount of lums to get and when you get a certain amount you will unlock medallion that shows your rank. Course getting all these lums isn’t that easy, even with no lifes attached to it. For the majority of the game, you pretty much have to play perfectly in order to obtain the highest rank as each lum can make you or break you on counting time. Even more so the king lums are able to double the amount of lums you get by turning them all red, but it only lasts a short amount of time so you have to make them count.. just a masterpiece !!! We need more rayman games in 2023 ... Please Ubisoft ... Imperfect but the best 2-D platformer I've played. Stunning levels, challenging tasks, and beautiful animations make it a standout.. The best single- and multiplayer jump n run game for the PS3. The series got better with every release. Overall rating: 9.0.. My first game I've played ever! I can't put 10 out of 10 because some games are still above.. This is a must play for every platformer fan. Movement is fluent, you learn the game gradually, half of the ost has been stuck in my head since I'm playing this game and above all it looks amazing as well. For almost the entire ride, the difficulty rises gradually. The bosses can be frustrating, but once you ""figure"" them out they're manageable. If you want some extra challenge, you could go for a 100% and earn yourself a new world.... this is where the game falls a bit short. The last mandatory world has a sudden difficulty spike that turns this fun platformer in a living hell. It's riddled with bottomless pits, unkillable foes and annoying stage hazards. The worst stage of all of them, I didn't know what was coming. That last runner stage, it made me angry. I wanted to finish it, because it was a three part level. What it 100% redeems it though, is that this game doesn't only manage to be a fun platformer, it's also a surprisingly good shoot em up. There is literally no reason that this part is as good as it is.. Do you like… Beating up grannies, Slapping your friends repeatedly, Thicc fairies? If you are all of the above, play this game now. It’s like 15$ on the Xbox store, and it goes on sale all the time. One of my favorite platformers as a kid.. Rayman's return to the 2nd dimension was a truly glorious one. It looks so beautiful, I truly commend ubiart for that. The controls are amazing and level design is peak. The characters are so expressive and there is so many of them. It has a nice difficulty spike too and I loved the since of achievement you got from completion. You can see your improved skills as the game progresses and its satisfying. The multiplayer is nothing short of pure fun and entertainment. I truly implore any platformer fan to pick up this game. I trust you will have nothing short of a thrilling experience. But were the design of the nymphs completely necessary lol. Not complaining but, you know.. After about half of the game, it gets boring. Bosses are terrible! Gameplay from the past - jump faster, run faster, swim faster. Maybe I expect a lot from a platformer, but still.. Top arcade game for cooperation mode. Kindly, dynamically and beautiful world.. Fun, colorful and great in all the ways that Rayman is. Easy controls with some humor.. My favourite 2D platformer and extreme difficult game in the last part. , Israel the game is very difficult at some point never becomes frustrating because you with wives so fast that you don't get annoyed not liking Mario where you have to look at the game over Game over screen and say oh no. , It also looks amazing and has an amazing art style , And I completed the game fully by getting teeth to get this secret final boss. , The only thing that is about this game is that I cannot play for too long because it's too texting so I always has to take a break every 2-hours because it's just a kind of Us sensory overload. The perfect platformer with a beautiful 2D graphic, music and creative levels. 9 out of 10.. The presentation in this game is fantastic. The music has a creative style and helps build atmosphere, and the artwork is some of the most creative I've seen in a video game, at some points directly affecting the level design. And about the level design - it's carefully made so that each level feels different from another, they don't just blend together. The controls are very good, for lack of a better word. The way Rayman's moves are designed combined with the level design makes it fun and extremely satisfying to speedrun through all the levels, and you never feel like you need to blame the controls. The thing that might turn some people away from this game is the difficulty, which some players may not be used to (if you're new to Rayman you will find yourself retrying certain levels a LOT) but the difficulty isn't a problem to people experienced with platformers. If you are a fan of free-flowing 2D platformers I seriously recommend this game to you.. The best platformer the previous generation along with Super Mario Galaxy games... simply amazing. And Legends is even better. A must buy if you own a 360 and want a good platform game for the kids ( of course you will find yourself playing it more). It's a fun game, but made somewhat cumbersome by the amount of collectibles that are needed in order to truly beat the game. Sometimes, the necessity to collect breaks the flow of what are genuinely well-designed levels. That and there are literally three different sets of collectibles and each requires the previous set. But the well thought out level design, crisp graphics, and amusing humor makes up for it quite well.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is just another complete rip-off of angry birds. The game itself is exactly the same except the graphics quality is much lower and the gameplay is significantly less user friendly.. Surprisingly brilliant. I loved Rayman on the Game Cube but I never dreamt of a Rayman game this good. The game is brilliant at being itself, a laid back, comedic and enjoyable experience.. after playing rayman legends and beating the game I decided to explore the rayman world a little more and picked up rayman origins. I really love legends because it is so smooth to play. there was no lag between controller and screenand extremely challenging in some areas. although origins is also challenging the control scheme does not match what happens on screen and a lot of times you feel like you failed at no fault of your own. you have to unlock abilities in early levels instead of having them like you should in the beginning and that felt poor and pointless to have levels without all your skills available. keep this out of your childs hands also as it will be far to challenging for them.. Absolutely fantastic platformer. One reboot worth returning to its roots, Rayman Origins is a sight for sore eyes. It looks delicious and the audio is incredible, especially the songs. This is a laugh out experience (when you are not furious about a level). One of the most difficult games I' ve played in years, it requires all of your expertise as games do such as Donkey Kong Country or Super Meat Boy. It's more forgiving than the latter but it has tons of more stuff to see. 50 or so nerve wrecking levels, tons of gameplay variety and some incredible bosses. had it not been for the stupid ""push A AGAIN"" scheme for the helicopter move, this would be much closer to tighter controls ergo better game overall. If you miss platformers, this is without a doubt the one you should check out.. This game is awesome! Exactly what i expect from a platformer! I had a lot of fun wit this game and i might go out and pick up legends to see if it lives up to this.. Best platformer of this generation. It's flawless. Beautiful art style. Wonderful gameplay. Diverse level design. Awesome bosses. No story but who cares when you're having this much fun? I can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a game, there was barely any frustration and even if there was I had a smile on my face because of the animations and the charm! Co-op is a blessing!. The first thing most gamers will notice upon starting Rayman Origins is the fantastic cartoon like graphics, fortunately it also the gameplay to back it up. As with most Rayman games Origins is side scrolling 2D platformer. Don’t let that put off however as aside from arguably a few games in the Super Mario series it is full of more ideas than virtually any other game of its kind. The basic idea of each level is to gather enough ‘electoons’ to unlock subsequent levels and challenges. Electoons are awarded simply for completing each level but more can be gained by finding secret areas, collecting the required amount of ‘Lums’ or racing to the end in under a set time. Each of these different goals allows the majority of the already well designed levels to be played in a variety of ways. On top of this added bonus levels can be unlocked that task the player with chasing a treasure chest non-stop through ever shifting terrain, mess up once and its back to the start. Played in single player the game is certainly enjoyable but it really comes alive when played with a friend (up to four can play at once but any more than two on screen at one time can become a little too crowded). Working together to negotiate the games trickiest moments must rank amongst the very best offline multiplayer experiences on the current generation of consoles. Aside from a few trial and error moments it is hard to really find any fault with Rayman Origins and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a title that puts the fun back into playing video games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the funniest games I played with my friends in my place. The game supports four players and I just have other three friends to play this game with. I cannot express how much laugh we had for this game, we punched each other all time in the game and had done some epic team jumping/lifting. The visual and sound of this game is more than I expected. I know some people out there think this game is made for Children, hell no, I found this game quite challenging and I cannot beat some of the levels in time to get trophies. The game is super fun if you can play it with friends.. The funniest game I've played this year. Addictive, fun to play, specially co-op, highly rewarding and a visual masterpiece. And with many hours of play, it's full of content.. Platforming has been redefined with Rayman Orgins. A story line isn't needed with a game like this. It is simply a work of art with great controls, a lengthy campaign and up to 4 player co-op offline. The game runs at silky smooth 60 Frames per second with not a single sign of screen tear or freezing issues. The animation is superb with intense game-play moments which always make a memorable experience for all of us.. A cute platformer but gets boring fast.. Kept me busy for ages. gives mario a run for its money. Absolutely gorgeous. No online multiplayer is a missed oppertunity but great local multiplayer. Buy it!!. Ubisoft has created a 2D platformer that deserves to be mentioned along with Mario titles. A mix of precise fast paced action and slower sequences which, although they may not seem exciting, allows for exploration, something that you rarely find in 2D platforming. The artstyle is astonishing as well. The only ting that really hurts this game is its repetitiveness. You essentially traverse through the worlds twice and despite the fact that they are different levels, makes me feel as if I'm playing the first half of the game over again. All in all, however, Rayman Origins is an exciting experience. 9/10. I am not really sure what to think of this game. I was so delighted when I first played it but after a few levels I got bored of the beautiful levels and the different art style. It felt overly simple and was only complicated through adding situations that required precise timing. It no longer was about how good I was at multitasking, it was about how good I was at controlling one or so aspects with exact timing. Perhaps I can chalk this one up to hand coordination practice as even after I came back to it I felt the same way. The only time I truly had a good time playing was in co-op mode. Rayman's story is innocent and in a time where every game seems to have a ridiculous plot it felt out of place but welcomed. Its happy characters, upbeat music, and its overall cheerfully goofy nature was unlike any game I can remember playing. It was stupid for the sake of being stupid and now walking away from it I am extremely pleased with my experience with it. Certain aspects frustrated me (granted it was usually my failures), but those are what will ultimately drive me to never play this game again by myself. My annoyance with Rayman: Origins was reduced as it is the first game I have been able to get my girlfriend to play with me. A good experience but seemingly forgettable.. I'm going to be very straight-forward. My Game of the Year for 2011 was not Skyrim, neither Zelda, nor Uncharted. It was Rayman Origins. Rayman Origins is a masterpiece **** - it's graphics are beautiful, it's soundtrack is amazing, it's gameplay is breathtaking and it's impossible not to have fun with. While playing the 15-17 hour long story mode, you will find yourself laughing more often than you'd think. Playing this with friends is a total blast, and the game is fair, creative and free of glitches. It doesn't need any violence to be successful, and it can be very challenging towards the end and even more if you're looking for all of the achievements, speed trophies or medals. The only fault I see is not having online multiplayer. Rayman Origins is as good as Super Mario World or Sonic the Hedgehog 2 when it comes to a masterpiece platformer. Everyone, even if not a gamer, should give it a shot.. This game is just pure fun. If you are a fan of 2d platformers, love beautiful artwork, quirky humor, and having a good time then this is the game for you. I played the whole game on coop and it was a blast. Me and my sister were slapping each other silly. Lots of love and care went into creating this game and it showed. The art, gameplay, music, story etc all mesh so perfectly well together. . The difficulty scaled just right. It starts off easy but progressively gets harder and harder but I never felt overwhelmed. The controls really helped, when I died I never blamed the game for my death. Rayman and crew responded flawlessly to your command. This game was meant to be played cooperatively. Having a friend to bail you out when you make stupid mistakes and laugh together is a huge plus. One thing I am disappointed in is that there is no online coop. Granted, this game was meant to be played on the couch with a friend but that doesn't mean they should have omit it altogether. It is like Scott Pilgrim the game, a huge oversight. The achievement system is another complaint. Why can only the main player earn achievement and not your coop partners? There is potential for abuse but come on! It's all good though, I ended up replaying the game a second time with my sister so she can earn achievements. That's how kickass and fun this game is.. I remember back to the days of the Playstation one where I would play rayman 1 over and over in hopes of finally finishing it. Genuinely difficult to me at a young age. Rayman then fell out of my life and I never felt the urge to return with all the 'Ravin Rabbits' banter. Suddenly, I see this game appear in the demo section of xbox live and feel its worth a go. Fell in love. Bought the game and never looked back. Beautiful graphics, a 'Loco Roco' style soundtrack and fun, smooth gameplay made this game absolutely fantastic for me. Though there is a few levels I found boring and lacking fun elements, the game delivered 95% of an enjoying game. I was truly happy to see this game had co-op, local co-op that is. Something I felt games of the modern age lack. Not all my friends have xboxs, and having them here to play together is a regular occurance and this game is perfect for such situations. I've recommended this game to absolutely every gamer I know and gets a solid 9/10 from me.. I really did not enjoy Rayman Origins singleplayer that much, but the multiplayer is very enjoyable and very fun. Playing this game on your own was **** and really lowed the score for this game. The multiplayer is very fun and I would play this game with friend or 2 but singleplayer is just terrible. Singleplayer 4/10 Multiplayer 8/10 Rayman Origins 6.3/10. A wonderfully whimsical game in a market dominated by grit. Rayman: Origin's shows of a beautiful world of color that offsets the sea of brown and bloom that most are accompanied to. Rayman;s classic level design returns to show memorable locals, catchy music and challenging gameplay. Players will find themselves continuing to play into the wee hours of the morning just to see what could possibly in the next level. I feel it must also be said that Rayman: Origins has what has to be the first underwater levels that aren't a loveless experience and are actually some of my favorite ones to play. Co-Oping is fun but seems lacking, they could have done more to make it feel liek playing with friends was a new experience. Overall, a perfect game to own if not for the 60 dollar pricetag, luckily prices have dropped to a better zone.. Play this game with a friend and you won't be disappointed; this game feels great and looks superb. I loved playing the original Rayman on the PS1 but it is the most difficult game I have ever encountered. Origins however, implements a nice checkpoint system and gives you an infinite amount of lives. This makes the game highly enjoyable but is no means a walk in the park. Unfortunately Rayman Origins has no online play but i'd rather have no net-code than poor net-code. Playing next to some one improves the experience anyhow; you'll find yourself literally laughing out loud at this game. Overall great fun.. Rayman Origins is a terrific platformer with a coop that makes it even more fantastic. The controls are flawless, and it is the certainly the best looking 2D game to date - the soundtrack and voice-work are also hilarious. Without a shadow of a doubt one of the richest and most fun experiences I've had in recent memory. Do not miss out on this great game, play it with a friend and you will both be in for a ton of fun.. The best 2d platformer I have played in years. Rayman Origins captures the magic, creativity and nostalgia of the 2d platformer, a dying genre in games today and even though I love Super Mario, it's a very refreshing shift instead of having to rely on Mario for platformers most of the time. The gameplay is fun, the music is funny and the graphics and art design are colourful and beautiful to look at, proof that a game doesn't need realism to look good this generation. The local 4 player multiplayer is ridiculously fun and a great game when friends are around. If you love 2d platformers and games in general, do not pass this up on any console you own.. I can sum up this incredible game in one sentence: If you don't fall in love with it after a few levels, you are not a gamer. In a gaming era bloated with first person shooters and bleeding edge graphics, this gem pushes the boundaries of 2d platforming with fluid, flawlessly integrated game play mechanics melded with incredibly gorgeous artwork in the form of environment and character design. Rayman Origins takes 25 years of platforming blazed by the house that built Mario and completely reinvents the genre for a new generation of gamers. The amount of content included with the shipped package is truly satisfying and the level of fun this game can provide is unparalleled. I even managed to get my wife to play this game with me, and actually enjoy it. Unfortunately it seems like masterpieces such as this game will ultimately get lost in the shuffle of the mindless CoD clones that the industry is so intent on force feeding gamers.. I loved the past raymans. However, this game is rigged with bugs and errors that make it hard to play. The game is very boring and is a total step back. Why go back to outdated 2D? The series has done great in 3D and thats how fans enjoyed it. Good thing rayman 3 is coming in HD later march 2012. This game is a total fail. Im a LONG TIME fan, and it **** **** ****. Do not buy this terrible game.. Truly an overrated game. Sure, it's one of the best looking games out there, and has an amazing soundtrack too, but the floaty controls, occasional camera glitches and insane difficulty ramp up near the end pretty much makes this game incredibly frustrating and at the price of a full retail game, it's just not worth it.. One of the best platformers I've played in a long time. The graphics are brilliant, the gameplay is challenging and varied and while the plot of the game is not particularly complex I do give the developers props for making the premise a tongue-in-cheek stab at similar platformer games and their lack of interesting plotlines (I'm looking at you, Mario). I'm not going to get into just what makes this game so great because all of the other reviews have already done so-all I'll say is this: If you're a platform gamer or even a casual gamer and you believe that games don't have to be ""realistic"" (CoD) to have gorgeous visuals than I would suggest at least renting this game and giving it a try. I do not believe that you will be disappointed. Now I gave this game a 9, though I wish I could give it a 9.9 or at least a 9.5. Unfortunately Metacritic increments scores by whole numbers, so I gave it a 9. I gave it a 9 because I didn't like the extra unlock-able characters-they are literally just the regular characters with costume changes. I felt the game would have been better without them because at least then I wouldn't feel disappointed every time I unlocked a new character only to find out that it was functionally identical teensie/Rayman/Globox with different clothes.. FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN!!!!! What a great fun game especially multiplayer. If you have kids they will love it AND you can even play it with them! It is in no way serious, involved or complicated. I'm not a huge platformer fan but this one is a must have.. When you first start up Rayman Origins, You are Introduced to a, really quite beautiful, world full of colour and Brilliant Sounds. The game is the perfect relaxant, There are no penalties for death, rather you simply restart from the current room. These are all really small. The art style Of the game is amazing, reminding me off what made me fall in love with gaming. It looks completely hand drawn. This game has great replayability, as it gives rewards such as new characters and new stages when you replay levels. Overall I would say that this game is best played with a couple of friends, simply because it makes the game more hectic, more fun and more brilliant.. the art style is beautiful and the simplistic gameplay is great. It's nice to see Rayman back. I hope they get a go at a sequel to this one because i don't think I could ever get tired of this game.. Okay, this game is charming, I'll give it that. While I generally thought some of the platform mechanics were a bit frustrating, the ability to do coop play with my kids and husband redeemed this game immeasurably. It's cute, the kids love it, and whether it's my cup of tea or not, there are definitely those in my house that love it, so this review is on their behalf as well. Give it a shot, you might be surprised.. It's about time we have a platformer like Rayman Origins in our generation. But it's disappointing to see that a game like this does not get enough attention. It's amazing to see game with many of the essentials to a platformer. The story is rock-solid. With multiple unlockable quirky characters to play as, and a variety of enemies to fight, this game won't let up the style and hilarity. And all this with a soundtrack that UBIsoft nailed to add on to the story. The graphics are hands-down one best you'll see in a 2-D game with a smooth animation and incredible art direction. Even though there is no online, you will still find amusement and glory in this game, whether you're playing alone or with friends. When you're tired of seeing or shooting other bad guys in gory clashes, refresh yourself by playing Rayman Origins.. What a fantastic surprise this game was! Beautiful hand drawn graphics that are utterly charming. The sound design is brilliant and the music is a fitting tribute to the mad erratic nature of the game. The gameplay is solid and doesn't try to over complicate with lives and power-ups etc. A pure platformer experience in every shape and form. Also, this is quite a large game with over 10 words containing several levels with a lot of variety, whether your flying on the back of a mosquito or swimming in the deep ocean. I have to say the underwater sections are immensely fun and rather quite beautiful. This game is best played with at least one other person. 2 player co-op is brilliant, 4 player co-op can become quite hectic and very suddenly turns into a slap-fest (you can slap the crap out of each other). So if you want to progress with good scores the 2 player co-op is best, but for maximum on-screen insanity get three friends round and start slapping! Honestly one of the funnest games of last year. I really do struggle to find anything negative about this game. Maybe there are a few pacing issues on some levels and a large amount of trial and error, but that's kind of what platform-games are all about. Anyway frequent checkpoints remove any frustration of having to re-do a tricky part of a level. So no, nothing bad to say about this game. Pah, you can have a 10!. This was the funnest game that I played throughout all of 2011. It was great. Hand drawn graphics, and crisp, fun game play kept me smiling until the very end.. I thought it was over for Rayman. I'll be honest and blunt. I thought it was a franchiseon its way out - with the latest being in the Raving Rabbids party series and Rayman 3D (See my review). However Rayman Origins has the shock factor and is exceptional in almost every way, an ideal platformer with plenty to give to not just gamers but an example of how platformers are done. Rayman Origins takes the successful elements of pprevious Rayman's and adds a huge layer of depth to the beloved franchise. This 2D platformer should not be judged by it's cover, many I have spoken to about commented on the artstyle not looking like Skyrim or Uncharted, SO WHAT. The artstyle is amazing in this game and should not be taken lightly a true delight o see that in an age where there are GOW3, UC and Crysis that even 2D platformers shine with their artstyle and shock gamers with the fluidity of their presentation. Gameplay:9, Graphics: 9, Sound: 9, Presentation:9, Lasting appeal: 9.5. I'm a hardcore gamer and yet I find Rayman to be a pure marvel, it is the most gorgeous game you will ever play, visuals are out of this world, Music is incredible, ultra atmospheric, and most importantly, super fun, do not miss this one, it is a Gem!. Beautiful hand drawn graphics, classic 2-d side scroller game-play with modern twists! This is what happens when France makes Mario, a hilarious, adorable, and addicting game. The SFX are unique and well done and is adding to my experience. I've been recommending this game to kids and adults alike, the 4 player co-op adds to the easy play-ability. And the replayability is high because of the challenges on each level. I've been playing it more than Skyrim as of late","the best thing to come out of France, and an affordable price for this colorful game that honors the rayman saga . i can't give it a 10 in 2024 just because of Rayman Legends ."
794.Return to Monkey Island,"Nice game overall. The story is not amazing and I was expecting something more from the puzzle.. For me, it's just ""okay"". I like the art style. But the game is *very* easy, it lacks the scale and scope of the series' finest entries (MI2 for example, which has never been bested), and as someone who has enjoyed all of the games except for Escape the soft retcon vibe and super meta ending just felt a bit off and discontinuous with the previous games. It has its moments, but ultimately left me unsatisfied.. It captures the fell of the old school Monkey Island/point and click adventures - with all the good and bad that comes with that. I don't particularly like the art style, but it works well enough. The puzzles are mostly good, until the last chapter where it just gets annoying. Overall, it's a fun time, but it goes on too long. The ending, while I get what they were going for, is not exactly satisfying.. This game is not canon. It's a big attempt to destroy the franchise legacy by Ron Gilbert for not having worked on anything Monkey Island from MI2 forward. Game tries hard to discredit anything that came after the last time Ron Gilbert had any input in the series in 1991 with a revisionist approach and pretending Curse of Monkey Island, MI4 and Tell Tale games didn't happen. Words can't describe how much I hate this game and those who made it happen.. I'm too much of a MI fan to get too down on this game, but it does feel like ""Monkey Island Lite"" in many ways, just kinda basic and bare-bones and also less funny than the other games in the series (noted exception being the mop tree scene). And while I don't hate the graphical style, it does make it look kinda flat and plain, like a flash-based MI browser game fan tribute or sth. Return is also very, very easy: Even in hard mode, the game practically spoon-feeds you the solutions to most puzzles. I only used the hint book once and even that was just because I had missed an item. And, oh yeah, the ending blows. HARD. Why do I still recommend it? It is still Monkey Island, not very expensive (especially on sale), and, overall, still a very enjoyable experience. It just cannot quite live up to the legendary legacy of Monkey Island, which is a bit of a shame.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I 've never played previous parts so probably rate should be higher for people who understand callbacks and enjoy meeting old characters. For me just decent point'an'click game.. its pretty funny, and seems interesting, but it has the most outrageously pretentious and unintuitive control system, and it has a terrible issue with not letting you skip certain repeating animations or dialogues. yes, it has a skip button, but why in the f**k doesnt it just let you click to skip through things? its literally a point and click game but it requires you to memorize ludicrous controls such as ""O: open settings menu"" (it might be a joke but it's getting in the way of functional gameplay). i got this for free and i don't want it, it's just massively outdated and stupidly inconsiderate to the player's time and energy.. Many have tried to be a modern point-and-click game but the godfather of P&C adventure games, Ron Gilbert, himself made one that truly lives up to that claim. I can't speak for those never been exposed to the MI series, but if you are like me and loved MI1 and MI2, you'll find RtMI so familiar yet so refreshing. I thought I did not like the art style but would only tolerate it. Well, as the game started I instantly fell in love with it. Like Ron Gilbert said in his blog post, he and the team always tried to push the graphics and art style forward with MI1 (from initial EVGA to VGA 256) and MI2. A lot of QoL improvements to the interface of RtMI's enables you to immerse yourself in the story and not be slowed down by menus and selections that likely won't be attractive given how much PC gaming and adventures games have come. This is truly a 10/10 modern adventure game. I thought that genre was dead (though I loved it to death) but Ron GIlbert and RtMI proved me wrong. The only critique I have is that I know I would liked it to be longer when I finish it.. Return to Monkey Island is a quality, modern point 'n' click adventure that should appeal to fans of the Monkey Island franchise and newcomers alike. An intuitive, easy-to-use interface, an easy difficulty setting and an in-game hints system will be welcome to those unfamiliar with point 'n' click adventures and everyone can appreciate the crisp visuals, professional voice acting, beautiful soundtrack and funny humour. The ending is the only thing I had mixed feelings about. It doesn't detract from the fun I had playing the actual game but I did feel it could've been wrapped up better (just don't ask me how).. First, an announcement: Ron Gilbert is my favorite developer, I consider the first two Monkey Island and Timbelweed Park wonderful adventures and perfect examples of storytelling applied to video games. I've been waiting and literally dreaming about this game for thirty years. So if you want to disqualify what you are about to read as an outburst from a hater, you are wrong. I really wanted this game to be great. But it simply isn't. It's a total, absolute disaster. Everything is wrong. The first bad sensations had already started from the first teaser, but, out of affection for Ron and the franchise, I defended the game on several occasions on forums and blogs, even if I felt that something was deeply out of tune. Let's go step by step: 1 - Graphics. This has been the most controversial point from the beginning. To best discuss this, we need to divide this point into three subcategories: art style, animations, technical execution. The artistic style, curated by Rex Crowle, is undoubtedly particular. In part it tries to ""conceptually"" resume the old pixel art, but it produces an alienating effect, which above all affects the general atmosphere of the game. It is no longer a ""realistic"" environment like in Monkey 1-2, a realism occasionally contaminated by cartoon grafts, here we are shamelessly inside a children's cartoon. The feeling of danger, of mystery, of fear that was breathed in the first two chapters is completely absent. I have not been able to understand, even after a year of reflections, what was the reason for this so self-defeating choice. If the Disney management really didn't like pixel art (which by far for a game like this would have been the way to go) they could opt for a style a la Curse. What's more: such a particular style, in order to be perceived as qualitatively valid, needed top-level animations and technical execution. Instead, for obvious budgetary reasons, instead of animations drawn frame by frame, we opted for poor spline puppet animations, which give the whole an amateur flavor and a Flash game. Finally, the technical execution of many backgrounds goes from good to mediocre: just look at the backdrops of Melee's kitchen, the fish shop, the museum, Carla's house... for an averagely trained eye it is clear that they have remained at an early stage of production. There are less colors on the screen, the proportions of the objects do not match those of the characters ... in short, a disaster. 2 - History. I would have accepted all the graphic flaws in the world, as long as the story was engaging and rich, full of mystery and adventure. But even here ... a huge disappointment. What we all wanted was simply the conclusion of the story as Ron had envisioned it. ""Guybrush goes to hell and fights the demon LeChuck"". An epic and great story, capable of tying together all the unsolved points of the previous stories (the amusement park, Big Whoop, LeChuck and Guybrush as brothers, the dead parents, the orphanage...). I expected flashbacks, introspection, intricate subplots that would expand the world of Monkey Island enormously. But... even here, nothing. ""They had already done a lot of my idea, casually, in Tales and Curse."" Mah. I think that even on this occasion Disney has imposed some of its delusional corporate policies and has forced Ron to change direction, forcing him to give us a silly plot that wearily links some elements of Monkey 1-2. I'll leave out talking about how everything, from a certain point on, seems drawn out: empty islands, puzzles and other islands cut from the game, characters that have no development and just disappear into thin air, no real connection to the old stories , everything seems to happen like this, by chance. I understand that the upstream intention was to reflect on the ""history of Monkey Island"", but seriously ... it doesn't work. Regardless of the initial intentions, it doesn't work at all. It is all superficial, empty, devoid of depth and mystery. Just to make a quick comparison: consider the bookshops of Timbelweed Park: one could also spend hours just reading the contents of those books. This is narrative depth. Take the RTMI library: four books of which we only read the cover. In Monkey 2 there was a whole filing cabinet...that's not design ""progress"". It's putrefaction. The old verb interface had the advantage of creating a direct bridge between the game world and the gamer. It had the ability to hide many games and phrases, as well as making you feel directly in control of the character and that world. The new control system eliminates any complexity in exploration, certainly making everything more fluid, but also less interesting and alive. It's like watching a -bad- cartoon with some minor interaction. Puzzles of an embarrassing ease. Here I think Ron got influenced by Grossman and his bizarre mother-in-law proof design ideas. **** target audience is not mothers-in-law. RTMI is garbage.. Return to Monkey Island is a well written adventure game. Ron Gilbert, the creator of the first two games, is back at the helm, and he found a clever way to essentially continue the story from where he left off in Monkey Island 2 without 'de-canonizing' the other games (although, I'm sure many would have been happy to forget Escape from Monkey Island). Thematically, it's a more thoughtful sequel than games 3-5; it really ties Guybrush's story together. While I realize that retreading the past is kind of the point, the fact that a big part of the game is set on a carbon copy of Melee Island from the first game was perhaps more pleasing to a returning creator than to the rest of us (we already got a graphically retouched version of Melee in the special edition). Also, I'd argue that the number of old characters repurposed to fill new roles felt gratuitous already by the fourth game. Even though the game is self-aware about it, the nostalgia-angle has already been thoroughly milked in previous titles. Be that is it may, the actual adventure is as well crafted as ever and the dialogue is excellent (as you'd expect). Gameplay-wise though, it's a a disappointment. This is an adventure game that doesn't trust you to play it. By severely limiting the number of actions you may (attempt to) perform, a lot of the lateral thinking involved in solving the puzzles is gone, and the world just doesn't feel interactive. This is a major problem with the game. Even if most attempted actions don't do anything in classic point and click adventure games, there's value in the feeling of it potentially doing something. I'm very surprised the Gilbert seems unaware of this. I'm not saying that the old 12-verb system would have been the better choice here, but rather that a game like Curse of Monkey Island struck a much better balance in terms of complexity vs user friendliness, and this new system holds your hand too anxiously. The puzzles themselves are mostly well crafted. While the new simplified gameplay makes the game too easy (and I played on hard, mind you), you can still get stuck on simple puzzles that are just counter intuitive. A puzzle where you need to simply re-enter a room, took me way too long to figure out, because it doesn't make sense. Similarly, I was stuck forever on another puzzle because it seems I disagree with the developers about the meaning of 'left' and 'right' in terms of rotating motions. No adventure game experience is free from a few hiccups like these, though, and your mileage may vary. Speaking of Curse of Monkey Island: compared to that game from 1997, the production values in terms of the graphics are underwhelming. I rarely complain about graphics in games, but I feel Return to Monkey Island really does have a problem in this department. The art style is so avant-garde that it forgets to be graphics, i.e. it's not immersive. The design of the characters' faces feel too abstract and lifeless to allow facial expressions to aid the comedic writing. It's a far cry from the sublime character animations of Curse of Monkey Island (again, from 1997!). Some have pointed out that the wobbly, elastic quality to the animations make it feel like a 'cheap flash game', and well... they have a point. Every installment since Curse has been underwhelming in terms of character design, animation and atmosphere, adding to the persisting feeling that we still haven't seen a proper Monkey Island game since the first three.. Return to Monkey Island is as fitting a conclusion as this classic franchise could have asked for. Return to Monkey Island tells a wonderfully charming tale of well-worn heroes past their prime, looking for one last adventure to recapture their glory years. The original Monkey Island team is back, lead by original creator Ron Gilbert, and Return to Monkey Island is very much content to play it safe in the gameplay department -- utilizing a system that feels right at home with the first two games, albeit with a few modern touches. Anyone who has any history with the Monkey Island franchise should feel right at home with Return to Monkey Island.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yeah, it's bad. It take one years for me to admit that, because I waited for this game litterally for 30 years, and I wanted to like it so much. But it's bad. Lazy, unfinished, with no real connections with the old ones. A boring soft reboot, as in contemporary Disney tradition. What a delusion. We just wanted the conclusion of the original trilogy as it was originally planned (Guybrush goes to hell)- Why Ron has abandoned all the good ideas he wrote in his post of 2013 is beyond my comprension.. I don't have much experience with this style of game, but I went through it with my wife and enjoyed it. We would love to play more games like this on the steam deck hooked up to our TV. I see a lot of reviews trashing the game for not living up to expectations, or for it's art style, but none of that bothered me. If you enjoy solving puzzles and humor, give it a try!. Great game! Continues the legacy of Guybrush Threepwood. The puzzles were much easier now. Lesser puns, insults, and jokes. But still very fun, nevertheless.. Ron Gilbert did not surprise me, again. Monkey Island has always been and will remain one of the best point-and-click adventure games I've played. I've read a lot of people's negative comments: These comments were about both the puzzles and its humour. However, there is no forced storytelling or boring puzzles. It's a pretty decent game that anyone can play. If you're starting the Monkey Island series for the first time, I recommend playing the previous games, as you can see a lot of spoilers in Return to Monkey Island. The ending though... It made me laugh a lot. The last information Elaine gave was really pleasing.. What could be the dullest puzzle for a point and click game? Maybe basic ""There's a lock. FIND the KEY and USE it to the LOCK."" Okay, now let's include dozen of those in this game! Sigh, I played the game through anyways, it had its moments but most of it was kinda unchallenging, repetitive and boring.. The worst game of the serie. Short, easy, with zero original idea, horrible graphics and a very bad plot that relies on continuous nostalgia moments and ends in the worst way possible. A few time the humour made me laugh, that's the most positive thing I can say. Only play it if you are a huge fan of Guybrush, but expect to be disappointed.. Initially so exciting to be back, but unfortunately uninspired puzzles, with a confusingly vague and dreary ending had me wondering if they'd run out of time/money and wishing they'd quit while they were ahead.. I want to preface that this game isn't made for me, I'm not a gamer that likes this genre of game in most cases. But, I play hundreds of games a year if not more and go into every single one of them with an open mind. This. Is. Boring. I couldn't bring myself to get past the first few hours. The art style is well done but I don't like it, the voice acting is decent, I don't like it. I can get through a bad game if the story is good enough, or if the gameplay itself is good enough; I don't like em. I can ignore a thousand different things if just one thing is good enough. I didn't find that one thing here. I'm giving it a 2 because of nostalgia and I do my reviews based off my enjoyment. I could've given it a 1 if I wasn't taken back to childhood like I was... and I was brought back and that was fun for 5 five minutes. Then I freaked out and cleaned my room before my dad could get home and ground me. But then I got scared because my dad's been dead for eight years! I thought about his funeral, I thought about the casket; thought about the food and I thought about this game. It was then that I realized, I had a better time there then I did Returning to Monkey island.. A game centered around solving puzzles... gets old fast. Puzzles are the only motivation and as such it gets tiresome. Better have a great story or do something else to captivate the player, but no. Not only is the story meh, the art design is terrible and hard on the eyes. It's even worse of an eye sore than Escape from Monkey Island! Sorry, Ron, back to the drawing board you go! F. Disclaimer: The Secret of Monkey Island and LeChuck's Revenge are my all-time favourite games and they will never be topped. I love Ron Gilbert, he's my favourite developer and I loved to death Thimbleweed Park. I had a very bad feeling about Return after seeing that god-awful trailer. Worse than I thought. Much worse than I thought, since I was confident Gilbert's writing would have been top notch despite the art direction. I was wrong. The artstyle is adequate for what the game writing and story are. And I don't mean it in a nice way. Yeah, it's an absolute disaster visually, ugly with cheap flashlike skeletal animations everywhere. It's small, both in scope and in lenght - it has no breadth. It's empty. Just compare the islands in act IV with the islands in Monkey Island 2. There is no Caribbean to be found here. The puzzles are easy and not particularly well designed or interesting, some of them also have small hints on how to solve them (like seeing a blowfish while going down the anchor). They're just silly. The interface... well, I hate those barebone interfaces designed for tablets and little kids at their first P&C experience. And the writing. Oh my god. I said the art style is adequate... because it's a full fledged low tier nickelodeon cartoon. It's silly through and through. Forget On Stranger Tides. It's not a pirate story anymore, it's a cartoon. LeChuck - from a scary ghost pirate - became a caricature, Elaine is utterly destroyed, as is everyone else. Cartoon caricatures. And the writing. I don't even know where to start. Pretentious overall. I'm convinced that in 30 years Ron got sick of people asking him about Monkey Island (and a secret that never existed) and started to resent his creature. Now it's a meta story on growing old and the likes. I don't even feel bad about the ending like most people (I LOVED MI2 ending), but... AGAIN? Not that I was expecting anything different due to all the clues during the game. And where the hell their fixation for THE SECRET came out? They make it sounds like they didn't search for anything else since the beginning of the saga, while it was NEVER a thing. And why Chuckie and Guybrush aren't the ones playing, since MI2 was Guybrush's story? ""Uh, no, it weren't them"" yes, they were, clearly. We also saw his parents in the dream, and they were not strangers. They retconned A LOT and it ****. Ron was hell-bent on NOT giving the fans what they wanted. Gilbert had no idea what to do with this game, scratched everything he planned and thought (his famous 17 points and ""Guybrush goes to hell and Stan is there"") and destroyed his creature. The music is also disappointing. I mean, it's good but... it's the bare minimum. They just basically gave an orchestration to the old tunes. And it's overdone and overcomplicated, in 1 year no one will remember those tunes, while we still perfectly remember every song in MI1 30 years later. A mention for Dominic Amato, who does an excellent job - still not my Guybrush voice and still doesn't sound like MI1-MI2 Guybrush should sound (too -again- cartoony), but he's GOOD at his job and he was obviously very committed to the part.. I really love the humour, puzzles and gameplay! It's a game worth every cent!. Not bad just didn't feel like a proper game. Still fun to play and a must for Monkey fans.. It's a great experience for those who grew up with the original point n' clickers. As a modern game, it's still pretty decent. Nothing about it really sticks out to me except for the nostalgia of the original games. Unfortunately, the difficulty is dumbed down for this new generation of gaming. Hours were dedicated to trying to find the craziest path to your objective, and now you're given a hint book that can be too enticing to read through from time to time. The comedy is still pretty on point if you know the originals, finding that perfect balance of nostalgia and new. You'll get your fill here if you're a fan of the first two Monkey Island games. I just don't think much else will.. This game features some very clever and fun dialogue which is the main attraction here. The design and setup are all very well done. I am glad there was a very instructive hint book cause some the processes would of been pretty tough to come up with otherwise. I had no issue with any of the graphics or artstyle. I don't think I got a great ending from what I have checked around on online but it was very thoughtful and introspective. Played exclusively on steam deck with no issues.. As a massive fan of Thimbleweed Park, I was extremely disappointed by Monkey Island. I basically kept playing in order to finish it despite being bored most of the time. The game's writing is basically exactly what you would expect. It's relentlessly silly, but in a predictable way that an AI could generate if it was fed the previous 2 games. Everyone says pretty much exactly what you expect them to all of the time. The games graphics are amazing, despite what you may hear. The vector images and textured art allow your brain to activate your imagination to interpret a scene, which is an element of pixel art that HD renderings often miss. The game feels more ""alive"", as a result, than other HD games. The inference is terrible, however, and feels made for touch screens. It's context sensitivity ruins a lot of the exploration from previous games and feels hollow. Where the previous game allowed the PLAYER to take actions, and then the game generated pithy outputs, the new game literally puts a prompt to ""comment on x"" on the screen that is literally a quip generating button. It's less fun and takes power away from the player. But the real reason the game is below ""fun"" is that the puzzles are tedious, boring and obtuse. For instance, one puzzle has to feeding an NPC who complains of his food being bland. The solution to the puzzle is to apply fire to it. Like... what? There is an in-game hint guide, so it's impossible to be stuck and have it not be by choice, but once you look up a solution and find that the answer is absurd, it ruins the game. You no longer want to put up with any frustration because the answer might be stupid and you would never figure it out. In the end... this game is just unfun. It's a MASSIVE disappointment because of how much I loved Thimbleweed Park. I hope Gilbert to returns to TP and abandons Monkey Island.. How to brew Return to Monkey Island soup: 30% Rehashed nostalgia and familiar characters 20% Rushed development and questionable art style 15% Good puzzles and quite a few lazy ones (even on ""hard"") 15% Monkey Island magic and new funny material 10% Monkey Island music 10% Flat ending Let simmer in a big kettle and add a flattened skull. It's probably not a bad game but it's hardly the best in the series if you've played the previous ones, and it's not exactly a stellar standalone game for newcomers either. Probably an 8 score game if the ending had been better, and still not sure about the art style.. I hated the screenshots and the trailer. I thought the art style looked awful. Then I played and was surprised to discover the game looks gorgeous. I don't know what happened, but it looks a LOT different when you're actually playing the game. Story is good. Puzzles are good. The whole thing is a very slick and polished. Recommended. Bottom line: Never trust people who haven't played the game. (Seems obvious when you think about it.). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An absolute gem ****. Not a fan of the art style but everything else is tight and on point. Loved it.. Excellent atmosphere, voice acting, humor and such a joyous way to Return to Monkey Island! Love the new and old characters, the puzzles are awesome (even if simplified IMO). Check it out, well done to all the team who worked on this gem of an adventure game! :). Art style is bad. Maybe it looks cool and modern to whoever designed it, but what I see is a tasteless ugly mess. It's not a remaster - the original game looks nothing like that and not because of a different technology from back of the days, but it had own style which is now completely gone.. Very enjoyable game, hardly no frustrating elements. Great modern application of the old school point and click adventure. But: I think it's time for something new. Many locations and characters return once again. Somehow it misses some atmosphere.. The game is a real crap. In addition to horrible graphics (I'm not surprised anymore) the story is terrible (there are too many moments where nothing makes sense). It's such a soulless game. Disney put his stamp just like in his last movies (Star Wars franchise and others). Absolute sadness. A fun return to a much loved franchise. Largely enjoyed the new art style. Music and voice work is excellent, and the puzzles were suitable challenging. I had to ponder overnight on several of them and even used a hint early on (I wish I hadn’t - it was obvious!). I liked the ending, but it felt a little abrupt. All in all, a really enjoyable game.. Very good point and click adventure. It is not as deep as MI2, but still very enjoyable. The graphic isn't bad at all, you get used to it just after a couple of mins of gameplay. Music is perfect: it give a nice touch to every location in the game.. Its an ok enough game from an puzzle standpoint but the ending is terrible and they made Guybrush into an cruel ****. I have been a fan of Monkey Island since the first game, and I loved all of them including the non-Ron Gilbert ones. Monkey Island was the game that got me into point and click adventures, but very few other adventure games match the quality and humour of Monkey Island. I was initially a bit hesitant about the odd choice of art style, but I was so distracted by the the sharp, witty and excellent writing that the art style ended up not bothering me. I was so sure of this game I pre-ordered it on Steam before release, and I'm glad I did. A masterpiece.... So eye-hurtingly hideous that it's impossible to bear; so I can't even comment beyond that.. Thank you Ron Gilbert for this game. It's a fun and engaging sequel. For most of the time it captures the spirit of previous games, with fun story and silly puzzles, cool presentation and great sound. But it feels too much controlled by outside forces presumably, and also every now and then seams a bit empty and unfocused. That's why it's only 8. But overall it's a good experience.. I don't really think there's anything about this game I don't like. It is an absolute master-piece when it comes to adventure game point-n-click. Every piece of the game intersects perfectly with the others making it a complete joy to play. From the music, to the art, animations, hint system, story, dialog. I love it all!. a Monkey Island. With all the essence and spirit from the originals. Fun adventure, lots of details from the originals but not full of useless fan-service. Just perfect. Graphics are beautiful, with a LOT of personality. And it looks waaaaay better in movement.. I've never played the series and decided to start with this one since it was renowned and I'm familiar with point & click adventures (I've obviously watched a recap of the previous chapters). The gameplay is pretty basic, I expected something more intrigate and mind-poking, but it may be because I chose the first difficulty option; perhaps veteran suited me more. Graphically it's definitely not bad as many would swear. I'd have appreciated better animation tho. I liked the writing, it was quirky, but the plot... Firstly I was expecting something longer, and more complex, and the ending was so disappointing. i read it was something the author reused to cope with the fact that he would never satisfy the expectations, so he simply bailed from trying. That's the overall vibe I'm getting for the entire game. It could have been much more, but something went wrong.. An excellent game ! Just finish in Normal mode (12 hours). Not too easy, not too hard. Good story.. I really, really wanted to like this game. The puzzles seemed a little easy with the new interface but I still think it could have been good. But so much of the game is just rehashing things in a less satisfying way. There's not enough Murray (which is from a game I thought didn't count ""officially""). I don't care if the art style is different. It only matters if I like the style, not whether it's new or old. I didn't like this one but it still could have been a good game. Ron Gilbert said Disney let him make the game he wanted. I only partially believe that. Disney's diversity quotas are in heavy effect. You see that the minute you walk into the Scumm bar. 2/3 of the pirates you talk to are female and 2/3 of the pirate leaders are female. Coincidence? Nah. It goes on throughout the game. Finally, you get to the ending and it just ****. What would be a better ending? ANYTHING. I don't care what the secret is. Commit to an ending. It's not that hard.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. my humble opinion, the existence of this project is just as tasteless It's your call but for now it's not recommended. 4/10 this game at that stag. Can't digest that they turned the iconic monkey island to this low budget, generic corpo art, soulless game. I guess it caters to a modern audience but for us folks who grew up with MI this is a major letdown art wise, script wise, puzzle wise, world wise... 4/10 from me. Now excuse me while I go play the first three games again to forget this atrocity ever happened. I find this game initially a very charming and endearing story in which each character is a true individual. I had a lot of fun on this short but intense adventure.. big disappointment the return to monkey island, don't waste your money on this cash grab attempt. The puzzles are too easy and the game has been extremely simplified. There aren't any truly remarkable puzzles like the insult fig","it's a big attempt to destroy the franchise legacy by Ron Gilbert for not having worked on anything from the series forward . the story is not amazing and the puzzles are mostly good, until the last chapter where it just gets annoying . overall, it's a fun time, but it goes on too long ."
795.Sin & Punishment: Star Successor,"Sin and Punishment 2 is a challenging, but very entertaining bullet hell, on rail shooter. Veterans will be tested like crazy on harder difficulties, but newcomers can enter the game with some relative ease.. Star Successor has a few problems with its oddly lengthy stages, confusing scoring system, and sometimes jarring visuals, but it is still a better game than its predecessor. Providing tighter controls due to the use of the wii mote and nunchuck; better combat, thanks to the focus on aerial combat, and charming visuals that are seen throughout the array of environments visited throughout the game. Star Successor is challenging, interesting, and overall weird enough to give it a look through for anyone. And if you're a fan of on rail shooters certainly pick this one up.. this is definitly the bests shumps i ever played its so awesome and hard and fun fly in the sky killing robots like a god and there is a pretty deng sexy boy!. Sin & Punishment 2 is truly a game worth playing in any way you can. The rail shooting perfectly mixes with the Wii mote and the bosses are some of the best in any video game ever made. PLAY IT NOW. badass and satisfying arcade gameplay which is fast paced and never gets boring. it's also pretty challenging. graphically, nothing to sneeze at. one downside is the nonsensical story where **** happens with cutscenes and dialogue rivalling kingdom hearts. 2020. Still love this game. It is what it is. 1st class rails shooter action. Immensely fun. I'll never part with this game.. I played this game back in 2011 and as I played once more in 2019 I was remembering bit by bit why I liked so much and why It's easily in my top 5 favorite games. I'm not really into shooters but I'm pretty sure that Treasure was in the zone when making this game because everything is on top and masterfully done: music, gameplay, character design, progression, story, challenge, everything. The story is a little convoluted and you need to play the first game to have the most of it (it's available in the Wii U shop for a very cheap price and is also a great game) and even then you also need to give it several playthroughs in order to organize all its bits and have them to make sense, it has some anime tropes but is really good or at least serviceable to an steller gameplay, and its filled with amazing moments, sometimes over the top and sometimes subtle and calm, yet they go so well with what's happening on screen, also the credits music is relevant to the plot so I'm really thankful that the localization captioned it for us. About the gameplay and progression, you have a three basic attacks, rapid-fire shots, charge shots and melee attacks and that's it, no power-ups just your basic attacks, what is so brilliant about them it's that you need to use them creatively in distinct scenarios through the stages in order to have the most of them, things like deflecting missiles with your melee attacks, use charge shots in certain instances, you won't miss power-ups because you have plenty with your arsenal. The difficulty have a well-established rhythm and every stage and every boss seems more difficult than the one before, on normal difficulty you'll have a challenging time especially at the final levels but the real fun and punishment starts with the hard difficulty, you'll die a lot but you also will improve a lot, and because there are several checkpoints it's not an impossible task, you only have to apply yourself and study what you're making wrong or what to do in certain situation, and eventually, everything will make sense and you'll be dancing with the bullets, it's very cathartic and you'll truly feel amazing, it's not impossible to finish it in hard mode, because an amateur like me could finish it, the real real challenge might be finish this game without even dying, good luck with that. There are several control options but the one you need to pick is the default one, nunchuck and wii mote, no matter what you've heard or thought about motion controls, this motion aiming is perfect and I couldn't think of playing it another way. This game is a masterpiece, simply put, it only requires that you play a very short and cheap game to obtain the best of it, it has a lot of replayability and if you're into shooting arcades or scores this game will be a hit, my only problem and is really a nitpick are the characters faces, they're just uncanny and kind of remind me of Dark Crystal creatures, which is a shame because the concept art is beautiful, hopefully but almost impossible we can have a remaster or something and with some tweaks to the faces that make them look more like they're intended to. I recommend this game to everyone because it reminds me of why I play videogames in the first place. Don't play it on easy mode, at least not your first playthrough, just keep in mind that your resolve will be tested and you'll be punished a lot. Also, if by some miracle this thing has a re-release or any related media to Sin & Punishment, please support the creators, this franchise needs to resurge and everyone needs to have the right to play it.. This game is overrated and I regret ever buying it. I played and beat the entire game hoping it would get better because of all the positive reviews. It didn't. It was simply not fun. Highly NOT recommended.. I bought this game a few days ago, so it's almost retro, you could get it for a bargain price. it's a lovely game, I've only played stage 1 and 2 and they're both cramped with stuff. gameplay is simple, graphics are imaginative and stylish. I wish it had some arcade, non saving mode(house of the dead style) it would have been even better to me. nonetheless it's a great, old school, game. you should buy it especially if you're into mecha design.. This game reminds me alot with the StarFox series, but it has its unique playstyle. Sin and punishment 2 is one those games that age extremely well, focusing gameplay over narrative and story. The graphics are well made for the wii, but it does have a lot of underpolished sprites. The ost is fine, not amazing nor bad. The gameplay is very well crafted with a lot of action and intense shooting. Altogether, its a nice little gem for the wii.. My second favorite game on Wii, Sin and Punishment: Star Successor is a cobal shooter done perfectly. Starting with the minor, the music is surprisingly well done, but unbalanced with songs like War, Blackheart and Morph sticking out. As for the story, it's not that great. It's somewhat basic and doesn't instantly reveal itself to the player. Instead, you're given hints as to what happened in the passed and must piece them together yourself, though it's not as bad as it sounds. There are a couple of localization errors here and there, particularly the ending, and the voice acting isn't very precise. On the other hand, the gameplay. HOLY CRAP, the gameplay. This is easily the most fun I've had in a video game. Like any cobal shooter, you control an avatar with one controller stick while separately aiming with another. With the Wii, however, you can aim directly at your TV while moving around with the nunchuck for superb accuracy. The level design is great, difficulty is determined by the player, and there are a plethora of great bosses in each level. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an extremely fun, fair challenge. 9.2 It has its flaws, but fits for the type of game it is.. Sin and Punishment 2 is a major step up from its predecessor in terms of both graphics and gameplay. Shooting is a breeze using the wii remote, and the game is full of non-stop action. The only flaws with this game are the texture details of the character models, and the extremely bizarre story, and while the game is quite short, online leaderboards should increase the replay value of the game.. This is a hardcore game. Anyone who gives this less than a perfect score should go and play Wii Music in the meantime. S&P:SS is full of fast paced action, that mixes tense gunplay with swordfights, in a flawless ""on rails"" experience (the game is not ENTIRELY on rails, the boss fights turn arenas into full areas, and you're always able to control your character's position). This game was the one reason I held onto my Wii after Super Smash Bros Brawl, and any hardcore gamer with a Wii (oxymoron, I know) is doing themselves a disservice by not playing this game. S&P:SS also contains some of the greatest boss fights of all time, and as soon as the credits roll, you'll be blown away at the sheer depth behind the game you just played. It may be 3-5 hours long, but has a high replay value, and the leaderboards are a nice feature (I ranked 16th place in the full game, easy leaderboard). The graphics aren't anything to write home about in this HD era, but remember, this is the Wii. The sheer art direction behind this game is only rivaled by a set few on the Wii. All in all, this is a great package, but one that most casual wii owners (the majority of them) will not enjoy.. Sin and Punishment: Star Successor is the sequel to cult legend Sin and Punishment, an N64 game that never got released outside of Japan during the N64 era. Despite not being released outside of the Japan the original Sin and Punishment is often on top 10 N64 game lists and is highly influential for shooting games. S&P2 happens years after the original S&P starring Isa, the son of Airan, and Saki from the first in as he tries to escape Earth with a strange alien girl with a cat tail called Kachi who the ""Creators"" dislike and send the Nebulox, an elite military group after them and.... Needless to say the story is just bat **** insane and makes little or no sense and only provides a reason to visit far out locations and make the last level epic beyond imagination. Since the story is paper thin the game relies on the game play to draw the players in. The original Sin and Punishment was full of insane gun battles, twisting levels, tough bosses and more. S&P2 ups the ante with even better graphics and game play variety. The goal of the game is to shoot anything that moves. And there's a lot to shoot at. From weird flying eyeballs to robots to giant eels and dolphins to more. The boss battles get switched up, same with perspective. Some bosses rely on you using only your sword/fist, not your gun. While the 50 dollar price might be a little steep for this game, it is an instant cult classic and great for blasting away hoards of whatever moves.. You get your controller, and shoot. Nothing gets in your way when you turn this blast on. Satisfication: Hell yeah! Ready for more: Hell yeah! Overall: Too short! This game ends like as if you finished playing a game of paintball which disappoints me when I had the pleasure of asking for more.. This game is ok i give it a sad 7, i though it was fun i honestly thought it was going to be better than it was but i was toatally wrong oh well. hmmmm. Very cool game for the Wii. Great job using the pointer and the pure rail-shooter goodness really calls me back to games like House of the Dead and LA Machine guns. I've had a lot of fun with this title.. Sin and Punishment 2 is here and it is awesome. Some gamers will not get, what the big deal is about this game. Too bad, this gem will blow right over their heads. I grew up, in the tough gaming age of arcades. The age where if you wanted the best that gaming technology creativity and intensity had to offer, all you need is a pocket full of quarters or tokens. After Burner 2, Space Harrier, Smash TV, House of the Dead; if you wanted something intense that you couldn't get on home consoles, you grabbed 5 bucks and went to the best arcade you could find. Now that spirit of gaming adrenalin, brought to the modern age, is birthed at home from developer TREASURE, in the form of Sin and Punishment Star Successor. Not only is this my favorite Wii game, and my choice for game of the year, but it is a game that embodies why the Wii pointer controls are supreme. I bought the first Sin and Punishment for N64 and it was tough and exciting, but the aiming system using analog took some effort to enjoy. The Wiimote makes aiming the most easy and painless thing to do. That, plus all the added fight moves, character modifications, and increased intense boss battles, seperates this game from being merely a sequel. Graphics are amazing with bump-mapping , specular highlights, art in a style of Castlevania meets Tron, and a story that will leave you knowing there will be a third game. 2 player Co-op was a nice simple touch. Rail shooter/run and gun, this is a one of a kind thrill, and any game that attempts what TREASURE has done to this gaming genre, doesn't even compare. This is the high mark of arcade gaming, no other game will do it better, that's all there is to it, and so sad it may be miss by so many. Pick it up, NOW! See a review vid about Sin and Punishment 2 on my Youtube channel. ****/watch?v=JHxOUpq68iw. I don't get it. This game is okay, but nothing GREAT. It feels like a remake of some 90's game, or arcade you played 20 years ago. Graphic average, music ****, and its the same thing over and over again? This should be a $5 wii virtual game.. One of the most astonishingly insane, fluid, imaginative games of this generation and an absolute joy to play. Treasure understand what games are supposed to be about, and Sin & Punishment 2 shows they are still on top form. The controls are perfect and the action is wild. Treasure's innate creativity doesn't let up from start to finish as they heap on more and more awesomely absurd setpieces, never reusing an idea. One minute you're running along a train detaching its carriages to smack them into a boss. The next minute you're trying to lift up two elevators to keep them out of rising lava. Flying midair swordfights. Onslaughts of giant eels. Fighting a giant monster up a scrolling block maze. A massive mechanical seahorse shapeshifts into a school of killer whales. IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. Who gives a crap about story or graphics?. Just off the bat sin and punishment 2 is one of my favorite games ever, it is fast paced, fun, addictive, and easy to control, sadly that does not mean that it is perfect. sin and punishment is graphics and story are its only flaws, the story make no sense and when anyone speaks it sounds like they purposefully made it funny. The graphics are its second problem, the are fuzzy and look overall bad, but the art design was very good and the graphics had a lot of potential. Sin and punishment also is a very hard, but it wants to be, so you will die possibly 1000+ times a level before you beat it which for me was never annoying because the levels are so much fun. The game also has a addicting multi-player were a second person also shoots, but its not great but its ok. the online leader boards are also a lot of fun, you will spend hours trying to beat a high score which will most likely adds another 3 hours to the 6 hour single player. so overall sin and punishment is very close to perfect and everyone should buy it.","Sin and Punishment 2 is a challenging, but very entertaining bullet hell, on rail shooter . the game has a few problems with its oddly lengthy stages and confusing scoring system . the game is available in the wii u shop for a very cheap price and is also a great value for money ."
796.Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain,"This DLC is absolutely worth it. new map with snowing weather and new cars . well done. It's hard to drive with supercars. Great map, so fun to drive on snowy roads, good add one for christmas.. This expansion is no worth the $10 dollars that it costs. It's just a little village on a top of a snowing mountain. The DLC includes some cars, but the best cars are restricted for those who have the money to buy the tokens for FH3 micro transactions.. Another really good forza expansion, great graphics, lots of gameplay, its more of a massive expansion to the forza horizon game than a simple add on, if you have the main game, this expansion is really worth the price. Beautiful graphics and great gameplay, it was the best racing game released in recent times, simply amazing, the riding is fantastic and very fluid, the cars are beautiful and very fast, many beautiful scenery and beautiful music.. I'm not going to lie, this is a very big disappointment for me. The expansion is expensive and the amount of races is not satisfying (not mentioning around 8 whole new cars that has been added, heh). The new modes are simple sprints that go off or on the hill, nothing special about it (in comparison to the modes in The Crew that were different than normal races). The new customization options are non-existent, the only one is to add winter tires and that's it. To progress forward in expansion, it forces you not only to win races, but complete some extra challenge as well. You will need also to complete some of side activities like bucket list challenges, jumps etc. which in normal Forza were completely optional and you weren't forced to do them if you didn't like them (which I actually didn't). While every Forza had problems with balancing the difficulties on different races, this is the worst case. In some races I can get 3 out of 3 possible to achieve stars playing on difficulties like ""Expert"", while on the others I'm struggling to achieve 3 stars playing on the lowest ""New driver"", Many races have barricades with hitboxes that are low detailed, meaning that I often ended up hitting or bouncing the wall that I didn't yet touched. It is really frustrating when you want for example to overtake someone while being really close to a wall. The game has still not working multiplayer in groups, meaning that if you want to play with your friend, it will disconnect one of you from the other about 2 races after you connected so you have to reconnect again. This problem exists from the release of the main game and they still haven't fixed that, but instead, they release expensive expansion which adds really little to the game. Don't bother buying it for it's full price. Actually, I am the owner of Ultimate Edition and bought expansion pass that guarantees access to 2 expansions for 25$ (which is 10$ cheaper from the original price of the expansion pass), so the Blizzard Mountain price for me was around 12,5$ (considering this expansion being half of what expansion pass provides) and I still think that it isn't worth it. Comparing this expansion to Storm Island, first expansion for Forza Horizon 2, which added completely new races(off-road and rally, because Blizzard Mountain added snow races, but those are still rallies). Many new vehicles and customization options for them. It wasn't as bugged as Blizzard Mountain as well. I consider Storm Island to be ten times better than Blizzard Mountain. While I consider Forza Horizon 3 to be the best racing game ever, Blizzard Mountain is definitely an example on how not to do an expansion if you want it to be good.","this expansion is no worth the $10 dollars that it costs . the amount of races is not satisfying . to progress forward in expansion, you will need to complete some extra challenge ."
797.Super Monkey Ball,"I mean its a great game dont get me wrong but the bumpers in extreme difficulty level 4 squeeze my nuts tighter than Tschaikowski's Nutcracker (this is a brainiac, you have to be so smart and cultured to get this reference (or you have seen the barbie film, goated movie btw)). If you haven’t played Super Monkey Ball on the GameCube, so yourself a favour and play Super Monkey Ball on the GameCube.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Though it is quite dated nowadays, Super Monkey Ball has so many tough levels and addictive side modes that you could probably play this game for 24 hours straight and still not cover everything. The best part is that all of the modes are so well executed, It is just a shame how the sequels try to, and fail to, live up to this timeless classic.. A good game that still meets modern expectations, even if the graphics are iffy.. super tight controls and polished design, only for the patient. this game rewards you for fast decision making, in some of the best level progression ever. such a simple concept executed with the grace of swans doing bank robberies.. A highlight of Sega's entrance into third party development and this game shows why they dominated at the time! Can't help but love the charm this game provides. Awesome levels and the difficulty increases perfectly as you go through the game!. My personal rating for ""Super Monkey Ball"" (GC): 6,9/10 - Good Gameplay: 7,5 Video: 3,5 Audio: 7 Scope: 8 Balance: 7 Story: -. This is by far the most underrated game on the GameCube. It's WAY too fun to be overlooked the way it is. I could play this game for hours. There's tons of variety and different game modes, and they don't get stale. You could play them for fun every once in a while and they're also difficult enough to get good at if you want. Speaking of difficulty, the main game has three of them. Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. All of them offer a challenge for their respective audience. Expert, though, might be one of the hardest things to complete in video game history. It's a great party game. I'm talking Mario Kart levels. Super Monkey Ball is the best installment in the franchise, and it's the one I'd use to introduce other people to the franchise. It's a shame Sega basically killed the franchise.. Sega is not only known for Sonic, well for the time but in the early 2000's this series came around. Super Monkey Ball has so much charm and fun gameplay it is probably one of the best Gamecube games.. This game isn't strong on the multiplayer side, but it succeeds in bringing originality and difficulty that makes completing the harder levels very rewarding. I have replayed the Expert Mode so many times and never got tired of the higher worlds are their immersive atmosphere. Crazy hard extra stages, and great soundtrack, too!. Sega has amazing series like sonic and nights into dreams and streets of rage but this one could have been the REAL rival to mario and this game has it all I wanted to see.. Such a refined and polished game. You can tell they thought a lot about every single detail of this really ""hardcore"" game. The ""escalating"" of the level difficulty is really great. The main game is very addictive and it can really make you rage. And if you get tired of it, you also have mini games like bowling, pool or golf. This game is from the era when Amusement Vision made awesome games and the AV on a cover **** was a seal of quality.. This game made me want to get a Gamecube but instead got the PS2. But when i did get this game, I played it nonstop for so long. They really need to make games like they had on the Gamecube again. I miss the fun. I enjoyed so much this game. It's pretty fun (SEGA style) With friends is marvellous. If you like simple fun, simple gameplay and laught with friends... buy this game.",this is the most underrated game on the GameCube . it's WAY too fun to be overlooked the way it is . there's tons of variety and different game modes .
8.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3,"this game is a huge milestone for the whole franchise, the soundtrack is amazing, the levels and the gameplay are outstanding and even if you play it 24 years after its release it is still impressive.. My favorite Tony Hawk game - even better than 2! Everything about it is top notch, and is just so fun to play; tough to put down!. IT JUST OK GAME THAT ALL .... maybe because of american and how they like Skater .... but to me it just a normal (cool game for it time )... i give it a 0 because it should be a 6 at best + overrated as f. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 is a total blast, delivering sick skateboarding action that's hard to beat. The game's got killer tricks, awesome levels, and a soundtrack that's straight fire. It's a nostalgic ride to the golden era of skateboarding games, capturing the essence of the sport perfectly. Solid 9/10 – it's a must for any skate game fan!. this game is better than forespoken .................................................. best skateboarding game out there for ps2 and this one.............eeeeeeeeeeeee. This was the game that got me into the PS2. Hard to explain how good it was at the time. For a kid that wasn't really into gaming, I loved this game.. Too good I played a lot of nostalgia this will never be bad, I love it but nothing higher than 8. Chameleon187 Tony Hawk games are great games. You just have terrible taste in games and in life. Idiot. And the rest of you negative haters are losers.. OVERALL - 96% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 5/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 10/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay Value - 9/10 My favourite in the series. Fun throughout, great soundtrack and the in-game videos of the pro skaters in real life inspired me to take up skateboarding. At least until I realised how terrible I was.. Definitely the greatest game of all time imo, feel so blessed and grateful that this game was bought for me and my twin brother when we were 2, never got bored of it and completed the career mode hundreds of times over the 17 years we’ve had it. The level designs are legendary in ALL 9 levels, it deserves all the praise and more. Definitely looking forward to a possible remake soon on PS, if it’s made exactly like the original THPS3, another 97 score will be on the way. Picture Picture **** was developed by Neversoft between the years of 1999 and 2010, there's a very very big chance I have at least 50 hours playing it. In this case, much more so. While I don't have as much Nostalgia for THPS 3 as I do with titles like Tony Hawk's Underground, I still have my fair share of play time with it. When I was a kid, pretty much the only games I extensively played and completed more than once were Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero games, especially the Tony Hawk games of the ps2 era which.. is most of them, this one included. Tony Hawk 3 is a fan favorite of the series and is often regarded as the peak of the franchise. While I respect its improvements and love the game to death, I think there are better efforts out there. The levels aren't as iconic as the previous games and the mechanics aren't as fine tuned as games that came after. It's got a hell of a lot to offer, just not as much as some other games in the same franchise. It's still a fantastic game, there's no doubt whatsoever about that. I beat this game in February of 2020 after beating it many times before.. thats my **** right here. open world game w not really much to do except for vibing. The best in the series in my view, wonderful and can now be played @1440p on pcsx. Sucessful jump to the next generation, skating was prettier than ever before, with some amazing animations and... well, more of the same, really. You might call revert a revolution but for a casual player I don't think it really meant all that much. Personally I liked levels from thps2 more, but its still great game.. Story - n/a Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Levels - 9/10 Replay value - 10/10. My favorite game in the Tony Hawk series. Everything is on point here; the graphics, music, and multi-player, with so much content you could easily spend 30+ hours trying to do everything in THPS3. One of the greatest sports games of all time.. Main evaluation criteria: -Atmosphere: 8 -Graphics and design: 9 -Gameplay: 10 -Sound and Music: 10 -Bugs: 10 -Interface: 9 -Completeness of the world: 10 Аdditional evaluation criteria (Do not really affect the assessment): -Coop in Story mode: 10 -Mods and the ability to change the game: 0 Scores from 1 to 10, the higher the better. This game is so good I don’t care if the graphics are a little out dated that doesn’t mean it’s not an amazing game. Definitely recommend if you have a ps2. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a fantastic game! This game is very fun to play with an awesome career mode and the addition of the Revert. The Revert allows the players to perform massive combos which has became a staple of the series. Levels are once again very well designed. Also, the soundtrack is great with some very iconic tracks. As the first Tony Hawk game I owned, besides the terrible Pro Skater 5, I was very impressed by how great these games once were and I played it for a while. Now, revisiting this game is a lot of fun. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a fantastic sequel!. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. One of the last great skateboarding games of Tony Hawk's franchise. Everything after this started going downhill..... Loads to unlock, great soundtrack, loads of levels, hours and hours on fun. Can be frustrating though.. Tony Hawk games are very overrated. The games do not stand the test of time and do not belong in the top games of all time list.. Dear Critics, you very overhyped this game, this isn't best on the system because Shadow of the Colossus or Final Fantasy X must be on this place. Plus, atmosphere of this game much worse than in THPS2 on Playstation One. Cool graphics and more realistic moves isn't enough for me to call this game the best on Playstation 2.. Very fun and interesting to learn the game. With friends to play this game is a pleasure and secret characters I was very pleased. One of the best parts in the Tony Hawk series and you have to play this part. Probably one of the greatest sports games in gaming history. Tight controls, great music, well designed levels and funny characters. I remember how satisfying it was to take my anger out on the triangle button when I failed a trick.. Now here comes Tony Hawk's legendary skateboarding adventures on your PlayStation 2 wherever PlayStation 2 consoles are sold. Pick this up and join the fun!. After the utter failure **** that came out this year (Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5) I decided to play the original Hawk series to see if the mechanics of the game just hadn't aged well or were simply just outdated. I booted up my PS2 and played this. This game is **** stellar. The music, the level design, the gameplay and the mission structure are amazing. I still love this game even though it's pushing 15 years of age. The controls were so much better than how I remembered. The multiplayer was so much fun to play with my brother and I'll probably play it more this year. The only flaw with this game is that if you're decent enough at the game, you can finish it under 3 hours, making the initial playthrough rather short. Buy this game instead of it's **** 5th installment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An all-timer PS2 game. I can't forget using Darth Maul or Wolverine listening to the soundtrack while I tried to rip off a perfect score run. I feel like this was the peak of the Tony Hawk franchise, and what a peak it was.. Nothing really can compare to this game, can it? Its a masterpiece, and one of the best skating games in terms of gameplay. We'll never see a skating game that'll compare.. THPS3 is definitely my favorite video game of all-time. The Career Mode is once again extraordinary, with bigger and better levels, (except the Suburbia level it wasn't that good of a level for me) the Park Editor is a downright upgrade to the THPS2 version, Create-A-Skater is much more fun to play around with, and much more. Absolutely everything works in this game. Try it, you will not regret it. Guaranteed.. Boring game. All the levels and stages are empty. There is nothing exciting to do. No fun challenge. No interesting gaps. It's a shame for a PS2. Except good quality bonus videos to unlock.... The most excruciatingly boring and annoying game I have ever played in my 27 years to date. I gave my copy to charity but I would have paid someone to take it off my hands.. Yeah, it's great but should it get all teh attention and praise? Not really. I wasn't really playing games when this came out so I don't reallty think I'm one to judge but I played Grand Theft Ayto 3 around this time and even then, when I was 6, it blew me away.. An extremely fun game with lots to do and hours of addiction. The game has many places to skate, including a foundry, suburbs, Los Angeles, and more! Tons of secrets are buried within the depths of THPS3, like locations from the first Pro Skater, and bonus skaters. Hundreds of tricks and even a PARK EDITOR make this game one of my top 5 favorite video games of all time!!. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is even better than the first two games, including twice as much variety in visuals, control, and freedom. Pros: Excellent single-player and multi-player modes; great graphics; solid control with extra combos; some of the best level design on a Tony Hawk game; wacky missions. Cons: A hit-or-miss soundtrack; though it's certainly a step-up from the first two games, Pro Skater 3 doesn't innovate as much as it should've.. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Best Sports Game of all-time.. This game is awesome but it's not all that it's cracked up to **** x box version is superior in this case.There is even added levels in the x box version,listen to your music,better **** of course when it comes down to it it is the same game but the x box cleaned up the little bit of mess it left.. In short Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 is the best sports game i've ever played. The level design is creative yet perfectly aligned for doing combos. The graphics were fantastic at the time. The bonus levels and characters were all amazing, and required huge time sinks to master. Which not not only added so much replay value but was always a blast. Good soundtrack, Fantastic multiplayer. I couldn't even count the hundreds of 10 minute Tag games I played with friends split-screen. What happened to skateboarding games? they're all terrible nowadays","i give it a 0 because it should be a 6 at best + overrated as f . the game's got killer tricks, awesome levels, and a soundtrack that's straight fire . it's a nostalgic ride to the golden era of skateboarding, capturing the essence of the sport perfectly ."
80.Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Metal Gear Solid 3 was already a perfect game. Subsistence takes a perfect product and improves on it.. One of the best games I've played so far, there isn't a single major complaint I have with this version of the game, the camera feels a lot better as you can now appreciate every detail of the scenarios and look around you without any problems of missing anything, the gameplay is very rewarding, the story is intriguing, the bosses feel unique and are very different from each other (especially The End), the codec calls are very entertaining to listen to, the characters are very charismatic and interesting... I could go on for a long time but in short, it's one of those games that you wish you could forget so you could experience it all over again.. This game goes beyond being a masterpiece. It is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time, and I don't think anything will be like it again.. This is objectively one of the greatest games of all time. The story, the gameplay, the characters, I love every aspect of this game. 10/10 please play if you haven'. What a thrill..... all I can say is PLAY THIS, one of if not the best ending in all of gaming with cutscenes galore in Kojima fashion. the best game you can ever play in your entire life, i never cried in a game before Metal Gear Solid 3 **** Eater, one of the best games i've played in years, maybe for my intire life. Pretty good but boring, also knock knock! ""Who's there?"" Cummings! ""Who's cummings?"" And I say: COOMING SOON BLAH BLAH BLAH. Simply the best in the series to date! It brings new gameplay elements and standards to the series and tells finally big boss's story!. 10/10 One of my favourite games on the PS2. Metal Gear Solid 3 was already incredible, but an updated version including additional content and tons of quality of life features? Even better. The gameplay is very Solid, showing a perfect example of what I expected the stealth espionage game genre to continue on with, instead of essentially dying out and letting remakes and ports take the wheel. The difficulty scaling of the game is also great, giving each player an option on how they have played in past or what they would like to play like. The story is the selling point of the game, featuring lengthy cutscenes with incredible voice acting. Being the first game chronologically in the series, anyone interested in the series can dive straight into possibly the best Metal Gear game. Overall, an easy 10/10. It does what previous games did right, expanded upon it, and improved on what they did wrong.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A true masterpiece. Subsistence fixes all of the little issues with Snake Eater, and makes it the definitive version of an already perfect game.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. I AM STIIIIIIILLLL IN A DREEEEEAAAMMM- SNAKE EATERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!. Playing that on the PS2 was something else back in the day. I didn't even understood English, and got hooked either way. Great to see it is finally coming to PC (even if that Konami collection seems kinda lazy). Never has an expansion made a perfect game more perfect. MGS3 is completely timeless. Subsistence more so. It takes a while to get used to but after that no other shooter will do. Played it first time 2 years ago and now can’t play anything but Metal Gear. Will I ever find a game better? (Apart from Gran Turismo 4 naturally). This updated re-release of ""Snake Eater"" could've been named ""The Ultimate Edition"". Konami added a number of improvements (including a better camera), bonus items and fully-fleshed out online modes. In a way, this was even better than ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance"" which also included a slew of new material. A must have for fans of the original MGS 3 game. It's too bad the online multiplayer games only lasted a year. I would rate this with a 10 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite Metal Gear Solid and my fourth favorite game of all time. They took a nearly perfect video game and made it even better.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. Amazing game amazing story amazing characters amazing gameplay amazing soundtrack amazing stealth amazing bosses = MASTERPIECE THANKS HIDEO KOJIMMMMA. I first bought MGS3: Snake eater after renting it about forty times because I loved it so much. Than for my birthday last year I bought Subsistance and fell even more in love. The only thing that ever bothered me about Snake Eater was the camera but I got used to it. Then Subsistance made it the best ever. This game had one of the greatest stories of any game ever and the best replay value by far. Plus the different ways to take on a situation keep the game play fresh. The boss battle are creative with several different strategies to take them out. (Unless your one of those speed gamers who just rushes through them) With magnificent graphics,(I have an Xbox 360 and this game still impressesme) and amazing action/stealth game play, this game is truly unique. The game designers clearly worked hard to study how the guns work because there only a few errors in total. Nothing beats the feeling of taking out 8 guards with your Colt M1911A1 and get eight head shots without alerting anyone. This game is so amazing, that I can't imagine how good MGS4 will be. I'd give this game a 100/10!!!! As many say that ""The Godfather"" is the movie to end all movies, This game is the game to end all games.....Bravo Hideo Kojima, another masterpiece.. This is more than just a game. It's an experience. A great game to get into the Metal Gear Solid series. MGS3 has some of the best written characters and dialogue in anything I've ever watched or played, and has some of the best, and most challenging, gameplay in any stealth game. The bosses are perfect, the level design is great. There is so much detail in every room it's wild. It is without a doubt my favorite Metal Gear game, and probably my favorite stealth game.. this game is the worst evar!!, there is no first person cardboard boxing. kojima was mad because of this review.... Best game hands down. I find myself playing this game over and over... there's a certain vibe to the game , you can tell that the game is well made .Deserves every positive review. I got no complain ... It was so well made that I think the game was too short. This game made me love the MGS franchise.. The definitive, rectified version of one of the greatest games of all time. ***** (5.00). Still the magnum opus of MGS series with its cinematic ending. The game had both the best shining qualities and the worst flaws of Hideo. From my viewpoint this is the best Metal Gear Solid game in the series, The gameplay and graphics from the PS2 is just amazing the boss fights are some of the best in the series, and a boss fight against the End is one of my favorites, I finished it 2 times In 2 days I got all the clothes the first time and I got the Peace Walker trophy the second time, I cannot recommend this game enough. OVERALL - 99% Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics (for time) - 10/10 Story - 10/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 9/10 I think this might be my favourite game of all time. It's the best beginning to the Metal Gear series I could have asked for. It pulls all the characters and storylines together and like all MGS games there was a lot of care put into the gameplay elements to make this as realistic as a game has ever been. Even now the injury system, stamina bar and the way camo system works makes the game feel possibly the most real action/adventure game there has been.. Metal Gear Solid 3 is an absolute masterpiece, I'm not gonna beat around the bush and I'll keep it short. This was the first Metal Gear I ever beat and back then I felt as if it was the greatest video game of all time. Do I agree with that still? I don't know. Does it matter? What matters is, as far as I'm concerned, this game is basically perfect. The only sequence in MGS 3 that I didn't have much fun was the escape on the bike. I'm mostly not a fan of forced combat in Metal Gear games and this sequence went on for way too long in my opinion. Other than that, I had such a fun time playing through this game both times. The variety in the gameplay is really what gets me. There are ALWAYS multiple ways to get from point A to point B. The vast attention to detail allows for play styles that just aren't possible with any other stealth games. The campy James Bond nature of the story is also a huge plus, dumping most sequel baggage for the sake of easy to understand entertainment. I'm very happy Kojima didn't stop after MGS2, despite the fact that he easily could've. Like I said, it doesn't matter to me what the greatest game of all time is... but I definitely wouldn't argue with you if you said it was MGS3. I beat this game in January of 2014 and December of 2019.. Probably the fan favorite in this beloved series, and I can see why. This game is incredibly well done, from its characters, graphics, to gameplay and cinematics. For a prequel, it's absolutely amazing. I personally don't prefer prequels but this is a fantastic example on how to do them. That being said this is not my fav MGS game. But that doesn't mean it isn't a fantastic game. I adore it. The BOSS ♡. The definitive experience of what makes a fine piece of art. Not the simple one. The greatest and reflective of the best o f what a expression of art can bring.. 10/10? A masterpiece? Best game ever? Who's everyone rating this game like it's a masterpiece? To me it's mediocre. It has its peaks. Sometimes it's enjoyable. But as others have said it has too many poor design choices to be good or above that. There's nothing special here. Story is just cliché Stealth TPS with boring conversations adding nothing to the main plot. Combat is mostly unbalanced. Enemies are either too easy or suicide level challenging. It's painfully obvious how the developers made soldiers almost impossible to kill to force people into fighting monsters, so reviews wouldn't say ""It's like Goldeneye 007."" Mission payouts are close to 0. What you're gonna do with 50 Coins? Might as well loot everything and sell that for better profit. Perhaps you earn more later. I might figure that out some day. There's alot potential here. The design of the world is impressively detailed (especially rural locations), but that's pretty much the only impressive aspect. Back to my question. Who's everyone rating this game like it's a masterpiece? I know who. It's kids who aren't old enough to know the true masterpieces of gaming, and those who love it just because of the genre of setting and/or gameplay. To me it's nowhere close masterpieces such as My fav cuz im smart. I mean... masterpieces such as my fav cuz im smart. Having never played Metal Gear Solid properly(only tried MGS1 as a kid), I wanted to see what all the fuss is about. And since this is chronologically the 1st game in the story, I started with this. Sadly, too much focus on stealth, it seems. Not sure if I can knock the game for that, since it's supposed to be a stealth game? Although not being able to pick up enemy weapons doesn't make sense. And the trial and error gets kinda dull, when you get spotted and a small army of enemies comes down on you, and you have nothing to defend yourself with, forcing you to just start over, because it gets pretty stupid and silly at that point. You start the game with only a knife and tranquilizer gun for attacking, and have to spend a pretty a long time like that, it seems. Having so much health, even on HARD difficulty, is also pretty weird. I think you have to repeatedly get hit for well over a minute to die. If this is HARD, I wonder what the lower difficulties are like... Snake's voice acting is also a bit overdone. Can't tell if his sarcastic or something every time he talks.. Best game ever made. This is the only ""old"" game I can still go back to and enjoy it. Every aspect is masterfully crafted. Gameplay is fun and story is entertaining and meaningful. Its only flaw is that they closed down the servers for MGO1.. Just finished this masterpiece, everything in this game is great. There are only 2 problems: you can't pause the game during cutscene and story sometimes too complicated, but who cares? it's entertaining and interesting to follow so maybe that's not that big problem to worry about. Kodjima is indeed a ""genius"", this game is still big even for 2020.. This game is kinda difficult to get into at first with its long cut scenes and strange controls I've played the game before but every time i come back the controls throw me for a loop but once you come accustomed to the controls you really get into the game. Sneaking around listening to dialogue and fighting some really fun bosses its a good time i wouldn't call it perfect some **** kinda cryptic the healing systems can get kinda repetitive in the late game and out of all the fights the Volgin one still pisses me off personally and really id say the game isn't for everyone i mean no game is but whatever the game is still great and is something you should really give a try for your self if you haven't played it yet just give it some time at least until the first boss.. Literally the best game on the PS2. Great graphics for the time, excellent plot, smooth controls and innovative mechanics. If you haven´t played this game yet do it right now, it barely aged as crazy as that may sound. Hideo Kojima is a mastermind.. Favourite game of all time. Fun stealth gameplay, one of the greatest yet wackiest videogame stories I've ever played, extremely creative and interesting bosses as well as the greatest video game theme of all time. This is a must play.. This game is really exciting and the story has you trying to guess whats gonna happen next and then surprises you.. A milestone for gaming! Without a doubt, this has some of the best story-telling I have ever come across to in anything.. Legendary game, play it, this game changed my life for good, all I have for this game is LOVE.. Metal Gear Solid 3 is my favorite Metal Gear game. It takes every idea from MGS2 and expands upon them, while adding a plethora of new ideas as well. One of the newest and best mechanics added to MGS3 is the camouflage system, which was utilized in almost every other Metal Gear game after. The camouflage makes the stealth feel incredible, and the best in the Metal Gear series. The camouflage indicator tells you how much you blend in each environment, like if your in a grassy area, wear the Flecktarn camouflage, and the Woodland face camo, and you will be practically invisible to the guards around you. Take into account that the version i'm reviewing is MGS3 Subsistence, (not the original Snake Eater) because of the top down view in the original. The version i recommend you play is either Subsistence or MGS3 HD edition, where in both games you can toggle between Subsistence camera, and Snake Eater camera. One of my favorite things about MGS3 is the freedom of gameplay. The gameplay isn't as good as MGS5 or even MGS4, but the jungle setting of Snake Eater offers up a huge stealth playground, you can scare guards off with beehives, you can sneak up behind guards and interrogate them to get a lay of the land. Nowadays this doesn't seem impressive because of MGS5's incredible gameplay. But Snake Eater was the first game to do this and acted as gateway for the rest of the series gameplay advances. Snake Eater was also the first MGS game to implement CQC. I love CQC, especially the one were you throw enemies to the ground, and is a great way to get out of a tight spot. The music is also really solid and completely fits the jungle setting , usually though no music plays, and you just listen to the sounds of the wilderness around you. MGS3 also has some of the best boss fights in any metal gear game, and there are so many ways to beat the bosses. The Ocelot fight, you can shoot the beehives in the trees, and leave him open for a few shots, you can wait for him to reload and shoot him then, you could shoot his hat, etc. Some of the best boss fights are Ocelot, The Fear, The End, Volgin, and The Boss. With the Fear you can use the Fake Death Pill, wait for him to turn around, throw a stun grenade, and shoot him down with an AK-47, or you could equip the thermal goggles, and shoot him on the trees. During The Boss' fight you could equip the thermal goggles and shoot her with the sniper rifle, or you could use my preferred method (the stamina kill) and get with some well timed CQC, stun grenade hits, and MK22 shots. My personal favorite boss though, and one of the best in the entire Metal Gear series. You could kill him early on with the SVD in Ponizovje Warehouse: Exterior, you can set your console clock forward 1 week, you can shoot his parrot which will give you an opportunity to shoot (i could be wrong, i've never tried this method), or you can have an actual fight, sneaking up behind him, following his footprints, listening to the parrot, the fight is incredible. And that's what the game is, and artistic and technical masterpiece. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but the story is incredible and probably my favorite in the whole series, mainly its the most linear and easy to follow. MGS1 and MGS2 have great stories, but most of the time i get lost when they incorporate current events, government conspiracies, it just gets really messy, MGS3 has a story that;'s easy to follow, and easy to enjoy. The characters are great, and respond to each other incredible well. The relationship between Snake and Eva is great and you genuinely feel bad when either of them get hurt. The relationship between Snake and The Boss though is where the game really shines, and the ending of the game is one of the best in video game history. Even if you don't like the Metal gear series there is just always something to enjoy in this game and i can't recommend it enough. I give this game, a 10 out of 10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Metal Gear Solid 3 is one of the greatest games in the action genre. Why?! What truly makes this the greatest game out of the Metal Gear Solid series? Here is a list. -Intriguing plot about spys, superpowers and saving the world -A perfected action/stealth combat system that encourages reconnaissance or blind aggression. -Lots of gadgets, firepower and multiple ways to use those items -Cool ways to hide and blend into buildings and the environment. -Cool and crazy characters that are interesting or disturbing, which gives the game a James Bond kind of feel. -Lots of entertaining moments, cool cutscenes and dialogue. -Snake is just badass -But can be a dork sometimes -Environments are lush and full of life -Boss fights are challenging and will test skills in so many ways. Sure, some of these apply to other entries, MGS3 does it PERFECTLY and will have you hooked. If you are new to the series, you can start with MGS1 or THIS, aren't any direct references or spoilers to the first entry in the Metal Gear Solid series, as this is a PREQUEL. A must play, without question. MGS3 does have a bit of a learning curve for novices, but after you've learned the ropes, you're good.. Perfect in every way from it's gripping and emotional story, to it's humor, to it's stealth/action. One of the hardest games ever to forget and that ending, oh that ending. 10/10 pretty much perfect. Perfect, just absolutely **** PERFECT, the rest of this review's just so i can get 150 characters in and it's working pretty well. Anyway, play MGS3 any way you can, it's amazing.. Now this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. 11 years later and it's still the game to beat, MGS3 is a nearly perfect game and nothing's ever come close to me. If you haven't played it yet play it now.. Arguably the best Metal Gear Solid game. I can remember each time I beat it. Maybe I'll play it again soon! Go find some Calorie Mates! ;) ;) ;) ;) ;). not only is this the best metal gear game of all time,not only is it the best stealth game of all time not only does it have the best video game character of all time but its 1 of the greatest games of all time and my personal favorite. This game is fantastic. There's just no stopping it. Easily one of my favourite games of all time. Before Ocarina of Time fans come yelling at me, yes, I have played it. I've beaten the 3DS remaster. This game trumps OoT. First off, let me just say how awestruck I was when I played this game to find these visuals on my PS2. It was incredible; lush foliage, beautiful character models and really nice post processing effects that really enhanced the lighting and other effects. For gameplay, I've always been a fan of stealth games but Splinter Cell aside, I hadn't really played any. Subsistence was my first dive into the Metal Gear series, and I don't regret it. The controls are clunky at first and a bit unorthodox, yes, but you get used to them fairly quickly, although I will admit the button sensitive interrogations/CQC gets annoying at times. Again, a fantastic game. The characters are engaging and the story is gripping, and I was blown away at how well written the game was. At the final scene (no spoilers here), I waited ages until I finally ""finished it off"" (people who finished the game will know what I mean). I'm playing this game in 2016 and I think it looks great; that is a true testament to how well this has aged. My only complaint with the game is that it felt like it was all over too quickly, and that's more of a compliment than anything. Phenomenal experience, would recommend any day.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is best PS2 game . This game better than GTA SanAndreas ! This is 2006 game . In this game good storyline and this game best in MGS series . Unlike MGS 3 Snake Eater in this game free camera. Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence is a very good re-release of an already perfect game. Subsistence adds Metal Gear Online, a new online feature for MGS3, and a very good one at that. The online mode requires skill, patience, and most of all, not to run around like an idiot spraying bullets all across the map, because if you do that, you'll be killed pretty quickly. Subsistence also comes with the original Metal Gears. Metal Gear, and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which are prequels to MGS1. They play pretty well on the PS2, and they add more playtime to Subsistence. If you already have Snakeater, only buy this if you're totally desperate to play MG1 and MG2:SS. But If you don't own Snakeater, you should pick this game up.. Anybody who says a perfect game doesn't exist obviously hasn't played Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. This game is one of the best stealth games ever made. Along with one of the best games ever made. The story of Virtuous Mission and Operation: Snake Eater will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The ending of Metal Gear Solid 3 is very satisfying and leaves you begging for more. The boss fights are difficult, fun and exciting. There wasn't a bland section of this game. This game is perfect.. The best version **** game. Metal Gear Solid 3 takes a much simpler approach to storytelling than MGS2's infamously difficult to follow storyline and instead provides fans with a homage to classic spy & action films. Set in the 1960's you play as Naked Snake, the man who would later go on to become Big Boss, father to Solid, Liquid and Solidus Snake and the central antagonist of the Metal Gear franchise. Sent in to a Soviet controlled jungle, Snake is tasked with killing his former master The Boss and the terrorist group she is leading. It's a very simple story in comparison to most Metal Gear games and also one of the most intimate, taking an in depth look at Naked Snake as a human being and what it is like to be told that you must kill the only person you have ever had an emotional connection to. Subsistence, unlike the original release of Snake Eater, has a independently controlled camera fixed behind Snake as opposed to the usual MGS fixed camera. This was absolutely vital to MGS3 as the game suffered without it, creating a frustrating experience rather than a challenging stealth game. You must kill wildlife to survive, use camo to hide against advanced enemy A.I and conserve ammunition as supplies are limited. It's as much of a survival game as it is a stealth action game. For many it's the highlight of the franchise, but for me it's too unlike the previous games with a story that despite being well written just doesn't break new ground like the previous two titles did. An amazing stealth game and a must play for gaming aficionado's.. My favorite game to date. Such an absolutely amazing story, and the characters are memorable. The controls may have been confusing to say the least, but you get used to it. The boss battles are so creative! The Pain is a guy who controls bees and attacks you with them! The Fear is a guy who crawls around trees and goes invisible. The Sorrow is literally a nightmare. The End is an epic sniper duel in a large area, with more than one way of beating him. The Pain is an astronaut with a flame thrower for some reason. And that's not all! All the weird stuff in this game, but you just naturally don't question it. The soundtrack, oh my god, the soundtrack is amazing. 10/10, best game ever made.. Tier 2 + Most well-rounded of the franchise to this point in terms of gameplay + Cool rewards for completionist gameplay + Fun and entertaining additions to the universe of the franchise ? Food hunting minigame might be considered tedious - Level design is less engaging, most areas involve the same gameplay (take down 2 to 5 enemies, move on to next area) - Still doesn't control that well, even with improved camera control -- first-person gameplay not that great. The original MGS 3 was already an amazing game; however, the added camera made this version of MGS 3 easily the best version. The story is superb and the gameplay, while archaic in some ways (having to open the menu constantly got a little tedious), is deep and fun. While MGS 2 to me seemed a little bland and the story too convoluted, MGS 3 manages to portray and wonderful story in a wonderful setting. The forests of Russia add some color that MGS 2 unfortunately lacked. MGS 3: Subsistence is easily the best MGS game out there. A must buy and easily a 10/10.. The gameplay is fluid and the graphics are some of the best the Playstation 2 has to offer. The plot doesn't break any new ground the way MGS1 and MGS2 did, but it is still an excellent narrative in it's own right. This game is wonderful.. My best game in the series. it does everything right like MGS1 did but with better graphics and more gameplay options. some may moan about this games controls but the first games were clumsy as well. but this version includes a 3D camera which makes the experience better. This game also had more gameplay then the others in the series too.. This game...I really don't know what else to say but wow.EPIC! Graphics are really good,maybe blurry but ok I really enjoyed the story and this game is EMOTIONAL 0-100!!! This game teaches all the bad things about war and history of wars on this planet.I am really speechless when I take a look at this game or play it.Ladies and gentleman,one of the greatest games of all time,Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence!. Simply one of the best games of all time. Fantastic story, near perfect cast of characters, top of the line voice acting, un-paralleled cinematography, some of the best graphics on PS2 hardware and tolerable stealth mechanics instantly turn ""Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater: into a classic. It's one of the most thought provoking games out there, almost demanding a emotional response from the player. You will never forget ""MGS3"".. As a person who desired to play the Metal Gear series, many claimed that the best game in the series is Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater. So after buying the HD collection for the Xbox 360 and finished the game nearly twice , Story: The story of Metal Gear Solid follows the CIA agent, Naked Snake, during the 1960’s when the Cold War was ensuing, whom was on a mission to save a Soviet scientist say they may halt the creation of mass weapon of destruction. However it seems as though Naked Snake’s mentor Big Boss has defected and is helping the GRU organization who is attempting to overthrow the current Soviet government. They had managed to capture the Scientist themselves, capture the weapon, and destroy a Soviet research facility, the destruction of the facility led the Soviet government to believe that the U.S was the one who destroyed the facility and has given the U.S a week to prove their innocence by saving the scientist, destroying the weapon, and killing the defected traitor, The Boss. All of which is up to Naked Snake as he must traverse the jungle so he may complete the mission. The story of MGS3 is actually very good but has some severe inconsistencies with it’s tone, luckily you don’t need to play any of the other games in the series considering this is a prequel so this is a perfect starting point for players wanting to play the series. The game is of course, historical fiction, taking place during the Cold War so you may expect to see actual realism taking place. However don’t expect such a thing, the historical context of the plot quickly diminishes and becomes it’s own individual story with it’s own fictional characters and plot, even taking some liberties in terms of things that don’t exist like supernatural characters and events that is taken as normal by the characters. Including many moments that make little sense if you were to apply real world logic. Not to say it’s a bad thing by any stretch, just something to keep in mind for those expecting an accurate historical fiction plot. But what plot there is, is in fact excellent. The large cast of characters both hero or villain were memorable and entertaining, the tension of the situation at hand was great including many fun action set pieces, and the relationship between Naked Snake and Boss, which may be considered the story’s strong point, felt real, which only added to the feelings felt during their final confrontation. While the story is great, a severe issue stops it from being better, it’s inconsistent tone. Though one may think the situation at hand during the story would infact be very serious consistently throughout the entire story, but no. There are far too many bizarre and goofy moments that leave you perplexed on how it’s even there leading the entire story experience to become over the top. One moment you’re given a serious exposition on the destruction of the potential world, and the next moment someone is touching another man’s testicles. Or some ridiculously bad puns made by the villains, or how stupid and pubescent enemy soldiers sound and act like. There are far too many moments like that for the game to be taken 100% seriously which can single handedly ruin the story for some people. Though if you were to ignore it and treat it as it is, as I myself have done, you can get a fantastic story filled with many memorable moments and a solid ending. It just takes ignorance of the previously mentioned out of tune moments of the story. Gameplay: The gameplay may be considered one of the games weakest point, not to say it’s bad, just outdated by today’s standards. But the gameplay has some of the best mechan","metal gear solid 3 is one of the best games i've played on the ps2 . the camera feels a lot better as you can now appreciate every detail of the scenarios . the story is intriguing, the bosses feel unique and are very different from each other ."
800.Minishoot' Adventures,"A fun streamlined, Zelda, metroidvania, and bullet hell filled adventure. None of the genres are pushed to the limit but they compliment each other well in a fulfilling and fleshed out experience.. Outstanding game, truly. It looks like Legend of Zelda from SNES, and plays like the best twin-stick shooter / bullet hell. First game I've been motivated to 100% in 5+ years. The end game content is spectacular, as well as the ""true ending."" Took about ~8ish hours to 100%. For a game with minimal dialogue, that ending HIT.. Played on Steamdeck. It is a pretty good mash-up of bullet hells and classic Zelda. The exploration is great, action is solid, art design is pretty good and the controls are very responsive.. So incredibly fun. Most I’ve enjoyed a game that isn’t a rogue like in a long time!. Very enjoyable adventure. This game is a shooter, metroidvania Zelda-like adventure with very fun combat, amazing map design with many secrets to discover and great visual aesthetics . Very highly recommended.. Amazing game that looks simple on the surface but is designed and balanced perfectly. Relatively short and sweet compared to other similar games (Zelda, Tunic) but 100% worth the price of admission.. I was going to give it an 8 because this game is incredible: Movement is smooth and snappy. Enemies are the exact right amount of bullet-spongey. Bullet-hell sections are very difficult but always manageable with the right technique. Bosses are fun and varied. The world is fun to explore. Tons of collectables that actually change your play meaningfully. It's just a masterclass in genre-blending fun. As I said, I was going to give it an 8 (which to me means it's amazing), but the post-main game content took it to a 9 for me. This is a special game. It reminds me of Tunic or Inscryption in how it has taken old formulas and made them feel fresh and new and exciting. What an enjoyable experience. Big props, dev. Big props.","a fun streamlined, Zelda, metroidvania, and bullet hell filled adventure . it plays like the best twin-stick shooter / bullet hell in 5+ years . first game i've been motivated to 100% in 5+ years ."
801.The Making of Karateka,"Wow. The extent to which Digital Eclipse provides background and historical artifacts on Karateka is impressive, and even borders on going a bit too deep in sections, but you aren’t forced to look at anything you don’t want to. The various ports of Karateka are incredible to play, and it’s great to see the small changes and enhancements between them. The remakes are also very impressive. The remake of Karateka is probably the best version of the game to date. But it’s the remake of Deathbounce that is truly incredible. Digital Eclipse took Jordan’s Deathbounce prototypes, plus the notes he developed over time, and made it into an actual complete fun game to play. The visuals are retro-styled enough and the twin stick shooter controls make it feel like a perfect version of the game. Truly impressive. For any fans of Karateka, or any retro enthusiasts, you have to check this out.. Amazing. This took me back 40 years in such a detailed & structured manner. Remastered & beautiful Karateka. With original & bonus prototype game modes. A full & detailed documentary, history & everything in-between make this such a fantastic package. Like Atari 50 before it. These game/history hybrids are amazing. More please as this is a perfect way to spend a few hours.. WOW! Probably the best game documentation available to date. Class research, preparation in the form of texts, interviews, videos, pictures and documents in very high quality, 3D still images, animations and former first versions (Deathbounce) by Jordan Mechner can be played. There are both published versions (Mac, Atari, C64), NEW versions (2023) and unofficial versions of Karateka to play which are part of the documentation but can also be selected separately. In principle, you can choose different settings such as filters, monitor settings (color, SW, monochrome), etc. in almost all versions of the game, as well as save your game save or change the key assignment! All this is a lot of fun and is hellishly interesting. The only pity is that the subtitles in the interviews are not also available in other languages. This would definitely be an added value and should not be an effort purely from the implementation. It would also have been desirable to be able to play emulations of the Atari ST and IBM versions than to be able to consider them only as screenshots. So the whole thing would have been more rounded. Conclusion: Please give us more of it!! More Making of .... :D","the various ports of Karateka are incredible to play, and it’s great to see the small changes and enhancements between them . but it’s the remake of Deathbounce that is truly incredible . the visuals are retro-styled enough and the twin stick shooter controls make it feel like a perfect version of the game ."
802.Pinball FX 2: Star Wars Pinball,"I have played all the STar Wars tables and I can confidently say they are all great!! Some may catch your eyes quicker than others, but play them all at least a dozen times to truly get what makes them special, even then a dozen is not enough. The music, animation, table design, etc is all top notch! ... Some complaint about the voices but personally I thought Zen did a great job all around, maybe its because its been a few years since I saw the movies last lol. I've played most, if not all, of the pinball tables available from Pinball FX2. The Star Wars Pinball tables are as fun as I had hoped. Boba Fett is my favorite of the three. Not just because of the character, but because it has a sense of grittiness to its design. ESB is a little difficult to figure out at first, but it has just enough differences from normal tables to make it enjoyable. The only one that doesn't impress me as much as those two is the Clone Wars table. I like the animated series, but I kept wanting to play the other two more. Perhaps I need more time with it. I don't have much more to say since there are free demos for you to try them. I hope that these are successful so that we get to have like Cantina, Dagobah, and Coruscant pinball tables in the future.. As soon as news first struck the gaming feed section of my Lumia phone it was as if I had died and gone to a hybrid heaven of Starwars and pinball. Out of the three stunning tables created by Zen my natural Starwars instincts drew me of course to the Empire Strikes back and as soon as the Lightsaber's pull back spring shot my first ball into the abyss of droids and wampa's I was hooked. For some reason the original voices of the characters lines have been re-done by voice actors, albeit very professionally but to the fellow die hard it's noticeable. All In this is a very fast paced table with a lot of interesting concepts not seen from any other table Zen has to offer. Next on my hit list was the Fett table, and as soon as the game loaded it was distinguishable by it's very long and narrow horse's head shape. Zen have gone for The Return Of The Jedi look and have the sound effects from the film to support the Fetts own table with a lot of emphasis on the Sarlacc pit. As previously mentioned the table is incredibly long which means that some parts look squashed and in certain areas it's hard to see whats happened to your valued ball, None the less it's still a fun table and when the Fett utilizes his grappling hook to save the ball from being lost it screams awesome. The third and final table was left till last due to the Clone Wars not being very high on my radar in recent years, so off the bat this table was not high on my priority list. The table opens up to a very wide and beautifully created area, with an escape pod being deployed upon pull back of your ball, A mini Anakin can be seen responding to where the ball is run and the sound effects are full of Star Wars charm, my one complaint would be the odd Yoda phrase that is spewed out every ten seconds which didn't really seem to make much sense and was not in line with the Yoda we all listened to in the Empire Strikes Back. To sum up all three tables have a lot of what made us all fall for the franchise in the first place Some tables will be liked better than others and this is why for 800 MS points and a bit of supple pinball finger flicking you should just go for it and wonder what's just happened to the last three hours of your life.. Immensely addicting. Perhaps $10 is a little high for just three tables but (a) the tables are a blast (pun intended) and (b) the Star Wars themes are a perfect fit for pinball. This game does for pinball what Pac-Man Championship DX did for, well, Pac-Man.. Being a huge Star Wars and pinball fan, I was sure these tables would be utopia for me. Man, was I wrong. All of the tables are frustratingly fast with table mechanics that delight in flinging the ball at blazing speed either down the middle or corner chutes. Even after reading all the table guides I often was confused as to where I should be trying to go next with the ball. Only Clone Wars does a decent job of not overwhelming you with targets and mini-games. If you want to gnash your teeth in anger while admiring nice Star Wars theming, then go ahead and waste $10.. These are the first FX's tables I've wished were real. They're simply well put together fun tables that play well and make great use of the licence. It's unfortunate they couldn't use real sync voice quotes, but that's the only real criticism, the GFX, music and SFX are all top notch.. As a huge pinball and Star Wars fan I have been looking forward to the release ever since I heard about it weeks ago. Finally I can say whole-heartedly after playing it all morning that I love these tables. A lot of care was taken to give it those subtle touches that pinball tables have always had- from the electric display at the top showing scenes from the movie to the name input being modeled after the carbonite slab display... it is all there. I was geeking out for hours at the love that they have shown the SW franchise as well as great pinball action. It is unfortunate that they couldn't use Harrison's voice from the movies, but the actor still hits it pretty close. My Fav is the Episode V table, closely followed by Boba Fett, and then the Clone Wars. The constant brightness of the lightsabers on the last one I found slightly distracting at times. Finally, I feel that the Pinball Hall of Fame collections have a slightly more true ""Feel"" to the real thing since those are REAL tables. However, as far as designing new beautiful tables that I WISH were real... this is the best you can do. These three tables are worth every penny.","the star wars pinball tables are as fun as I had hoped . the only one that doesn't impress me as much as those two is the Clone Wars table . the music, animation, table design, etc is all top notch ."
803.Spelunky,"One of the most unique games I have ever played. It is a bit like Mario on steroids. Very smart the game changing every time you die so you either have to get good or you are doomed. The are a bunch of fun items and characters to mess around with. The best level for me was the forest level. Jetpack is OP and bombing rules is so much easier and so satisfying when it saves you crossing a floor full of spikes and spiders. One of the hardest rougelikes I have ever played and beaten.. This game is hard,but with so many thing to do,a game that mix lucky with the rage.simply perfect,after watch a gameplay by issacTV(italian youtuber)i love. As a retro games fan, this one hits all the right notes. A friend of mine recommended it, and I can't thank him enough. Sure difficulty is a thing, but I like challenge a lot. It's a platform masterpiece, hard but rewarding. It's not for everyone though. Give it a try if you enjoy retro platformers such as Super Meat Boy etc.. One of the best games of all time. Intricate, insanely difficult, charming, and completely addictive. You'll have nightmares about the run where you got a jetpack and a shotgun on at 200m and then that stupid ****ing arrow trap launched you into a piranha plant. BULL****!!! No platform/roguelike game has collected more of my hours (original and modern version combined) and kept me coming back more. No run will ever be the same, and nothing seems to be lacking (other than the loss of the ability to chuck arrows into walls [woe is me]). I absolutely cannot wait to see what Derek Yu comes up with next, as this was an absolute masterpiece. I do wish there were more minibosses or goals to go along with the game (yes, I'm familiar with everything that's available in the game and have been to hell) – would be nice to have a better reason to explore outside of the beaten path. Again, one of the best games of all time. Well done, sir.. Okay,Spelunky is an Action-Platformer,where if you are a casual gamer,you have a high chance to not like this **** game is cut up into 4 sections,with 4 areas inside of each ****,if you die,it's back to the beginning. This game is brutal,so brutal it took me over 600 runs to beat it my first **** game does fell very satisfying to complete though,and it has very good stylized and pretty graphics,and the music is awesome.This game also has co-op,and might be fun to play with a friend for a few laughs,and bursts of **** game has even a hidden hard mode,but I won't spoil the ""fun"" in finding **** I guess you could just look it **** game also has an Arena Mode,but playing with bots is very frantic,and might not interest you for very **** game is very fun,but only for the people who like losing a bunch before finishing this game.Casuals will get very frustrated with the game's very tight and responsive controls.This game will test you,and if you are not ready,it will annihilate you,but every death feels as though it was your fault. If you like good music,responsive controls and a game that will destroy you,this is for you.. This game is the type of games that will get bad reviews from some hasty people. Why? Because it is excruciatingly hard. Completing even the first level may seem like an overwhelming challenge at first, but one you'll overcome with patience and practice.Standing only at sixteen (actually twenty) levels before the ''final'' boss, four for each of the worlds, the game may seem like a pretty short and simple platformer, but here comes the twist. Every single time you die (and it will happen, A LOT), you respawn at the very first level of the Mines (1-1), but it is not the same 1-1 you just went through, it is randomly generated like every other level, meaning that in a thousand successful games you would never encounter the same layout twice. In addition to that, a plethore of different enemies. events and items will keep you hooked until you know the ins and outs of everything Spelunky and you can reliably (or almost) kill Olmec on most runs. The charming art style makes it a pleasure to look at, with every of the 16 characters being unique enough to warrant a little playtime. Couch co-op and deathmatch help extend the already infinite replayability of Spelunky and add a little more chaos and family ruining fun to your spelunking evenings too! Aside from some minor nitpicks, such as bothering multiplayer bugs and the lack of updates compared to other versions of Spelnuky HD, this game is a brilliant masterpiece, and one proof that gameplay still is at the very core of the enjoyment ****, even when there is no story involved, at all. Go and try it, you will die at every trap, but I promise, you will soon be riding Olmec into Hell, collecting every diamond the nefarious ghost can grant you.. The art style is amazing charming, the gameplay is tight and awesome. This is truly the kind of game I'm pretty sure I used to dream about when I was a kid playing the NES. It's different everytime, it rewards patience and caution, and when you start to make it to later levels you really get a sense that your skill has grown. The multiplayer is mayhem, and it's absolutely fun working with your friends to survive the depths!. A 2d platformer the aim of Spelunky is simply to make it to the bottom of each stage. Of course things are not quite that simple and the game will very quickly begin to throw all manner of enemies and challenges your way. Fortunately the controls are excellent meaning deaths always feel like they’re your fault rather than the fault of the game. What will put some people off however is the level of difficulty. Much like platformers from the 8-bit era and earlier every time you die in Spelunky you have to start right from the beginning again. The fact that the levels are randomly generated each time does go some way to mitigating any frustration this may cause, particularly early on in proceedings, but many people will feel the game crosses the line from challenging into downright unfair as it progresses. Still I’d recommend to anyone to give Spelunky a try for themselves.. I loved this game so much when I bought it, I feel it was worth buying. It's frustrating at times but it's addicting just trying to make it further and further, the addition of shortcuts/tunnels in this game were a great idea, sometimes it's hard to make it through levels and it would have **** having to start from the beginning. Great game.. the best rogue-like on the 360, the dungeon randomizes everytime you play, enemy encounteres are always varied and unique, and so many secrets to be found like going inside of a worm, castle, black market that you'll always find something new. this game is the crowning achievement of ""just one more time"" syndrom. ive spent 2hrs playing this game, saying ""just one more"" time after i die.. Nice clean visuals that may look childish, but it hides a devilish hard game. Addictive and fun in coop with ""accidents"" of knocking you're friends in to lava.. I have put countless hours into this game since release. Each time I play I learn something new, and there is an incredible amount of depth and nuance to the gameplay. While there are some systematic problems with the game (such as the randomized nature resulting in the very occasional cheap death), I have fallen in love with Spelunky. If you are a patient gamer who loves to get personal with every facet **** (and recieve great rewards for doing so), pick this game up. I did on release day, and haven't stopped playing since.. Spelunky is singly the most frustrating game I have ever played, yet this somehow only adds to the sense of satisfaction when you finally edge a single level further than the time before. If you go into this game expecting the classic 2D platformer that you can breeze through and complete with ease, then you. Spelunky is a fantastic and fun platformer. Be warn it is hard, and there will be plenty of dying. Old school gamers will feel right at home playing such a difficult game. Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Mario etc. were all very hard. But their gameplay revolve around trial and error. Spelunky revolves around learning the game mechanics. There is no trial and error because every stage is randomly generated and each playthrough is unique. You progressively get better and when you complete the game, it is an accomplishment. It is a deep intrinsic game and you are guaranteed to come back even after dying dozens of time. Every death is the player's fault and that is what makes the game so great. It is not ""cheap"" in the traditional sense. It is very hard but fair. The controls are very responsive. It might kill you the first few times but after learning the core mechanics, you'll never fight against it. Multiplayer is great fun. Coop is just a mess of fun, with friends killing and sabotaging each other while trying to reach the end of a stage. Deathmatch is chaotic with bombs flying everywhere and plenty of wtf death. It's shallow but great for a quick laugh. I wish there was online coop play, split screen multiplayer, and an online coop leaderboard. Why omit a leaderboard for cooperative play, I'll never know. Despite these cons, the game is still a blast. 1200 msp seems a bit steep but fans of the platforming genre own it to themselves to check out this game. For everyone else, give it a try before buying. I'm sure many of you will agree this game is a hidden gem among the xbla library.. I exaggerated on my last review of this game. It is a great game, the game play is good, the visual is incredible, the history is simple, the enemies are awesome. But the game has some problems that is hard not to notice, such as: when in multiplayer, only the first player can buy things and the camera is focused on him; when you die, you start all over again; sometimes, 5 lives is not enough, some enemies and traps take more than 1 life of you, and there's nothing on the levels to regenerate a life; when you get hit by something, you stay too much time unconscious and in this little frame of time, someone or something can kill you.. Excellent game that rewards and punishes appropriately. All your actions have risk / rewards and the sense of adventure feels so real. The controls may be tricky at the beginning but after awhile you will realise that they are ingenius. I'm not a fan of 2d platformers but this game is one hell of an exception.. I wasn't expecting a lot from this game when I first heard about it. Sure I love retro-gaming and this one looks like a refurbished game from the eigthies (which it actually is). First time I tried it, looks particularly hard, because I kept dying over and over again. Sometimes I could die in less that 15 seconds. Could be frustrating to some, but for me it was challenging. As in Super meat boy you have to retry many times before getting the hang of it, but when you reach a new randomize level, it's very rewarding. I have yet to finish the game but I won't give up until I do. I would recommend this game to everybody who is willing to put some effort in game. As far as I'm concerned, Spelunky is the best XBLA game since Super Meat Boy, hands down !. Rad game, but I really wish you could keep your stuff when you died. The randomness is what sells the game for me. It seems like anything could pop up in the game. Easy deaths are never cheap, but make me feel like a moron.. Though Spelunky's price of 1200points may seem steep for what seems like a re-port of an old classic, but the game speaks for its self. The addition of the co-op mode is worth the 1200 alone. The other user reviews are correct, if you dont like this game it is probably to hard for you, and the frustration factor will turn you off. If you are a gamer like me, however, this is the kind of challenging game you strive for in this world of CoDs and Gears of Wars where with every death there is a close by checkpoint and almost no sense of real danger. There is no mindless killing set to a direct path in Spelunky, a trait that has been all but lost on the new age of gaming and is a breath of fresh air for the XBLA. There was a reason we all spent are allowance every week back in the cartridge days renting these games over and over again never to even come close to beating them. BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS THE FUN. After every time you leave a door to a deeper more difficult stage of the caves, you feel you have ACTUALLY accomplished something, very rare in the modern gaming age where everything is determined by achievements or trophies, which could not produce a MORE hollow feeling of accomplishment. I am a big FPS fan and love all graphical advancements in gaming as much as the next guy, but there is something to be said for a game that can port from 16bits and be this good! Give me a giant machine gun and endless enemies to kill and you dont have to be that creative to make the game entertaining. But with a ""simple"" game like Spelunky, i use quotations because the action and adventure are FAR from simple, you have to create an atmosphere in the game that MAKES it interesting. Trust me your 100th death on stage 1-5 wont cause you to drop the game, and THAT ladies and gentlemen, is a full bodied PERSONAL achievement, not just a ghost of a former accomplishment that xbox has deemed ""An Acheivement""! Those hundred deaths actually feel worth it! But i digress... Controls are smooth as butter. Though it can get extremely frustrating at times, the game was not constructed to be easy. It is definitely aimed at true gamers who have been playing these types of games since the years of nes, snes, genesis, and other similar systems. The frustration is almost what generates the fun aspect of the adventure. What fun is a game with no sense of underlying danger?! In Spelunky you are never more than one or two misplaced jumps away from being sent all the way back to the beginning of the cave to start your adventure again, stripped of everything you may have earned on your way. This sounds like a detrimental aspect of the game, but the beauty of it is that every time you start again you are playing a a totally different game! The levels are all randomly generated every time you enter a door, so there is no grinding repetition of beating the same baddies 50 times over before you finally advance to a new area. This is also where the seemingly overpowering cost of the game fades away. The replay value on spelunky is great, especially since your life is at stake 100% of the time, causing great deal of tension in each stage. All in all: Visual: very impressive for a 16 bit port. Colours are nice, bombs look great and the controls really, really complement the graphical style of the game as everything feels as smooth as it looks. Gameplay: single player and co-op both offer a great experience, have yet to try the deathmatch mode but it looks promising. The tension created by always being seconds from death and a full restart keep the game very exciting and permits a great amount of replay value. Replay Value: Every time you play it is a different experience as the game generates each stage independently and randomly with continuously more grave amounts of danger and pleasing amounts of treasure! Sound: Music is great, sound effects fit the game style could use music more to create tension, but the game is difficult enough to give you that feeling on its own Controls: Easy to learn because the game flows so smoothly, though it will take you time to master your adventurers skills to be a prosperous treasure hunter. IN CONCLUSION: Don't let the price scare you off, Spelunky may look like a cheesy remake of an old-school adventure platformer, but it is far from that. It is a crisp, fun, challenging and, best yet, never ending romp through the creative caves on your quest for the ultimate treasures! IF U ARE A *TRUE* GAMER AND CAN DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL THAT GAMES USED TO BRING US... OR IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE OTHER FRIEND TO HELP YOU ON YOUR QUEST FOR RICHES, GET THIS GAME!... ...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET IT!. risk, reward. these words describe many of the situations that you will encounter in this game. i only have one heart, should i leave safely, or risk trying to save the damsel... or should i try to rob the shopkeeper even though there is a good chance i will die. these situtations occur frequently and they will decide whether you venture far into the journey or be locked in the caves. this game also takes patience... lots of it... also it takes a good amount of skill. sometimes it may take hours of trying to accomplish your goal but that makes the moment of victory all the sweeter. spelunky is not for the feint of heart but if you are determined and patient this game can be a real gem, i highly recommend playing, it truly is another indie victory with the likes of super meat boy and limbo. People who don't like this game is because they think it's too difficult to them... it's a platform game, like the ones we saw in NES and SNES. Like said before, if you don't like ""hard"" games you will hate this one, but if you a real gamer, you will like it, or at least apreciate the work in it, if you don't play it to the end. Like FEZ and other retro games, it frustrate the players who like a ""modern"" and easy game. This game is a masterpiece of retro games, so if you like the style, buy it.. Spelunky is a XBLA game costing 1200MS Points, based on an Indie game that was released for PC in 2008, and consists of a 2D platform game with old-style gameplay, as we saw in 8 and 16 bit consoles. The basic game is the prerogative of an explorer, after an Aztec artifact, which has to go through various underground levels and stages, to the exit of them. The Graphics of the game are simple, but the XBLA version won a updated look, being cleaner and more polished, still maintaining the old-style look, but being attractive, with a more ""lively"" and colorful. Everything else, like Menus keeps the air retro game. The CG animation of the game use to tell the story and have a simple air, but more refined. Audio: songs and voices are simple, but with a good audio, and effects, and voiceovers (in animation) are consistent with the actions and what you see, but still keeping the classic look we see in graphics. Gameplay: here is concentrated the greatest attraction of the game - the game has a series of 14 levels, which should be circulated with controls typical of the old platform games, and using some objects to help walk the galleries and avoid hazards such as spikes, sags and enemies, ranging from the simplest like snakes to advanced ones, like ghosts. You have objects like a rope (to climb up or down from a session), pumps (used to break the floor or walls) and a whip (to break objects or kill enemies), and other items that are being released with the progression in the game (such as jet packs). The Levels has the objective to reach the exit using its limited and scarce resources, and in the meantime, picking up treasures and rescuing characters if you want. You can make your way using the items, or try to cross using pre-established paths, but keeping the retro look, nothing is as easy as it sounds. If you die, you'll be returned to the initial stage of the game, and added to that, we have the fact that the levels are random generated, never a stage will be equal to each other and never the difficulty will be predetermined. Summary: the game is a very good classic platform game, with a retro air, but it presents a difficulty that may disappoint many people, but to please players who like games more hardcore platform games - the price is a little salty, 800ms points would be better.. The cool thing about Spelunky is its randomly generated levels so that you have a different experience every time you play. The platforming itself is well done and the controls are very responsive. I have yet to die and blame it on the game. But dying is so easy. One careless mistake and it's game over. You have to be constantly aware of your surroundings and plan your every move. There's also a shop in random levels. I initially liked the idea of how you could rob the shopkeeper and have him hunt you down for all future levels to come, but unfortunately this idea was executed terribly. The shopkeeper acts as though you just slaughtered his whole family and bounces around the place like an idiot firing his shotgun the second he sees you. There's also a time limit on each level, forcing you to act quickly and make hasty decisions. The graphics are very nice and the audio compliments. Lots of replay value. If you have any interest whatsoever, I highly recommend downloading the demo on XBLA, as it offers a very deep experience for a trial.. Got the game based on reviews. Liked the game itself, but found it a bit too difficult for my tastes. There is a fine line between challenging and frustrating. I'd recommend the game to people who enjoy intense puzzle-solving mechanics. Certainly worth downloading the demo!. You have to know what you're in for with this game to enjoy it. If you do, it's a masterpiece, one of the best examples of a small-but-oh-so-fun arcadey experience which is infinitely replayable and deep. Other reviewers obviously don't know what they're in for. A couple of hints: i) after the tutorial, every level is randomly generated EVERY TIME you play it. You can't learn the levels like other games: you have to be actually good at PLAYING it, it requires skill and practice to get better and learn how to deal with issues. ii) It's goddamn unforgiving. Hand in hand with point i), this game will take you apart repeatedly until you learn to do things like: avoid running under spiders, drop things in front of arrow traps, save ropes and bombs more than money, GET THE CLIMBING GLOVES AS FAST AS YOU CAN, stay the damn hell out of a yeti's armreach... And so on. It's wonderfully deep and infinitely new and fresh. GET IT AND ENJOY IT, FOLKS. (The only issues I've noted are very, very rare bugs and... That's it. It's great stuff, and I haven't even tried 4-player splitscreen co-op, which sounds incredible).. I've played this game for a few hours now, which is not nearly enough to do an in-depth review, but these are my first thoughts. The game is a lot of fun. You really have to learn to be careful or you will die by carelessness. You will die, die again, and then die some more, but with each death you learn a little more about the game, and how to survive. As for the controls, they're very responsive, and I've yet to die because of them. And the graphics are really great as well. It's a crisp HD look that suits the game. So all in all, it looks like a fun game that will take a long time to master. But oddly, I think that's ok.. This is the type of game that will get bad reviews because people don't have the patience to really get what it's all about. Also, if you don't enjoy hard games, you will hate this game. This game is so rewarding because it takes so much planning, concentration and even luck to get through to the end. The controls are great, the items useful and fun, and it has great variety based on the endless iterations of the various levels. If you're up for a challenge and understand that it's going to take you hours to master the gameplay, you're going to love Spelunky, which is undoubtedly the most well-designed and executed game of the year so far.","as a retro games fan, this one hits all the right notes . a friend of mine recommended it, and i can't thank him enough . it's a platform masterpiece, hard but rewarding ."
804.Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Best in the series. Haters gona hate. 10/10. I love this game. This game change my life.. This is the first game of the series that I got acquainted with. I spent more than 300 hours in it. I really liked the atmosphere and the wonderful lore of Souls. Of course, the game design of this game is inferior in many ways to the first and third parts, but still it is one of my favorites in this genre.. Worst game in humanity's existence. If developer thinks that putting 1000 mobs in every location and your weapon breaks literally after 5 hits makes the game difficult, then they better not make games ever again. Compared to the previous two games (Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1) Darks Souls 2 is literally a garbage and must be forgotten by everyone. With Hidetaka not returning to direct the sequel I can see how some could be turned off by this game but don't give up. It's very unappealing in its first hours but if you are able to get through it you will definetely have a good time. Unfortunately it has a lot of dumb enemy placements, sometimes choking you at a point where you have to fight 6 or 7 of them at a time. Get ready to play without the lock on. The game itself is not a problem, but the speed of everything bothers me, especially the recovery speed, I know there is the adaptability thing, but there are several other negative points such as buggy enemies and the life that decreases after the character dies.. very good game very good remaster, changes alot of enemies placements and items in a way that way way way better than the original game, but still has some hitboxes bug that should've be fixed even if you can count on the fingers the enemies that it has bad or not correctly hitboxes it shouldn't has, but overral its way better than the previously old game.. This is just a much worse version of the original. It's a cash grab. Changing enemy positions and adding more of them is cool for a new game plus mode, but not as an entire new game. There are rare instances of improvements such as the lore references added, and the graphics are definitely improved. Other than that though, the level design and enemy placement is just unfun now. This is probably half the reason Dark Souls II gets so much hate, because people played the inferior version.. This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. It takes some work to learn to love, but once it clicks it is spectacular. Dark Souls II means more to me than I can put into words.. ""Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it. But only a true monarch can make such a choice. Very few, indeed, have come even this far. And yet, your journey is far from over. Half-grown Hollow, have you what it takes, truly?"" (Aldia). A good re-release which, although it doesn't improve the serious design problems, offers additions to the plot and improvements to some enemies, as well as including all the expansions released for the game.. The sequel to Dark Souls, another flawed masterwork. As good as the first with some major improvements in equal proportion to the missteps. This is truly another unique experience, one that any fan of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls must play for themselves. It's Demon Souls 3! Or, if you prefer, ""Dark Souls Too"". This is a fraternal twin, closely mirroring the first in many regards while managing to carve out its own identity. A strong entry that has an impeccable art direction, a higher difficulty ceiling and distinct features that any Souls fan will enjoy discovering.. Actually, this game is Elden Ring 0.Mechanics aren`t good as other souls games but has a good world.Also has a very good Majula song. I have never understood the hate for Dark Souls 2. It has its issues and maybe it’s not as good as the other 2 in the series, but it is still a very interesting, and fun game…after all, it is Dark Souls.. This game is so overrated and it **** **** Old ass mechanics and boring start to finish … just some nerds overrating a shiit game. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I feel like Dark Souls II is a tad bit overhated, does it have some additions that are so awful that they've never implemented them again (looking at you ADP), sure. Are some of the bosses in this game either way too easy, or the most unfair crap you'll ever endure in a souls game, sure. But for some reason I still absolutely love this game. I felt like a lot of the areas just felt a lot more moody and interesting than in the original Dark Souls. The level design isn't maybe as intricate as the original but I think Majula as a hub is a lot better, and it also makes up for it by allowing you to fast travel to every bonfire which makes subsequent playthroughs a lot less of a slog. I definitely agree that the first playthrough of the original is a much better experience, but I will argue that subsequent playthroughs are much better in Dark Souls II. There are some things that I absolutely despise in this game, and genuinely baffles me that it made it in, but there is something about this game that genuinely captures me, I can't quite explain it, but it made me unable to stop playing it, the locations and lore are so captivating to me. I should also probably touch upon the DLCs, they are pretty good for the most part. There are 3 DLCs in total bundled with the main game that all offer different locations with various bosses. I actually think the best bosses are found in the DLCs, so they're a step up from the main game in that regard. However one of the DLC does have the absolute worst area that I've probably ever played in a souls game (and I only have Dark Souls III left). This game probably deserves a 7/10 but there is something about it that I just love so much, and also I've become quite a FromSoft simp over the years so there's that. 8/10. First of all, it's not a bad game it's a bad Dark Souls but a good game ! Miyazaki was not in the project and this game could have been worst. The lore and the gameplay still legendaries, however this game is not for all people even more if it is your first Soulsborne (some advices : do not create a random build, look at the wiki and think, analyse movements and patterns). There are weapons and classes for all kind of players. Unfortunately, the level design has changed since the first game, moreover the hitbox is weird and random, even more than Dark souls 1 !!! To finish the DLCs are okay but 1 boss of this game is recycled in a DLC.... Go to boss die, respawn try to go again die on path, respawn try to go again die on path, respawn try to go again die on path. That is DS2. If we don't count that mechanics are bad, how they fumbled that when they have DS1 mechanics. Boss designs are truly bad and unmemorable. Level designs is meh. Art is very good. HP hollow system totally worse mechanic from FromSoftware. If you are not truly Souls-like or lover I don't reccomend this game. DS1 much much better.. Even though this game has fanatic fans, mostly because it's a Souls game from FromSoftware, it's extremely garbage. The game is unpolished on a new level, from the incontinence in dodge and the half-second it takes to block with the shield to the ultra-frozen floor. The poor gameplay is continued to the extremely discussing difficulty, especially in the last levels. Last but not least, the aesthetic of this game is made by people with no taste. 0 is a very bad score, a more realistic one is closer to 2 or 3, but I chose this score because the average score of the game is hilarious. This game is so bad, I try to play it again, and it makes me create a Metacritic account just to leave an actual review and not a delusional one. Don't try it, especially in 2024, just play something else from FromSoftware.. Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, an enhanced edition of the original Dark Souls II, attempts to build upon the renowned formula of its predecessor while introducing fresh content and enhancements. While it offers a satisfyingly challenging experience and an expanded world to explore, the game falls slightly short of the high bar set by its **** of the standout aspects of Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is its formidable difficulty. The game maintains the series' trademark punishing combat, demanding precision and patience from players. It rewards mastery of its mechanics and pushing through trials with a profound sense of accomplishment. The unrelenting nature of the game can be frustrating at times, but it successfully captures the essence of the Dark Souls **** world design in Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin presents a mixed bag. While the environments are still beautifully rendered and have their share of breathtaking moments, they lack the intricate interconnectedness that made the original Dark Souls so captivating. Some areas feel disjointed, leading to a sense of inconsistency and occasional confusion. Additionally, the enemy placement in certain sections can feel overwhelming, bordering on unfair, impairing the overall **** enhanced graphics and updated lighting effects in Scholar of the First Sin bring a noticeable visual improvement over its predecessor. The enhanced presentation further enhances the eerie atmosphere and grim beauty of the world. However, the visual upgrade is not enough to fully mask the shortcomings in level design and occasional technical **** story in Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin strives to weave a compelling narrative within the larger lore of the series. It introduces intriguing new characters and expands upon the themes established in the original game. However, the storytelling lacks the same level of intricacy and subtle nuance as its predecessor, leading to a somewhat shallower narrative experience. Though it offers sufficient lore and world-building, it struggles to reach the same depth and impact as previous entries in the series.Multiplayer functionality remains a significant highlight in Scholar of the First Sin. The ability to engage in jolly cooperation or PvP encounters adds a layer of unpredictability and camaraderie. The online interactions are seamless and further extend the longevity and replayability of the game.. I really like it. although it does not follow the previous game .it is just an experiment to make DS3 and the following games as good as possible.. Oh my lands, this is the best Dark Souls, even better than Dark Souls 2.5 in a half. Hmm was expecting dark soul got two broke the chest???/ why???? enemy not same slowish dont tell me deliberate not sure where go maybe dumb who know. Worst game i ever played, this game is cobstantly trying to upset players with infinite ambushes and unavoidable poison statues. This difficult is artificial, the same mistakes made from souls like not made by From Software. I beat all other souls including the most difficult Sekiro, and i have some experience in this genre. Dark Souls 2 has suffered the missing Myazaky touch and it is absolutely not worth playing. Plus, the plot is really bad compared to DS1 and 3.. Doesn't hold a candle to the rest of FromSoftware's titles but still worth playing.. One of the best games ever made.. Honestly a pretty good game. Not the best Souls game butdefinitely worth playing. DLCs areas are some of the best level design in fromsoft history.. WTF is this!. I know what people say about this game, but give it a try and judge it yourself. I find this one has the best atmosphere of the trilogy. Honestly just play slowly and patiently and you may find its the best of the three for you. worst game in the souls series how can a sequel be this much worse than the original.. huge downgrade from DS 1, but the game is solid and fun, recommended. Dark Souls 2 is a good game, but its the weakest of the series due to odd design choices.. One of the best games ever made. If we Only talk atmosphere alone, this is the Dark Souls to play. Not as good. But still fine.. It's the weakest Fromsoft game, but it's alright. it's fun. This is Dark Souls, but bigger and with more features. And arguably harder in the beginning hours of the game. Somewhat different but it's still Dark Souls, unlike Bloodborne'ish DS III. Even if I said DS I is the best, all DS games are 10/10 top quality products and I don't understand the hate towards this game. The devs went experimental instead of stagnant and did a good job. Don't make adventurousness die in the industry, I don't want soulless AAA's made for money with little originality in them.. Dark Souls was a great game. Of course it had some problems, but it was definitely a near perfect game. Usually, when companies make games like this, they put a number 2 next to it and continue on their way with easy money without changing the components much except the story. But FromSoft didn't follow such a path. They were very innovative in this game. The teleportation system has changed, the power-stance feature has come, the strengthening of weapons has been different. In other words, changes were made in the game. Obviously they tried to improve the game in a good way. Some of these changes are of course very nice, but some of them I definitely didn't like. For example, the new stats added to the game seemed pointless to me. Agility makes sense to some extent, but it definitely hindered the development of the game because it's not a feature, it's a necessity. It's like playing the game on hard mode if you don't have enough ADP. Stats are there to make characters different from each other and this kind of thing is definitely not **** combo of the game has definitely gone backwards. Whereas the first game's combat and fights felt great, this game felt like a regression in a way that I don't understand. I mean, the combat is actually faster, but it feels like the hits are less precise. It feels like the game's kombat doesn't lend itself to this speed boost. Although I can't properly explain why, the game's combat definitely feels awkward and worse than the first game. The game's variety of weapons, and the addition of a new feature called the power stance, are pluses in this regard. The game has a huge catalog of weapons, and the PS allows you to make very different and powerful attacks. In the magic section, they designed some interesting spells, but I think the low number of uses for these spells, even though they don't do much damage, just because they are interesting, has upset those who want to use these spells in the game. I think it would have been much nicer if the number of uses was based on the damage of the spells, not their coolness. Dark spells are the same as spells, you can play with them, but it is debatable how many different spells you can use, and I turned into a dark mage somewhere in the later parts of the game. It didn't feel much different to be honest. I usually played the game with MGS because my spells weren't very enjoyable, and the weapons that made me bonk definitely still making me bonk, there's no problem with **** game has grown. But I don't know how much. Unlike the first game's constantly connected map, in this game we go to different extremes. That's probably why we gained the ability to teleport to every bonfire. I can say that I liked a small part of the places in the game in terms of design. There are a few places where I was impressed by the beauty, there are a few places where I was impressed by the interior design, but I can say that I couldn't see the great design of the previous game in this game. That's the summary of this game. The game is actually pretty good, but the first game was better. The growth of the game didn't help itself. There are a lot of boss fights in the game, but there weren't many bosses that I remember as good, that I had a hard time with. It was more difficult to run back to bosses after dying, which I didn't think was right. In fact, the reason why I was so successful in boss fights was definitely my motivation to walk that path **** game doesn't look that good compared to the year it came out. There were very few places in the game that really stuck in my mind with their characterization and beauty. The soundtrack didn't seem very characteristic to me for some reason. Maybe the game could have been a bit smaller and more refined, but the DLCs were surprisingly good. Aside from the difficulties, I enjoyed the DLCs immensely. Since I'm writing about the DLC version of the game, I didn't want to pass without mentioning it. Also, the story of the game was overshadowed by the size of the game. The story is definitely more understandable in this game. This clearly shows the absence of Miyazaki. Personally, I liked the story, it wasn't bad.Dark Souls 2 is a very good game. They wanted to try the Souls formula with a little innovation, but it wasn't as good as the first game. I haven't played it yet, but I'm sure I'll see a game closer to the first game in the third game.. this is the only 8 from Fromsoftware but I still respect the game and its incredible vision. This is one of my top 10 favorite games of all times. This is one of my top 10 favorite games of all times.. Follows up on a lot of the greatness from the first game but kind of falters at times to deliver the same memorable experience. I think most things about it are good-great, but some of the map designs are a bit of a misstep to me and some of the boss fights could've been better. But overall a fantastic game with great DLC expansions.. After going for all the platinums on Console and also 100% all available Soulsbornekiro-Games on PC I was actually shocked that I spent most playtime in Dark Souls 2 and had to evaluate on this unforseen outcome :D While the game clearly strays from the path of DS1, DS3 and Demon's Souls it actually has an intruiging way of telling its story and a really nice pacing. Are there some boring bosses? Hell yeah! Are the graphics a bit cartoony? Yes they are! But the atmosphere delivered is just amazing, the gameplay is a bit different from the other FS-Games but also super fun. While the vanilla game would only deserve an 8/10 the by now complete game including the 3 DLCs is a straight up 10 of enjoyment.. Worst Souls game and it's not even close. Holy **** they just loved putting a billion enemies in tiny locations just to piss you off. This game's whole purpose is made to piss you off. No other Souls game feels that way. They feel like actual good challenging games. This game is awful and hard for the dumbest reasons ever.. do not waste your time with this piece of crap. it has many bugs and the weirdest hitboxes I have ever seen.. Was my first Dark Souls game on the Xbox 360 and replayed it on PS4. Great edition of an epic game. Overall rating: 8.8.. Not much to say here, incredible game like the rest of the **** world is visually stunning and very interesting to explore. It basically has most food aspects from the other games so obviously it will be great. However, there are some things I want to point out that may deterioriate the experience for some people. Those are: 1)ADP Stat. The game is 10 times harder if you don't increase this. 2)Enemy ganking. In some areas it feels like the place is overflowing with enemies, and strong at that. It feels somewhat unfair. Especially for a new player. Thankfully, there is the mechanic that if you kill an enemy 15 times it stops spawning. 3) The combat feels somewhat slower and the roll happens with a delay. That is due to the fact that you can't cancel attacks, or animations in general. 4) Very easy bosses (excluding DLC). These are the most annoying things, but they really didn't do much to ruin my experience, because I actually appreciated and loved this game on my second playthrough, contrariwise to my first one. Give this game and the series in general a chance. They are masterpieces.. Dark Souls 2 is easily the worst release that From Software has made. Everything in this game feels so forced. Other titles have been more about a fun game that happens to be hard as Ds2 is more hard for the sake of being hard. Like every action you do there is always an ambush. Every boss mechanic feels so over the top and ridiculous. The hole game can be cheesed with Life stones and Agility. The combat feels clunky and horrible compared to every other From Software game. For example if you swing your sword you are stuck in place for half a second before you can roll. Why? You can tell this wasn't the made team that created this game because it plays more like a cheap imitation. Also the game is actually harder if you use lock on. Honestly if you go against your brain telling you to always use lock on you'll find the game way easier. Which is funny cos that's the opposite of every other from soft game. I can imagine Ds2 being really bad for less experienced souls players as right at the start your fighting ambushes of 10 + enemies. And this is when you likely have a bottom tear weapon. Scholar of the 1st sin should have been a proper reword not just a couple minor improvements and random enemy placements. Apperantly the enemy placements are worse but I've not played the original.. As someone who has defeated every boss and completed every aspect of this game, I can ensure that it is still an amazing title, even if it doesn't hold up to other FromSoft titles as far as consistent levels of balance and quality. Controls take some getting used to, several bosses are mediocre or flat-out bad, and the main story isn't as engaging as those of Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Yet the world of Drangleic is huge and sprawling with an incredible hub in Majula. NPCs and covenants are also the best in the series, and there are some great weapons and spells to make for an incredible RPG experience with tons of content.. Pros - solid weapon variety - robust build variety - most interesting NG+ changes the series ever had - one of the clearer overall stories within the series Cons - clunky if you don´t know about the DEX stat (seriously read up on it if you are about to play this game) - even knowing about DEX some of the hitboxes are outright bad - the worst overall boss design within the series (over reliance on ganks) - map design is less inspired than its predecessor As hated as Dark Souls II seems to be in the community, the game is a fine example of an underrated entry within a fantastic franchise. Bunch of the design choices are quite polarizing (the DEX stat, every attribute giving health, the healing system) or outright bad (some of the boss design, hitboxes, overall gankiness of the entire game). However, I genuinely feel like I was undersold on the game which delivers an experience worth it´s asking price. Funny how all the horror stories I heard before playing it made me expect a complete mess, but in the end I got an all right experience. Not as good as the first or third entry but decent by my account. Funny how being underhyped can make you enjoy seemingly mediocre games.. Amazing, underrated game by the souls fans. The weakest souls game, clunky like the first one, but not as many high points, though it still does have many. Kind of improperly balanced, which is the main issue here, it´s very annoying, there is no way to not notice it, but it´s also not gamebreaking.. I really like this game. i understand it has flaws but it also has cool lore and dark fantasy vibes and the world is just as cool as ds1 even though its not connected in the same way. the music in majula is constantly stuck in my head. the weapons and variety is amazing so many different builds. the bosses are not the best in the series, few memorable ones. dlc as always is top notch.. Till this day after many many tries I have yet to feel that spark I felt with every other souls game, I have played and 100% (atleast trophy wise) multiple fromsoft games but till this day this remains the only one I have yet to beat let alone just get through a decent portion. It feels like if you got a fan made dark souls game by people who think the only reason souls games are loved is because they are difficult. It lacks a true place umong the souls games getting 2 points purely for powerstancing the 1 it deserves.. I played this game right after playing Dark Souls I Remastered, Demon's Souls and Bloodborne. I prefer to start with the pros: PROS Clunky combat (everybody hates it but I like it, it is more realistic) More complex abilities and stats system CONS -The game feels very sober. In dark souls 1 every scenario makes the player feel what the game want the player to feel. Every scenario is a form of art and you can ""read"" the lore in it. On the other hand, in Dark Souls 2 the scenarios are very generic and makes you feel that they are premodeled. -The bosses are very similar to each other. About 40% of the bosses are a big man with a shield and a sword. Also, they got no essence and most of times are very easy. -Although the bosses use to be easy, the path to the bosses are unfair sometimes. Sometimes the game just set A LOT of enemies and the agro irange is very very big. As a game is a 7/10, as a dark souls 4/10. As a Souls game, it is mediocre; however, as a game overall, it is by far above the average. DS2 lacks the incredible map design of the first game, but its atmosphere is almost intact. The battle system was slightly slowed and the Adaptability feature is definetly an error, but it was compensated with the addition of dual wielding and the quality of the DS combat system itself, that remains fun and exciting to play. Although more plain and less interconeted than in DS, areas are still fun to explore and offer an even better variety of enemies. The big issue here is that creators couldn't find an appropiate way to implement difficulty and opted for throwing dozens of enemies at the face of the player, which leads to frustration and weariness in more than one situation. Story telling style doesn't evolve, but NPC's are fairly more interesting and better created than in DS, which makes its lore be as interesting as always. Sadly, many of the new mechanics they tried to implement, like torches in dark areas, feel incomplete and barely exploited. DS2 doesn't improve in the overall over its predecessor, being worse in most of the aspects and better in just a few, but this series is so good that despite all its mistakes, it remains as a much better game than the typical product you can find at the store. Pros: - Dual wielding is fun and adds depth to the already deep combat system. - Areas are beautiful and inmersive, offering a great variety of engaging enemies that keep the player focused and entertained in every moment. - NPC's are interesting and make you want more about their stories. - The game is long and full of secrets, with a NG+ that is considered the best in the series. Cons: - Plain and poorly conected map that feels like a collection of independent areas sloppily glued together. Still, each one of them more than good. - Too many bosses with only a few offering the quality expected from a Souls game. Luckily, the regular enemies and mini bosses compensate this issue. - Rough fights until adaptability skill is maxed enough. This problem is accentuated by disgusting hitboxes and slow animations when healing. - Still bad menus and poorly explained stats. I give it a 8.1/10 as a game, but a 6/10 as a Souls game.. It doesn't get to be called Dark Souls and surely it would have more note, it shows that Miyazaki was not there.. I have completed this game twice and I still don't like it. For some reason every now and then i crave to play it though, only to remember how bad it is.. (Note: this is the only version I tried - I don't have the earlier PS3 version and I didn't do any of the DLC.) Tried DS 1 and 2 concurrently; beat this one, still have yet to finish DS1. It seems hard to speak of one without mentioning the other. Still, DS1 had a flawless first half, then dipped massively for me. DS2, on the other hand had flaws all over, but I found the controls, combat, and levels to be more enjoyable overall. Everyone has their preferences, right? Both DS 1 and 2 have jank and gank, but, for whatever reason, I enjoyed this one enough to keep playing, whereas I have no desire to pick up DS1 again and try and finish the last few areas (after Anor Londo).. Despite how much I want to enjoy this game, I just can't bring myself to truly favor DS2 to any of the other From Soft games, as to me, it is genuinely the weakest overall, and lacks in what a lot of the other games shine in. Firstly the combat. This is usually the main factor that really makes souls games fun for me, and here it just feels lacking. DS2's combat feels significantly slower and clunkier than in any of the other souls games. Animations often look rigid and stiff, and your attacks (even the fast ones) can sometimes feel too slow. This is emphasized even more so when you run a strength build like I did with a greatsword, with which I often felt overpowered and lacking in skill, since the weapon crushed every enemy nearly instantly, but still couldn't save me from getting hit nearly constantly. To compliment my earlier criticism of feeling overpowered, this game has no real sense of order, as I often struggled to find out the order that I should go in, since some areas always felt too easy, and others too difficult, so I usually just gave up on trying and just checked wikis to see what areas fit my level. However, this isn't to say that the game is terrible. It isn't. DS2 has a massive world to explore and a crap ton of bosses and enemies to discover, many of which are very well hidden, which is something I can always applaud a company for doing, prioritizing the more dedicated players. In conclusion though, this is a half decent game, but a pretty bad souls game, even more so if this is your first entry in the series. Other entries usually bring similar difficulty with a lot less of the frustrations of DS2. Plus, FromSoft has such a huge catalogue these days that it's hard to really consider playing this game over any of the others.. Best main hub atmosphere out of all fromsoft games. Also I wish they would bring powerstance from DS2 back.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a piece of **** the only redeeming thing about this game is the lore that Miyazaki cintributed.. 65/100 Dark Souls 2's map of Drangleic aims to be as structurally cohesive as Lordran, but ultimately lacks that same level of ingenious interconnectivity that made DS1's journey so engrossing. The branching pathways leading to the various corners of the world rarely intertwine, with a mostly streamlined progression that often halts exploration with awkward progression gating requiring a single resource, which makes the experience's flow much more jagged and tedious. Even the historical background of the kingdom of Drangleic seems to have less care put into it, with some areas not making geographical sense in relation to their position and extremely few meaningful NPC storylines to witness. Nonetheless, even after all of this, the Level Design itself within each zone can still be extremely engaging, even surpassing DS1 a couple of times, with a solid artistic direction that soaks the ambience in a gloomy melancholy, areas developing horizontally and vertically on multiple layers, hidden paths, environmental hazards and ","the game design of this game is inferior in many ways to the first and third parts . it's very unappealing in its first hours but if you are able to get through it you will definetely have a good time . the speed of everything bothers me, especially the recovery speed ."
805.Resistance 2,"This game is the worthy sequel of a pretty good first game. It has better graphics, better battles, and no health bars. However, it still feels a bit repetitive here and only allows you to carry two weapons instead of all of them. I get why they did that but it's just a bummer when that's why I enjoyed the first one. Still, it's a solid sequel that is worthy of trying out. It's not essential but still a good play.. One of the most beautiful, best and most enjoyable games I have ever played in my life. I hope it comes back again.. A wonderful game whose series was buried by Insomniac games. I'm looking forward to the return of this franchise on PC and Xbox. Gameplay, violence, physics, sensitivity... Everything is superior to RESISTANCE 3 (except the graphics) I felt like playing Killzone but this game is very dark and doesn't allow you to change the brightness or **** coolest thing about this game is the number of bodies it accumulates on the ground.. The story is not that great,ans it is **** enemies absorb every bullet like they are made from a sponge.Graphics are better than the first **** is dumb.Sound and music not so great.. Resistance 2 is better than the first game, but barely. Graphically it is leaps and bounds better than the first while the story remains as interesting as the original, in fact its a continuation, but gameplay is even more dull and one dimensional than the first game, if you can believe that, I really didn't think it could get more one dimensional than the first game but somehow Insomniac managed it here. The very mild peppering of variety the first game had with driving jeeps, being able to use mounted turrets, and drive tanks is all gone replaced with dull as dishwater traipsing from point A to point B from start to finish of the game only this time combat is made more boring because you can only carry two weapons at a time. There is just as many shenanigans in this game as the first as well to pad playing time and rather than the game introducing different obstacles mobs just get more and more the deeper into the game you get. Enemies that could have provided genuinely interesting challenges are used once or twice at most never to be seen again, play it if you like FPS games on consoles, for everyone else just watch a youtube game movie video for the story and move on.. This was the game that brought me to the franchise!!! Magnificent game!! I've been back to it, a few times.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A well improved sequel about this fantastic FPS sci-fi genre on PS3,amazing coop mode too bad there no more server this time but main campain and gameplay are still pretty solid and enjoyable to play...still worth it to play nowadays.. Improved graphics thanks to some nice lighting effects embellish what is otherwise pretty much more of the same. A good, solid FPS that'll please fans of the original.. Horribly boring game with poor level design, weak weapons, and bullet sponge enemies. Nothing from the first game was fixed this time around. If you didn't like the first game you won't like this one.. Resistance 2 is a bad sequel in almost all respects. Usually the sequel solves all the problems of the original, but it's not about Resistance 2. The level of gameplay has not gone far ahead. This is still a linear shooter with a broken balance between the complexity and capabilities of the main character. The gameplay finally falls apart in the final 2 missions. Dozens of enemies are dumped on the player without variability of passage. In the sequel, the missions on the equipment were removed without providing anything in return. Resistance 2 is the main reason why Sony no longer makes shooters. Resistance 2 is a game that is no longer relevant and has become a gameplay. And if the first part can be forgiven a lot, after all this is the first part of the series, yes, the PS3 was just launched in 2006, then Resistance 2 has no chance. The only thing that's good about Resistance 2 is her introduction and the final credits that this torment is over.. its a fun shooter of its time. One of the best released that year. Don't get the low score.. This is the best Resistance game in the franchise, just wow, I've played all the Resistance games, and this one always left a good, and satisfying feeling. I believe I played this 10x over to full completion. This is one of those poorly rated hidden gems that Sony will not bother with, what a Shame. I hope one day a Pure soul at Sony leads them to create an Open world Sequel with the gameplay of the Last of Us Part 2, making this into a Horror, Survival, 3rd/1st person Shooter game Only the fans can dream, I guess.. The evolution over the first game is quite remarkable, more depth in the characters and with more action, a bigger and more balanced Multiplayer, a new cooperative mode that is unique, its visuals and animations are a huge improvement.. Resistance 2 is inventive with its weapons even if it isn't as inventive with its story.. Resistance 2 is a 2008 science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony.. The game is too hard. Enemies have aimbot. You die with 3-4 shots. And that's medium difficulty. Easy is too easy. This successor of the original Resistance game kind of abandoned the features of the first one, however it still turned out a fun game indeed.. I was play in 2021. Graphic is very nice and game play is much better than first game.. Game became much better than terrible first part. The protagonist now knows more than 2 words, learned how to run. Developers added normal cut-scenes, added auto health regeneration, normal shooting mechanic, action scenes, better plot presentation. The picture became more pleasant, more interesting locations. Game on medium difficulty is too difficult, some enemies could oneshot me, too many enemies at once, little disbalanced. Bad checkpoints, pause doesn't work, on pause I can be killed, and you can't skips the cut scenes. This game can be better.. Resistance 2 is a great shooter game. Graphics and story are unimpressive but the gameplay rocks heavy. The single-player as well as the multiplayer are very thrilling despite of the game`s little flaws. Not bad at all!. In 2008 i got my mind blown by Resistance 2. The high quality of graphics, the horror elements and cool enemy designs made for an astonishing experience. This game is a single player player game about a alternate history where a virus called Chimera has infected most of the planet, and turned them into monstrosities out of nightmares. They are conquering the world and are eradicating humans in the proces. In resistance 2 they are taking this to the next level in the United States. To keep it Short: Story: Pretty darn amazing and exciting, with a cliffhanger done right. Gameplay: So much fun, challenging and addicting Characters: All characters are military, so there's a lot of testosterone going on. But it all works. Enemy design: Freaking amazing and scary. i love it. Multiplayer: Yes, this game even has a mutiplayer. And it's a pretty darn good one as well. All in all i loved my experience with this game and will always think fondly of it. I give this game a 10/10.. As a first person shooter resistance 2 both functions and plays as you woud expect, along with smart AI and over all a very well polished experience. However compared to its brothers, it's as if resistance 2 is having an identity crisis. Lacking not just in its story, but also in its gameplay. The shooting is satisfying, but the lack of the weapon wheel takes away the variation. Its trying to much to be halo, while still trying to appeal to fans of the first game.. i've played now, in June of 2017, for the first time. It is an impressive and grandiloquent game. very high end graphics and much, much better in all senses than killzone 2. killzone 2 has bad graphics for a newer game than resistance 2, maybe because was the first incursion of killzone into the ps3, but even the gameplay is repetitive and stupid, just going into cover to cover and aiming on the hordes of enemies that pops on the screen. Going back to resistance 2, the Chicago level are, indeed, an ispiration that Naughty Dog took for The Last of Us. The level design, i mean, the ""set desining, art direction and props"" is not good. The game feels like taking place in nowadays, not in 1953. The buildings and wooden houses in small cities are very like today houses, and Chicago level it is like the same of today. Just the cars, but excluding the vans, are a very piece of old times. I gave an grade 9 or 9.1, but it is below the 9.4 i gave for Resistance Fall of Man. The first installment doesn't have tense music and terror moments like this one, but is a more unique game, with good 50's architecture, music and sound effects more memorable. i don't know why they took away the heatlh system and put a adrenaline stuff in resistance 2, but it is amazing to see a small glowing yellow cannister and hear the sound of when you take one. One big issue, in my opinion, about resistance 2 is because has too much things happening on the screen in a lot of moments, like killzone 2 and uncharted 2; a lot of stuff exploding, a lot of soldiers dying and parallel events occurring, it is difficult to concentrate on your character.. Resistance 2 is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Good Scenarios + Campaign and Multiplayer - Chameleon - Frustrating Parts. Great gunplay, fun weapons, a solid campaign with a tight narrative and fast-paced combat, meaning, you can die quickly but so do enemies. One of the essential arcadey singleplayer-centric FPS's of the time along with its sequel and the Killzone series.. Resistance 2 is a fun and enjoyable FPS and proves to be a worthy sequel to RFoM (Resistance: Fall of Man). R2 is much more intense and all the battles are bigger and better than the original. I loved the settings of San Francisco, Chicago, and Louisiana in this game and how they were incorporated into the overall story. This was one of the most fun single person campaigns that I have gone through.. Dont believe the sheeples. Restistance 2 is a good game, you should pick it up today, not because I say so, but because you owe it to yourself to check it out yourself before you believe the others.. Awesome game. The storyline is top notch and the level design really sets it apart from a lot of other games on the PS3. The multiplayer modes are good as well and the musical score weaved throughout the campaign is some of the best I've heard yet in a shooter. My only qualm with the game was that I thought the graphics weren't much better than the first resistance, and the swarm level didn't really fit the rest of the story. Besides that though you'll love the epic boss battles as well as the clever enemy AI and spectacular weapons design. A must play for sure for any true shooter fan.. Horrible everything. Sound design. Story. Graphics. Game play. From 2015 perspective at least. This is PS3 exclusive ou must avoid. Al thou it's playable. i'm giving this game 0 so it would disappear from top.. The game was fun to play, with cool enemies to fight, and many guns to experiment with. The graphics were quite good, with sometimes the framerate taking huge hits when many things are happening on the screen at once. The sound was good at most parts, but overall it was forgettable. Overall the single player experience was enjoyable. I did run into several glitches and bugs, and also the character and screen would lock up during key important battles. Now I never had a chance to play multiplayer or coop, as the online community was pretty dead when I got the game several months after release. So my experience with multiplayer was not pleasant. Overall it’s a fun game to play, with challenging bits when played on the highest difficulty setting. I give it a 7.25/10. This was by far my favourite game on PS3 and the nearest FPS to get near the Half Life series. Wish it would come over to PS4, then I would have some use for the console.. The game it's ok, but it doesn't have the same force to attract the typical FPS players, i tried with the first levels and it's doesn't catch my attention, the history in this moment is not attractive, i feel that the options to play (weapons, etc) are too basic, but the scenes and the places are very good worked.. I love this game and I recommend it to any one, its got a great action-horror atmosphere and lovely graphics. The fact that this game is more linear and only allows you to carry two guns doesn't mean the game **** , each and every gun is cool in its own way and especially the enemies and the co-op system is another great way for every one to enjoy the game and its story.. The best console shooter i've played. Neat setting, cool guns, nice story, giant bosses. Enjoying multiplayer (too bad it's pulled off on 8th of april, but you can sstil try to play splitscreen co-op). It has some strange nods to CoD with 2 weapon slots, but there are always few guns lying under your feet. And health regen, well, no big deal. If you haven't played Resistance games, it's probably best to start with the 1st to keep up with the story.. Resistance 2 is a landmark game for the PS3. The atmosphere and universe is great the bosses are epic and the weapons are unique. This is one of those games that balance single and multiplayer too so there is plenty to do when the single player is over.. Should u still give this a shot in 2014? If u haven't played already, u'll miss out on one of the finest FPS ever! The story feels disconnected, the cut-scenes are crap and I really didn't care about the characters (Nathan Hale = having Drake's name and looks like Cole, but nowhere near likable as them). That is literally the Only complain about the game. Everything else is a blast! The variety is what impressed me the most. The game-play sections, guns (so cool!) and enemy types and boss fights which include Titans, Sharks, Zombies, Dinosaurs, Krakens and a goddamn Godzilla (they're just Chimeras, I'm just giving names! ). Both Ally and Enemy AI are superb with actual help from allies and the enemies using cover and flanking. Graphics considering it's from 2008 still stand out beautifully especially the environments. On top of the mind-blowing campaign, is the enjoyable multiplayer with up to 64 players (yes, 64 on PS3 back in '08) which surprisingly is still active! The game literally screams Epic right from the moment u pick up the box with one of the best cover arts I've seen! Another PS3 Exclusive that is pure quality! It's a shame that Insomniac Games is now working on an XBox One exclusive, but I still hope Resistance 4 will come on PS4! Verdict : 9.5/10. This game is truly epic! More enemies, better guns, updated game mechanics. Let's start with the core gameplay. One thing I did not like about this was the sudden change of the gun system. In Fall of Man and Resistance Retribution (PSP), once you pick up a gun, it's yours to keep forever. Here, they removed that and made it more like Call of Duty. You can now sprint (something you couldn't do in FoM and Retribution) and you can only carry two guns at a time.I guess that's not a bad thing, but I played this game the second after I completed the first, and the wacky controls surprised me. Storywise, the Chimera have gotten stronger, and now have giant airships capable of leveling cities. How Hale escaped London alive is a mystery (but it probably can be answered via ingame intel and the wiki). In my opinion, the Chimera have become almost godlike. Fall of Man showed that their survival depended on humans, or they would not be able to produce any more soldiers, but in Resistance 2, they seem to have gotten past the Conversion problem. There are also a hell of a lot more non-humanoid creatures. The damn spinners, chameleons, krakens and more. I also don't like how they removed the cutscenes which explains what is happening (and narrated by a soothing british accent). Resistance 2 and Retribution came out at almost the same time (hooking your PSP up to the PS3 with R2 gives your PSP game extra stuff), yet they are completely different. Regarding weapons, the Auger is far more powerful than it was before. You can see your enemies from behind walls, the bullets are much faster and deal far more damage. There are also new guns that really should have been in Retribution, but were left out. Regardless, a fantastic sequel!. I enjoyed playing this game more than the first one, mainly because the campaign was much more epic. The number of enemies and amount of action going on at any one time is tremendous and really pulls you into feeling like you are in a war. Fighting huge enemy bosses was also very cool, reminds me of old school games. The story was a nice continuation from the first game and the graphics and sound are a lot better. There are some changes I didn't care for. I missed the gun wheel, the health packs, and the loss of vehicle play. These made resistance 2 feel more like other games. Other than that I really enjoyed everything else about the game and continue to highly recommend it.. Not much has changed and was has changed is not for the better. It feels like a lesser game then the first one. If you can't get enough of Resistance you could buy this though.. Worth playing for the cooperative multiplayer, but that's all. The campaign is a large disappointment from Resistance: Fall of Man. As you probably already know, the weapon wheel and cooperative campaign have both been removed. These were defining features of the original, and a couple of its largest attractions. The style has degraded from Resistance 1. The sepia look has been abandoned in favor of neon grass and oversaturated colors. I understand that people are trying to move away from dull gray shooters. I understand that, I really do. But if there was one series in the world that should keep a dull color palette, it should have been Resistance. Furthermore, the colors in Resistance 2 are not balanced or realistic at all. The flora practically glows it's such a bright shade of neon green. The campaign has become worse as well. There's no longer any mystique to the chimera. They're aliens, that's all. Just aliens. As if we need another generic shooter with invading aliens. The chimera are no longer an aggressive hive mind ruled by the Angels. Instead, they now have military ranks like humans, and the Angels have been replaced by a partially human mutation named Daedalus. The chimera have lost their ferocity. In Resistance 1, it was common to see chimera biting and ripping at human soldiers. It was clear they were enraged and bestial, and the style worked perfectly to reinvigorate the stagnant shooter market. In Resistance 2, the chimera act so human they even listen to orders from overseers. It's simply a terrible way to portray the chimera. Graphics have only arguably improved from Resistance 1. Water is now dynamic, and that's the best thing I have to say about it. It resembles blue jello at this point, and while it's amusing to watch, it can't be taken seriously. The rest of the graphics have seemingly just been painted in brighter colors. There's less of a selection of guns in Resistance 2, and there are fewer enemy types. In general, the single player is just bad. Multiplayer, however is much better. The 8 player cooperative multiplayer is immeasurably fun to play. Each of the 3 classes supports the others, and it creates a real sense of companionship with your team. In a good team, it's possible to overwhelm even full battalions of chimera (of which there are several dozen on screen at once). Ravagers and the hybrids that follow them add back much of the sense of ferocity that the chimera lost in the single player, and the 60 player competitive matches are chaotic and fun. The traditionally insane weapons of Resistance are fully featured in both competitive and cooperative multiplayer, and they create dynamic gameplay you just don't see in other shooters. I paid $60 for Resistance 2, and I've never regretted it simply because the multiplayer is so fully developed and so much fun. If you want to focus on the single player campaign, prepare to be disappointed.. After Resistance FoM, I was hoping this game would be really good and capture the same feel as the first one. Did it fully capture it? For the most part yes. The story was wonderfully put together, with great characters, plot, set pieces, and AI. The MP was of course of the chains. With the massive matches going on and crazy clan battles, the game was great. The new COOP experience was great as well. The only down side was the lack of support by Insomniac. No new COOP DLC, and well over priced maps for MP. But there was no incentive to get those DLCs. Aside from that, the problems that existed were with the somewhat cartoonish graphics, bodies exploding in to the chunks of intestines and organs, no arms or legs, those were rare when it came to certain enemies. In Multiplayer there were only organs all over the place. The fire physics and textures in this installment were terrible. The did a great job on the water physics. To some people these are laughable things to pick on, but when you are looking for a good looking game, these things count. Over all the game was enjoyable, great story, great graphics, characters you could relate and care about. There was a lot of hate on this game because it was nothing like Resistance Fall of Man. But truthfully it was more of a Resistance title than Resistance 3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is an improvement on the first one. Its more epic with some new Chimera enemy types that are awesome. The story is more interesting as well adding a few new plot twists to the original first game that are pretty interesting. The gameplay is good to and the great weapon design is back with a new and improved Auger, possibly one of my favourite guns in gaming. There is something wrong though, where the original seperated itself more from the norm this feels more generic. You can now only carry two guns at a time and your health regenerates more like a conventional FPS. Also to enjoy this you have to be patient, even on the normal setting this game can be difficult in places, especially the last level. Overall than a great game that is a bit better than the first. Another Call of duty clone of what could've been the best sequel of any shooter until now. The developers literally butchered everything that they've created since the first game, no more investigating levels to get those beautiful archives that were actually interesting and would tell you about the story of the game, no more diary having an history of every weapon and every type of chimera that there was before, no more carry an arsenal in your backpack, no more characters from the first game, and i mean there's no one they even remove the narrator, but the worst part is that the first game characters are replaced by dull boring uninteresting characters that you not know a single thing about them. Then you have the regenerating health (straight from cod), you also have the two gun limitation (again straight from cod) and after that even the melee animations are exactly the same ones from cod. The only reason why i'm giving this game a four and not a lower score is because the multiplayer is barely decent which sadly i need to count if not i would probably give this game a score of two. Is sad and demeaning how Insomniac just released this game only to sell, im telling you the call of duty similarities are frighting. In conclusion Resistance 2 is by far the most disappointing sequel that i've ever played until now,(and i've played mw3), dull characters, awful team ai, not even mentioning the fact that you're constantly are going to be asking yourself. Why the chimera is here again? just leaves me with a putrid disgusting feel towards Insomniac games and just the big scum liar sellout that they've become after making such an amazing game like resistance fall of man was.. Dont be fooled by the poor user rating this game is a solid 8.5 to 9.0. Great frame rate, very nice graphics and good control. I was pleasantly supprised by this game. I would have rated in higher with maybe more weapon upgrades. More open level design, this is a very linear game it's main downfall in my opinion. I will say the single play is a lot of fun, you will most likely want to finish this game. I have spent a small amount of time on the multiplayer so far it's above average. I have not played it enough to form a solid opion. You can pick this game up cheap at gamestop used well worth it.. 8-Presentation; The story is not as good as the first game, but the menu's are well laid out and easy to navigate. 9.5-Graphics; Beautiful art style, amazing models and textures, and amazing scope. 10-Sound; The music, sfx, and voice acting is excellent. 9-Game play; The AI is much better this time around, but no vehicle segments sadly. However, the mechanics are so well done. 9-Lasting appeal; Single player, co-op, and multiplayer will take forever to unlock everything you can. Overall-9/10. Resistance 2 is a good game with solid gameplay but with a forgetable story. Not that different from the average shooter. Fun while playing but easily forgeted as you end it.. Short version: not nearly as good as the first game. Long version: What does a game company do when a game is successful? Make a sequel and change everything about it that made the first game great! The story introduces some unnecessary plot points, and stretches credulity to do so (the relationship between the protagonist and antagonist for example). Unlimited weapons are gone, as are vehicles, split-screen campaign co-op and split-screen multiplayer. Some enemies can instantly kill you with one touch. Some boss battles are ridiculously hard, others are ridiculously easy. The ending boss fight is simply stupid. That said, I did actually like the additional characters, and I found the color palette interesting. As always, killing Chimera was fun, and a few of the boss battles were really enjoyable. Grims were a painful, but ultimately appreciated, addition to the enemy pantheon. All in all, I did enjoy the game, but not nearly as much as the first. It's more like a a wannabe sci-fi COD clone, except with COD you would at least get split-screen multiplayer. The brightest spot is probably the soundtrack also not quite as good as the first, but still great nonetheless.. i discovered resistance 3 by accident, so i decided to play resistance 1 and resistance 2 as well. there is no way this game ****. it was more fun than the other 2, and i liked them as well. but this game had so much fun stuff in it with the monsters and the vehicles. maybe i am naive, but i definitely see some haters and trolls knocking this game beyond a reasonable complaint. if you are like me and are searching for a new game that you haven't played that doesn't ****, this is one fun game.. Lets start by saying I am new to the PS3 having had an XBOX 360 for a few years now,but I decided to get a Playstation and bought Resistance 2 together with Fall of man,I really loved the first game,but this is a stinker. What went wrong everything about Resistance 1 that was good,the controls,the story the game-play were thrown out of the window for this sequel what were the developers thinking,where they drunk all the time through development or were they playing a joke on gamers,whatever it was they really messed this game up it's as if a whole new team worked on it without any or little knowledge of what came before. I can't think of anything but the rumble feature that this game has that's an improvement over the first,this game is all trial and error and it gets really tedious when you die over and over and over and over again and each time have to start again from the beginning of the level, you often die because enemies just spawn out of nowhere when you least expect you also get confused as to what to do and where to go you often get swarmed with masses of creatures who bizarrely only target you and not your teams mates and you often run out of ammo a lot as you are restricted to two guns,they also changed the controls around as well which annoys the hell out of me,but I finished this game because I bought it,but had I known how bad and inferior it would be compared to the first game I wouldn't have bought it,this game isn't worth buying at all,rent it instead,but even then you'd feel ripped off.. I bought this videogame for 22. This game is much better then the second one. I disagree with all the negative reviews here. Gears of war is too stupid for me to get into. This however is much better.. This game is utter trash and incredibly overrated. It took queues from the COD franchise but executed them in an extremely awkward manner, resulting in a overall awkward and unpleasant experience. You move extremely slow, as if your ability to run present in the first game, somehow vanished, and got instead replaced by an annoying sprint option. Hale also lost his ability to aim also present in the first game, now if you want to kill any enemy, you will have to press the aim button, because that would be more fun they thought? The graphics are also a complete mess, one minute you're looking at decent looking and interesting environments, the next, you're looking at low res textures and ugly characters. Extremely disappointed in this considering Resistance 1 wasn't the best FPS ever but it was at least enjoyable, this is utter trash.. It was okay, but it wasn't the first game, and just didn't grab me. I could leave it at that and given how long ago it came out I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about. The visuals don't look good, with varying levels of texture around the environment that make certain pieces look like they are out of place or not fully loaded. The guns felt the same as the first which was a plus with some additions I believe (haven't played the first one since it came out. The gunplay was just as good as the first as well and I enjoyed how the style of combat is really defined by the guns. I know this is a stupid point but I really appreciated the option of a flashlight on the weapons as it accomplished two things: First it makes going through the dark places doable so I'm not squinting or adjusting brightness settings to get through the section, and second, it gives a horror feel to the game. The enemies felt more or less the same; the big guys were frustrating but what I would want in it. The story was really what fell short. I liked the first one and found it compelling, but Resistance 2 just did nothing for me. I flat out did not care what happened, and for those who have played to the end you can tell insomniac wanted the player to care about this character you've been through the **** with and I couldn't. Perhaps others were able to engage more with this one but for me it just didn't work and I don't foresee myself ever recommending this one. Here's to 3 being better!. Slightly better than the first one, but at least there are some improvements. Graphic is one big improvement, and presentation of the story. Weapons are almost the same. Enemies variety has increased a little. This is only an above average game. Nothing is really great that needs compliment, nothing is really bad that needs complaint.. Loved the game. If only there was 8 player co-op, and 64-player multi-player on Resistance 3 I would of got it... Its like if they Zombies from Call of Duty - worst choice ever.. I enjoyed Resistance 1 and 3 but this game is just bad. They some how screwed up coop campaign, the online multi player is disappointing, the appearan","""resistance 2"" is the worthy sequel to a pretty good first game . it has better graphics, better battles, and no health bars . gameplay is even more dull and one dimensional than the first game ."
806.flower,"It was very beautiful and a showcase for the system, and is pretty fun too actually.. Beautiful and somber, Flower is a great and unique game that can be beaten in just a few hours.. Incredible game, extremely high-quality graphics, tactile controls, animations and, strange as it may seem, the plot. Totally in the continuity of the game 'Journey': clever, contemplative, beautiful, pleasant and not that hard. The levels system is interesting and allows the game to show some variety. The gameplay is great and the idea to control petals with the controller without having to press any button is amazing even if the PS3 doesn't recognize every single move you do. It kind of reminds me of 'Mario Kart' on Wii when, as a child, I turned the controller so hard that my character turned the other way around. Sound atmosphere is as amazing as the little story you have to construct by yourself. The core message is simple but marvelous. The semi-open world is fantastic and allows you to freely explore the environment. It's a shame 'flower' only lasts three of four hours straight.. If you're expecting something conventionally fun, you wont find anything of the sort here. The controls are bad and the gameplay is boring. It has a chill vibe, but that can get counteracted by the frustration often involved with the controls. Its price is low enough and its short enough that if you think theres a chance you'll like it you should take a shot at it, but I didn't enjoy it at all.. This is a short artistic game where the music and the visual beauty are the best. It took me almost 2 hours counting the credits (where you can play). Although there's one mission that I could not completely finish.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. I thought I would hate this game, but it was on sale for 99 cents and I saw how much praise it had gotten, so I tried it. I'm so glad I did. I have never felt so emotional in a game. Not exactly angry, sad, happy, or anything specific. I simply felt overcome by the beauty and catharsis that this game provides. It's an experience everyone should have.. Fantastic experience! Beautiful game, the soundtrack is amazing, and it's veeery cheap! Eve if you're a hardcore gamer, i recommend it! I am one myself, mainly FPS and TPS, and i LOVED it, it's very calming and a great experience to the end!. Flower is a video game developed by That game company and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. + Relaxing and Beautiful. Absolutely one of the most beautiful and artistic games I've ever played. It's hard to articulate how relaxed and happy this game made me feel, and I think it's definitely one of best mini-games of its year for sure. Using the Sixaxis takes some getting used to, but this game is one of the very, very, very few that use it well. The music is outstanding, the scenery is hard to describe in one word, as excellent, or amazing would be an understatement, and the subtlety of the ""story"" is just spot on. The devs have been quiet about this game, but I'd really love to see a sequel, or even anything else similar to this.. Flower is a video game developed by Thatgamecompany and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Thatgamecompany have a solid reputation for developing video games that aren’t actually conventionally video games, however, more than 5 years later, Flower evokes emotions throughout its stunning visuals, lush colors, and joyous soundtrack. It’s not a surprise that it’s not for everyone and the motion controls can still be frustrating if you’re not adapted to them—and since very, very few games have taken advantage of this feature, that frustration is warranted for a lot of gamers—it’s still a must-play for anyone willing to spend their 7 bucks on it, whether it’s the PS3 or PS4.. Far from a traditional game, but rather a chance to relax. You literally play as flower petals soaring through the wind. Plenty of emotional impact, short, cheap, easy trophies.. A peaceful & enchanted game. Really original & fun to play (but also watch!) There is something here....that could be grown for other kind of games ! Thanks. Flower isn't necessarily a game, but it is definitely worth playing by all means. Pros: The visuals look astounding. It may not be the most impressive game in terms of graphics, but the art direction is phenomenal. The soundtrack is stunning. It is very peaceful, calm and it fits the tone of the game perfectly. The controls may seem a bit fiddly at first, but when you get used to it, the control is really smooth and swift. Flower feels like a silent film, but it has less emphasis on the story and more on the relaxing gameplay. I did feel like there was a message Flower was trying to get across, but i'll leave that to you to find out (or look up on the internet). Cons (More like a drawback for some people): Aside from possibly wanting to find all the secrets and gain all trophies, there is no real replay value for Flower. Overall, Flower is one of the purest games I have ever played. I would say it is more of an experience rather than a fully fledged game, but it is still worth picking up. 10/10. amazing visuals and an amazing soundtrack. My only issue is one certain level that seems to be either too difficult or impossible to pass. Solid game and should be played.. Another extremely short game from Thatgamecompany, but another highly unique and calming experience. A rare game that makes great usage of the sixaxis and perfect if you've had enough of shooting zombies for one day.. some people say ""whoo this game is mind blowing"" and some say ""wow the visuals are beautiful"". but i say ""what the **** is wrong with these people??"" i mean this game is damn overrated. this is not a bad game but it is not as good as people and critics say. it is a mediocre game. you control a flower petal and you have to just travel with motion control. no challenge at all. i give it a 5/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Breathtaking life of the petal of a flower. There is an amazing flow of harmony here, where with your own moves you control the nature itself and fight for the harmony of nature against civilization. Extremely simple, really relaxed feel and a slow pace, but the entire eco message goes beyond videogame and it can really open many children's eyes. 8/10. Simple and Beautiful. Just press a button and move your controller. This game is not going to be for everyone but it is definitely worth a try. The PS4 version of the game only delivers a better experience of this piece of art.. Bought this because everyone says it's a 9/10. I was disappointed. Gameplay: You move flower petals around over other flowers to accumulate more. There is no words to read, no story at all. Just you moving your controller and not understanding why you have to collect more petals. Story:None Replayabllity: None Controls: You have to use the six axis which no game ever uses, and it shouldn't because it feels clunky. And since there is literally no words in this entire game there is no way to learn the controls other than fumbling your way through trying to figure out what any of the 14 buttons do. I paid 7 dollars for this game, and I feel it was a waste of 6 of those dollars. Even after reading these good reviews, I don't understand how people can call this a form of entertainment. 0/10. What the...! 8.8 in user score average! To me, Flower should be more intense to be a good action game, more tricky to be a good puzzle game, more imaginative to be a good adventure game, more impressive to be a good hardware showoff, longer to be a good retail game. The campaign ends very abruptly, just as it's about to get interesting, so half the game feels like the beginning levels of any other game... like a tutorial basically. I LOVE the concept and the subtle environmentalist message, but at the same time I have a problem with that as well: it preaches nature, but it demands a piece of consumer technology in order to be heard. Its depiction of nature is very simplistic and romantic. Where are the bacteria? Where are the fungi and all the natural stuff that messes up beauty? It's not in the game. Just as there are no explanations for the flowers or anything that could enlighten people now that the attention is there. All it shows is beautiful nature versus the factories and cities where WE sit consuming the message. I guess it's a subversive approach to the medium, but as simplistic as we see it here, I expect the constructive message to be lost on most gamers.. About the best and most original game I've played this generation. You have to control the wind and make one leaf into a wide colored beautiful group of leaves. More importantly, the world because more beautiful and opens up as you open flowers, make dying grass green again and essentially create life. One of the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen, couldn't get enough off this game. Why only a 9? Because the game is too short, for some reason replaying it feels wrong (the second playthough will never be as good as the first) so after a 2,5 hours that's it. And lastly, it's nice to control the wind with the sixaxis but moving the controller like that is not always that comfortable and doesn't always work perfectly.. Flower is the most aesthetically-pleasing, calming, serene game I've played. I thoroughly enjoyed the tilt-control gameplay that puts you in the part of the wind, opening flowers as you fly along with each flower playing a musical notation upon opening. Easily my favorite game; and definitely my favorite to play to de-stress.. This games sounds awful on paper: you control some petals by tilting your controller and holding down X to run into flowers. Despite this, the gameplay is tricky enough to keep your interest and the atmosphere and wordless story, at once deceptively simple and yet compellingly intangible, is possibly one of the most moving games I've ever played. If you can't see past shooters and bouncing on creatures heads, then this may not float your boat, but for those looking for a genuinely different experience in gaming, that isn't lodged squarely up its own backside, this is it. Worth the money and dismiss this as a 'girly game' because of the flora. Just try it.. While not generally suited to the action and first-person shooter audience, Flower gives players a flowing (no pun intended), minimalistic, and overall powerful meaning, and for the duration of the game (2-5 hours, not counting extra time not playing it), it's well worth the money if you want a visual story not told from text or speech.. Very beautiful and relaxing this game is, the graphics and music and the way the sixaxis controller is so well done is amazing! All 3 of this developers games are great to play if you like flower try journey and flow, you wont be disappointed.. This game is beauty. Some could think it's boring, but I think it's poetic. You are the wind, you can fly over hills and ponds, you drag behind you a long trail of petals, you can turn all the ugly human structures into colorful plants. It's just beautiful.. How does playing as a bunch of flower petals moving through the wind sound? Not that great. My thoughts afterwards: YES PLEASE. Having no clue what the game was when I started playing it I was really great experience to build my own opinion of the game entirely free of outside influence. I was confused at first as to why I was a petal and moving around with motion controls. After having set down the game for 15 minutes to take a break I found myself wanting to pick it right back up and keep floating around. It had a level of relaxation, visual awe, and awesome interactive sound track that really tied it together as an ""experience"" game. It's hard for me to understand why I enjoyed this so much, because conceptually this sounds like an incredibly boring and pointless game. Once you get going it rapidly grew on me and I really appreciated what Flower is. Definitely on the short side but in retrospect I wouldn't have wanted it to be any longer. For those who haven't played, I absolutely think you should: the last level is incredibly fulfilling.. This is a game everyone should play. It's also a game that everyone CAN play since the controls are simple and intuitive. Some might find Flower boring and short, but the rest will find it relaxing and wonderful. One could beat the game in a couple hours, but I find it has excellent replay value when you just need to relax and take your mind off something. The music is beautiful and changes with your surroundings, and the graphics are incredible as well. You can't compare Flower to any other game, and in my mind, that alone makes it worth buying.. Perhaps one of the best video games I've ever played! It is more of an interactive experience than it is a game. I will try not to spoil anything. You will need a DualShock 3/SIXAXIS controller to play this experience. You guide a swarm of flower pedals and tilt the controller to bloom all of the flowers with your swarm. This game is also educational of human impact on the environment. If you are looking for a safe online game for your children of any age to play, look no further!. Flower... original and very beautiful game i ever seen, but besides that, very boring, you can play only 1 hour before falling asleep. I think it is just an excuse to show the potential of the PS3.. Truly a beautiful, mesmerizing game. If I were to explain this to someone that has no idea about it, it would sound like the lamest thing in the world. It even took me like 2 years to play it because it's like you are a flower? That floats in the wind? That certainly is all there is too it but at the same time it's so much more. You seriously cannot be mad playing this game, it has a strange soothing quality to it. I recommend this to any gamer.. Not much to say about Flower. It's a nice relaxing game that feels like a painting come to life. It has a certain type of sleepy catharsis about it that helps me unwind after a busy day. It's not the most challenging or deepest game ever created.. But then again, what do you expect from a game based around flowers? The question is: Do you want to win the ""Games as art"" argument? Look no further.. Awesome game, some days before I play the boring Journey, I decide play flower, and the result is completely different than the other SCEA game, is addictive, interesting a masterpiece.. Flower isn't so much **** in a traditional sense though it does have a ""goal"" for each level but more so just an... Experience. I can't really think of how else to put it as there is just nothing else around that is really like it. Visually stunning with soothing music and simplicity in its approach it really is just a matter of simply letting go of yourself.. Most stunning game you'll play in your life. It's beautiful and extremely unique. The only downsides is the short campaign, although the prise is rightly chosen. As well as the rather dark level toward the end. All and all a great game!. One of the greatest and most relaxing down loadable games you'll ever play. Don't hear those who say it's too short and not worth the money. This is one of the few games (if not the only) that will make you feel sad for what we are doing to nature. It's a most buy and it will remain one of the most unique games on your game library for a long time.. Seeing all those good reviews makes me wonder why I still look to reviews ... if I want to relaxe, I'll watch TV, play to a game with a lot of cinematics (not a FPS), play to a game like Little Big Planet ... but never I'll play this boring game, yes it's beautiful but just go outside if you want to see flowers ... top 10 of the worst game I've played.. Stunning graphics and vibrant colors does not make up for shallow gameplay. Too much of flower is just comprised of guiding a flower pedal in the air and gathering more flower pedals. It was definitely stunning to see all of them rendered so lifelike but it's something I would be amazed to see as an E3 tech demo, not as a video game.. Wonderful. Atmospheric , addictive , fluid and mesmerising. This game must have been thought of in a dream or a transient state. Indeed I wish I'd thought of it. Doctors should prescribe Flower to people with high blood pressure. Gamers should play it to experience the ultimate chillout. Everyone else should play it just because its a unique unforgettable experience. Beautiful.. An amazing experience. This game is all about relaxing and just letting the game take you where ever it goes. The graphics and music give this game a soothing presentation and that is what this game is all about.. This game might seem simple, but the originality and creativity is solid and shines. Glad to see a quality and enjoyable game which does not rely on guns or repetitiveness to carry on the product as a whole. The elegance and relaxation is immersible and for $10, it does seem you do get your money's worth.. This is a relaxing game... So relaxing I almost fell asleep every time I played it, the game provides a novel and minimalistic but powerful meaning, somehow they managed to awaken me at the later levels when I started to understand the context of the subtle story it intends to show, so I can say that this game is special somehow but it has some issues, first of all the gameplay is controlled entirely with the sixasis feature on the ps3 controllers, making it very interesting but ultimately annoying, I hated how difficult it was forthe wind to follow my commands so every level I spent more time going back to the same areas multiple times untill I got all the flowers up, and second the music is almost too boring to actually realize the game has music going on. At the end I'm not sure if the game is worth the price I payed for it.. Epic, perhaps you never heard of the creators and the title may sound a little bit lame, but anyone should be able to look past that and see a truly beautiful game waiting to be discovered. The wind blowing with and eerie yet beautiful sound to top this game off a 'living art'.","beautiful and somber, flower is a short artistic game where the music and the visual beauty are the best . it took me almost 2 hours counting the credits (where you can play) although there's one mission that I could not completely finish ."
807.Europa Universalis IV,"One of the best strategy games i’ve ever played but in fact you need a lot of money to buy dlc’s that really can make your playing experience better.. without dlc you can not play for very long periods of time, but with dlc it is very fun, if you like historical strategy you should definitely play.. I love this game. It can seem expensive but you can subscribe an offer and get all the dlc for a few money. The game is old, more than 10 years old but it looks good and there's still new content. Also, the mods add a lot of content. To conclude, this game can be expensive but offer thousands of hours of content. By far, the best Grand Strategy game.. 3500 hours of my life gone... Best game ever. I will never be able to go back to a simpler strategy game. Very addictive, fun and intruiging. Useful as an educational tool as well, getting you heavily invested in the late and post-middle age periods, though is a bit complicated for a beginner.. Over 3000hours spend. Best return on investment measuring by time. Especially wonderful game for history lessons.. Europa Universalis IV (EU4) is a captivating strategy game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive. The game provides an immersive experience of establishing and managing a grand empire during a historical period spanning from 1444 to **** of the most impressive features of EU4 is the incredibly vast and detailed game world. Players can choose various nations and play their roles on the world stage throughout history. As a complex strategy game involving diplomacy, trade, war, and internal politics, EU4 offers players a multifaceted empire management **** deep strategic mechanics of the game allow players to enhance their diplomatic skills, form alliances, and plan war strategies. Additionally, events and crises occurring in the game world require players to continuously revise their strategic plans.With advanced mod support and a large community backing, Europa Universalis IV provides long-term playability. Each gaming experience can be different as historical events and developments from history books are integrated into the dynamic world of the **** conclusion, Europa Universalis IV is a must-play masterpiece for players interested in strategy games. With its profound strategic elements, expansive game world, and continuous updates, this game offers an excellent choice for history enthusiasts and strategy aficionados.. I like this game but most basic features are locked behind paywall. This game is pay to win. I tried to play without dlc and its impossible. Dlc add features which make game easier but its behind 20 euro paywall. I hate paradox for making pay for every single detail. It has no strategic feeling like hoi4 its basically who has bigger number of soliders.. This game honestly might be one of the best games ever for me. I have over 400 hours and dont regret it! Honestly if this game didnt have so much dlc it would be a 10. Great game lots of replaybilty but becomes simple after 100s of hours which is fine. Pure global strategy at it's best!. Score: 7/10 Europa Univeralis IV is an awesome game for people who enjoy playing history/strategy games. While I don't really play strategy games this game still managed to have me invested for couple hours. It has a huge variety of playing styles which can easily entertain you for many hours.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. EU4 is a great game, it is the perfect historical sandbox that gives you the ability to do basically what ever you want. You can play as any nation, and have fund regardless of that fact that the non-European nations aren’t as flushed out as their counterparts. If you want a more structured experience there are missions trees for some of the nations that gives you the opportunity to have a historical game if you want. The game also revives regular updates even to this day, however to actually experience the updates in their entirety you have to pay. This is the only negative to the game and it's that the DLCs are really expensive, though it's not fair to expect all the content for free since they are putting time and resources into developing the DLCs it is fair to expect some of the really basic features for free instead of forcing you to pay. Despite that drawback EU4 is still a good game that is worth purchasing.. The game itself is actually quite good, I just can't recommend this game because the poor excuses of devs have locked a cr*p load of essential features behind several paywalls which makes around half the factions and thus game unplayable. if your willing to invest triple the amound of the base game on dlc's go ahead. Otherwise don't bother.. A Decade of Grand Strategy Excellence - 9/10 As a dedicated player of Europa Universalis IV for the past 10 years, and having experienced every expansion along the way, I can confidently say that this Paradox title is a true gem in the realm of grand strategy games. With the perfect balance of depth and breadth, as well as historical accuracy and playability, EU4 offers an unparalleled experience for both history enthusiasts and strategy gamers alike. One of the key elements that sets EU4 apart from other grand strategy games is its focus on both micro and macro gameplay. The game allows players to dive deep into the intricacies of diplomacy, warfare, and economic management, while also offering the opportunity to guide an entire nation through centuries of historical events. This combination of detail and scope creates a captivating experience that has kept me hooked for a decade. The historical accuracy in EU4 is commendable, as it manages to stay true to real-world events and geopolitical situations while still providing players with the flexibility to forge their own paths. This balance ensures that the game remains engaging and exciting, offering countless possibilities for alternate historical outcomes. Moreover, the consistent release of expansions and updates has kept EU4 fresh and exciting over the years. The developers at Paradox have shown a commitment to improving and expanding the game, adding new mechanics, regions, and historical events that have only served to deepen the already impressive gameplay experience. As a passionate fan of both history and strategy gaming, I have found Europa Universalis IV to be the ideal blend of these two worlds. With its near-perfect combination of depth, breadth, historicity, and playability, EU4 truly stands out as an exceptional grand strategy game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a rich and engaging experience that will challenge their strategic skills and satisfy their historical curiosity.. It´s fine, you need most if not all dlcs to have fun with it. But it is a good game, even if some mechanics are bad.. As the name suggests, the game is very euro-centric. They don't do a good job with Eastern concepts. For example, Buddhism is a dharmic religion, which should be categorized under Hinduism and Sikhism. As someone not from Europe, the game gets boring very quickly.. Probably the worst of the main Paradox games. This is basically a map painter. As a game it does have some tactical considerations and is more complex than risk, but not nearly as much as a game like HOI4. As a simulator it is total nonsense.. fix the sieges. they took mountain level 2 fort at %14 and i took grassland level 1 fort at %35. this is **** stupid. i forgot to mention the stupidty of ai. **** idiots. EU4 is an incredible strategy game from Paradox interactive. The most accurate description is probably ""a sandbox of alternative history taking place in the Modern Age"" (from the fall of Constantinople to the end of the Napoleonic Wars). You can choose any existing country from around the world and lead them in your preferred direction. Establish powerful alliances, conquer new territories, colonize unknown areas, trade with precious commodities, become a pirate state, play politics in HRE and many others. For me personally, this is an essential game that has had a strong impact on me, one of the best I've played in my life. That's why I rate it 10/10.. Best Paradox game to date. Multiplayer hotjoin added makes it the easiest grand strategy game to play with a friend. Full of depth and history it will make CIV5 seem like child's play. With over 250 nations to play you will never be bored.. If you are able to overlook the terrible wallet draining marketing practices (even in less legal ways if youre into that) this is the best paradox grand strategy experience, the most complete, with the most content, and simply the most fun for the most time.. It's a great game if you like history and strategy games. It really makes you feeeeel like a 15th century tyrant. The dlc system is very rough, many dlcs completely change the way you play the game, and there is like 30 of them. I dont think that you should lock whole core game mechanics ander such a paywall.. One of the best games ever. Replayble. Enjoable. Millions od possibilities.. Best strategy game ever because everything is so detailed and there is too many countries you can play. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 7.. Spent hundreds of hours on this game. The game is simply fantastic and never gets boring. The possibilities are limitless on how you want to approach and build your empire. DLCs are expensive and are worth getting once on sale. That's the only issue with the game. They really do improve the game mechanics and make it way more interesting. You may also learn a lot of history from the 15th century and beyond. Well done Paradox.. Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy video game in the Europa Universalis series, developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive as a sequel to Europa Universalis III (2007). It is a strategy game where players can control a nation from the Late Middle Ages through the early modern period (1444 to 1821 AD), conducting trade, administration, diplomacy, colonization and warfare.. It's a great game that I couldn't get up from for hours. The pinnacle of strategy games.. The game feels so empty without $300-$400 of DLC. The game has fun nation RP but it will cost you $400. I like the game but it needs to add the DLC to the base game.. This game is an absolute masterpiece, of you like strategy games and you re a bit curious abaout history, you should play it, its so inmersive and addicting, they might get hard sometimes but here s the point of the game, this is not a meme, the game is difficult as hell, specially when you start to play it. in my opinion one of the most difficult games i have ever played with high entry threshold and with thousands of dlc's ........ Definitely is not a game for everybody especially if you are not dedicating yourself to this game. But if you learn it once, boy what an experience is that. Every tiny country in this game is playable and this literally means that we have hundreds or even thousands of different scenario that we can play with. Almost each region has its own game mechanics and mission trees. So this enriches the game play even more. And i am writing this comment from 2021, this game is still state of the art in its kind.. The game could be fun but it's unstable and it runs with shutter at x1920 64gb ram and 3080. It's hilarious but after it crashed my pc for the second time I stopped laughing. The gameplay is tottaly random, meh.. Very great game. I really appreciate my amatour 500h in game. I had and i will have so much fun with my friends playing ths. I like strategic games from Paradox. And even that i still cant normally exit to main menu bc of popup and playing without dlcs is mess that still. i like this game. It's good game but I guess it inflated over the time and requires refreshment. The resolution is way to low for 2021. Plus I have never figured out how the trade worked.. This is the best strategy game, I've ever played. With 75% of the DLC's you can play thousands of ours without feeling bored. It is perfect. Massive game thath you can enjoy for infinite hour. The problem is always the same: with all dlc, from the release of the base game to the addiction of the monthly subscription, we have paid more than 200€. I don't like the moneygrabbing policy of paradox.. Game is text-heavy, as you would expect. Yet game doesn't offer any means to increase text size until it becomes readable. That basic failure requires so low an intelligence that you would wonder why the game maker even tried to make a strategy game. Anyway, it cannot physically be played, so the intrinsic value of the software is simply zero.. Europa Universalis IV is the pinnacle of Paradox Interactive games, with plenty of content in the areas of diplomacy, trade, warfare, estates, etc. Pros: - Rich in content - Freedom of the player to choose his personal objective - Mechanics unique to certain realities such as the Holy Roman Empire or the Ming Empire - The Extended Timeline Mod, which allows you to play from the year 58 to the modern world - Saves are convertible with other Paradox games Flaws: - Downloadable content policy is anti-novelty - Artificial Intelligence can be annoying - Multiplayer needs some work. Once you start, the game might be very difficult. But when you've been playing it for a while you begin to master it. You're either addicted to it or find it boring, no other exception. I actually prefer EU4 over HOI (and yes, I've played both.). I don't have much to say. I played it over 2000 hours and i don't regret a little bit.. The game is too inaccessible to get a higher rating. I got bored because I didn't know up from down. It would be a 9/10 if I didn't get bored first.. This is kind **** you play for years and never get tired of... I am speechless how good EU4 is!! Playing as any nation in the world you attempt to conquer it through military expansion, diplomacy, carefully planned strategy, missions etc... for those who are new to the eu4, don’t give up, keep learning until you grasp the entire complexity of this game and you won’t ever regret! It’s addictive!. Paradox Interactive is already the god of strategy games. EU4 is a bit of a complicated game. But the playing time is very long. One of the best strategy games.. It's a fantastic game, but its also a game were your either goingt o like it or your not.. It may be a good game however there is one critical flaw. The text in the game (and this is a text heavy game!) is difficult to read at a resolution of 1900x1200 (native monitor resolution).. Im going to give it a 3 ! It got everything right ... it's a diamond ****. BUT ... BUUUUT ... it's 0 fun because they spent ZERO EFFORT into making it fair and challenging. What happens is you lose your manpower in like 3 lost fights while the enemy magically has INFINITE pool of soldiers and INFINITE money. So even if you occupy ALL their provinces and SCORCH EARTH all of them and DEFEAT their armies in ONE MILLION BATTLES, they still spawn back to 100% health in a few days. Not to mention that if you have for example 10 provinces you can make a 10 unit army while the enemy can make like a 30 unit army for the same ammount of provinces with same development and everything. Its just a big unfair pile of %^& to give you the illusion of a challenge.. A Masterpiece! A game with countless opportunities form strategy RTS to national RPG to history simulator, it spans a wide array of tates and play styles. The replayability is immense, the music superb - the only real downside is that it becomes harder for the developers to think of something deserving to be added via DLC.. Best game ever made at strategy I suggest you play with Voltaire's Nightmare mod Its amazing.. Good strategy game which supported with DLCs but has too much bug and unbalanced stuff. So many possibilities. Perfect strategy game. Europa universalis series always provides good entertainment.. Excellent strategy that I keep returning to. My biggest complaint is Paradox business model that revolves around introducing small patch-like changes, calling them expansions. Many changes are basically things that should be from the day 1, or fixes to overall balance they ruined with previous ""expansions"". If you count all the little expenses for the important expansions and the game itself, it's insane cost that Eu4 put up with because they are really passionate about it.. This is one of the best strategy games that I have ever seen. Europa Universalis IV has a vast and complex political/economic mechanic, with lots of things to explore throughout the campaign. Its political mechanic may be very hard to understand in the beginning of the game, with very different government types, religions, cultures, estates, etc. But when you understand these mechanics, you are able to play a very long and fun campaign, with colonization, revolutions, revolts, bribery, and hundreds of others events available in the game. 10/10. Ernesto Baratheon. What can I say, this is my fave game of all time. If you have any interest in playing a game where you can change the outcome of history, well, this it it. I would never have thought something could ever replace the Total War series as my go to historical sim/ fantasy generator. Sure the learning curve is a bit steep, but nothing like EU 2 or 3. So rich and detailed, so rewarding.. If you like long play strategy with impressive modes, this game is for you.. This is the video game I've spent the most time on. You need a lot of time to learn and master it, but once you do, it's so addictive, especially if you're a history nerd. Replayability value of this game is huge. There are many positive things I'd say about this game, but also one negative: its DLC policy. I understand they need money and DLCs are not bad idea, but it's really shameful how are they doing it. Some DLCs have very irrelevant stuff and are not worth the price, while some other DLCs include some mechanics that are pretty essential and should've been in the base game. Also the number of main DLCs is too big, there are 15 of them in July 2020, I think. That's really too many.. Amazing game, endlessly replayable. Can be very frustrating sometimes but always fair and often extremely satisfying once you achieve your goals. The best sandbox for playing empire.. I'm gonna start off with saying that this game (without taking the DLC policy into account) is a masterpiece! It's a bunch of fun with friends, but make sure that you play with people that don't get too mad at you for betraying them, because the multiplayer side of the game is the most fun I've ever had in a game. It includes everything you need for a truly fun and immersive grand strategy experience. The main downside of the game is the DLC policy which truly is a stain on this game's legacy, as of now it costs you hundreds of euro/dollars to get all the DLC without a sale, which I would strongly advise against, personally, I got all the DLC on Humble Bundle, you should wait for a sale and then buy the game with the DLC. Or you can buy the game, then see if you enjoy it and if yes, come back when there's a sale and buy the DLC. But the upside is that if you have a friend/host who has all DLC, for the duration of the multiplayer session, all of the host's DLC will be activated for all players. I would heavily advise any Grand Strategy/History enthusiast looking for a fun game, spanning from 1444 to 1821 to choose Europa Universalis IV!. After years of development and many DLCs, this game is now an impressive work that could simulate the history and country managing. There are so many contents to the game that the learning curve would be steep, the game also had late game problems like other Paradox games. However apart from these flaws, the whole system is great and worth spend time playing.. The unbalanced countries / dynasties make multiplayer impossible. The graphic is just below average. Didn't feel entertained while playing, nor was I educated in history.. Positives: quite a lot of depth, great mods (community mods are the reason I still play the game to this day), learning curve is not too steep, which is great for someone new to grand strategy. Negatives: great powers would steamroll across the map, so if you want to roleplay history, it might get a little bit tricky.. Very interesting game with interesting mechanics. But dlc.... it is very expensive. I played this game over 800 hours by now and i have to say im not bored by now, if you are searching a game that will last you you are perfectly right with this one, but the dlc politics is like a bad joke, so expansive for basicly no content or content that should be in the main game by default. But even with that i cant rate this game bad because its that good. Probably the go to for every Grand strategy player.. This game is extremely deep and complex with a steep learning curve. But as you begin to learn the intricacies of the game it only keeps getting better and better!. Europe Universalis as we knew it, but then at its best. Great complex game, remains entertaining, but gets too easy after some time if you know how to game the system.. I'm at about 1,300 hours currently... One point knocked off for expansion/dlc practices.. I like strategy games but it's easy is hard for me. This game need to be more playable. If you write there setting named easy, than make it easy. Menus are confusing. No story and gameplay is slow. There is no depth in strategy (plots etc) .. 2500 hours in this prefect game... Difficult for beginners,but after learning its starts being very entertaining game. Europa Universalis is one of the most re-playable games that you can find. You can play for Any country from 1440-1821 period. Compare to the previous game it became much more diverse and detailed. All big nations feel unique thanks to the tree of missions and special mechanics. For the person who wants to start to play this game for the first time it will seem too complex, and most people will quit after few hours. It is a common problem for almost all Paradox games. Therefore, when you get into it will become one of your favourite strategy games. Strategy Element- 5/5 From the first moment you get a full control of your country. You control micro and macro econ, you have control over foreign policy, control over army... Re-playable element-2/2 As I said you can play for any country and as soon as you finish playing for one of them you would want to start playing for the new one. Multiplayer-0/1 Unfortunately it is almost impossible to play multiplayer. Me and my friends tried to play together but we couldn't play even at speed 4 out 5( speed of time). Our best result was speed 3, in the end we gave up since it would take us ages to finish the party. DLC-0/1 generally most of DLC are good and add interesting mechanics, but the problem is that there is more then 10+ DLC for which you need to pay 50+ dollars in total. Music-1/1 It is OK, a beat repetitive, I liked more the one in Stellaris. I never expected to like a grand strategy game. I always thought I'd be bored on a game that runs on maps. I was wrong. I spent way too many hours on trying to colonize Brazil as Venice and conquering Manchuria as Japan. The only criticism would be that it is too eurocentric. All mechanism is built with European dynamics in mind, so whichever state you choose to play feels more or less like a European state with minor touches. But after all the game's title is Europa Universalis and Paradox is a European developer. Who can blame them for designing a game just for their Western audiences?. great strategy that has captured me for many years. And still developers adding in the game content in the form of patches and dlc. EU IV is a fantastic game but with a massive caveat that really hurts the game. In itself, it's a pretty fun game that allows you to take any nation in the world somewhere before the start of World Exploration all the way to the French Revolution and basically turn them into a superpower. Even if you're not playing the game, you can just sit back and watch the AI spin the world in all sorts of ways. The only real downside (and why I'm not giving this a 10) have to be the DLCs. Don't get me wrong, Paradox still updates the game and the DLCs do keep the game alive as well but they can be pretty expensive at times, which really hurts the game, as some of those DLCs are actually pretty important for the game to be... well, properly playable. Still, a blast to play nonetheless, but this does become a bit of an issue pretty often.. Pro+ - best grand strategy - alternative world history... transforming my country to the World Empire Cons- - tons DLC - DLC politics - expensive DLC. I've played over 5000 hours of this game. It's easily the best game ever made, and probably will still hold that title until I die. The key to longevity is a good AI, the key to a good AI is a game with SIMPLE mechanics, but LOTS of them, so that the challenge comes from balancing the interactions between all of the many systems... but each system it's self is simple enough for an ai to do correctly. This inevitably means the game is very hard to 'get into' ... because in order to even be competent you need to learn dozens of systems and how they interact. But stick with it.. Simply the best game every made. Incredibly deep with endless replayability, constant free updates and support.. With all DLC included this becomes one of the best grand strategy game ever made.. I am impressed with Paradox's work. A complex game that makes you learn something new about it every time you play it. It may take hundreds of hours of gameplay to master the harder difficulties.. This game is good and has potential, but many of the features baffle my head. I love the idea of colonialism in Grand Strategy Games, but most of the games that use the mechanic add too much to the idea, making it way to confusing. Overall, EU4 is a game with great potential and a great battle system, but many mechanics make it confusing.. I have decided to give this game negative review, because too many pieces which should have been in base game, are in DLC. Transforming your country into Empire, designating a March, increasing development, are few example, which in base game wondered how it can be done and checked online only to learn, that it is in DLC. And it is not one or two DLC, or some cheap DLC, but expensive DLCs. Secondly, new updates regularly are ruining my saves. This game is a huge meh, and definitely the WORST paradox game I've played. Compared to HoI and Crusader Kings this is just awful. Mostly boring and trying to give the impression that there's actually a lot of options, while having very little actual substance. In the end the whole thing still feels unfinished and lazy. It really doesn't help that just like so many other games it still basically boils down to fighting wars, therefore battles, which like so many other games just comes down to luck. Although this is especially lazy by just determining it through literal dice rolls which it shows you. Still absolutely stoked to see which insta-power buttons the Indonesians will get in the 2019 ""expansion"".. One of my most played games ever. I have over 2500 hours in this game, putting it behind only Diablo 2 as my second most played game of all time. However, I can not recommend the game in its current state. Each patch since 1.19 has felt incomplete, and has left the game feeling hollow and half built. The changes to the mission system and addition of government reforms seem to also indicate a development trend towards shoveling out low effort DLC and slapping a $15 price tag on it while not addressing serious underlying issues with game mechanics (most notably naval combat and subject AI, both of which have been major requests of the community for years). At this point in the game's life span, it seems to be best to wait and hope for an EUV rather than invest the $200+ to get all the gameplay changing DLCs. Europa Universalis 4 is absolutely gigantic strategy game and it hits the balance between depth and accessibility just right.. I know this not a new game but it is forme, so i like so much the game than i created my account here only to put 10 for this game and make my contribution from him. I was a gamer more when i was more young and i realy love this game make me fell i have 17 again and make mi fink only in this game all the day. So i want to say thanks a lot to make him. About the game i just want to say is not easy game but learn him make the all the diference and is reward because is change all your oppnion about him. Have pacience padwan and you make there.. 3 words : Paradox dlc whoring. As usual this game is empty without the numerous tiny dlcs paradox spews over the years.. Choose the Ottoman Empire and capture the world. but remember, if you do not select that , Ottoman chooses you.. ""Europe 4"" - the same tool for conducting historical experiments, like its predecessor seven years ago. On our conscience is the fate of an individual state taken. We are free to control it as we please: build up the royal army and fight with its neighbors on the mainland, create a whole state of merchants and subdue trade to ourselves, find the New World and appropriate its wealth ... but what's that? Game tools quite accurately simulate domestic and foreign policy. Take the indicator of stability: the higher it is, the greater the tax collected, the risk of rebellion is less - the light is brighter and it is easier to breathe. Will leave in a minus - welcome to tartarary! And there is inflation and likes to become hyperinflation, if you are lucky at gold deposits. And also - all kinds of indicators of the economy, trade, fatigue from war, contentment and discontent, military and naval traditions - and everything should be looked at, without forgetting the plan in case of force majeure. Well, the war, of course. Here, war is a special case of diplomacy, not a daily bread, like anywhere in Total War, and not a thorn in the ass like in Civilization V. War can only be useful for its initiator and for those who were ready for it and found her application. Somehow - shake out the money from old enemies to pay off their debts on credit, or force the defeated to release a few small nations who are sure to want to be friends with us. The war is not welcome here. The seizure of provinces or even complete annexation is possible only if the enemy has a small area, and you have a monstrous preponderance in the armed forces. At the same time, the aggressiveness index of the initiating power will soar to the ceiling, which will be bad for the opinion of the surrounding countries. Believe me, they will remember your aggressive appetites and will do anything to prevent new victims. Therefore, it is necessary to fight war carefully, looking at the public and spending.. This is the more advanced version of civ you can make your own countries once you get the el dorado dlc this and cities are the best paradox games the game traces back history to 2 ad once you get the extended timline this game can bascally played infinity and you still have stuff to do. I dont know, how people can give this game 10/10. For me this means, this game is at least almost perfect and there are only little mistakes. In my view this game has more than just little mistakes. First of all, this game is 5 years old and it costs a lot of money (over 200€), because it has countless DLCs. Some of the content should be in the base game, so this politics makes me very suspicious. In addition there are 2 DLCs with metal soundtrack, in most of the cases to find out later, that you dont want **** cant make it more obvious how commercial EU4 is. In addition you cant buy everything retail, only on Steam...what I will never do. Another",Europa Universalis IV (EU4) is a captivating strategy game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive . the game provides an immersive experience of establishing and managing a grand empire during a historical period spanning from 1444 to . players can choose various nations and play their roles on the world stage throughout history .
808.Sonic Mania Plus,"That’s basically a skin of Sonic Mania Plus. 4/10. You could have added Amy, Big, Creme Or even Blaze.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game reminded me why I hate games with lives. Remove that and it'd be great. Still recommend it, especially liked the Puyo Puyo Tetris jumpscare.. Could’ve have a slightly better flow, orignal level design and gimmicks, it’s mostly well designed although Sonic Generations and the orginal classics did it way better it’s still a solid game but not the best Sonic game you could play.. this game is fantastic, with minor mistakes, and a must-have because of his price. I love this addition of an already masterfully crafted tribute to the classic games here. Sonic Mania Plus is one of the best sonic games of all time the great soundtrack the great art style by far one, the best sonic games of this generation. Very good game with few bugs, new and old stages to please retro fans, but it fails in the special stages. On the contrary to forces, this was damn near a perfect experience. There was barely anything in this game I didn't enjoy. The only thing i didn't being ray's controls, but maybe that's just me. Other than that, each stage feels different from the last, and the soundtrack is absolutely immaculate. Highly reccomend this to anyone.. This is one of the best games of all time, I will not elavorate in my opinion it is that good. The best Sonic game yet for all the sonic fans out there. İts kind like a remake to me.. Good 2d sonic game, pretty fun and is outstanding on a first playthrough but thats the issue,a lot of this games merit comes from a blind first playthrough, otherwise its just a sonic 3 rom hack with almost no original zones, further sementing itself as a sonic 3 rom hack. Great however it can be a bit difficult and I just got finished with the metal Sonic boss battle which was difficult. I love it!. It's no doubt that this is something the Sonic series really needed. The game builds upon all the classics, and improves on every aspect of gameplay and music. The only issue I have with this game is just how unoriginal it is. It's very fun, but almost every level theme is just taken from the older games. The level designs are new, but the music and visuals are merely just remixed versions of the classic stages. I'm not trying to say the game is bad, not at all. I'm just trying to say that originality would've been far better. The Sonic franchise during this time period was flooded in nostalgia-bait, and having more original levels would've been a million times better.. I had been waiting for another great 2D sonic game for such a long time; the game definitely delivers and proves to be one of my favorite games of all time. Whether it’s the new zones like press garden or the remastered zones like **** speedway, even the new characters Mighty and Ray this game brings something truly special to the table.. The only good Sonic game does it again, giving us slightly more content. Thanks, Sega. If only this was in the base game.. My (previously) favourite game of all time. Gameplay is fantastic, music is fantastic, everything in this game is fantastic.. This game not only one of the greatest 2D platformers ever made, but it is the greatest 2D platformer ever made. Not much in this world is as good as Sonic Mania, but being balls deep in a concrete wall with sponges on the inside is pretty nice too. This game is so good, I would actually pay my taxes and start investing in startups, but sadly I cannot play Sonic Mania on my Smart Fridge, so really it's a 9. I don't really care tho, bc I'm already built like a steam roller. Sonic Mania is so good, I could actually get off my ass and go to the gym, and stop living a diet consisting of only blue Gatorade powder and hot sticky syrup sandwiches. Perchance. Maybe if Sonic got rid of that yee yee asudh haircut he has, he'd get some slogblwag on his chilli dog. Perchance. Is the Fortnite battle pass really beneficial for our developing youth? With the rise of Generation Alpha, the skibbidi toilet scientists have discovered that kids ages 7-10 when in contact with the Fortnite Battlepass start violently hitting the giddy like quirked up white boys. Forensic Scientists call this ""griddy"" a reaction that happens when the immune system is invaded by the Battlepass waves. Is it safe for our children? To answer this question, we look to the 1919 bombing attacks of Little Rock Arkansas. The bombings racked in a toll of over 265 deaths. This catastrophic event was caused by Quandale Dingler, not to be confused with the late Quandale Dingle. Were this attacks done out of Ohio rizz? Maybe not, but it often makes me think about humanity's role in the universe. Like how Sonic in Sonic Mania hits the Fortnite on Tails. End. The lesson we've learned today kids is to never smoke weed while writing a Metacritic reveiw. Plerchance. I am in debt with the IRS. Spoiler Alert: Also, Batman dies. this game defined my childhood the game is the greatest thing i have laid my hand on. i can cannot put into words how much i love this game. Love this game. 2-d Sonic done correctly and it feels so good. The addition of Ray and Mighty freshen the game up and the Encore mode is tough as nails. This game feels like a lost Sonic game that was just released and that is high praise indeed.. Rip off should have been in OG game.. Peak Classic Sonic Platforming, take notes sega, graphics arent everything!. Masterpiece This game is literally PERFECT,from the bottom to the top. There's isn't a single flaw, one of the greatest 2D sidescrolling EVER MADE!. One of the best Sonic games. One of the best Sonic games, a true love letter to the classic sonic games.. Sonic Mania is a really fun game. However, I feel like this game relies too much on nostalgia. The game is also very short, and there were a few random difficulty spikes. Like most games, Sonic Mania has its flaws, but it is still enjoyable and I think it is worth buying.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is literally perfection, and all a fan of the genesis era Sonic games could ever dream of.. Visually, the game is an absolute blast. Also quite a few characters to play as. It's really a perfect remake of the original games if you liked those. I'm probably one of the few people who are more into Sonic Rush, Rush Adventure and Colors (DS)-style levels though. I always found the rush system to be perfect for blasting through stages and it feels so much more satisfying than constantly getting stuck on walls and just everywhere. Precise platforming is also incredibly hard in Mania. You know, jumping around moving blocks for example. My only complaint really is just the difficulty. Just like the OG games, if you're not good at this kind of game in general, it will take a few tries to get good in levels. Which is fine, but it can be frustrating. Especially running out of lives in the final boss stage and having to repeat pretty long levels just to try again. I have not figured out a way to farm lives either, so yeah. The difficulty is the only thing that I didn't enjoy a lot!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it isn't better than the original game, the levels don't let you fully control ray, mighty is literally broken, it is still very fun and the visuals are incredible. Fantastic visuals, great level design, and wondrous music. Sonic Mania/Mania Plus not only celebrates Sonics past perfectly, but it improves on it by making it unique as possible.. Of what I’ve played thus far, it’s pretty decent. The gameplay is nice, and it’s nice to see new things from SEGA, old and new.. Its awesome game but it would be more awesome if they release it on sega mega drive/genesis back on late 80,early 90.. In the words of Harry Dunne from Dumb and Dumber. Sonic, ""You totally redeem yourself!"" The only thing I didn't like was the Knuckle's gameplay. His low jump made some of the bosses a little annoying. Other than that. A great reboot!. Sonc Mania is always good, and now with more characters and new levels its even better. The only problem is that the game suffers from classic Sonic Issues, but its a pretty good and solid game.. Not gonna lie, I wanted to see if this game was actually good a few years ago and I didn't really like it due to how much this game relies on nostalgia bait. The graphics are fricking horrible. This game would have been way better if it was released back in the 90's era. This isn't the time to release something like this, especially due to it being the 3d era of Sonic. It's not the time to release a fricking 2d Sonic game. Due to this being a fangame, I thought this would be better than a official sonic game but no, I was indeed wrong.. The atmosphere of the game is on point. Its like playing a sonic game from the 80s. The length is ok. Sonic Mania is an amazing game and Sonic Mania Plus improves and raises Sonic Mania level by a lot worth buying Sonic Mania Plus !!!. This game is my all time favorite, it really reminds us all why Sonic was great to begin with! Anyone who played the genesis games will feel their nostalgia kick in while playing this game. The music is great (as with all Sonic games), the sprites are bright and lively, and the level design is fantastic! To me, what makes a great Sonic game is levels that let you speed through at sonic speed, but also have many different paths and secret areas to explore, and different playable characters with different abilities to explore with! There is nothing I don't like about this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sonic is a franchise I've ALWAYS wanted to talk about. My childhood revolved around Sonic in many different ways to the point I can say with confidence it improved my life way more than any other franchise has. As a fan of both Classic and Modern, this game was right up my alley. Despite reading about them all the time in Archie comics, this was the first time I really payed attention to Mighty and Ray. Now, what I'm about to say may sound insane, but bear with me. Sonic Mania Plus is not, in fact, the best Sonic game. Of course, while it improved everything we all loved about Classic Sonic, I really need to nitpick in one specific area. I'm not sure if it's just me, but both special stages (Blue Spheres and Catch the UFO) are mercilessly difficult and drove me to the point that I thought Mania Plus was actually bad. Of course I'm aware Mania is amazing and it's possible I just lost my touch, but playing other classic Sonic titles, I never had this much trouble with the special stages. However, every cloud has a silver lining, and these special stages are no exception. The satisfaction of overcoming it is a feeling that will stick with you for a good while after. Despite its difficulty the stages are colorful and the music is above and beyond. Even if I'm certain my next attempt will end in failure, I still find myself looking for the giant special rings. Sonic Mania Plus also has two player VS, which only improves this almost perfect game. Wether you're looking for a nostalgia trip, or you want to prove your Nintendo obsessed friend wrong about Sonic never being good, Mania Plus is your best bet. Again, my only real issues lie in the difficulty of the Special Stages. I can't recommend this gem enough.. Sonic Mania Plus is an amazing return to form for Sonic the Hedgehog with even more content than the digital release. The physical release is a great package that is definitely worth the money and it includes an art book. This game is perfect for classic Sonic fans as the levels are very well designed, the gameplay feels as great as it did over 25 years ago, and the soundtrack is excellent. Special thanks to the Sonic fans that developed this fantastic Sonic game.. Sonic mania does what it should do. Excellent gameplay, Amazing level designs. This game was my favorite since my childhood and it is still fun for modern day. BGMs are great also. The bad part, however, is a lack of online COOP, otherwise I would give a 10. Fun game. I hope they bring more levels.. This game, This game..... I love it HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE ALREADY PLAYED THIS GAME GO TO THE STORE AND BUY IT THIS INSTANT ITS ONLY 15$ IT WON'T RUIN YOUR COLLAGE FUND JUST GO SHOW THESE NERDS WITH THEIR PCS WHERE THE DANG MONEY IS AT.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Why did I want to play this game? I have never played a Sonic game before but obviously being around video games for 25 years, I have heard a ton about Sonic. I mostly heard bad things about the franchise but then this game came out and I heard universal praise. I figured this game is the perfect game to finally give Sonic a try. What did I not like about it? I know how stupid this makes me sound but I just don't get the game. I understand the core of always be running and always move to the right. But first off, it's so jarring when you lose momentum but then there is also the issue of all of these multiple paths and none of it feels fun or rewarding. I just don't get it. Sonic is not for me. How much time did I put into it? I put about 3 or 4 into the game, it was enough for me to know that this isn't for me. Will I try it again at some point? No, I'm good. I will let Sonic fans have this one and I will stay far away from this franchise.. Just a classic game in a physical disc........... a must have........................................... Probably my favorite platformer of all time and definitely the best Sonic game out there even better than the originals.. It's been almost a year since Sonic Mania has been released to the world and everyone soon fell in love with the game and it's no secret that the team behind Sonic Forces admits loving Sonic Mania as well by connecting the events of the two games together for rather two epic games to play for the price of one. I think it was time for Sonic Mania to get an upgrade due to the critical success of Sonic Mania and the fact that it's literally impossible to get a physical copy of the game. Introducing Sonic Mania Plus, an upgraded Sonic Mania that includes even more things that might as well make it even better than its original form, it has more nostalgia written into it than what Sonic Mania could ever have to surprise its fans into wanting more.. With the addition of encore mode, this game is cemented as the best sonic game of all time. Exactly what 2d fans have wanted for 15 years. It is hard to think of anything more that could have been done to improve this game but with some well chosen additions, the package now feels complete.. This DLC is good but dumb at the same time the encore mode is boring but might and ray saves the DLC, the encore mode big rings are too hard to find but character switching is a good idea :) but there is quality problems to, like when you play egg revierie with mighty and ray (which only you can access with level select) they are not flying but walking in the air this is just dumb, okay i can understand might beacuse he as no flying sprite but ray he as flying animation and he is still walking in the air, okay one last complain mighty's ability isnt that usefull compare to ray,knuckles,tail and sonic, this dlc is good concept is good encore modes'color palet change is cool but he as problems but it still worth it. This game is literally perfection, and all a fan of the genesis era Sonic games could ever dream of.. Sonic Mania was already an awesome 2D platform game but with Sonic Mania Plus the game is just perfect. More stages to play, more characters each with unique gameplay to play and many more things to do it's simple : just buy it, to experience the amazing experience this videogame has to offer!. a absolute must buy. the best sonic game ever, simply perfect in every aspect. The perfect Sonic game! better than anything launched in this series! congratulations!. simply amazing, mania team outdid themselves this time around! simply gourgeous!. Astonishing package, this is certainly the best Sonic game of all time, congrats Christian Whitehead and the team.","this game is fantastic, with minor mistakes, and a must-have because of his price . it's one of the best sonic games of all time the great soundtrack the great art style by far one ."
809.NBA 2K16,"One many can argue the ""Last Great"" 2K game. Personally I can see why, soundtrack still holds up. The graphics are still great, the gameplay while not as perfect as some make it out to be is still a fun experience. My Career? A bit on the cheesy side but 2K sure has done worse , B-Fresh anyone? Overall, solid game.. Great Game LEBRON ofc so its very good so yeah its too great too good and i luv it. The best 2K game. It had everything: a great MY CAREER, great gameplay, and an amazing soundtrack.. Sound Quality still stands as the best heard throughout the series, even after 8 years or so.. at this point im only writing reviews so i can actually look back on my score... screw you metacritic for only allowing you to look back at games you reviewed rather than just scored. This Game Us The Best In History, Graphics, Defense Is Fantastic, Shot Timing Was Good! NBA 2K16 > NBA 2K22. Wanted to start playing basketball games again since I haven't really been into the sport since 2006. Tried 2k22 and realized whi I don't like basketball games then my friend told me to try this one and even tho it's older, best basketball game on the ps4. Best My Career ever with solid gameplay and a top tier MyTeam. This game is a classic for a reason.. This game is 2k18 but before 18 came out. Story was good. Gameplay just like 18's gameplay. Game is pay to win. I barely have fun playing it and most people call it the 2k ever when there is zero fun to have in it. 2k17 was a lot more funner than this dog ****. This is one of the best 2ks of all time it was so fun, 2k16 and 2k17 were just great games. Computer defense is literally denis Rodman on meth it really takes away from the game literally no one can beat curry 1v1 not cause of his offense with would be correct but for curry to clamp so hard Kobe couldnt make a layup or even get close to the basket. the king of sports games!! 100% recommended! The closest I've seen of reality!. The first NBA 2K I played. All Modes are pretty cool to be honest only thing I don't like is that the servers are shut down so fast, so you have to get a newer title more often. I did not know that the franchise did not evolve but devolve for the next titles therefore 2K16 gets a much higher score than the following 2Ks.. I think everyone here knows by now that the story in this game is just so bad, and it is. I am not one to usually play the nba series games and this one was the only one I actually played (I have 2k15 but never play it). This game was free also, just thought I would mention that because it does sway my review a bit because I never actually payed for the game. I think this game though is simple enough for me to like because I didn't waste money on something and I had no expectations going in on what to expect. I honestly still play this version of NBA regardless that there are two new installments out right now. I know the story is bad, I know the gameplay isn't perfect, but honestly I have spent so much time playing this game that I really have no legit reason to complain or give it a bad score. Time flew when I played this game and it even still does now. I can't complain. I have enjoyed it thus far. **** trash simple as that playing on a harder difficulty doesn't make the AI smarter you can't hit wide open threes with kobe for example while the AI seems to make every shot even when heavily contested, shaq the most dominant player ever can't even score on curry in the post realistic my **** career is trash aswell you either grind to get vc or you can buy it wow wtf is this a f2p game? Was having fun at the beginning but after playing this game for a long time i realized it's flaws if a player is hot or is just dominating will be double teamed (ok that happens in real life) until the end of the game... always leaving someone open guess what in higher dificultys even if you pass it to a open shooter you still gonna miss, if you play on all star for example you'll get double teamed even if you pass the ball to the shooter and hit shot's the AI will keep leaving him open because the other player has 30 points . Speed doesn't seem to matter either some times centers will run at the same speed if not faster than point gards . - Unrealistic / Higher difficulties are just cheese - My career mode is Garbage - A lot of bugs - Amazing graphics - Micro transactions break the game This will be my first and last 2k game greedy **** put the same game every year with updated rosters. Stay away from this game if you want a realistic and immersive basketball experience.. The game-play is just not fun. It feels sluggish, and the margin for error on anything is really low. I suppose it is all in the name of realism. I got this with a friend and we would have sequences like: missed layup, offensive rebound, missed wide open jumper, defensive rebound, turn-over, turn-over, kickball. Leaning jumper scoring on 4 guys. Time-out. The entire rhythm of the game is frustrating and slow for a casual gamer like me. Yea yea, I hear all you 2k-ragers saying ""@#$%$#$% you NOOB @#$@#% play NBA LIVE."" I played 2k15 and really enjoyed it, but I suppose I will check out NBA LIVE from now on. I don't feel like spending hours and hours just to learn how to dribble a basketball all over again. Or weeks of game play just to hit an open jumper. I suppose people with lots of time on their hands get their kicks out of this but I am a pass.... Games are only as good as two things. For PvE, they are only as good as their AI at the highest levels. For PvP, they are only as good as they are able to resolve what happens when two players DO something to each other at the same time (assuming the game doesn't suffer from fundamental network issues). This game is terrible at both.. Great NBA game, has a fun interactive be a pro mode. The game can be hard for beginners, but it is easily one of the best sport games out there. I recommend playing this with a friend or online.. There are so many glitches in this game its infuriating. Career is badly thought through, with preset characters allowing little room for freedom for the player. Even in regular game mode, players that are not controlled by the user him or herself will randomly walk around the floor at times, leaving their opposition wide open. Shots that are considered A grade will regularly miss, whilst the opposing Cpu will consistently hit shots that are tightly contested. Overall this game makes me so angry regularly due to the way it glitches out. They probably wont fix it because they are 2k, so I would just wait for the new version to come out and pray its actually playable.. I'm just writing at least 150 characters because I wanted to save this review in a more convenient way to look back at scores that I had given stuff as a user.. NBA 2k has been easily exceeding over the past few years. But personally seems as if 2k is taking really slow small steps. While NBA 2k16 easily being the best NBA game out there, there are some things that I noticed. For one it is almost the same thing as last years game (2k15) An upgrade was the story mode. The story mode was entertaining but also has its little things. Myplayer is great, but during the story, the players name is Frequency Vibration. I would like to choose my name instead of being given one considering it is my player. Another thing is that the story mode makes you come from the projects and you are from an African American family. All is fine cause it is a story, but also is myplayer. The story was produced by Spike Lee, and it kind of did give a feeling of ""not me"" Some positives include the story line, you get to start from high school, and choose your college, limited choices. The online gameplay, Mypark, is and upgrade as well as you get to play with other people after joing a group. You get to battle opposing groups and have different competitions. The gameplay overall is good but could be better. Feels very one sided, (offense) as defence is much more harder. The controls can be confusing at times. The gameplay to me seemed a little slow, I like a faster more excitement type of gameplay. Overall it is the best game out there, but not much of difference other than the myplayer story mode and mypark. For 2k fanatics would be a great game. For those that love playing basketball games, it is a good product but can get boring at times or even frustrated. 2k servers have some work to do. I would recomment that if you absolutely want it, get it, but if you can hold off for a year, these problems will be solved. I rate it a 5 because it is almost the same thing as 2k14, the rest is because again the myplayer and mypark.. It appears to me that 2K Sports spent much efforts in making more money by in-game purchases, instead of perfecting the game-play. This is a CONSOLE GAME, not a cheap cell phone game.. this is the worst my career ever. you cannot do a fast small forward like durant or lebron or carmelo. If you make a small forward inside, he's only gonna be 80 in layup, ***kin 80 man!!! that's the stupidest thing i ever heard man for real. Also, if you make a 6'1'' point guard, you can only be 86 in speed:who the *uck made this game was high as hell. THE WAIT TIMES For career mode and there is an incredible load time for every game This game drags you along and makes you sit through every cut scene. There is a skip feature but it still makes you sit through the first few seconds of everything, (pregame shows, postgame shows. timeouts, freethrows, inbound passes, etc) It gets so frustrating I want to throw my controller at the screen in hopes it hits a secret button that allows me to get back the part of my life that was wasted on this. Spike lee creates a story line that gives your character a preset personality, this was a big turn off for me. Your character is already set on an egotistical show-off personality which was a real turn off for me because it's not the sort of player I wish to be. The story line then goes on to try to convince you to feel sorry for your best friend who is an awful terrible human being that refuses to take responsibility for anything in life and would end up in the same spot in life no matter what. They don't have as many interviews in the game which is really disappointing because that was one of the few features that let you develop your characters personality. Overall the gameplay is really fun and I think does a good job of all the mechanics. If they did not have all the waiting time in gameplay and made some changes to the story making this more open I might rate this a 9.. Great game BUT too much, too much, and again too much loading... Extremely slow interface. When you play a game, and internet goes down, you cant play a game. That would be the negative sides. The positive are: great graphics, great ingame physics, movement and best of all: great AI tactics. Its like I am really playing basketball with friend.. Loading times for junk! That pretty much sums up the game. If there was a way to just play the game without having to wait for all the junk you don't even care about to load it might be an average game. The game does allow you to skip through the junk but only after it make you wait to load it. I played ""My career"" mode for as long as I could stand (which was about an hour). Made the mistake of making a PW. Wanted to create a KD type of player, instead I ended up with a Kwame Brown. My guy was 6'10"" but couldn't dunk the ball. His nickname was ""The Freq"", which I guess is fitting because if you are that tall and can't dunk you are a freak. It's the same game as last year with a new sound track and a more annoying My career mode. I understand progression is part of the game but seriously any ""5 star"" recruit should already be able to dominate the court in high school and college. This game apparently feels a great high school and college basketball player is simply taller than their opponent and progression begins in the pros. A terrible mode and any money they wasted on a ""Spike Lee Joint"" would have been better spent on developing a more dynamic engine or figuring out a way to eliminate the constant long loading times that plague this game. Very disappointed.. So I've had 2k16 since release and now since its PlayStation plus freebie I've decided to do a review. NBA 2k16 is a great sports game and is one of the best on the market. The gameplay now is better then before and now you actually have to know how to play basketball and call plays in order to win the game. Another thing is that there is no more scoring countless of contested shots either. The new game modes seem to be good. With the play now online now its encourages you to choose lower ranked teams as you'll get more rewards and you have to "" play to win"" with their new ranking system. Myteam looks the same with the nice new addition of the gauntlet mode and Myleague and MYGM have new customization that are fun to mess around with. Also another strong point is the new Myplayer customizations and improvements, I felt like the new improvements actually felt like you were getting better rather than buying everything. But now here are the downsides that keep this game away from perfect 10. First of all NBA 2K is an annual release so if you have an updated roster you can probably stick to NBA 2k15. and secondly is Mycareer. The new Spike Lee directed Mycareer mode felt like you were controlling someone else's career rather then yours hence ruining the name MYcareer. Overall 2k16 is a dominate sports and even if you don't get it free it deserves the $50-$40 purchase that it is.. This series **** and I decided to look at the most loved game out of the franchise well god it's BAD! Why? The graphics look like the other games as usual. The controls are terrible and I find the game has little variety. This game **** and the whole series ****. If you like sports THEN JUST PLAY IT!. Nba2k16 (Ps4) is the best Nba game i ever played in years! the graphics is great the players look exactly the same you can see the shoes that their wearing it's awesome! i can not wait to play Nba2k17 : ). All I ever play is MyCareer and it ****. The story is not about ""My Player"" but instead the one it forces you to be, and it forces you to play through 2 NBA seasons without being able to really upgrade your player significantly despite starting you out with abysmal stats and abilities.. While NBA 2K16 is the best basketball game in the market currently, it does not make up for the fact that it is absolute garbage and full of awkwardness and **** To begin, the featured Spike Lee joint, ""Livin' Da Dream,"" is very boring, full of clichés, and constantly losses your attention and caused me to skip basically all of the scenes. They are not necessary to watch and practically nothing you do on the court will correspond with the story. Oh, and don't even try creating a white MyPlayer because your entire family will be black while you are white. The gameplay, while is sometimes enjoyable, is an awkward **** Simply moving around on the court becomes a challenge when your player is a magnet towards every other damn opponent. Trying to detach yourself from the players is as hard as ripping dried tar off your skin. This leads to many ""defensive breakdowns"" which will lower your teammate grade a metric **** decreasing the amount of currency (VC) you will earn at the end. On top of this, every time you lose the ball it feels random and cheap; you can never predict when you'll have the ball stolen. For all actions, the game chooses animations to perform them such as for lay ups or receiving passes. A lot of the time the animations that it chooses **** you over. For example, rather than taking a simple open lay up with a defender trailing behind me, the game decides to have my player do a one-handed dunk allowing the player behind me to swat it away. Surprisingly, for a game this unpolished there are quite a few modes. The most important, and fun ones, are MyPark and MyCareer. While both use the same player that you create, these modes allow you to play with friends in pick-up 2v2 or 3v3 games in between loading screens that are longer than a ****ing turtle's lifespan. As well as this, ProAm lets you play on a 5 player team with your friends against other teams. I found most fun in these modes, while the rest are pretty basic and somewhat useless (I'm looking at you 2KTV). To conclude, NBA 2K16 is the best basketball game out there, but the gameplay itself is still lacking much polish and fluidness. I'd rather just play FIFA instead.. I can't play with my name Diogo? WTF? Ridicolous. The game is a lot worst than 2k15 and 2k14................................................................................ I've been playing this series since 2k5, and I have to say- this may be the most disappointing title in the franchise (alright, 2k7 may have been worse). Historically, the graphics have improved with each new year, but this latest installment looks like it may have even taken a step back from 2k15. The gameplay doesn't feel any smoother; the play-calling is awkward to bring up at times; the cut-scenes are marathons and require waiting before skipping; the soundtrack is exceedingly limited; and the MyPlayer mode is heinous. 2k has partnered with Spike Lee to create a drama-nstrosity, where your player is supposed to be able to experience all the ups and downs of making it into the pros. However, the script hijacks your player, makes all decisions for you, and forces you to keep track of a tedious and long-winded plot about how your underprivileged, ghetto-born player copes with the struggles of his almost comically dramatic past. Certainly, I don't want to have MY PLAYER'S script written without my input. Ugh. I'm sure Spike Lee thought he was being ""edgy,"" and ""Avant-garde,"" by showing ""lyfe 'n 'da streetz,"" but it comes off as overdone and tiresome. I hope 2k never attempts a project this poor again. 2/10, I may be finished with this franchise.. This game is completely unplayable, I think it has something to do with the update servers, but don't expect to actually be able to play the game when you load it up, there will be an update which downloads painfully slowly. I am lucky that I didn't actually pay any money for this game (PS Plus) because if I did I would be furious. I would like to review the actual gameplay of this game, but I am not going to waste my life waiting for every 0.0001 MB to download. Awful, just plain awful.. I downloaded this game mostly for the career. I've always enjoyed sports titles with any kind of ""story mode"" aspect. (maybe one of the best examples being champion mode in fight night champions) But, this career mode is not very good. I think 2k needs to stay far from any Spike Lee influence for the next title because I really did not like his take on the career mode. It felt very cheesy. And the games graphics do not look 4th gen. The player models look, for lack of a better word, crappy.. Online is broken as usual. MyPlayer is boring. Game is kind of tedious to be honest. Maybe its because I'm getting tired of sports games like this. Like the soundtrack though.. Would be very good if it didn't make you work for in game currency. Playing this I kept wondering if the developers are having a huge laugh behind everyone's back. You pay full price for this game to relax and enjoy it as entertainment but it forces you to still grind and work to get the in game currency called VC. I did some research and you can get it by installing a phone app and grinding through some card game every day, secondly you can earn some VC points by watching the in game tv with ads. What a hilarious joke that no one is laughing at. Pay full game price and then pay more money for micro transactions if you don't want to work for it. Of course you can play the game for free, but remember if you are a casual gamer and not ready to spend months grinding enough to make your game play fun don't buy this.. PS+ freebie June 2016: So, PS+ time again, and at last another AAA title for free, £55, for free. I assume this is only on the EU release as free, given our lack of love for Basketball! It's true, I don't really understand or like Basketball, so this is a review from that view-point. Unlike other sports sims, I found my first game of NBA2K16 actually really REALLY refreshing. Firstly, no commentary. If you're going to invest a lot of hours into a sports game, as I have in ProEvo in the past, I've grown to detest the commentary. First few plays its always okay - after hearing the same comments over and over again, it becomes like a knife in the side every time they repeat the sentence for the 4th or 5th time within 10 minutes. Instead, NBA2K16 has a soundtrack. Which I've liked so far! My understanding of basketball is that it's a game of attrition. The matches aren't about scoring as much as 'breaking the oppositions serve' as such. It's a given that the majority of runs at the hoop will see points, and the game makes this very fluid and very easy. I found using the Square button to shoot a little confusing at first, and my first game vs a friend was dominated by both of us endlessly travelling - but a few games in, I started using the right stick and shoulder botton's more for tricks, quick turns and extremely fluid play. I also figured out the balance of the game sits with your defence line blocking more than they block of you. To compare this to another sports title - I would compare it to the old NHL on the mega-drive. Something clicked with that game, it was very fast, simple to play, hard to master - and NBA2K16 feels like that. It took me literally 8 games to get a slam dunk in as such. As someone that has little understanding of the sport, or any knowledge of teams past knowing Michael Jordan, I am surprised at how enjoyable this game is. If you don't catch it on PS+, I would recommend paying up to £25 for this on future sales - but given its a sports sim, it will probably have an annual release and this version will be bargain bucket on ebay within the year if not!. The best basketball sim available with tons of game modes and heaps of option. There is literally 100s of hours in this game if you have the time to invest. I do however have 2 gripes, 1 minor, the other major. Its a little too realistic to the point that it restricts gameplay. The shot mechanic is very hard to get used to and I find myself watching the gauge instead of the game. Then again every time you sink a shot it feels that little bit more rewarding. Now, the major gripe. Holy Hell 2K what were you thinking with the Story Mode!? It is hands down the most ridiculous and worst video game story in the history of video games. I love Spike Lee, most of his movies are fantastic but the ""brush"" he has tainted 2K with is too glaringly obvious to ignore. I created a character to represent MYSELF therefore I made a white male with a beard; woah and behold the story FORCES my character to have a blatantly African American voice, be a twin of an African American sister and have African American parents. I could not believe that there were no options. And speaking of options, the story branches into what you would expect to be ""Choice"" situations, like which shoes do I like? which friend to I cut off etc etc. There are no choices what-so-ever and you're shunted on by the narrative which is, in effect, a poor man's He Got Game. No doubt 2K realises the huge mistake they made using the Spike Lee Joint to try and hook gamers (it worked on me) however it will be extremely unlikely that they take this route again. Oh, and one last thing, I started one of the owner/manager modes and who walked into the scene, my created character who I wanted nothing to do with. That's right, the game pigeon holes you into using the same broken character in whichever custom mode you play. 2K16 is a good game let down by some poor choices by the publisher. I'm looking forward to 2K17 and its step away from a Spike Lee Joint. In the mean time its Madden 16.. The number one problem in this game is the NBA 2k servers. This is the only game I have ever played that will lag you out constantly due to the terrible servers. You can barely play a series of online games before lagging out. The fact of the matter is that you will lag out at least one time when you are playing this game.. This game is so typical, yet not. the gameplay is insane, it is easily the best played sportsgame out there. but everything around it is a miss, the story just about ok, and the fact that there is a story is cool, so i don't mind that much, but i was expecting to have way more options in career mode. i like it when a sports game can explain how it works with simple setups, and yet have insane amounts of options that i don't have to fiddle with, but still be there. the character creation is **** and i also lost my cool since the first time i had to use their custom keyboard to register an account, later to find out, i had to confirm email, and then go though the horror of that keyboard again the next day. i realise im rambling here, but my main point is: gameplay = 10. everything else = a weak 6. Just another sports game only focused on selling cards not improving the game like madden and mlb the show. You can not use all of the players offline that are available to purchase online. That is just a money grab I hate all sports games now because I pay for a game and then they want me to pay for the players too.. Only reason I'm giving this a 6 is because it's pay to win. :/ But if your buying it to only play my career and offline stuff then I'd say its a great game but when it hits online there are soooo many people that are pay to win in the game its really sad that a game that could be a solid 8-10 is being marked due to P2W.. The gameplay is awesome and realistic. It feels like basketball. The voice acting was mediocre and the story itself wasn't that great but what can you expect from a basketball game. If you enjoy basketball, you'll enjoy this game.. To say I'm surprised about the my career mode is a bit of an understatement. My lord I had to review this game because the dialogue is fantastic. By far the best my career mode I have ever seen. Love that high school mode more than anything as well.. Good graphics but terrible AI which on harder difficulties basically means the 4 players you don't control are a liability & are more stupid than a 6 year old playing for the first time. The odds of completing myteam or MyCareer are basically nonexistent and an obvious ploy by 2k to get people hooked so they'll end up paying more money for a game they've already bought. Very concerned about what the game is becoming after being a loyal customer for years.. I write is out of my love for prior incantations of this game, but this is going to hurt you more than it hurts me, hopefully. The **** non-soliloquial dissertation below pertains most entirely to the MyCareer mode in NBA 2K16 playing as an inside scoring shooting guard, the facts and discussion of which contained, except “The Good” section, are born out of pure misery. The Good Game looks great, and music is really good this year. Ability to move your team to other cities in franchise and creating a different uniform for them is awesome. The defensive rotation after the latest update is a lot better, in terms of center rotation for help defense in the lane, and all players seem to be playing passing lanes better on terrible passes. The stadium atmosphere is great. I really like the badges and leveling them up. Great idea. The commentary is very good. The Bad (in addition to my other post on the subject matter) Inexplicably not responding to pushed buttons: I have ran out of bounds while holding firmly the dunk/layup controls on multiple occasions late in a close game, on a fast-break, after a steal, while running directly under a basket without a defender or unreasonable animation preventing the dunk/layup. Hmmm…. In what universe is it a good decision by 2K to implement this in their game. 2K, this is a directly paradoxical decision in terms of what you should be deciding to put in this games. Decision like this demolish 2K’s reputation and trust among gamers. How can I trust a game that disregards, at its whims, to respond to my input. Whoever made this decision at 2K is a freaking moron. I would love to be at that meeting where they decided this. E.g. “Great idea Jim! We will just makes sure that the game is surprisingly and completely unresponsive in these type situations. How much are we paying you? You need a raise you ingenious bastard”. If the proposed scenario above did not happen, how are decisions made at 2K in a vacuum? WTF. This complete lack of response, has also occurred on many attempted passes to completely open persons in scoring positions, and in regard to dribble moves, especially the super easy and inordinately successful spin-move. AI players going catatonic: **** AI players, literally falling asleep, with the f-ing ball in their hands, just staring into oblivion, until the clock nearly runs out. You have to force them to pass the ball, and if not they would continue in their catatonic state until the end of time and then three seconds before the world explodes, finally shoot a completely contested shot directly in the face of an opposing player. (a little over-dramatic, but I despise this) Loose balls: Nearly complete inability to acquire a loose ball Unfair blocking discrepancy: Upon every teammate or MyCareer block ejecting the ball into the 15th row. But when the opposing team blocks you or a teammate, their ball seemingly always starts a fast break. (completely unrealistic and unfair stupidity by 2K). Idiotic failed dunking animation: Driving, trying to dunk in congestion, but instead of getting blocked or rejected by the rim, inexplicably throwing the ball over the rim and not surprisingly directly to the opposing team now on a fast break. Player Initiated teammate passes: Inconsistent ability of teammates to pick an appropriate passing type and location when throwing to your player. And, spraticatily picking the most inappropriate type and locate possible for the situation. Teammate post play: Teammate in the post taking a shot directly in the face of opposing post player, without any attempt to create space or utilize a post move, and unsurprisingly getting reject with virtuosity or hopelessly missing the shot. (Great AI guys). League progression: After five or more years into My Career mode the NBA **** in terms of talent. Player progression of CPU players and teammates is terrible. 3pt shooting discrepancy: Seemingly a better chance to make a half-ways contested three super late in the clock than to make a wide-open three in transition. Inability to effect your team: Inability to affect the franchise in any way, except performance and asking to be traded. You cannot even talk to the coach to suggest something. You are not only the face of your team, but eventually the face of the league, way is this not an option? In the NBA the player’s voice is exercised through the coach’s medium to management, if it truly is My Career shouldn’t we have a say in something that has to do with it? Too many wide-open 3pt shots: How am I shooting a career 46.6% from three with a 78 rating (most of my career my rating was way worse, less than 70) taking on average more than 5 threes a game? The answer is because, I am completely open without a man within 3 yards of me. I only take completely wide open threes. I don’t even running plays in order to get these chances, so why am I getting so many chances? How am I getting so open when I am the best player in the league? I have absolutely no Idea. Don’t get me wrong I like making open threes, but getting this many opportunities is ridiculous. Poor transition on-man defense: I am a transition finishing inside scoring dunkaholic. Ho",the best 2K game ever with solid gameplay and a top tier myteam . game is pay to win. i barely have fun playing it and most people call it the 2k ever when there is zero fun . computer defense is literally denis rodman on meth .
81.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"First time I've been able to complete this magnificent game on Xbox Series X. I remember when my old PC couldn't run this game at a decent amount of FPS. I've completed the normal version, maybe it's worth going for the remastered version to take advantage of the visual beauty of the scenarios and action, but I wanted to see what work of art Activision completed in 2009! It's amazing that today, 2024, it can hold up in such great shape!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a modern classic (literally) and is a must play for anyone, doesn’t matter who you are, PLAY IT. Modern Warfare 2 improved its predecessors gameplay loop, but brought a highly unbalanced multiplayer suite that suffered due to Activision's poor handling of Infinity Ward. Modern Warfare cemented what future multiplayer outings would bring for the future of the franchise, in addition to bringing its ""Michael Bay"" style story.. Easily my favorite game after RDR2, this game has no match, no competitors, everything related to this game unmatchable. Simply the goat! If RDR2 doesn't exist, this game would be my number1. This is the Best Cod game ever made alongside Black Ops 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Modern Warfare 2 is like a Cod 4 if it was on cocaine, making a revolutionary sequel to one of the best video games. Countless debates about controversy in the campaign. Let's talk about the campaign first. The introductions are so well put out and it runs through smoothly with it's pacing. Stealth missions, heavy missions with riot shelids you can blaze through, you get it, it has the pack of everything, which I really enjoyed. And that classic mission, No Russian mission is still **** crazy to play through, and you can't tell me that these developers back then didn't have huge balls. Makarov is a true villain, a true russian terroist that makes you want to crap your pants when you see his face right before he tears through people. This one mission where you go on an invasion with Sgt. Fogley and Private Ramirez and the intensity really kicks in because of the huge battle, and that classic Burger Town, that will fortunatley never get out of my head. Anyway, you screw off shepard at the end and it's hooray time. Multiplayer time, and good lord Modern Warfare 2 and Halo 3 started these **** LMG gamer 420 blaze memes. It's so crazy how this impacted the community so much with all these 360 no scope Intervention montages reels. This is where you get addicted to multiplayer, I love how whenever you complete a challenge in-multiplayer, it plays a cool gutiar sound effect. The map design is probably one of my favorite maps ever that I played, not just in a COD game, but outside other FPS games. It's fast-paced, commando pro meleeing people and pure chaotic fun. I love how every gun is not wasted and repetitive and fills in a role. Like the Tactical Insertion where you can place down in a sport so whenever you die you get back to where you planted it, throwing knifes are for players who want a more stealthy approach, or just wants to get sick highlight clips. And the weapon designs and gameplay and wacky, but in a good way. You can also unlock Pro Perks by doing some challenges onto a regular perk. It's not like the Pick 10 system from BO2 (even though BO2 pick 10 system is unique and fun) has a secondary option but hardly even used so what's the point for having a secondary? But that's where MW2 comes in and puts every thing a job. And we cannot forget about the Noob Tube & One Man Army spam, and the Model 1887's dual wield shotguns, thank god that was patched, but it will always be remembered. Was the game balenced? **** no, but the viability is all the way up. The map design is almost perfect in this game. It has points of interest and changes gameplay style which what the game nails it in, for examples, the hallway on Skidrow, the big house on Estate, the shredded plane on Afghan, and the cockpit in Terminal. There is no map in COD WWII or a map in Black Ops 4 that offers three story heights. So if you have one surface or no higher or lower path to go, it feels flat and lifeless. If you took the map in here Wasteland and set up a bunch of walls and traps instead of an wide-open freedom, you get a piece of ****. All the maps in MW2 have dynamic flow, like in Scrappy yard you get to climb into these windows into these engine things and you can climb up onto two big buildings and snipe from there. It takes risks and that's why I enjoy the multiplayer. Now, spec ops was born, and it consists of 23 missions with some that takes shorter than 3 minutes and some that takes way longer. You earn stars when you complete the mission and the more stars you unlock, the more mission lists you get. However it's not a simple task to go through point A to point B, you often have to deal with the clock, and soons becomes a way to perfection, the one thing that **** is that it's recycled through parts of the campaign missions, but I much rather have that than nothing at all because I had so much fun. Some missions forces you for two player which where one player gets to be in a helicopter while player two is bobbing through enemies while your buddie franticly tries to cover you. Overall spec-ops is really fun and makes you sometimes chill out. Even though it's not as fun as the loving **** Zombies from Call of Duty World at War because it was a different studio, you can still have a fun time and it's kick-ass and a good skipping stone. This game might not live up to your expectations and you might think it's clunky at first, but you get used to it. Even though there a lot of things that wouldn't fly today like the annoyance of Danger Close, One Man Army, and Commando, this is the greatest multiplayer-offering place ever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. in my opinion MW2 is the greatest online videogame of all time. Campaign and Spec Ops are very good too.. The best COD of all time, simple as that, the GOAT, amazing campagn and multiplayer.. in my opinion MW2 is the greatest multiplayer game of all time. a shame what happened to infinity ward after this game. Does what a proper sequel should: goes for broke and ramps up the spectacle. Sometimes it's a bit too much, but overall this is a fine follow-up to a classic. The campaign returns to beloved characters and continues a twisty and shocking story. Gameplay is as crisp and responsive as ever. Multiplayer builds off the original without reinventing the wheel. Spec Ops is a fantastic and challenging new mission mode. Absolutely worthy of your time.. This game is a outstanding game, Love the graphics, But for some reason when your hurt the blood looks like raspberry jam, But overall a great game, I would play it again.. The greatest multiplayer videogame of all time. Best COD Campaign as well alongside BO1. The remake in MW3 rebooted multiplayer and MW2CR both are extremely good as well. Love this game and love the original infinity ward. Great game in terms of atmosphere. It does have good campaigns and great story!. Incredible game, everyone should play this as soon as possible! masterpiece ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game came out 15 years ago and is still a blast to play. The campaign is superb and the story being told is incredible and has you on edge. It’s challenging but will also cater to the newer less experienced or skilled players when necessary. The multiplayer to this day is also still holds up as arguably the best of the franchise.. For me, 2nd best cod, beautiful campaign and very good multiplayer .. The golden age of call of duty. You didn’t need to know every meta and every guns stats to have fun it’s campaign is straight from hollywood with the over top goodness and not a £70 snooze fest like the newest call of duty. You don’t know what you had till it’s gone. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 builds upon the qualities of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and keeps it going, making improvements along the way as well. The campaign is just as entertaining, engaging, and fun. The characters are expanded upon. Would recommend after playing Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare to fully immerse yourself into the story provided in the series.. The best COD that I ever played. Amazing campaign, special ops was fun as hell especially with a friend and the multiplayer was just so fun, with the best set of launch maps and weapons ever in a call of duty.. A perfect call of duty from A to the Z nothing to say. Storyline is perfect, multiplayer is ball-breaking but it is really good. The missions are also very nice.. It's a masterpiece just not as good as the first one in my opinion.. Yes it's good. But claiming to be the BEST CoD is just too much. Do not get blinded by nostalgia. Multiplayer balance is broken as ****. Maps are great but playing with all that broken stuff is just unenjoyable. It's way better than fortnite. the best game ever, captivating story, fantastic multiplayer and the maps as well. Cool of duty. Historia legazona ein. Só isso mesmo. Cool. The campaign is a wild fun ride, and the multiplayer rules Hard to skip. Good campaign **** multiplayer it's not fun when everyone is camping and using noob toobs every **** game. i finished the campaign for the second time and this game changes everyone, this has to be one of the best cod games ever made.. THE GOATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. But sometimes nostalgia blinds us. Remember One Man Army noobtubes? Akimbo Model 1997s?. really awesome game. The best game in all of Call of Duty. The campaign is just so so good, and nothing beats No Russian, it is just brutal. The full out warfare that goes on in Virginia when the Russians attack is shown SO well in this game. Not to mention that the game has THE BEST Call of Duty Multiplayer ever made. It is so grindy, so much to do and everything. Spec Ops is so addicting, and everything about this game was just made to be addicting. This game places itself in Gaming History!!!. Gameplay - 9 Plot & Characters - 8 Storytelling - 8 Pacing - 9 Music & Sound - 9 Replayability - 9 Performance - 10. cool story and multiplayer. spec ops is alright for me. but a pretty fun game even with that!. Peak of the franchise. Fun but forgettable single player campaign matched with addicting and chaotic multiplayer.. I prefer mw1's campaign but the campaign on this game is still great and the multiplayer is improved in every way.. 0 score for NATO propaganda, why Russians are always bad, why Anglo-Saxons are always good. when in real life it's the other way **** sad. I had so many good times on this game and I honestly wish I could relive the year 2013 it was so fun.. A bit overrated but it's okay in the multiplayer the Campaign is mediocre. Modern Warfare 2 is still one of the best FPS and easily better than most if not all CoD released since, including MW22.. Really good game, I had a lot of fun playing this when it came out. It's one of few games that is a generational defining video game. It brought millions together to play through the exciting gameplay, co op missions, SnD, team deathmatch, and much more.. Basically Modern Warfare on cocaine with improved gameplay and more action sequences. What more could you ask for?. One of my favorite story modes in an FPS game, a stupidly complete & fun online mode, this is just prime COD.. Content rich game. One of the best maps in the franchise. Spec Ops is very fun in co-op but the very last missions are just cheap in veteran.. This game is a great example of how to mesh Hollywood's over the top action scenes and military realism into one. The campaign is one of the greatest first person shooter campaigns of all time. The multiplayer, as unbalanced as it was, was so fun and so remarkable.. Amazing game that improves slightly upon the story and game play of Call of Duty 4 but is also very similar still. Only disappointing thing is how short it is compared to older games like Call of Duty 2. The gameplay feels great and smoother than the previous title and the story is a fun quick explosive experience that feel like an action movie. Honestly surprised this game has mixed reviews >.>. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Remastered: 2009 is when this revolutionary FPS came out and it got a remaster yesterday does it still hold up obviously. You play as different solders still trying to take down the main big bad from the last game. What hasn’t been said about this game it’s a masterpiece of a shooter, firing a AK has never looked it felt so good. Price is back and he still is a badass. I don’t want to drag this so if your going to play this game play the remaster of it on PS4 because it’s out a whole month before the other systems get it.. Greatest CoD of all time. Simply untouchable. The only problem was 'one man army'. For that I cant give it more than a 9. Once in a lifetime multiplayer experience that will probably never be duplicated for CoD ever again.. Nostalgia carried most of this game in my mind. It is simply too unbalanced to be a 10/10. Still my favorite of the series by far. Please remaster it already.. best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer best game ever made, really made me a true gaymer. A great sequel to the first Modern Warfare game. Slight improvements over the shooting and the graphics The story is more intense, there's way more action and it has nice set-pieces. But the multiplayer is messy and chaotic, many guns are broken but it's still fun nonetheless. Lastly, the Spec Ops mode is a welcome addition. Final Rating: ""Very Good"" ~ 7.5/10.. Mw2 combined with mw1 is absolutely best call of duty experience. Vivid characters engaging sory and so many epic locations. Campaign of 2 is not better than first mw but multiplayer in mw2 is brilliant and spec ops are awesome as well. Must play! After mw1 of course.. Oh baby a triple!! Sorry about that. This game's campaign is phenomenal just like it's prequel. The multiplayer started the dude bro thing and trickshotting. Spec Ops was ok I guess.. A Great Sequel to the first Modern Warfare game, with a better story, way more action, and an unbalanced yet chaotic Multiplayer experience.. my favorite call of duty campaign everything about it is so amazing the graphics, writing, characters and gameplay just everything about this game is amazing a must buy for gamers! and museum was such a nice treat for beating the game this game has great replay value i beat the game on almost every difficulty except veteran its such a nice challenging game and the multiplayer is nice too the only problem is that all the maps feel the same but still its enjoyable enough best game of 2009 and of all time. the best cod ever in years this and bo2 unbalance and fun mp spec ops is doe snot compete with z. COD: MW2 has some memorable moments and missions, including a controversial one, but the game over all did it's job. Only rating this based off of the single player campaign as I do not play multiplayer.. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 7/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 8/10. A game that has lost its cells in the sequel , dat kind of sequel way they make everything More Explosions more action more set pieces more more more , It has lost so much of The Originals charm and play style I had to take it down to Ranger Because hard there are just so many enemies and just not fun , original Modern Warfare 4 I could complete it on hard and had fun, The game is just a disappointment compared to Modern Warfare 1. This game's campaign is absolutely amazing, and the multiplayer is still fun even today.. Leaving the multiplayer mode completely aside, the story is one of the best the COD series has, with an interesting character development, a realistic villain, a bittersweet ending and sets up as the best one of the trilogy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is average at best. This game doesn't hold as many stones as the first but that doesn't mean its not good. Modern Warfare 2 is not terrible but it is not great. It feels like just a repeat of the last game, a lot of the missions i could compare to the older games which makes me wonder why i bought this game when i could of just replayed the last title. Another thing i don't like about this game is that just like the last one, the American soldier in the game Private James Ramirez of the U.S. Army’s 1st Battalion/75th Ranger Regiment still has no personality. What is it with infinity ward at the time and giving Americans no personality? What's the point of making me play someone who's just a mute the entire time, i wouldn't of cared if he was mute if it was apart of the story but no Infinity Ward is just lazy. But i did enjoy the story a bit but i feel as if it did nothing but just wipe out some random boss that nobody really cared about and is just milking the series. The multiplayer was ok i guess, multiplayer doesn't sell me games so i have no opinion. the Spec Ops game mode was pretty fun but it got boring really quickly. Overall this game is just painfully average and i don't want to replay it nor would i recommend it. I recommend instead just playing COD 4 or 2. You'd be more entertained. Modern Warfare 2 was IMO the high points of the series. It had the best COD multiplayer I've played to this day and was just insanely fun. Even the campaign was great. Ghost, Soap, Price, Shepherd and Makarov were some really great characters. Unlike the more modern games of COD which are just forgettable. Only thing missing is a zombies mode, but you have black ops for that! Multiplayer (back in the day): 10/10 Campaign: 9/10. To put it simply, this is the pinnacle of FPS online gaming. It will be hard to CoD to top this one, much less any other video game.. Incredible game. Amazing campaign with very memorable characters. Spec ops is ok (MW3 is better in terms of spec ops.) Multiplayer is very fun.. if there was any type of Oscar award thats beyond the game awards award, this game deserves just that. the story its self was such a masterpiece. the voice acting was on par with the intensity of the plot. guns felt just right at the time. it started an era of online gaming. multiplayer started youtube careers and ended a few too. clans, crews and toxic lobbies galore. this is a staple in gaming.. The best game ever, it was perfectly done, campaign godtier, multiplayer was god like, and spec ops was great, truly the best cod ever.. Seeing what Call of Duty has become in the future I have to come back to this game and say this game is a relic from the golden age of Call of Duty. this is now one of my favorite games of all time.. Definitely one of the best first-person shooter games and the best trilogy ever. All three games are a must-play for a complete experience.. This game is very good. The Multiplayer is very amazing. The Campaign is good but has a CANCEROUS mission... ""Takedown"" god I hate that god damn ****. The campaign in this game was great. Maybe not the best, but good nonetheless. The twist was good and it had a good story. The multiplayer is the best in the series. The maps are amazing, the customization in depth, the gameplay fast paced and interesting. The spec ops was also a hoot and a half. The missions are fun and the Arcady style worked well for it. Just an awesome experience.. Love, love, love this game. Easily the best call of duty ever. Absolute best multiplayer and campaign.. The pinnacle of what a modern Call of Duty campaign could be. Aside from CoD4, MW2 has the best campaign for my money.. an amazing game the multiplayer but even more so the campaign, by far the best call of duty story ever. This game is a masterpiece, I don’t have much else to say besides mw3 is absolute garbage.. A very complete game, one of the best Call of Duty's ever with a good story and excellent multiplayer.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GOOD. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. This is by far one of the greatest video games of all time. Absolutely biblical. The killstreaks are amazing, the killstreak system is amazing. The game ending nuke is absolutely amazing. By far the greatest first person shooter game of all time. Thank you Vince Zampella, Jason West and the original infinity ward for this masterpiece. The Hit detection on the game is amazing and the time to kill is fast, but not too fast as to promote camping. Running and gunning is great in this game. The only problem is the one man army noobtubes and the quickscoping. Ground war domination is the most fun you can have in a video game. If you want to get the nuke, run the 7-11-25 killstreaks (6-10-24 with the hardline perk). The perks are amazing and provide a huge difference to the game. All in all, a masterpiece. Again , a big Thank you to Vince Zampella and the original infinity ward team :) .. The best part in the Call of Duty series, the apogee of her development (Black Ops 2 was still not that breakthrough). After MW2, the series clearly went down. Excellent gameplay, which is still relevant in 2020, 11 years later. Again, the plot simply blasts with its blunt, but everything is served factually and beautifully. A multiplayer who 's still alive on the Xbox360. Just a great game, it 's a pity that after it Infinity Ward fell apart.. Now then, 2020 review, i played this game when i was younger in 2013, it was by far nothing that had ever hit the market in terms of multiplayer, the customisation, the maps, every aspect of it, in terms of campaign, i'm sorry but COD 4 MW beat it, but there's nothing that will EVER beat that, this game is a necessity to have, you have NOT received a true gaming experience until you have played this game.. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a second part of a best directed action game ever! Very recommended!. A great addition to the franchise and a solid campaign. Strong gunplay and an overall entertaining experience.. Terrible disgusting russophobian game. I want my money back. Trash. Gameplay is weak and unimaginative.. The second long awaited installment of Modern Warfare is back and packs a bigger punch than ever. Safe to say that the campaign, muiliplayer, and the special ops of this game is an excellent all-in-one complimentary package that could remember days to come. Remember No Russian.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story is surprisingly really, really good. The multiplayer is pretty great too.. Amazing single player campaign. Multiplayer is still good just it's really laggy and depending on were you live it can take a while to find games but, if you live in/near a big city in America it will be fine.. I liked this game. The campaign was good so was the special ops. The multiplayer was kind of good but it is very flawed. There are a lot of hackers in the lobby. Some hacker in the lobby maxed out my rank and prestige for some reason. And for that reason I get put in with the really good people who got their ranks by playing so I do really bad against them. Overall it is a good game. B+. The story to modern warfare 2 is amazing, not perfect, but still really good. the story is must play. the spec ops can be plenty of fun with a friend, except when u get to the later missions. The multiplayer can really fun if u don't get into a hacked lobby, or with a bunch of campers. overall the game is really good. the only things that are bad can be the enemy placement on veteran. some spots infinity ward didn't think about veteran, there are spots where would run into a big open area and be getting hit from behind and from the front by 30 enemy's on each side and is almost impossible on veteran, some spots on veteran are pure luck. overall the game gets a 9 out of 10.. Modern Warfare 2 took everything that made Call of Duty 4 great and expanded on it with excellent maps, guns that were iconic and satisfying to use as well as bringing new game modes and having a very memorable campaign. It is probably the most fun I have ever had with a video game despite its flaws such as the overpowered grenade launcher, knife lunging, one man army pro etc. The campaign is fantastic. The multiplayer has unfortunately not aged very well at all, but for what it was at its time, it’s amazing. Rating - 79%. Absolutely funny multiplayer that can be played for hours as Online as offline splitscreen. Story is not of special. This standard A-lot-of-fun-and-caress-of-story has been stayed until nowadays not evolving even after years.. ""Modern Warfare 2"" is the best ""Call of Duty"" ever made. A bigger and better game than the first MW, it is the pinnacle of the series. Highly influenced by Michael Bay's ""The Rock"" and featuring music composed by Hans Zimmer, it resembles a Hollywood action blockbuster. The first time I played the campaign, I was blown away. It possesses the look and testosterone-fueled bombast of Jerry Bruckheimer movies. Of course, the competitive multiplayer is terrific and the new co-op based Spec Ops missions are fantastic. Overall, ""Modern Warfare 2"" is one of the greatest shooters ever conceived . I would rate it with a 9.5 out of 10.. This is everything a Call of Duty game should be. The Single player is rather short but very enjoyable. As for multiplayer, its the best I've seen in any of the call of duty games. This is easily the most memorable game on Xbox for me.. Enjoyably over the top single-player and a great adrenaline rush of a multiplayer, both local and online. Me and my friends used to play the splits-creen co-op all the time so I have fun memories of Modern Warfare 2.. This game was just souless. It had such a dumbed down tone from the first one. While the first game had a huge variety of levels and a compelling story, this one opted for more streamlined generic action. At the end of the day pointing and shooting just got so boring. Not a fan. A good single player combined with an OK multiplayer, makes this game an OK sequel to the brilliant Call of Duty 4. A lack of post-game support is deplorable and effectively kills the replayability.. I seem to have been caught up in the massive explosion of the Call of Duty series when Modern Warfare 2 was released in 2009 and I was only a teen. I first saw MW2 by a friend on their PS3, and was immediately sold. The fanbase and popularity of Call of Duty from there on exploded into one of the most popular gaming franchises in history. Now that I am much older and look at games in a more articulate way, I can say that MW2 is perhaps the most overrated COD game ever made. Let's start with the campaign, which is definitely a good campaign despite character motives and development being very little in regards. I enjoyed the snow mobile ride even if it was railroaded, the pulling of the knife out of Mactavish and throwing it into Shepard's eye, and a few other moments, but unfortunately the game tries to hard to hold your hand in terms of freedom and playing. To hear your soldiers constantly asking you over to objectives and give you devices and gadgets, it was like I was just being prepped more for the multiplayer instead of enjoying a great campaign that COD4 achieved and WAW had not-as great but still well done regardless. Makarov's involvement was just so one-off, yet you could skip the mission of being in the Russian airport massacre and then have no idea who he was (since he never shows himself again until MW3). The inclusion of Soap MacTavish and Captain Price was not necessary, so it made me a bit confused on why a new group wasn't included. COD4's Marine Sgt. Jackson and his team dies in a nuclear explosion while the two SAS soldiers sustained wounds from a ultranationalist Russian organization. It was suppose to be a story of their's and nothing more should have been become of it. In short, the campaign had good moments, but was lost alot of its charm and brilliance that made the previous unique. The spec op missions were a brilliant inclusion to the game, probably the best the game had. Splitscreening with a friend or playing over a mic and chat was really fun and the challenge the missions held were commendable. The Juggernauts were tough foes not found in the campaign and was great to fight overall. I can't help but feel thought something was missing. Maybe it was the fact it was the campaign maps recycled that made the missions not as good, but something else too. Regardless, it was a neat little side activity that proved to be the better arm of the entire game as far as I was concern. Of course you have to talk about the multiplayer, which (in the context of ONLY looking at COD4 and WAW for comparison) almost took an entire nosedive in quality. Perk imbalance was still in full swing, and with the new pro effects stacked onto them, the idea of war went out the window. It now became an arcade-like firefight that included goofy camos, scorecards and overload of scorestreaks that it made it feel so dam lame. Was it fun? Yes. But was it carrying on the tradition of its predecessors? I would say no in 100% confidence. With the inclusion of quickscoping, influx of kids and younger adults (like myself at the time) and such at the time aside, it just didn't feel like war now. With the community exploding and releasing a whole slew of hatred and acidity on a whole other level, it's no wonder why so many can see this being the first COD to **** so much. I mean overall I can MW2 is a good game, but grossly overrated for the departures it makes that made its previous so good and interesting. It felt like it was more commercialized and safe rather than trying to innovate itself again and prove to be a strong arm for shooters of its time.. Oh. My. God. **** better than this ever exists, pinch me because I am definitely dreaming. If you haven't played Modern Warfare 2, then get onto gumtree, eBay, whatever and buy yourself a PS3 or an Xbox 360 because even just to play this classic it would be worth it.. 7.5 - Really good campaign and multiplayer maps as well. The issue was the weapons and perks on multiplayer were not balanced at all, and became frustrating to play at times. Campaign and Spec Ops were done really well, especially Spec Ops since it allowed for coop and made it very memorable.. It's cod. Mediocre shooter material at your service folks... What's that? Meta critic requires my review to be 150 characters? Please... It's cod lol. The sixth shooter in this long series, infinity ward delivers a competent shooter with good gameplay: Pros: -Good written story with a intense campaign -Voice acting and characters are excellent -Good graphics and sound design -Multiplayer is intense and fun -Spec ops mode is enjoyable Cons: -While good, the campaign is short. I completed it in about 5 hours on normal mode and I'm not the best FPS player ever. -While fun, multiplayer is very unbalanced with many OP kill streaks and guns. -Spec ops can be dull if you are by yourself In the end: Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 7.5/10 Multiplayer: 7/10 Graphics/sound design 8/10 Overall: 8/10. Two things come to mind here. I think I'm always going to look at Modern Warfare 2 as the title that launched the now strictly enforced theatrical design of the COD campaign and the first time I felt the military shooter had finally caught its stride on current-gen consoles. I remember seeing MW2 in motion for the first time and thinking ""no way that's running on Xbox 360!"" and sure enough, it was. Still images just didn't do it justice though, and when you zoom in on things you can see the right through the smoke and mirrors but during regular game-play, up to that point, I had never seen an FPS look so pretty. It was the 60fps and beautiful lighting and phys","this game is a modern classic (literally) and is a must play for anyone, doesn't matter who you are, PLAY IT . Easily my favorite game after RDR2, this game has no match, no competitors, everything related to this game unmatchable . the introductions are so well put out and it runs through smoothly with its pacing ."
810.Pikmin 3,"truly an under rated gem of the pikmin franchise and also an under rated wii u game. Aside from learning curve for the gamepad, the addition of it is what really makes Pikmin 3 a successor to its predecessors. Along with looking really pretty, and having a fairly engaging story, Pikmin 3 gives a lot to help make newer and older fans of Pikmin feel welcomed. While its a shame that certain extras don't appear again, overall Pikmin 3 is bigger and better than any other Pikmin game before it, and helps give reason why the Wii U gamepad can be an essential piece to making games better.. Casual fun times with cute characters and a fun creative world. Not complex, hard to live or hate.. I think the switch version is much better but. Still a very good version of the game with a well told story unique characters with the story being very good and compelling to see unfold. The man characters are not bad and are actually quite likable in my opinion. a high recommend for anybody who liked pikmin 1. A wholesome and fun experience on the Wii U, The greatest console. Some parts are a bit soggy however.. Its been almost a decade and no Pikmin 4. This game is amazing, where is Pikmin 4 Nintendo?. very fun game both for teens and adults. is a bit easy unless you want to complete it 100% where the difficulty spikes significantly. Pikmin 3 is the best game of the Wiiu Nintendo games the graphics and the characters and the controls are better the missions to kill enemies are easy and normal and collecting the money is difficult well I liked it I give it the criticism: 10/10.. Pikmin 3 is the best Pikmin game. Pikmin 1 and 2 are excellent, but Pikmin 3 is the finest game of them all.. This game is fantastic, the fact that it has almost been a decade with no sequel is almost criminal.. Love the game, one of the first ever games I played. 10/10 would recommend.. Absolutely brilliant. If you've played any of the iterations you'd know Pikmin is one of the most creative and original **** out there. This game was very well crafted , the new pikmin (winged and rock) are both integrated very well into the gameplay. The main story is a bit short, but collecting all fruits and mission modes should add some extra life and enjoyment. The 2 player versus Bingo mode is also brilliant, my only gripe with it is that it is local play only. Granted, it is better locally, but it would've been nice to give online as an option as well. Especially since it could have been added as DLC , which is already introduced into this game. The main story offers a pretty decent challenge but it isn't too extreme. Going for the best medals on the mission mode should add a lot of extra challenge to the game. The gamepad has a kind of weird control for this game but after getting used to it I really like it, the map feature is also perfect for this game. The Wiimote nunchuck is also a PERFECT fit for this game and changes up the gameplay feel of this game if you want something different. The bosses are very engaging and well crafted, and I've fought each well over 3 times because of how fun they are. The graphics are down right gorgeous. If you have a Wii U, you NEED this game.. Really great game, probably the cutest game I've played in a while! Fun puzzles, very unique take on the real-time strategy genre with perhaps the best use of the Wiimote + Nunchuck I've ever seen, topped off with a wholesome story and funny cast of characters. Combat could be a little clunky and hard to aim at times, and it's pretty short, but overall a good time. Get this one on the Switch, and make sure to collect all the fruit (it's not actually very hard, I'm not usually one for completionism but this game makes it really easy with the very convenient map and navigation).. This is a amazing game, I love it with all my heart, please play it I beg you,. Not only is this the best Wii U game in my opinion, but it may also be one of the finest games Nintendo has ever crafted. The classic, addictive Pikmin gameplay has been refined and feels smoother than ever, the visuals are luscious and atmospheric, the soundtrack is nothing short of masterful, and even the narrative and the lore within the universe of Pikmin is at it's peak. Every aspect of this game oozes with an unusual amount of passion than we typically see with triple A games. A pitch perfect modernization of one of the most underappreciated series in gaming, and an absolute must play for anyone who considers themselves a fan of unique and innovative experiences.. By far my favorite Pikmin game and to this day remains one of my top favorite games of all time. If you want to introduce yourself to the world of Pikmin this is the game to get as it is one of the easiest ones in the franchise, but that does not mean it can't be fun. The use of go here adds so much more strategy to this game than there already is. At the same time it has a great enough story to keep you moving forward. I have replayed the story mode dozens of times and gameplay is as fun as ever, improving several of the first games flaws while adding it's own flavor. The side modes are in my opinion the best of the series with bingo Battle being a fun frenzy with friends that is so much chaotic fund. And you can work together in mission mode. This may be my Pikmin fan bias but I highly recommend this **** that it is getting the deluxe treatment on Switch I am looking forward to replaying this amazing game.. Enthralling world and enthralling gameplay! it just makes u want to live in this game. First game I've played from the franchise and it's perfect. It's balanced between action and strategy. The visuals are astonishing. This game made me a fan of this saga. The first DLC was really bad though.. Pikmin 3 is a fantastic entry to the pikmin series. The idea of more than 1 character at a time is a expanded idea in this game from Pikmin 2. The areas are awesome and to 100% the game is a awesome time. I loved every minute of this game and can't wait for the ****. This is the first game in the series that I finished, I played Pikmin 2 for a little while, but lost interest after a couple of hours. This one on the other hand, I played until completion. And it was really great fun. These games are really interesting and unique, there's really nothing quite like them out there, they have that typical Nintendo-charm, with bright & colorful visuals, quirky humor and a high fun-factor. The new bee-Pikmin are also really cool, as they bring new strategies to the gameplay. The fruits you pick up look highly realistic, and the ""monsters"" roaming around all have different and unique appearances. The boss-fights are quite challenging, and requires a healthy dose of strategy to beat. I highly recommend this one, particularly if you're into strategy-games.. one of the greatest games on the wii u (and one of the only ones that hasn't been ported to the switch). now, WHERE IS PIKMIN 4!?. Best Wii U game and best game of 2013. Truly one of best Nintendo games out there, as well as one of the best games of all time.. This game is absolutely fantastic with a beautiful take on the Pikmin series, beautiful worlds, and an awesome multiplayer mode to boot. This game perfects the Pikmin formula and now hopefully the make Pikmin 4. A truly wonderful experience. While the Wii U isn't exactly the most popular console, Pikmin 3 is an amazing game to play. This game exceeds the expectations **** Nintendo game; the visuals are extraordinary! As a person who has completed the game and no longer plays it, if you haven't tried out the game yet, my suggestion is, go try it for yourselves. You will be playing for hours. Hours of fun!. Pikmin 3 is a fantastic experience. The core gameplay of the Pikmin franchise is brought back just as strong and enjoyable as before, and when you add all the new concepts and mechanics brought to light in Pikmin 3, you're left with a downright artful gaming experience. Pikmin 3 is the first installment in the franchise to replace Olimar as the protagonist, having you play in the shoes, (or, rather, ""space suits), of three astronauts from the planet of Koppai, Alph, Brittany, and Charlie. The new crew is just overflowing with personality and charm, and as the plot constantly separates and reunites its members, Pikmin 3's story provides a rollercoaster of enjoyment. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the ending sequence was a bit tedious, though that's my only ""big"" issue with the game. Aside from story, aside from that end sequence I just mentioned, the gameplay and level design is absolutely superb. Like I said, the core Pikmin gameplay is beyond satisfying to me, and the levels you traverse are so well crafted that it's hard for me to believe that Pikmin is a relatively niche series. One of the main goals of Pikmin 3 is found in collecting fruits, and you get these by either simply finding them in the world, solving a little puzzle, or defeating a boss or mini boss. There are 66 fruits in all, and they were almost universally fun for me to collect. On top of gameplay and story, Pikmin 3 runs perfectly on the Wii U, and has some of the best visuals you're likely to find on the system. Some of the environments are absolutely breathtaking, and they even sport a good visual variety. When you add Pikmin 3's two incredible bonus modes to the mix, you're left with one of the best games I've ever played, and one of the biggest recommendations I can give you.. The peak of the Pikmin series. Undoubtedly the most polished in the series. Difficulty just at the right spot. Enjoyable boss battles. 1 point deduction is for the simplistic and at this point repetitive storyline.. Very few games are as comfortable to play as Pikmin games, there's something indeed very special about all of them, and this is no exception. A worthy successor to the previous 2.. Nothing more than a masterpiece, while i do admit I prefer the originals, this game is still a 10/10, my favorite IP ever! Only hope, WEED PIKMIN, nevermind.. Pikmin 3, is a pikmin game that tries to capture the essence of the original 2 pikmin games on the gcn, but fails to capture the essence without understanding basic concepts and how the added to the base game. Pikmin 3 fails at a couple important aspects, those being plot, linearity, and collectables. Pikmin Is a game franchise with a heavy emphasis on collecting items, battling enemies, and managing resources. it is a amazing rts game filled with puzzles and challenges. However, a part of the main experience of pikmin is collecting objects. In the first game, it is the ship parts, and the second, hundreds of unique objects which tally up to a total to let your progress, the parts are a requirement to progression. this is one of the most important parts of the game, and pikmin 3 has failed at making it interesting and essential. In pikmin 3 you collect fruit, and this fruit is supposedly essential to the main plot, but all it does gameplay wise is make sure you dont fail, and run out of food to survive the game. This is a bad decision on many parts, the only addition the fruit adds is more time, fruit is not required and adds nothing other than more days to get to the linear goal, which is always solving puzzles to get to a single boss fight. this leads all of the game to be set on a linear story driven path, where nothing you do except following it progresses the game itself, which is a downside to the very nonlinear setup of the first two games. The collectables are also boring: in the first two games the collectables were interesting and unique, the ship parts had a cool look and were unique in their own way, and pikmin 2 had you collect stuff you knew, chapstick, but in pikmin 3 you collect the same type of fruit, and alot of them are repeats. this is detrimental to pikmins core design and hinders the experience. I play pikmin to explore and collect, but I am not incentivised nor required to do so to progress the plot, and the game loves to stop you to force you to do something. The game is very linear, and its short too. The biggest part of the two pikmin games was collecting and here it serves no purpose to progression other than letting you continue the linear path it has set for you. in the first two you had to collect and find stuff to continue, and that was where most of the strategy came.. but all it seems like now is the puzzles and combat, which are done well I will have to give credit. In my eyes pikmin 2 is a stronger title than this but if you want to ease into pikmin play this game first.. Extremely overrated game as usual since it's a Nintendo game (they tend to get extreme scores by their fans regardless). It gets a 7 at best because 1) the time limit is annoying 2) the fighting mechanics are convoluted, annoying and nonsensical and 3) you are being attacked out of nowhere in some cases without any indication of what's going on.. I've neglected to write a review for this game, but I feel the need to let people know how insanely fun this was for me. The campaign was enough fun by itself to get me to play it through twice, however the most fun I had was playing the challenges. I soloed each of them to 100% because they were such a riot. When I finished that I had not had enough, So I opened my wallet and bought all the DLC. Each challenge level required it's own strategy, and it took a fair # of hours to figure out a base strategy which I could re-use. I loved this thing, and may have to buy a Switch if only for the pleasure of playing Pikmin 4.. Beautiful graphics, fun and slightly challenging puzzles, great boss battles, and captivating gameplay. This game also manages to make good use of the gamepad.. I'm a brand-new fan of pikmin. i gotta tell, you, man. i understand it if you want to look at the number of games on other platforms and decide to go for them. i also understand it if you just like shooters -- i simply don't, and i'm including splatoon here. i have a ps3 where i can currently get digital games for one-fifth of the price of a virtual console game, and yet the thing just sits there. there is the current narrative that nintendo has lost its touch, but i honestly want to convince you that that's a lie told by outsiders. pikmin looked just as baffling to me a few months ago as it probably looks to you. and then i just got it. wow. it's rare for me to play long sessions of anything. on the ps3 i think i got obsessed with two games in total -- stick of truth and portal 2. but, without me noticing, this week i have spent 9 hours on this game. i suppose you'd call this a puzzle game -- one where each stage is an innocent-looking sprawling network of connected complexity, with objectives that lead into more objectives, with different captains that you switch between, using creatures with different skills to throw them at different problems in different quantities, splitting your army into two or three pieces to tackle problems at once from different places, so that everybody together solves the massive puzzle that is the level. things feel like real triumphs of team work -- it is quite the rare thing for a video game to pull off. even if you're thinking of some co-op game that does this greatly as well, i think you would love feeling it in this particular way that pikmin offers. after a certain point i had beaten the first boss, and in the process i had learned some of the game. then i realized i had lost my rock pikmin (creatures you can throw at glass to break it, and so on). so i decided to restart the game and do it over with my new knowledge. on exploration day 5 there was something i wasn't getting quite right, so i did that day three times over. by the way, i've never seen a game justify the wiimote and nunchuk quite like this. you use the pointer to throw pikmin as you run around with the analog. meanwhile, exclusive to this third installment is the gamepad, which sits on the arm of my couch giving me a map to just look at while moving, instead of pausing. if you're a pc gamer, maybe you will be tempted to emulate this, but trust me -- you will be missing out on the magic. maybe you can hook up your pc to a tv and get a wiimote to work with it, and have an android tablet work as the gamepad, but seriously -- at that point i don't see why you wouldn't just get a used wii u that everybody's selling to buy the switch anyway. anyway, it's **** magic. i think i'm gonna spend 40 hours on it or more (if i only ever play it once), and then i'm excited for the prospect of playing 1 and 2 (each $20 on the wii u eshop). and, no matter who you are, i'm 100% sure you **** hate some of the tendencies of the industry currently -- qte's, season passes, massive installs, day-one patches, broken games, unfinished games. nintendo, just by remaining decent, now stands out among everybody else by just giving you games on a disc that just work. i think you owe that to yourself. plus botw is coming up, so what better time to jump in? oh, and the wii u is a brilliant system with brilliant games. rest assured -- there is nothing wrong with the people at nintendo who make software and hardware. that was only a complete marketing disaster -- seriously, to this day you see amazon users baffled that their wii u games don't work on their wiis; like, what the **** as cool as the switch is, losing the second screen will mean that some things like pikmin and mario maker will never be as good again.. A gorgeous game that is a REAL treat to experience. I loved every darn minute of exploring the Pikmin 3 world. A few control irritations, and a slightly baffling final boss fight were the weaker moments, but they were lesser parts of an otherwise excellent whole.. Pikmin 3 is a ""killer app"" for the Wii U. It is a purely Nintendo experience and offers the kind of creativity, imagination, and quality the company is synonymous with. There is a case to be made that Pikmin is the best post-millennium franchise for Nintendo and Pikmin 3 is arguably the best game in the series. On the surface it may not look like triple A blockbusters on other systems, but make no mistake - Pikmin 3 is the kind of game worth owning a system for.. i hate hate time limits in this game even if it gives u a lot of food storage to work with. why can't i just play around a level as long as i want and take my time 100%ing the level?. I can't say enough good things about this game. This game is one of the few you can actually sit back and feel relaxed while playing it, it's an extremely relaxing and enjoyable experience. The graphics are great, all the Nature looks incredible, and the music, which is very calm, is also great what enhances the experience even further. The boss battles are, however, challanging and make you in this worrying state for not losing Pikmin, this makes, this being such a calm calm game it's also really good to have some intense moments like these that really mean danger to you and that's how a boss battle should always feel like. It's a spleasure to explore through this game. On top of it all it has some of the best multiplayer modes in existance.. Years after the second one we just got rehashes of the gamecube one but now pikmin 3! I thought this wouldn't be as good as the 2 original and it was but this game is still perfect!. This was overall a decent experience. This is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The enemy designs were great and they did a great job making the areas as good as possible. However as a Pikmin veteran I have some complaints. The biggest being the time limit. Even though in reality I would have to play like an 8 year old to actually lose I still hate the feeling that you have a set time and that's it. It was this thing **** at me for my entire playthrough. Another thing I hate is that there is no Piklopedia. If you don't know what that is it is basically the best thing in Pikmin 2. I'm not saying this is a bad game I'm just saying that it needs improvements to be a truly great game. There are other things I dislike about this game but I don't want to be typing until 3am.. This game is so entirely amazing, I don't know where to start. It is everything I was hoping for in a Pikmin game, and a perfect improvement on its already great predecessors. The graphics, put plainly, are beautiful. The story is interesting, and they've finally got the time limit perfected. It's not the stressful, breakneck pace of Pikmin 1 nor the lazy, numbing pace of Pikmin 2, but rather a mellow pace that still pushes you to complete your goal. Using the GamePad for planning and strategizing is a great addition to the series. Pikmin finally found the right console! The Winged Pikmin are also a great addition to the lineup, and having three captains encourages multitasking and efficiency. It would've been nice if the White and Purple Pikmin hadn't been pushed off to the side, sure. The game could've had a few more items to collect for a really hard challenge. But overall, I couldn't be more happy with this game. If you have a Wii U, you should have this game. If you don't have a Wii U, you should have a Wii U and this game. Oh, and did I mention that the Pikmin are absolutely, positively adorable? Well, they are.. This game takes everything that was good about the first 2 pikmins and improves upon them. I love pikmin and it is a franchise i hope continues throughout Nintendo's life. Pros: I love the new rock and winged pikmin. The music is charming and goes well with the moods of the game. The graphics are beautiful and the artstyle is fantastic. Boss battles are fun and very rewarding Cons: The days are far too short and i feel that the length of them takes you out of the immersion of the game. The controls can be a little tricky to first figure out.. This games deserves more love. I'd never played Pikmin before it, and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it. It's the best game on the Wii U. I felt compelled to make a Metacritic account just to give it a 10. 9/10 The Pikmin are back in beautiful HD in Pikmin 3 + Beautiful graphics + 3 characters + Amount of landscape variety + New Pikmin types - Hard to control all activities - Time Limit. Great graphics make this game a pleasure to play. It requires a little bit of strategy and thought but is not too difficult for kids. The boss battles are good and varied. It is really good fun and worth getting. A highly polished game and the time limits mean it does not drag on too long for each level.. Alright so Pikmin 3 is a game in which you control bug like ""pikmin"" to help you escape a post apocolypse planet earth to return to your home planet (incase you didn't already know). First I feel I should get the (only) bad thing out of the way. This is game is short. like you can finish it in a few hours if you tried. Adding to this point is that the white and purple pikmin are still in this game and function perfectly however they are not in the story mode. Adding back these two pikmin to the story could've lengthened it by a few hours easily but I feel that it's really just more of a missed opportunity. Now that that's out of the way, let me gush about the rest of this game. Alright so first off, this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen and the music and visuals go so well together and it makes it that much better. Ontop of that, this game actually have a constantly flowing story which is a little unoriginal but it has very charming moments and a fair share of plot twists. I played this game using the wii remote and nunchuck while the gamepad acted as a map for me and I believe this is the most efficient way of playing. The motion controls are simple and on point (which hasn't been a problem in the Pikmin series anyway). The levels in story mode have tons of collectibles which consist of : Fruit, Journal logs, and hidden suit upgrades. All of the levels in pikmin three are each very unique and different from each other. Not to mention that all of the levels are quite massive! There are five different types of pikmin in the story mode and 7 in bingo battle and mission mode which are all very unique and fun to use (but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't already seen them). Bingo battle and mission mode are the two extra multiplayer modes in pikmin 3. Let me talk about bingo battle mode first. Bingo battle is a versus mode in which two players must try to fill out a bingo card at the bottom of the screen by carrying the items listed back to their base (whether it's the body of a monster, a fruit, or marble). The players can try to stop the other players from winning by having their pikmin battles each other, stealing the item they need to win, or (my person al favourite) by using a cherry to spin a roulette wheel to somehow buff your army or screw up your opponent. Each map uses two different types of pikmin (which are the same for both teams) which are best suited for the environment (for example a map with water on it will give you blue pikmin). There are 12 maps in total which you can unlock through playing on each map once. The last mode is mission mode which is split up into three smaller modes: Collect treasure, battle enemies, and defeat bosses. The titles are pretty self explanitory but i'll explain otherwise. Collect treasure is a mode where you are given a set number of pikmin and you must try to bring as many things as you can back to your base before the time runs out. Everything in this mode is worth money to try to bring everything back while being efficent and productive. ""Battle enemies"" similar except this time you're just fighting monsters and bringing them back to base before the time runs out. In ""Battle Bosses"" you fight the previous bosses you've encountered in the games story mode while trying to beat your previous record (by trying to lose less pikmin and by beating your time). the game also has DLC in the form of more missions for mission mode which I'll admit I haven't bought yet. All in all pikmin is a great game and series and this title doesn't disappoint. It's a little on the short side and I wouldn't pay the prices they're selling it for online (I bought it on release), but this game is worth the digital download and definitely worth your time. Hey this was my first review on metacritic. Tell me how it was by clicking if it was helpful or not. Thanks!. One of the best games on Wii U! This game is different but feels comfortable. This game is so fun that I've played story three times. But it still is challenging!. Pikmin 3 is what you call a game in the most true sense. A novel idea that takes you into another world and invites you to do things you've never done before. A game that can pull in gamers of all standards and give them something to enjoy. It can be easy to miss the deep and addictive challenge this game offers to hardcore gamers, but working to complete the game and challenges as fast as possible is a true test of your wits, and incredibly rewarding. There is truly no one way to complete this game and figuring out the most efficient way an insanely tough and incredibly rewarding experience. Pikmin 3 oozes with charm and replay-value. It's remains a truly novel and innovative franchise. It can be hard to see the appeal of Pikmin or even the point of it, I won't try to explain. Given a proper chance Pikmin will find its way in your gamers heart and never leave.. Pikmin 3 is fun, and gorgeous game that is very different from most other Wii U titles you will find. Story The story in Pikmin 3 is interesting, and has a good backdrop to it but its unfortunate that the hunt for Cpt. Olimar doesn't dive deeper into the mysterious planet that they land on. Gameplay The strategy involved in Pikmin 3 is what drew me to it and, that mixed with the puzzle like approach to areas, which you will be able to unlock over time once you discover more Pikmin species, is a very fun and rewarding process, and its nice to be able to go back to locations you visited and discover new items, and areas. Managing your Pikmin, and resources is the key to the game and it works well cycling through them to fight enemies, I only wish the game pad controls were a little less wonky, which they could be at times. Graphics/Presentation This is probably one of the prettiest games i have played on the Wii U, specifically in terms of the lighting effects, and level of detail put into the world. The game as expected from Nintendo runs very smooth, and I experienced no slowdowns or hiccups throughout my play-through. Overall Pikmin 3 is a must buy for Wii U owners, and is a very unique game to the platform. The strategic element to the game works well, and it is such a delight to play and explore its world.. Everything about this game is perfect. Personnally I prefer shorter games with high replay value and this title certainly hits the mark. Once you've beaten it you'll want to start all over again. Beautiful graphics and atmosphere, cool characters and ennemies, very original and fun to play, addictive.... Pikmin 3 is still the best Wii U game so far.. Other than some unfairly biased multiplayer, Pikmin 3 is a beautiful game that will have your mouth watering at the fruit and graphics, your mind watering at resource management as only the best RTS games can offer, and your eyes watering every time you mess up and your faithful little Pikmin die horribly. THEY TRUSTED YOU.. outstanding level design with so much room for player improvement and replayability, extra modes are very fun, a game polished to the bone, perfect presentation and progression.. Pikmin 3 is beautiful and unique, the graphics are some of the best this gen even compared to the much more powerful XB1 & PS4 games. The game play is fun & addictive, the multiplayer is good too. A must for all WII U owners.. This game is just another complete rip-off of angry birds. The game itself is exactly the same except the graphics quality is much lower and the gameplay is significantly less user friendly.. Pikmin 3 improves upon both previous games and has some of the cutest graphics ever. Probably the best RTS (Real Time Strategy) ever put on a console.. Best Pikmin game to date! I have played all three since the first came out, and this really ironed out any issues with the previous installments. The Wii U gamepad is utilized well and makes it even easier to manage your Pikmin army. I can't recommend this game enough! My ONLY cons: -No online multiplayer -Story mode too short (but highly re-playable). This game is gorgeous, really fun and the graphics are great. It's a complete new story that every wii u owner should try out. It's simply the best on the franchise and it deserves more love.. It's a shame that many won't be able to experience this amazing game. And yes, Pikmin 3 is amazing. From its visuals to its gameplay, it's surely a treat for players. First, the visuals. The graphics in the game are spectacular and in my opinion, it's the best-looking game on the Wii U alongside Mario Kart 8. It's not the level of graphics of your typical first-person shooter, but it looks gorgeous especially whenever it rains and you can see water on the ground. I can't tell you how many times I was amazed by the visuals. The gameplay in the game is the same as all the other Pikmin games. Usually you have a specific goal to accomplish in a certain in-game day and you must use the different types of Pikmin that have joined with you to complete the goal. There are many types of Pikmin in the game: red (defends fire), blue (can survive in water), and yellow (can withstand electricity), as well as the new rock (can break objects) and winged (can fly) Pikmin. The purple and white Pikmin do not make an appearance in the main mode but they make a return in one of the game's side modes. The gameplay is simplistic and fun and while you may not accomplish what you want to do in a day, you always have the next one. The Wii U GamePad is used as a map in the game w","aside from learning curve for the gamepad, the addition of it is what really makes Pikmin 3 a successor to its predecessors . overall Pikmin 3 is bigger and better than any other Pikmin game before it . a high recommend for anybody who liked pikmin 1 ."
811.Sunless Skies,"Its not for everyone, but it was definitely for me and I loved it. It can be slow, but I personally really like the writing, which is kind of the focus of the game. It's a gothic, Lovecraftian kind of horror that I really like. The prose is excellent, with word choices that border on pretentious in the best and most fitting way possible. So basically, the story is amazing, but it IS also most of the game and I know some people would not enjoy that (I, however, giggle like a schoolgirl every time my character goes through the Horrors(TM) so this is the sweetest of treats).. Wish I loved this far more than I do. The writing is very good. The stories I have pieced together have been engaging. Some of the characters are fun, and there's a humour to it all I can appreciate. It just gets far too bogged down in busywork and grind , and without the same sense of atmosphere which let Sunless Seas carry it off.. Sunless Skies is a mildly woke written book for people that still care about pronouns or think that getting a degree in literary English is a good idea. Nothing happened in the first 30 minutes of reading this book; I won't use the word ""gameplay"" here because it is undeserved.. Don't be fooled: Sunless Skies is a game about horror. More accurately, it's about the narrative of the game beating you over the head every so often to remind you of the horrors you're supposedly in. I gauge Sunless Skies by a ratio that I call 2 to 1; two parts brilliance to one part BS. See, most horror games allow you to circumvent the horror aspects by allowing you to plan for---and by extension mitigate---parts of the bad stuff you encounter. It's a delicate balancing act that the best horror games are able to pull off. There are exceptions, such as Darkest Dungeon, where you just have to prepare as best you can and hope for the best. Sunless Skies delights in disallowing that mitigation, foisting inconvenient and often hidden dangers upon you at every turn. I'm referring to the ""Nightmare"" and ""Terror"" mechanics, in which ""Terror"" fills at a constant rate regardless of what you do, and ""Nightmares,"" which measures how close you are to an unavoidable game over. Too much Terror, and your crew panics, with mutinies, madness, and outright crew loss. This guage fills constantly, and also fills due to actions you take. The problem is, it fills almost no matter what your choices are, and the game doesn't always tell you what induces Terror. Strip an enemy locomotive for parts? Somehow, that's scary, so you get Terror. Fail a check for hidden goods? Find Terror instead. Simply walk into the parlor of a Crewmember whom you apparently know well, but not well enough? That's Terrifying. Strike up a conversation with the wrong person? Oh, Terror. And often, the events that happen due to Terror do so with no apparent rhyme or reason, and often in rapid succession. I can't count the number of times that I've had a crew induce mutiny while I was fighting an enemy and my finger clicked a choice because I was in the heat of battle. Once, I had a mutiny happen three different times within the span of a minute of each other. Additionally, there is absolutely no doubt that the game will force you into situations during story choices regardless of your apparent success rate. I have failed FAR more times than succeeded, even with a 50% chance or higher of success due to my stats. It doesn't help that even with an apparent 100% success rate, you can STILL have what is called a ""partial success."" Even a partial success with a 100% success rate comes with a penalty. That penalty is---you guessed it---usually Terror. Eliminating Terror comes with few opportunities, but eliminating Nightmares is far more difficult, because the price to do so gets higher with every attempt. It's an un-fun mechanic that puts an arbitrary timer on your adventures, because regardless of what you do, it will get to the point where nothing can be done. This would be fine if there were multiple saves, but there are not---which is itself a heavy handed mechanic in modern games that really shouldn't be present. Combat is about as much fun as heaving a bag of rocks around in waist-high water. Your locomotive (why a **** the SKY?? Why not a zeppelin?) is as nimble as you would expect a flying locomotive to be. That is to say, it isn't. At all. Unlike Sunless Sea, you can strafe, but that doesn't mean much. Fighting others amounts to lobbing painfully slow volleys at a distance while your enemies dance circles around you. Particularly bad offenders are the Guests, parasites that masquerade as friendly locomotives and then spring their dirty surprise at you up close, scooting around far faster than you can ever hope to turn. Your only real tactic for survival is in spending an enormous amount of cash on a vessel that can take enough punishment during these frequent (and frequently frustrating) encounters. It doesn't help that the writing is very much in love with its own faux-Lovecraftian narrative, which it heaps upon you at every opportunity (O, horror! Lo, A Dead Star! Is it not terrible, this bleak and cyclopean sphere? Are you not frightened??) There are moments of levity, but they are far outweighed by the grimdark story, in which seeking the wonders of the sky simply aren't worth it. The game is practically devoid of any kind of humor, and the characters are a forgettable roster of cardboard placeholders, roughly half of which are of ambiguous gender, with no real reason to delve into their individual stories aside from the potential monetary rewards. I put about 80 hours into Sunless Skies. I put twice that into Sunless Sea, because that game maes more sense of the dread things that lurk beneath the waves and the things to discover were infinitely more fascinating. Sunless Skies is more accessible, with a more fleshed out economy, but that doesn't mean it's **** more fun. The writing can be interesting, but having the specter of failure constantly hang over your head through no fault of your own isn't fun at all.. Fantastic, beautiful. A superb text adventure combined with a beautiful 2D exploration game. Topped off with a magnificent soundtrack and superb sound effect design. Would be a 10/10 if it weren't for some stutter issues.. The combat is very unfulfilling and clunky. Management is nonexistent. The controls are eh. Character customization just ****. All characters feel the same. I can't recommend this game to anyone.. I love sunless skies but there are flaws pros great exploration when ever I played the game Loved seeing everything i saw in the backgrounds great writing this game has some of the best writing I've seen combat I did like the combat but its not the best great atmosphere and story the story kept me in maybe not the main story but the side story's cons I felt slow when exploring and a better engine is costly The main story I had to look for specific things to learn about story The best way to get money in my opinion takes time and resources to do even with the cons the pros outweigh them by a lot in rate this game a 10/10. Sunless Skies is not for everyone. It's sort of an acquired taste. So I can understand why a lot of people don't like it. The game has its flaws, there is no denying that, but I think they can be easily overlooked. At least if you're a fan of the Fallen London universe or appreciate video games for their story, atmosphere, tone, etc. and not for gameplay alone. The greatest issue I have with Sunless Skies is how needlessly unforgiving it is. The combat system is clunky and ineffective, so when you encounter enemies (and you encounter enemies at every turn) you always end up taking damage. If you could repair your sky engine at any port this wouldn't be an issue, but you can only get repairs in one or two ports per region. I find this quite frustrating and hard to understand especially since Sunless Skies is about exploration and free play first and foremost. It's actually counter-intuitive. The game should encourage you to explore new areas and discover more of the Fallen London lore, not constantly hinder your progress. Until you get the hang of it and learn how to avoid (or fight) enemies you have to spend half of your time just heading back to port for repairs. I feel this could (and should) be fixed. My other issues are not really worth listing. They are just minor annoyances. I have 100+ hours in the game so far and I still haven't explored all the areas. I barely reached the Blue Kingdom. But I thoroughly enjoy Sunless Skies, more than I did Sunless Sea. It's such an immersive experience and the lore is fantastic. So is the writing, which is quite important in a game that focuses on storytelling. I recommend you give this game a chance, especially if you appreciate deep lore, good writing and immersive gaming experiences.. This is definitely biased as I am a long fan of the Fallen London verse, so I am already pretty invested in this world. Nevertheless, if you are into atmospheric game with gothic eldritch horror undertone, you will definitely be into this. This game is also a lot friendlier to those who aren't that into the brutality of the rogue-like genre and just wanna keep the character to enjoy the ongoing story.. If you can look past the minor annoyances, the writing makes all the sunless games more than worth playing.. Big step back from Sunless Sea, sadly. They overdid this game. Main issues: The world is incoherent. There is no main theme to bond all elements. Why trains? Why not zeppelins? Floating islands? But why? How? Yes, game explains some of these but that's the problem: they overdid it. Too much of these. Aesthetic: again, everything is overdid. I'm looking on Albion and I'm not even sure what I'm looking for. Pipes, clockworks, fine... but again. WHY? I don't ask HOW. I ask WHY. The game is alienating me too much. I don't ask for story explanation. I'm asking for aesthetic one. WHY so much pipes, metal, clockworks when it just looks... stupid. Just be for ""being sake"". The tempo of the game is too slow. It was slow in Sunless Sea but here it's just... too much. Too much stories in one port: can be treated as weird one but I believe that it would be better to divide actual stories for more ports. I'm little bored after 30-40 minutes of constant reading... ...especially where stories are not so great. But again: the problem is not lack of writing skills. It's the lacking theme and incoheretion of the world. So overall: so far I'm dissapointed. The game is bland and boring comparing to Sunless Sea. They overdid it. Too much of everything without solid glue - the coherent world. And the atmosphere. Sunless Sea was more or less peaceful with horror elements. Now it's - again - too much ""horror"" elements. It's just bizarre.. Sorry, but I just hate everything about this game. Story, unrewarding combat, game stutter/freezes, UI navigation, nothing happens, dieing, controller support.. I bought this game on Feb 7 and I haven't played it a lot. It's not because I don't like it, it's because of the updates that keep coming out. Just yesterday, there was a 19 Mo patch... When I consulted the list of it s' (numerous) fixes, I was unhappily surprised to read that ""We're currently working on a major update that will be out in the next month or two..."" I paid 23€ for this game and, I understand that at launching, there could/would be some minor fixes but, what I don't understand - maybe I'm dumb - is that an obviously unfinished game can be sold, as is. This seems to be a new norm for recent games. Apparently, gamers are now considered to be Beta testers by editors and developers. I'm no Beta tester so, I'll wait a few months for this game to be stabilised and complete before I spend any time playing it. For those who are, good luck and keep up your good work !. this game is amazing the atmosphere and writing are flawless this game is one of the best. With a focus on intircate story telling and excellent atmosphere rather than action and complex gameplay, Sunless Skies is an refreshing change of pace.. Its atmospheric, exploration story. Beautiful, otherworldly, quirky and maddening. Between the role playing aspect and the artwork alone make this worth sinking a few dozen hours into. Game play isn't much different then Sunless Sea; Combat-lite mechanics seem just to add a rarely engaging system of story pacing. Though the beautiful setting it worth inching all over it can get repetitive.. Like Sea before it, Sunless Skies has some really good writing and atmosphere but the gameplay is about as fun and engaging as a screensaver. There simply isn't much to it, the combat is very basic and besides that the game has nothing but simple resource management, rng stat checks and waiting; mostly waiting since traveling from place to place will take up most of your playtime, and like Sea it just involves staring at you vessel while it chugs through a nice looking but ultimately featureless map. Cheats can make the experience bearable by speeding up the game and removing the need to grind but a game that requires one to use outside means to avoid playing has failed at being a game. Probably makes for a good LP assuming it's screenshot-only or highly edited.. Failbetter live up to there name... Many improvements to Sunless Sea. but Still so much fail. Pro's: Great writing, improved User interface that takes the design of '100 days', gorgeous world design, combat much more dynamic and fun. Cons: 70% of the game is doing nothing waiting to get somewhere.. the pacing is awful and ends up you have to grind the same locations to get a slither of story. This game tries to be a rogue lite like the first.. but it makes for a terrible roguelite experience as you end up just like the first repeating the same story content. You can turn this off which i recommend.. but you still have to deal with **** movement speed and the wims of autosave.. which just failed on me.. Post-apocalyptic Victorian adventure novel set within a mission driven combat-lite exploration game. + Well composed and atmospheric environment, rife with pathetic fallacy. + The stories are rich and diverse, tempting you ever onward. + Combat puzzles have some diversity and are a fun aside. - Fairly regular stuttering when loading new scenes can break immersion. - Some UX issues and missing quality of life conveniences. - Combat AI is relatively immature, leading to common glitches. If you enjoyed Frostpunk’s theme, Windward’s gameplay or Darkest Dungeon’s storytelling, then this is worth picking up and likely a must have after the first patch...","""sunless skies"" is a gothic, Lovecraftian kind of horror that i really like . the prose is excellent, with word choices that border on pretentious in the best way possible . ""sunless skies"" is a mildly woke written book for people that still care about pronouns ."
812.Total War: WARHAMMER II,"It's getting better. The devs are doing all the right things. I like this game alot, I hope you do too!. This is the most exciting and infinitely replayable game I have ever played! It deserves a 10, all the way. No negatives to report.. Successful and good game. I've played over 100 hours but it has a depth of content that feels like I could play forever. Only problems with the game are the extremely long loading screens and optimization issues. Despite being an old game, PC performance is not as good as it should be.. Beautiful, huge, complex, superb grand strategy game with the awesome option to implement the map and factions of the previous game... In the other hand it includes less faction than previous game with worse DLC politic and appears to be only a remake of WTW1. It's one of the good total war series game but absolutely not the best. Almost every gameplay mechanisms and parts in the campaign are as they should be. Of course, the same old process still continues and some details are missing in the game like naval battles or family tree and ... Apparently, they have hidden a series of deficiencies behind the theme of the game. I think the research tree was acceptable and also diplomacy is good although it could have been have some more options in diplomacy but it's acceptable. I really didn't liked agents and their abilities. About battles the first thing I should say is about enemy, AI stupidity and bugs are much less. But I think Warhammer 2 has the most untacticable battles. I can almost say when you are weaker you should lose and it' so hard to change it. Even There is no units formation option in battle and it's really bad. The maximum number of armies is not based on the number of settlements and I like the new mechanism. But there is a problem here. When you take most of the settlements of a big and powerful Faction and only one or two settlements remain, now since the decrease in the number of their settlements does not decrease the number of Armies, you have to defeat a large number of Armies gathered in one Province. And about factions designs, the game has many different races and every race has its own faction and unit design and this vast design is really impressive. Just I think some faction's units are unbalanced and maybe it would be better if it wasn't like that. Also soundtrack is good but not as much as old total war games. In the end I should say that, I really liked Warhammer 2 and I played it for many hours it's a real good game but if there were more details that I talked about, it could have been a great game for me.. I feel very conflicted about this game. I have spent over a 100 hours in this game but the longer you play the more the faults of the game shine through. My main complaint is that the campaign AI is TERRIBLE. In order for the AI to be competitive they receive massive bonuses to everythin. Some examples: The AI cannot be relied upon to build the correct buildings so they will just have the ability to recruit whatever units they want no matter the buildings. They get enormous bonuses population growth and happiness. These are just a couple of examples, and this means that a strategy to make the enemy populace rebel is just impossible because the AI gets such a huge bonus to population happiness. Only one map. I get that this is the warhammer world map. But the game would just be infinitely more replayable if it was not the same map every time. Diplomacy is useless and only serves to be annoying. The mod ""no diplomacy"" is basically a requirement to play this game without going insane. Units and combat tactics are very poorly balanced. This game is fun in the beginning, but the more you play the more the problems with the game become obvious. In my opinion the DLC monetization model has failed this game. Instead of improving the game they are adding more unique lords and unbalanced units.. Incredible faction variety and presentation. Hundreds or thousands of hours worth of replayability. Held back by bugs, and some factions being obviously outdated or insufficient compared to newer ones. Amazing DLC scheme is worth mentioning, only buy what you want to play because all DLC units are in the game to play against regardless of ownership.. Very buggy. Worst game in the whole series! Very greedy company, dont buy their game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply amaznig game, high cost and many dlcs but for hunderds of hours. lots of replayability. Not only the most fun Total War game ever, but also THE most fun game ever. The mechanics are all wonderfully implemented, the soundtrack be banger yo, the visuals are stunning, the voice actors went all out, and of course the gameplay is unrivaled.. This game is pretty good, not the biggest fan of RTS, but I can enjoy this game for its value.. So glad I tried this game. Had enormous fun with it. Really enjoyed the battles which were easy to pick up, as was the incremental learning curve which was interesting and felt comfortable. Had a blast. Definitely a fan, recommended!. Very weak optimization. Intel cpu based game only. A shame. A game of 2017, running poorly on a 2020 pc. Absolutely shameful.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 7.. The game is just crashes on the launch. I tried all the fixes that are proposed on the Internet and non of them helped.. Excellent design, spectacular battles, warhammer fantasy setting, but monotonous tactical battles, a sea of add-ons at an unjustified price, scarcity of animations make the game perfect for fans of this setting. As the total var game is average, it is a pity that it will continue to be so in the third part and in historical games.. I'm McLoving it! Game's great and gets only better with every patch and expansion CA releases. Can't wait for TWWH3. By far the most addicting and time-consuming game I've ever played, please play responsibly. This is my first Total War game and when I lost my first campaign, I honestly felt like quitting. I watched a couple YouTube videos, hopped back on and won my first campaign 60 hours in. There's still so many factions and campaigns to try, and I still **** at battles, but the learning curve is not as steep as you would think. There's easily hundreds of hours of fun packed into here, with lots of free DLCs. Highly recommend.. **** **** garbage with broken gameplay 0 balance 100 random **** also waiting simulator. I'm I the exact target audience for this game? Yes Is this a perfect game ? Absolutely no Did i spent more than 2000 hours finishing almost every campaign? Of course I did If you liked Warhammer Fantasy Battle this is a dream come true. If you just like strategy games this is probably the best chapter in the Total War series. If you want to play as elves or skaven, and you don't pay too much attention to lore etc. this is a very good title. Unfortunately, like all Total War games, he suffers from some ills, adding his own. In its current state, with all (except the last) DLC and FLC, it provides fun for tens of hours. The following rating is based on the complete title with all available content: + Number of playable lords + Mechanics of some factions + Graphics and audio + Wood Elven Re-balance + Quantity and visual aspect of the Tradition of Magic + Mortal Empire campaign + MODS (SFO especially) - Lords are not as interesting or even playable - Mortal Empire campaign is not a ""linked map"", to fit the map from one, large areas of the map have been cut out of two (in the south and west) - The game has an undead pirate faction, but still no naval battles - Some campaigns are stupid to win conditions or require defeating factions on the other side of the map - Buggy achievements - PRICE. Easily the best Warhammer and Total War game in either series. 30 hours into the High Elf campaign and im not sure I have the stamina for any of the others just yet, but after some very memorable battles defending Ulthuan from CONSTANT skaven ambushes and feeling sure I had conqured the northern wastes. The final battle makes it worth it, especially seing the Old World realised like this. Great game.. best RTS ever made?, probably should prefice this by saying that I am a warhammer fan in general so perhaps I am a little biased. for me the whole system is(you can tweek things o your like i.e you can turn off the chaos invasion) fantastic and it has a fantastic fantasy setting which for me puts it above the other TW games.. Better than the last but still not a good total war game. Many total war features were simplified for casuals that are new to the genre and overall the game is much easier. The only good thing it has is the fantasy setting but there isn't much replayability once you have tried each one of the races.. Very similar to the first one. I wish they would have done more with the story but it's still rather enjoyable. Date Completed: 2021-04-18 Playtime: 44h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: I enjoyed it so I'd say ""yes"".. Worst game ever made. thank god sega doesnt make consoles anymore. It is well known that SEGA implements AI that cheats if you are doing too well. They ruined Company of Heroes and Total War. They cant even make a decent sonic game anymore. If i ever meet a SEGA employee, i have 2 middle fingers waiting to flick you off! They should call is White Hammer since they hate nonwhite people so much there isnt 1 man or woman character that is not white. I'm only about 10 hours into the game at the moment, and for a Total War game, that leaves a lot of ground to be covered. But after years of watching this game and waiting for a moment where its price dipped to a point that I could afford *and* my head was in the right place to fully indulge the game, I finally got my claws on it and felt eager to offer some of my impressions for anyone in the same boat. First thing's first - the game isn't *that* much different from its predecessor. More than anything, it's a different setting with different playable races in the same world. The game is functionally the same in terms of its general mechanics and presentation. The main campaign revolves around the opening and closing of a magical Vortex in the Elven lands and seems to place its story in a much more central role than the previous game. I'm not gonna lie, I don't much care about that story. Total War has always been about chasing supremacy, and while I appreciate the fact that they've tried to develop a narrative, I can't say I've found a lot of time to divert my actions to what the story wants me to achieve when I've got two factions of undead pirates with seemingly endless resources at their disposal constantly raiding my territories. I didn't ask them to attack me. The game made that happen. So it's a bit frustrating to be strategising, building armies, maneuvering them into place and getting ready for the coup de gras, only for the game to strip control away from you and move the camera to some other area in which a bunch of magic stuff is going on that means absolutely nothing to me, and then hits me with half a dozen pop-ups with timed missions pertaining to everything other than the immediate existential threat to my civilisation. I can't account for Warhammer 1, as it's been a while since I've played it, but I don't recall ever struggling so much against individual enemies as I have against these pirates. They live on isolated atolls out in the middle of the ocean, so you have to rally your army and take them on a 3 turn journey to get to their stronghold. On the way you might encounter a pirate army that chips away at your forces, and attrition from being in corrupted territory might make you weaker still. Then, when you finally get to their last settlement, you find it's full of 2000 pirate soldiers and monsters. You've come all this way, so you attack, and you put on a good show - taking out 75% of their forces, but losing the battle. So you have to journey back to your lands 3 turns away to muster more forces, and when you return you find that the single, lone settlement the pirates hold is suddenly filled to the brim with soldiers, as well as two full armies floating around the area. Seems a bit unfair that you have to own 6-8 settlements to get one full army of reasonable strength without bankrupting your nation, while the pirates are here pumping 5 thousand soldiers out in a few turns from one location. The end result is that you spend hours trying to whittle them down to the last man, only to have it all undone in 10 minutes and their armies replenished to full strength straight away. I've should have accepted it when they sued for peace. Instead I've wasted a bunch of time fighting for an objective that now seems insurmountable, and I've had to disengage and wait for them to lay waste to my nearest city while I'm distracted. I guess that's war against the undead for you. I've read complaints about the game tweaking the rules for CPU armies. Maybe this is what that is. I also recently realised that certain elements of the game have been paywalled in a way I don't recall from the first. Namely, that you can't confederate with factions within your own race if they have paid DLC attached to them. An example of this is the Yvresse faction of Elves. The game gave me a mission to ally with them, so I did. Now they're my greatest ally, and own a bunch of territory I helped them acquire, and I can't confederate with them because controlling their Lord requires paid DLC. Putting them in the game for free inclines the player to invest in them, only find a big dollar-sign roadblock in their way. It's sneaky and gross. That said, it can't be denied that most of what made Warhammer 1 good is on display here. And the fact that you get the Mortal Empires sandbox mode, in which you can play on a giant map of the combined areas of both games, with 117 playable factions, is just bonkers. That's perhaps the best reason to buy. But because of the frustrating DLC and suspicious AI, I'd still say the game is only worth it at a steep discount. 90 bucks for a three-year-old game that pressures you to pay for DLC in order to stop basic diplomatic gameplay being gated off from factions it gives you no choice but to interact ****'s just not worth it. Go for number 1 first, or if you have it, get this and play Mortal Empires.. I love the way the game captures the huge scale of the wars between the factions. The only problem continues to be the lazy AI that all Total War games use. The challenge comes in the form of the computer opponents cheating to instant build huge armies or create units that they clearly couldn't (and faster than they should be able to). They also don't have to deal with territorial stability or politics and the computer will always favor attacking a player over another PC, regardless of political affiliation. If the developers would fix these issues, the game would truly be amazing.. Metacritic, a place for raging gamers to slate games, and paid reviewers to unjustly inflate positive reviews. Total War: Warhammer 2 however, is a an absolute masterpiece. Total War meets Warhammer, is there anything more to say? I would only critise the DLC prices.. Not only the best Warhammer Fantasy Game, but also one of the best Total War games.. Probably my favorite strategy game ever, its the virtual manifestation of everything bad ass. This game will imerse you in a fantasy world like no other. if you're a fan of LotR or any fantasy universe you just can't be disapponted. So many races, so many heroes, units, lands, maps, abilities, magic, equipments. No campaing is like the other, even if you use the same lord out of around 64 legendary commanders, each with a unique story and gameplay. You will want to buy every single DLC cause it's worth it. Constant updates and free downloadable content, as well as respect towards the community and costumers that CA has, makes this just a wonderfull game for anyone that loves fantasy. Great visuals, great music, great voice acting. Plus, you can watch a dragon fight a T-rex, while a wizard is summoning a rain of fire on top of orcs, and a gigantic crab is eating a human alive on the same battlefield. Just buy it already.. A masterpiece, one of the best strategy games of all times, congratulations to CA.. seems strange to block all the free dlc during a free weekend also why can't i play mortal empires dlc considering i have downloaded it but the game play is pretty good. Game is excellent in and of itself. Wha I don't like the idea of this Trilogy being just adding on new content on top of old content and charging another $60. In other words You can buy Warhammer 1 for $60 and then will buy Warhammer 2 which will have the same content as Warhammer 1 and then you can buy Warhammer 3 which will have the same content as 1 & 2! Why spend $180 instead of just waiting for Warhammer 3 and saving yourself $120?? RIPOFF!! A.I. STILL **** (They same bad as Rome 2). i skipped 'Total war: warhammer I', I thought that i wouldn't enjoy a total war based on fiction. Boy was i wrong, this game sure is the best total war up until this day.. Very fresh and original Total War game. Introduction of magic, big monsters, epic lords, different races make this game really good. Playing with different race is just like playing different game. I almost lost interest in historical Total War titles because of Warhammer, because they are not as complex and they dont have so much content.. The game itself is fantastic. The DLC is overpriced for what you get. $22 (CAD) for the Beastmen? Another $22 for the Wood Elves. Repeat for each non-base game faction... Oh, and you need to own the first game to have access to a lot of what the second game has to offer... So two full price games plus all of the DLC? You're looking at well over $200. For that price, you better be certain this is the type of game for you.. Playable only on mid difficulty level if you really want the Total War experience, which is a very bad thing for HC strategy games fans and for TW fans. All the higher difficulty levels are mostly about exploiting AI stupidity or using some silly cheeses so there is almost nothing in the strategy dimension, core units no longer have the passive/active skills that can turn the battle tides, all melee units are the same garbage so this game on legendary difficulty level is just about getting some giant flying monster and support it with archers and artillery to harass the enemy for eternity while eating a sandwich and thinking about some Mia Khalifa.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is a really high quality total war game and delivers above and beyond others in the series. It's visually stunning, the sound is excellent and the combat mechanics feel very well adjusted. The negatives are: 1.sometimes the agents on the campaign map bug out and tpose across the map, which really pulls you out of it. 2. Enemy factions in campaign mode carry out frustrating spam and swarm tactics, such as spamming agents to assassinate and wound all your heroes. 3. Higher difficulties don't mean more complex behaviour from the A.I. just that the A.I.'s units are buffed with additional damage leadership defence etc. These negatives are nowhere near enough to bring the game down from is excellent level. There is a lot of DLC but it isn't necessary to buy all of it, you can pick and choose what appeal to you or just play the base game and you will not be barred from major mechanics or updates. Best to also own tww1 so you have access to the massive mortal empires campaign. Amazing game, definitely worth playing for strategy fans and newcomers.. 1000+ hours on Steam. The game has the most complex and rewarding structures of any Total War, with a very active modding community, regular large DLC updates from CA that add significant features or factions. The biggest negative is that you do need to buy a lot of DLC to get the full experience, but there are regular sales which make the cost easier to stomach, and there are potentially thousands of hours play time to be found.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing strategic game in a fantasy scenario. It's unbelievably well balanced considered the number of different races. The number of races and how different they make it very replayable. you can play with and you can basically play it forever without getting ever tired of it. The game isn't perfect though. The load screens take far too long and the story quest battle could be more explored, there are two few of them and if you are not into the Warhammer world you might not even understand those quests. Another issue is the reliability system of the game. In some situations, it doesn't make much sense, situations completely out of your control may make you lose reliability. 8.7/10. Very solid game. Alot of interesting mechanics with constant updates. Great options for mods and overall an experience that keeps on giving.. Why write a review for a 2017 game at 2020? Easy. Because you have sunk 2000+ hours on a game that keeps re-invening itself every few months or so. Allot of things have been said by others on the mechanics and flaws and whatnot. I can only speak on how this game affected me, as a long time, hardcore Total War fan since Rome. This game will conquer you. The historical titles will feel blunt in comparison. If you are a Warhammer fan in addition, it's even worse. You life will be consumed. You are not prepared. Buy that **** It's awesome.. I like this game very much my daddy bought it for me i like play as the dark elves be casue they are so cool and badass and i cut my self. Just improves upon the first game. If you liked Total War: Warhammer definitely pick this up.. Almost perfect game in this genre. Probably part 3 will pull 10 out of 10. We'll see... Incredible game for single player and coop multiplayer. Astonishing variety of factions, races and units for each one of them. Warhammer`s lore only helps stablish the richness and variety never seen in a game before. Stunning, colossal cinematic style battle. Strategy at macro and micro level are essential, If you are going to get it, start on Hard difficulty. The real game begins when you choose either Very Hard or Legendary. I just lowered it to 9 and not 10 bcause there a ton of DLCs, however, FreeLcs are plentiful and will give you hundred of hours of gameplay. OST: 10/10 GAMEPLAY: 10/0 GAME ENGINE: 9/10 (High ammounts of units at the same time will cause alg unless youre running it on a super machine). Also, developers put the CREATIVE in CREATIVE ASSEMBLY.. Yes, it's pricy. No doubt about that, but if you judge hours of fun per buck it's absolutely up there - doubly so if you even slightly enjoy Warhammer lore. Easy recommendation on that one.. Right now, this game offers endless replay-ability. so many factions and heroes to choose from and a huge campaign map to conquer. They fixed a lot of the performance issues too, it is a really solid game now and with mod enhancements, this total war title is going to have longevity like no other. What stands out: - Voice acting is really good - Dinosaurs vs Undead - Fully kitted lords is an army by itself - Faction design oozes character, owing to the warhammer fantasy world it self - Some units and heroes are over the top fun to use. Warhammer 1 was apretty good title, but it always felt like it lacked many things to keep it interesting. Warhammer 2 fixed that and beyond, With all the extra content and balancing patches over the years, this is now one of the best PC RTS games of all time. The sheer content with all DLCs will keep you busy for years. With a total of 1500 hours on Warhammer 1 and 2, I've still only tried out half of the factions in the game! Best of all, it will get even better with Warhammer 3.. Absolutely amazing game! I've spent many hours (...days) enjoying myself playing this awesome game! ( also great modding community!). It's a must have if you enjoy fantasy RTS!. Hauling an overrated and boring fantasy setting that pales compared to others the unholy trio of CA, SEGA and GAMES WORKSHOP managed to create this abomination. There is hardly any reason to talk about the predatory and downright lititious DLC practices as everyone has already spoken about it, therefore this review is only about the gameplay. Technical: -Total War Warhammer 2 only seems like a beautiful game, yet even on ultra it is downright ugly with poor models. -This game has a myriad of bugs and glitches that have appeared in the first game raging from mere annoyance to downright game breaking (LOS bug for direct fire units the most insulting). -Crashes galore with no discernable reason and no crash report with the most common crash the ""battle loading screen"" one and best of all no solution to it. -Poor perfomance thanks to an old engine coupled with long load times. -Poor mod support, alas, don't expect Medieval II levels of modding in this. -No patch support as it exist only to accompany DLCs. -Ai does not play by the same rules even on normal difficulty, sustaining 2 stacks of troops with only one province. CAMPAING: -Plenty of unique races that in the end play the same and are just as boring. -Small selection of buildings and restrictive building slots since SHOGUN 2 any sort of complexity. -No Tax control, no population restiction (only growth) and easy asf to maintain Public Order. -No discernable choices in campaing. -No unit upgrades making the absurdity of existing 2 tipes of units, for example the High Elves have archer and archer with light (armor) with the latter only costing a little more with better stats (we had an entire system in ATTILA devoted to avoid unit redudancy and saturation while making technology more important). -Economy **** beyond reason far too easy to be swimming in gold. -Most bare bones diplomacy in the series and out of place in this ""grim fantasy"" where everyone is an **** -Poor camera controls and UI making a drag to try and micromanage your lords and heroes. -Too many AI players doing their stuff resulting in long turn times and being forced to watch every single AI troop move his ass around. -On the topic of technology none of it unlocks new units, upgrades, buildings or changes the playstyle of a faction, on the contrary, they are all stats buffs. -Resources are not used as restrictions to build units or as means of improving them like in past games, this results in doomstack spam later in the game. -To avoiud the doomstack CA had the brillaint idea of making it impossible to have more than one army around (supply lines). -Armies are still bound to generals making movement a drag add to that how little movement points there are. -Armies still replenish automatically so good luck with guerrila warfare and wars of attrition. BATTLES: -Most bland total war game out there despite of the different factions. -Uses the poor new system of HP and armor which makes ranged weak unless you stack a bunch of bonuses. -Ranged units will not shoot because of LOS and obstructions. -Terrible selection maps that are also too damn small for any tactical play other than doomstack. -Terrain, apart from blocking ranged attacks, have little effect on the tactical play since there is hardly any difference in holding a high ground or not. -Battles are still too fast with units. -No unit formations as apparently in ""grim fantasy"" using one's brain to position one's troop is blasphemy. -Cavalry still **** even the fabled Brettonia are eaten alive by the new monstrous units (blame this damn engine and its terrible fluidity) and still get stuck everywhere. -Leadership might not even exist as units barely rout in this one even the cowardly skaven will only rout when led by a level 1 lord, add to that fact that units get ""broken"" meaning they keep returning to pester the other side, because of this they fight to the death most of the time. -Not only that but attack on the sides and the rear no longer yields massive gains and quick routing (making ranged and cavalry even weaker). -The fantastical elements are no better since all that matters is stats check. -Lords are unbalanced with meele ones being unstoppable machines while ranged ones are weak asf. -Magic is either underpowered or overpowered with no middle ground. -No sea battles even though this game has vampirates. -Sieges are at its worst with no towns to fight on, to burn and civilians to kill ala ATTILA ( add to that no towers to aid the garrison). -Cities are a pain to siege thanks to overpowered towers, long siege-holdouts and instant ladders. When you add the consumer unfriendly policy of CA , it is safe to say that the entire purpose of the Total War Warhammer series is to be a plataform for selling DLC and for this, I have no hope that the third entry in the seires will be any different.. The dumbing down of the franchise continues. Now with added bad performance.. 1800 hours on steam. the sandbox gameplay and the constand updates make this a gread game. that can be played endlessly. just 1 campaign can take up to 100 hours. and if you start the same campiagn agian you wil stil have a differend expirians. This is my first Total War game so I can't compare it to the former ones. This game is very interesting and has a lot of mechanics which makes a strategy game a good one. Essentially this is Heroes Of Might And Magic with a decent battlefield and a deeper game mechanics. ONLY, it is completely ruined by bugs / mistakes. 1. The game AI is hard-core, even in normal, except if it has to help you. Then it becomes dumb. 2. The loading screen is unacceptably long, even on SSD. This is a huge disappointment. 3. There is the black-screen bug when start. You can fix this by constantly clicking the right and the left mouse button on the Windows panel while the game is loading (welcome to 2020). 4. There is a black-screen bug coming back to the map from battle. You can fix this by completely disabling shadows. 5. There is a sudden desktop crash during loading the battlefield. You CAN NOT fix this. I lowered the graphics to the lowest level to see if it has something to do with video memory (RX580 4gb), nothing has changed (not even the loading time). This is that frequent that it happening in every three battles. This is literally game breaking, since you have to restart the whole game and enjoy the loading screen. Completely unacceptable. 6. Camera angle bug on the main map. All of a sudden, the camera angle has changed itself to be too vertical from horizontal. Changing options doesn't do anything. Thank you. Are you telling me that I going to play 100+ hours with a bad camera angle? I could forgive anything, except the 5. You can finish the game by auto-resolving every battle, but it can be boring after a while. If these bugs / mistakes were not present, this game will be a steady 8/10. But I literally had to abandon it because of them, and I can't see that these bugs going to be fixed, so I can't see I going to play it again or recommend this game to anyone.. Warhammer makes total war definitely more interesting. But heroes abilities and agents, as well as buildings could have been better developed. Overall it seems as total war has barely evolved over the years.. One of the greatest strategy games ever. A good combination between turn-based strategy with RTS. Real time battle with hundreds or thousands soldiers, huge monsters, air force, powerful magics, legendary warriors, hundreds projectiles in the air and much more. 15 races - which the game-play for each differs widely. Two big campaigns: One big with the 6 races of the Total War Warhammer 2 and 2 races from Total War Warhammer. Second campaign with bigger map, much longer game play, and all the races - but you will need both Total War Warhammer to play it. In each campaign every race have different mechanisms that have big effect on the gamep","despite being an old game, PC performance is not as good as it should be . it's one of the good total war series game but absolutely not the best . despite being an old game, PC performance is not as good as it should be ."
813.Driver,"driver we will never forget 🫶🏻 A legendary game at the time, it paved the way for open-world games.. The final level of the game is complete and total BS, but the game aside from that is top tier. I'd go as far as to say one of the best games on the PS1, and it holds up well even today. The graphics (for the time) are very well done. The car you drive feels weighty and (for the time) pretty realistic. The missions are (almost) all super fun and the chases are pretty exciting, though they can be annoying since you can't end the mission without losing the cops. That last point is one of the reasons why the last mission is BS, the cop spawns are way too frequent, making it nigh impossible to get through to the end in one piece.. Graphics and poor voice acting aside, this is a fun driving game. Almost too fun at times, with the missions and jobs you’re required to do. The main issue I have with this game, though, is the controls. Good LORD are they sensitive! Sometimes, it feels like you’re driving on ice when you turn. You have to be so delicate with the handbrake as to not careen into oncoming traffic or light poles. And those RNG-controlled cop cars? Get the **** out of here. There is NO prediction as to when or where they will show up. I once got to my destination to be met with berries and cherries flashing in my face, prompting the game to tell me to “lose the tail”. This often ended my missions. As much as I liked this game… **** this game.. Great game but it is definitely the most difficult game I've ever beat one of the missions took me 2 hours to beat but overall its a fun game and I would recommend it. A masterpiece of car chase gameplay. If you get past the brutal tutorial, you get one of the best PS1 games ever. Had many playthroughs as a child and would always come back to it. Overall rating: 8.9.. This game either didn't age well or wasn't designed well, plain and simple. Cops just appear in front of you on the radar, cars have the damage resistance of cardboard, cops only know how to ram you and not arrest you and car physics are equivalent to that of bumper cars. Just play Driver 3, PL, 76 and San Francisco.. Fun game of my childhood. It was very hard from the beginning but also very rewarding you you mangaged to get trough.. Along with Midtown madness this was the pioneer of driving game series. I had a lot of fun with this.. Was mind blown when I first played this game on PS1 long time ago. Solid 9/10 game. Fun aspect 11/10.. Let me start by saying how great the physics for this game are, and how it surprisingly still holds up TO THIS DAY; it's incredible. The way the car moves, and reacts to the environment; the crashes, and swinging - really cool. I should also mention the good atmosphere and soundtrack for this title. A lot of jazz and blues, and that's great to listen. It brings a retro feeling (even for when it was released, back in 99', I believe). The rain effects are really good, they look great. The game presents four major cities in the campaign, each with their individual vibe, and well represented. I don't think they hold many secrets, but they still pleasant to the eyes, as these were fairly good graphics for it's time. Also, there's a good replayability factor, since you can't do all of the missions in just one playthrough; sometimes you may have to choose one from two or three available contacts. Plus, you still got a director camera to film and edit your own cuts, and a few additional standalone modes you can have an extra fun with. Unfortunately, the game lacks a captivating story, a good protagonist, interesting characters overall, and car variety, as we only have a handful of vehicles to drive around the cities. Tanner doesn't have much charisma, and that certainly applies to the rest of the cast; no exceptions (actually they don't have any charisma at all). It's kind of hard to keep track of who's talking, and who's who during the cinematics, as they don't have any lip-synch or subtitles pointing out who's having the word. Some missions have a timer only for the sake of having it, instead of making any sense. Also, the opening mission, where you're given a proficiency test in the parking lot, doesn't make much sense at all. Why would you ask a proficiency test from a person who just got his hands in the controller? Sure, Tanner is already good using the wheels, but the player isn't. There's the tutorial, but the tutorial should be included in the campaign. Kinda poorly executed. Many people gave up right there and then. Anyway - I don't really have a lot to complain about the gameplay itself, as it does a good job of being a driving simulator, but that sort of brings me to the final mission of the game. NO SPOILERS: The final mission throws the idea of being a simulation to the garbage bin, and tries everything in it's power to completely frustrate and ruin your day. It doubles up the chasers' speed, and probably triples their bumping strength. I was countless times pummeled to death, and even thrown OUT OF THE MAP... literally; I could see the whole map disintegrate right before me as I flew away. For some reason, developer Reflections turned the game into a bumper car simulator, and let me tell you, it is the hardest mission I've ever played in a video-game; and I've played a lot of games. DRIVER was well respected, and very influential back in the day, and I believe you should at least experience what it offers once; though keep in mind it has aged in some aspects, and is also incredibly difficult at some points; especially during it's final mission, where all hell breaks loose, and you shall feel hopeless. In my opinion, it was an OK game back then.. Open world car game with best story for ps1................................. I recently tried this cult classic again on the PC and the graphics/gameplay are still fun. That can't be said about lot of other games. Only downside is the absurdly difficult campaign though.. Such a fantastic game. Driver 1 and Driver 2 are still two of the best video games ever made. Driver 1 has a fantastic gameplay and Driver 2 has the most memorable missions i have ever played in my entire life.. The classic yet better than many recent cars games in terms of driving mechanic, unforgiving missions and brutal cops. Driver is the game of my old days i still play it to this day and i have the same feeling as i first played it.. The first entry of the Driver series is still the best choice. The graphics, controls and gameplay simply rule! The game was revolutionary and is still great fun. But can be pretty difficult, especially the start,. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GOOD.. Perfect game but too much harder than it should've **** police difficulty should've been much lower.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. in my time it was a best open world game before GTA III release . i paying this many time. There's something interesting to be said that a game can be funner when manipulating its glitches rather than actually playing it for its original purpose. Driver is one of those rare games, and for once it's not really a bad thing. The game does have mission-breaking glitches—your car flying off of the map, going through invisible walls into the ether, and so much more. However, utilizing these glitches in leisure or challenge modes are mouth watering. The reason? This game came with a replay mode where you could save your best ""work."" Hit a car on its side at just the right spot and your car or the other one will go flying to hilarious new heights. It makes for fantastic laughs with friends trying to create new videos, one-upping one another to put together the greatest madness possible. However, there is also a story mode here. While it is interesting, taking on a 1970s cop drama/thriller theme, it can feel absurd with some poor dialogue and voice acting. However, none of this is problematic enough that you will lose interest in playing. The story quests are challenging, some incredibly so, and will keep you going for some time. Just be sure to do one thing when you begin this game: don't give up on that opening driving test! it's tough and annoying, but it will prep you for how crazy this game is going to get.. Handling is bad. Speed is bad. Acceleration is horrible. You apparently drive a base model/ bottom of the line common car as a getaway car (honestly, my 2006 stock Scion XB performs better). Most of the game is made up of seventy five percent luck/rng and twenty five percent skill (with the last mission being ninety nine percent luck/rng and one percent skill). But, at the end of the day there's just something to it that makes this game fun (most of the time).. Driver was utterly outstanding for its time on the playstation. The tutorial was the most frustrating part of the game ironically but that didnt stop me fro playing through the game. I had a lot of fun ramming my car into the police as they chased me down. Avoiding police using the map was engaging and I was anxious. I'll never forget driver. Overall, a cool driving game that has physics errors but was an amazing experience as a child playing this.. Driver is a timeless classic. While the first mission is extremely difficult, the game is a lot of fun. Graphics look great for an early open world game, the cars control great and the maps are varied in design, The cops are brutal but that just adds to the charm.. Driver is the first driving game set completely in a 3D world, as far as I know. When I first saw (and later played) the demo, I was impressed so much and I knew I gotta have this game! It's amazing how they succeeded in making such a big 3D map for the original Playstation back in 1999, 2 years before GTA III did it on the PS2. This really changed the face of driving games for the future. The car handling is enjoyable and it's a hoot turning tight corners using the circle (burnout) button! Driving at high speeds through the city being chased by the cops, makes you feel like you are Steve McQueen in Bullitt (1968) The film director mode allows you to see your wildest chases again from different camera angles. The funky music is fantastic and sets the tone for a 70s police/bandit flick. The graphics are good for its time. A year later Driver 2 (2000) was released which didn't improve on Driver at all, except you can get out of your car. If you like more of this kind of driving games on the original Playstation, check out World's Scariest Police Chases (2001). Driver was at its time a very original and solid game. It hasn't aged so well over the years, but it's still a good game if you own an original Playstation. I rate Driver 9 out of 10.. This one's a real classic with a great feel and an engaging atmosphere, but it's held back by its steep difficulty level and very frustrating time limits.. The start of something amazing! A classic game with an amazing story, the driving physics and 3d open world graphics make it one of the best driving games ever.. At a time when GTA was still in 2d Driver provided an opportunity for gamers to take to the streets in 3d. It may not have been a true open world game but the thrill of chasing and being chased around a fully formed city in vehicles that, for the time at least, handled very realistically was fantastic. A horrendous difficulty spike in the last level meant that many would never complete it but it remains one of the best game available on the PSone.. Driver is a decent driving game which draws influences from classic 1960's and 70's car chase films and attempts to bring those movie car chase scenes and mimic them in this game. Reflections has done a good job with this concept with great looking 3D environments, a soundtrack that fits well in the game and sound effects that sound powerful. The games 3D environments that you can drive around in were somewhat of a new thing back then and still look great. Driver was a breakthrough in 3D driving games that even the mighty Grand Theft Auto series took this concept and the 3D view and built on it, and then Grand Theft Auto 3 was born, 2 years after this game. The environments are a little empty though and some of the cities roads are very strangely designed (I mean, Los Angeles has one of the longest straights I've ever seen!) The game play is simple: It involves you driving around in a car, around a big city, avoiding traffic and the cops, and either trying to get to a destination quickly or trying to get away from the cops as safely as possible in the single player campaign mode. The game play is quite limited and it does get quite repetitive after a while as you drive to this destination, then drive to another destination, avoid this, avoid that. The handling model feels responsive, polished and allows you to skid around corners and dodge traffic. The games main missions require a flamboyant driving style and good car control as you dodge traffic and avoid charging cop cars. The cut scenes that carry the story forward are nicely animated (seems that Driver games always have good cinematic cut scenes to advance its stories). As I said earlier, the sound effects are fantastic with some great sounding car crash noises and car engine sounds. The menu music is funky to listen to and is probably the best track in Driver's soundtrack. Chases with the police helps to liven things up and the police A.I is fair for most of the time and is able to dodge the traffic instead of mindlessly smashing into them unlike in Driver 2. Sometimes when the roar of the police engine and the sound of the police sirens is just behind you, you wonder if you're going to escape them or not. Along with the single player campaign, there are a few driving games to try out. My personal favourite is the Survival mode where you try to survive for as long as possible against a rampage of cop cars with supercharged V12 engines under their bonnets (well not literally, but they do seem to have a slight speed advantage) that try to damage your car. Now this game is good but there is one problem I have to address. Police car A.I is quite fair (unlike in Driv3r) most of the time but in one particular mission, they are far too aggressive; they slam in to your car consistently if you're not careful you could find yourself getting smashed around like a pinball in a pinball machine. This mission (I'm not telling you what mission it is) that I'm talking about is one of the hardest missions I've have ever come across in a Driver game because of the brutality of the A.I. It is a huge problem which may cause you to rip your hair out. Despite this ""Minor"" problem, Driver is a solid driving game and the fact that it was one of the first 3D driving games, it is one game that hugely influenced the 3D Grand Theft Auto games and the sandbox genre","the final level of the game is complete and total BS, but the game aside from that is top tier . the graphics (for the time) are very well done and the chases are pretty exciting . the cop spawns are way too frequent, making it nigh impossible to get through to the end in one piece ."
