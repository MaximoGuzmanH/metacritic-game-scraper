"1,052.Viewtiful Joe 2","Viewtiful Joe 2 improves on the originals formula of controlled viewtiful fighting, but it does little to actually improve the flaws the first had. Fights can still be very tedious if you don't know how to hit the enemy properly, and the puzzles are nearly as bad as the first with a lot guess work and wondering what exactly you do to solve this puzzle. Viewtiful Joe 2 had a lot of potential to be great, but it just ends up being a good affair.. This game doesn't shine like its predecessor, but it's still awesome! Everything about the first one is here but, while it may feel too similar, it's still fun, charming and challenging as ever. If you are a fan of the first one, you owe it to yourself to continue the adventure. But the game has its share of bad things. Sylvia, for example, is useless. The unlockables aren't as good as the in the first game. Repetition of bosses **** and there are TOO MANY annoying puzzles. Like I said, those things prevent it from shining like its predecessor, but if you're a fan of the first one, you'll definitely enjoy this one too.. Viewtiful Joe 2 is a 2D beat 'em up which combines side-scrolling and platforming. The player takes control of either of the characters Joe or Silvia to complete tasks within each stage, such as defeating enemies and bosses, and solving puzzles. Within Movieworld, Joe has ""VFX Powers"" such as Slow (similar to bullet-time), Mach Speed, and Zoom at his disposal to defeat the enemy. He is joined by girlfriend Silvia, who has also acquired VFX powers. However, Silvia has ""Replay"", which allows her to record and repeat an event three times in succession, instead of Joe's Mach Speed. The Replay power must be used wisely, as although it allow the player to do three times the amount of damage on an enemy, being hit while using it will incur three times the amount of damage to the player.[7] During the game, the player utilize a gameplay mechanic called ""Viewtiful Switch"" in order to swap between Joe and Silvia at any time. The two characters share both their amount of health and the VFX meter. Holding the switch button down for a certain amount of time enables the two player characters to use a special attack involving the transformable robot Six Machine. At intervals between stages, V-Points can be spent to purchase new moves for either Joe or Silvia, or to improve their existing powers, which includes making Joe's Mach Speed more effective or upgrading Silvia's Desperados. V-Points can additionally be spent to give the player more maximum health, add extra lives, or be used to buy power-ups such as the VFX Turbo Charger, which slows the drainage of the VFX Gauge. Aside from the main game, Viewtiful Joe 2 also contains an optional gameplay extra called the ""36 Chambers of Viewtiful"", a series of stages which test the player's skills. The objectives include defeating a set number of enemies or scoring a number of V-Points within a time limit, and dodging an onslaught of swords without dying.. f you have a gamecube, then there is no excuse not to own this game. This is by far one of the best game of that generation. Henshin A Go Go Baby! @ Capcom please bring a HD Port","viewtiful Joe 2 is a 2D beat 'em up which combines side-scrolling and platforming . the player takes control of either of the characters Joe or Silvia to complete tasks . the game has its share of bad things, such as the unlockables aren't as good as the in the first one ."
"1,053.Day of the Tentacle Remastered","This game is a treat for a completionist. It has clean drawings that make every situation easily understandable. The story itself is simply genius and the developers invite you to go through their minds while playing this game. As is usual for the genre, there are points where you can get lost trying to solve a puzzle for a frustrating amount of time. Other than that, I would say it is still a great experience and holds playability value today.. I play it with pixels. Not personally a fan of the new art style but clearly it is popular. Possibly the best 'point and click' game ever made. Hilarious, good and interesting puzzles, Time travel. All you could want. I've played it repeatedly over the years. Could not recommend more.. Day of the Tentacle is a graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts. The plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle—a sentient, disembodied tentacle—from taking over the world. The player takes control of the trio and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.. Great high quality visual, totally improve from DOS version, great sound, great remake game.. I generally dislike adventure games with illogical puzzles. Many people would consider one of the Monkey Island titles their favorite adventure game, whereas my favorite ones would be Sanitarium, Beneath a Steel Sky or the first Broken Sword. My preference generally falls outside Lucas Arts’ scope, but I nevertheless loved Day of the Tentacle. Similar to its prequel, Maniac Mansion, you control three different characters interchangeably. Your goal is to save the world from the evil purple tentacle! Day of the Tentacle is easily one of the most hilarious video games I have ever played and I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite not appreciating several puzzles. One word on the perfect remaster. Tim Schafer did an amazing work with this and enhanced the visuals without losing the game’s spirit. You can also press F1 anytime and enjoy DoTT with the good old graphics and audio. PS: You can access the original Maniac Mansion from within the game too. 8.5/10. I have exchanged this game on a few diskettes in rar format with some buddies on high school back in the day. It has a very dear place in my heart as it was the first Lucas Arts game I played, followed by many other adventure games bu the company. Seeing this title being Remasted is a dream come true! They have done such a great job and all the extra's that have been digitalized are a big addiont the the already cool content you get for a bargain of a price. There must be no one who doesn't like Lucas Arts game being Remastered, and I have read countless forums of people who ask for the Classic to be Remastered! I say bring it on and charge 30 dollar instead of 15 dollars, but for the sake of adventure genre, this needs to be done.. ""Golden classic the point-and-click quests"" in all its terrible glory! Sequel of the Maniac Mansion. Works fine in a window mode. Ubuntu 16.04.. If you fall in love at first glance with the art style or are American (story is about that), you may get more out of it. But it is still a solid adventure game, one of the classics. One of the best games EVER made. I have played the original at the time it came out and now just finished the remastered edition. The puzzles are as challenging and mindbending as ever but always logical (in a Monkey Island kind of way ;-), the remodeled graphics are amazingly beautiful and the new interface is super-intuitive. 10 out of 10. A TOTAL classic.. The remastered procedures just brings games of the past to the actual desktop resolution, plus, audio and video enhances are simply comparable to a slight facial lifting where the whole face can't be logically replaced. I'm the fortunate who enjoyed this game since the beginning, when independent reviews on the net wasn't an available option because the internet wasn't for everyone at all. Day of the Tentacle is probably one of the best Lucas Arts adventures ever made. The only one pity thing for all the fans like me is to don't see the majestic artworks of Steve Purcell here, that it should made more justice to the whole Maniac Mansion series due to the fact that he left Lucas after Sam&Max: Hit the Road then the art direction turned to Tim Shaffer (also great and valuable from this title until Grim Fandango). But despite that, we are talking about the history of point and click adventure here. As many said, at better price, it's worth for a replay ;). This is a masterpiece, i will go as far as saying the BEST point and click adventure ever made, Tim Schafer you are a genius. Thank you and your team for remastering the Greatest Point and Click Adventure.. Some games do not deserve remasters and this is a great example. Just, it doesn't work on consoles. The controls are horrid and gameplay is slow and boring.. A very funny and enjoyable adventure game by the king of the genre: Tim Schafer. This game originally came out way back in 1993 but has now been remastered and made accessible to gamers of this generation. This is a classic adventure game so some of the puzzles do require a lot of esoteric knowledge, I'll admit I did refer to a guide more than a few times but it isn't frustrating and remains mostly enjoyable. It's also one of the shorter adventure games out there, but I think that works to it's advantage, if it was any longer it would have been boring and would have felt padded out unnecessarily. The story of this game revolves around time travelling thus adding a time travel mechanic to the puzzles that's very smartly done. Certain actions performed in the past have repercussions in the future and it creates unique opportunities to solve certain puzzles using the element of time. Overall it's a fantastic adventure game that's very true to the genre and for any fans of adventure games this is a must play. No bugs, no technical difficulties, runs smooth and is even playable on older machines.. Its a great game, funny and enjoyable. A good remastering that leads to the old days, definitely one of the great videogames, together with maniac mansion.. This is probably one of the few ""Remasters"" that works out well. The mechanics are all true to form and the game gives highly flexible options for old vs new graphics as well as old vs new actions. Eg, you can have the new graphics with the old ""verb bar"", or the old graphics with the new verb dial, or the old with the old, or the new with the new). In that respect it's very well done similar to Grim Fandango where switching between them is completely seamless. Graphics are much sharper and in widescreen and are very much true to the original art style. Commentary and subtitles are all present. The game itself really is a 10 purely for the old fashioned wacky LucasArts humor. However this only gets a 9 as the price is a bit high considering the game was released in 1993 (and the much cheaper original is still more than playable via ScummVM). I'm always seriously wary of ""remakes"" as they usually either screw something up trying to modernize it too far, or are in it purely for a cheap franchise brand cash-in. DOTT along with Grim Fandango though, are surprisingly well done and very respectful to the original games and fans. Whether you've played the game before or not, it's definitely worth it.. Finished this game in 1994 I was 14 and I had a dream that George Washington's false teeth was chasing me... 22 years later finished the remastered game had the same dream... now you don't have this kind of experience with the Call of Duty's!. If you're already a fan of old adventure games, this is for you. Otherwise, pass. This game is a remarkably faithful update of the original, but the humor and gameplay doesn't hold up very well for a modern audience. If the game were very easy, it might be entertaining for tweens, but the outmoded stereotypes and obscure puzzles would not.. Threw my wallet at the screen immediately when I saw this. That didn't do anything, so I entered my Paypal information and that seemed to do the trick. The remastered visuals and music are lovely and totally faithful to the original, and when you hit F1 it changes the game back to its classic pixelated soundblaster goodness. It's exactly as I remember it when I was a Power Rangers loving prepubescent child, only now the sound doesn't skip like crazy and I didn't have to install floppy disks all day. The additional commentary is also enjoyable to listen to and gives a lot of incite on the development of this much-loved title. As for the game itself? It's a classic. It's what put Tim Schafer on the map, and one of the best point n' click adventure games ever made, right up there with Gabriel Knight, Fate of Atlantas, Monkey Island, Kings/Space/Police Quests, The Longest Journey, etc. It's brilliant, and this is the best version yet. I did, however, run into one bug where the music wasn't playing correctly during the final moments of the game. Hopefully they'll fix that because it kinda ruined the climax for me. Otherwise, it was problem-free.. Great! What a funny game: The craziness is on the same level as Zak McKracken for example but of of course it is more funny to see the game in better graphics. The new controlling is better in my view than the old verb boxes. The riddles are funny too. In addition you can even play Maniac Mansion in old graphic by using a computer ingame. Yes, play Maniac Mansion, it is another great and classic game. Is there any negative sides? Yes, I cant but the retail version, just digital. -> For few hours investment you get a lot of fun, so this game definitively is recommended to be played and in addition this game is so classic, every gamer should know it.. A very good remastering of the 90's adventure game. To point out, the way of interacting is also very good (you can manage the game with the gamepad quite easy) The 1st game (the original Maniac Mansion) is within the game.. I had a blast with this game, after decades since I finished it for the first time. The remaster is definitely not worth 15eur, it's really just hd graphics that's it. However it's worth to have it in your library so buy at reduced price.. The remaster may be somewhat lazy, but it still is one of the best games of all time. Anyone being used to current gen adventure games though, the puzzles might frustrate you, a lot, with their old-school non-sensical kind of sense.. A classic gets a new coat of pain and makes it even more glorious. The new interface and graphics make an already legend game even better. A game i will never ever get tired of playing again and again.. Well this game was always quite overrated... Back in the day it was already kinda meh, but 15€ for a game that was released on 1993? Just because of a poor lazy remaster? This is definetely not worth it, the puzzles are not intuitive at all, you know it's ok if the puzzles are hard, but they have to make sense, and they do not make sense in this game. Bad characters, lazy comedy... If you play this because you loved Monkey Island and you think this will be as good, JUST DON'T.. One of the greatest adventure games of all time. This the game I want to show to my children one day, they might not appreciate it like I did, but at least they will learn something about where they come from.. Without words. This game is awesome!!! Just buy and play!!! Be sure to wash your hands after playing. (c) Day of the Tentacle is one of those games that innovated the adventure genre. It’s funny that this game from 1993 has more ground-breaking measures than a lot of adventure games released in 2016. (c) Would recomend 10/10. STYLE ALL OVER THE PLACE. How is this game not a 10? It's simply one of the best adventure games ever made. It revolutionized the way we play games today. And it still holds up because of its lovable characters and wonderfully funny script. The love and care that's been put in this remaster it's up to the expectative. And that's a LOT to say coming from a true fan of the original game. Thank you Tim and everyone in double fine productions! Hope you get to do this with ALL the lucasarts 2D classics. But most of all I hope more new developers start making this kind of games that we all need in our lives, funny, witty, just ENTERTAINING!",day of the tentacle is a graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts . the plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends as they attempt to stop the evil purple tentacle from taking over the world . the player takes control of the trio and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history .
"1,054.Cyberpunk 2077","Decent game. Graphics have its highlights but especially the NPCs look and behave horrible. Gungame is just decent and the preset settings are just bad. Didn’t like the boss fights as they were just annoyingly long but not hard oder challenging…. SO to keep it short and sweet. Bought the game in March of 2021, such a hot mess, uninstall within two days. Blur/digital pixels ahead to Decemeber 2024. YES, YES, more please. This is the game I wanted, it's great, fun game play, fun dialogs, indepth characters and more. It still has it's issues, but its at bare minimal and it's more to my taste and wants versus overall game play. Graphics are beautiful. In a way, it followed V time line, game was close to dying, but it found its life line. Save the day. Definitely one of the best revival stories in gaming. What started out as a glitched mess has turned into probably one of the best FPS RPGs out today. They legit fixed almost every technical issue the game had, and added some good content to the game. Worth **** if you haven't gotten it et.. Good visuals/world everything else is meh. Endless boring cutscenes that you cannot skip with the most uninteresting dialogue. 30 minutes of cutscenes with 5-10 mins of gameplay is what the average mission is like. Gameplay is floaty, wonky, and that of a bad PS2 era game (melee build) doesn't feel satisfying. Music is hit or miss most tracks are instant skips not even tolerable. This is more of a RTX showcase than a game in all honesty.. A gorgeous game with a well-developed universe that really draws you in. Cyberpunk is not just a game about killing and going on missions, it is a game about the importance of choice, about building relationships with other characters and thereby creating your own history of not just becoming legend of Night City, and also developing V's story and his future, lifepath. It is an honor for me that I was able to allow myself to touch such a masterpiece from an equally wonderful studio with an amazing game director. ""Would you rather live in peace as Mr. Nobody, die ripe, old and smelling slightly of urine? Or go down for all times in a blaze of glory, smelling near like posies, without seeing your thirtieth?"". They really turned this game around from the bad launch. Props to cdpr. It has become a favorite of mine. 10 out of 10. This game is truly an Experience. I can't even use words how much I love that masterpiece. I may sound like a fanatic, but in my opinion literally everything is perfect about this game, story, mechanics, story telling, development, world building, every characters and building. This game has something inside that just makes me stay in Night City for long long hours. Every game I play I usually Abandon it after finishing main story or spending some time but in Cyberpunk 2077 I just want to stay there, I just want to play even for the 10th time and Experience this art once again.. Had to give 2077 a 6/10 due to it's lack of optimization - but the world and story is engaging. Worth a pirate, not a purchase. The bugs, glitches, and crashes made the game feel like a labor of greed rather than a labor of love. It's why I waited until 2025 to try the game as I heard how bad it was at launch. It is still a hot mess, but playable, just save often.. I created an account just to rate this incredible game, which has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. I came in with low expectations, but it has pleasantly surprised me in nearly every aspect. I absolutely love this game.. Horrible first year. I had pre ordered and decided to not get a refund no regrets. I just waited for it to be ready,. Cyberpunk turned out to be an amazing game, it just took time. Hopefully this is a lesson to all companies to not rush a product. Make sure it is ready. Cyberpunk is a top 15 game all time for me. It might be a top 10, somewhere in between. It's absolutely worth every dollar. There's a lot of great content, characters and stories. I hope they release another game!. The story is short and depressing, it didn't satisfy me at all. The gameplay gets boring after a while, and the feeling of impact is terrible. It built up so much expectation and failed to deliver on any of it. I played it in the beginning, and I let it go back then because it was full of bugs, but nothing has changed. The game is still trash, in my opinion. Its open world feels extremely lifeless, with just NPCs and cars that spawn for no reason.. I'M CHIPPING IN, Cyberpunk is the future of gaming, this is the ultimate game I have been looking for my entire life. The Night City, The Storyline, THIS GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. I recognize that the game has numerous bugs and issues, but it remains a fantastic experience due to its solid mechanics and compelling story. I genuinely enjoyed playing it, and it's impressive that a game set in 2077 can be so engaging! However, I do take issue with the jokes made about our creator, Jesus Christ.. Story, gameplay, graphics, atmosphere. Everything in this game is perfect, literally everything. This is a masterpiece!. Playing in 2025... Starting with the bad: Open world is small, since it seems like one can't really create an urban open world or modern open world that feels real, maybe don't try. Night city is tiny and there's no traffic jams. Glitches, hats don't work properly. Encountered one weird stretching glitch when a body was dismembered. They still need to proof read the text, I teach English to migrants and refugees and their writing is often more comprehensible than texts I have encountered in game. Guns, don't use them in your game if you don't know how they work. They put too much effort into making the guns gamey. Shoulda made the combat much more deadly instead of sending more bullet sponges at you. Guns, cyberwear, perks all involve too much incremental change and or differences between options. Vehicles handle ridiculously and defy physics. Makes me wonder if the devs even drive. You can't really defy or rage against the dystopia and even if you did there wouldn't be any consequences. I keep accidentally hurting civvies and the cops hardly care and when they do they quickly forget. The good Graphics Voice acting, characters, story and art. They really convey the horror of a multicultural degenerate anarchocapitalist hell with the gross ads and prostitution simulation. At the smaller scale the environments, individual building interiors, are well designed to allow for multiple play styles and feel more or less realistic besides too many indestructible windows. Conclusion. One of the best of its kind. This game is very good at taking you from your chair to night city. very immersive, very cinematic, sometimes kinda boring but overall its an unforgettable experience. Based on 2024 latest patch,my whole playtrough 95%free of bugs,the futuristic city is cramped with small little detail everywhere,especially most indoor area have a very detailed futuristic/complicated led lights/design(too ambitious no wonder game launch was disastrous)Smooth/fun Gunplay,most of the main story heist/mission was really good/epic,overall game structure feels like playing Gta/witcher3 with wide variety of moderately fun sidequest. Not as good as promised. The game was launched when it was not finished. The delelopers try since then to finish the game with patches but it still feels a little bit unfinished.. I am not your ""Bro"", especially when the first time i try to launch the game nothing happens, the second time it plays an advert for The Witcher 4, and the 3rd time it tries to get me to download AMD software. 4th attempt at finally getting in it calls me their own made up slang version of ""bro"" on a legal document. One of the worst most **** launches in the past 5 years, and doing nothing to redeem themselves.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever, I mainly loves the vibes. Besides that, characters and combat mechanics are 10/10 if not 9/10.. Best game ever, period. The graphics, actors, plot, it is just insane what this game is capable of.. Absolute masterpiece with one of the best plots in videogames. Even thought the launch was a pure mess, the developers fixed many annoying issues. Visually stunning with engaging gameplay, top notch music, and memorable characters. Cant wait for the release of Witcher 4.. ""A visually stunning RPG with deep lore, action-packed gameplay, and style!"". A perfect example of quantity over quality. The game is visually appealing, and tries to do so many different things. But the story telling and main character lines were so bad that its hard to find reasons to come back and play it. I played it with the path-tracing mode on PC and the developers deserve some serious recognition for what they accomplished! But this game took me over a year to finally finish. I found that I was desperately trying to skip every bit of dialog just to get back out and explore the world. But then the world didn't have very much charisma or charm, and was generally buggy. I would hit a barricade while driving (vehicle handling is aweful) and if I was within 10 feet of a police officer, they would freak out and attack me with full force. The experience of driving around the city ended up becoming annoying and frustrating. If you have a path-tracing capable PC, I would recommend picking it up on a sale and playing it to experience what truly incredible lighting looks like. But I don't recommend this game in any other form.. One of the most boring games ever created. They put so much effort into the hype, and keep upgrading graphics, but in a nutshell, the game has extremely weak and outdated mechanics, even Fallout 3 still feels fresher than that. It's like a regular polish shooter with cheap cyberpunk skins and designs made by some scholars, despite all their hard work on improving Ray Tracing stuff, etc. I waited for it for years and pre-bought it, and simply couldn't believe how bad everything was when launched it first and tried to have fun for 10-15 hours, then gave it another try one year later and the game was still bad af but with better graphics. Feels like a complete scam.. the first time i played a game and i did not want it to end. the only thing not s tier about this title is the open world immersion and the gameplay systems could be more, but what gameplay systems are there are amazing. Combat story and art direction are s tier.. Even after a large number of updates, the game is full of bugs.Boring mechanics, nothing special and new.. too many dialoges excpect only 15% gameplay the main story and side stories are very good you need to give it a big time to understand johny silverhand is the best charchter in the entire gaming history the graphics is the 9/10 most of the times the world is amazing at night but not big enough soundtraack is average very few activites other than missions custmization is worthless since its first person. Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunningly beautiful, funny, and over all entertaining game. If you enjoy having the freedom to do whatever you want like me spending the first 3 hours playing the game just exploring the map, and doing side missions for no reason whatsoever then this will be your **** course a game of this magnitude does not come without its technical difficulties, however even with a mid-tier system like my own I have been able to enjoy the game in its entirety. I can say that I am very happy with how vigilant the developer has been with communicating that they want to perfect the product as much as they can.I was not a hype beast for cyberpunk, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt its lived up to all the hype I’ve seen about it, and I can’t wait to see what the developers do with the game going forward. So let me stop reviewing so I can actually beat this game at some point.. 10/10 Story - 9/10 Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 10/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Character design - 10/10 Levels/map design - 9/10 Sound Effects - 10/10 Soundtrack - Overall: 9,60/10. A jack of all trades, master of none, leads to a shallow experience that's still oftentimes fun. Almost half a decade after its release, Cyberpunk 2077 is a fully playable, mostly glitch-free, and enjoyable experience that does everything well yet stands out in no particular category except graphics. Its open world, dialogue, RPG elements, progression system, characters, stealth mechanics, combat, gunplay, hacking, movement / parkour, loot drops, car handling, and basically anything you can think feel fine on the surface and are incredibly fun to engage with, yet the second you put many of these systems to even a remotely below-the-surface stress test or compare them to many other games, they quickly show to be pretty shallow. The characters are written incredibly well, yet with how little time I actually spent with many of them, I never really got fully attached to any of them, nor did I ever feel like I ever got to really know them. While it is great to see systems like the cops spawning and despawning 5 meters away from you not be in the game anymore, there are still times where they literally saw me through a wall and on one occasion through an entire house, because apparently they have eagle eye or something. The many hours you will spend in dialogue are mostly written well, yet with how many times the game gives you two options that literally say the exact same thing, I wonder why the game gave me any choices at all. One of the first options when you talk to Dexter Deshawn is literally you saying either, ""Yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory"" or ""If you die a nobody, nobody will remember you, so yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory"" or dodging the question entirely. Why are they in the game? They just slow down the pacing of an otherwise interesting conversation. The combat with both regular enemies and jacked-up ""Cyberpsychos"" is great fun, and the game gives you a pretty decent amount of fun and powerful options to deal with them. Yet in regular CDPR fashion, many of these can be boiled down to mind-numbingly boring tactics once you know how the game works. Oh, and expect enemies to uppercut the air 5 feet away from where you're standing and for you to still take damage. The stealth is actually handled pretty decently for their first attempt at it, yet you can't pickpocket enemies, you can't just hit one button and kill them with your melee weapon, nor can you shoot a silenced pistol at a camera without the entire building now somehow knowing you're somewhere close to them, or hide an unconscious enemy into a dumpster without killing them for some reason. Enemies in most side quests will be completely neutral towards you, giving you plenty of options to plan your approach. Yet open a door you shouldn't, step half a foot into a restricted area (oftentimes without you even knowing, because none of the enemies ever tell you to back off or to not go through a door, since you can't actually talk to most of them), and within a millisecond every enemy in a mile-wide radius will turn hostile and instantly try to gun you down. Save a girl from getting beaten up by someone; she doesn't say anything, just crouches on the floor with her hands above her head and stays there till the end of **** can buy dozens of different vehicles, yet you can't customise them at all except changing the color on a few. The movement in the game feels really fluent, yet the city isn't really designed in a way where you can use your parkour skills to your advantage. The skill tree is diverse and leads to very different-feeling playthroughs, yet in dialogue it is only used for V to be able to say additional lines of dialogue, without them ever changing how a quest plays out. Trust me, I could just go on and on. But in short; Cyberpunk 2077 is a very fun game whenever the developers decide to just let you loose and give you quests that allow for player creativity. For my personal taste, it is easily the most fun game they have ever made, once you take the game for what it is. Just don't go in expecting to be blown away. 6/10, 7/10 on a good day. Amazing game! Must have, you wont regret it. Gameplay, music, story, sound, graphics: 10/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No game has ever conflicted me like this game... It is an interesting experience for sure, but it could have been so much more. The game lacks so many things that make a good rpg, but also lacks so many things that make a good linear game. It is really an anomaly. In the end, the world is not well developped and the story is very bad. The gameplay is mixed aswell. It is mindless fun, but to the point where you really have to be mindless. They bring up very interesting topics, without giving the depth required for it to be nuanced. The wirld ends up just being a disgusting sex joke and gangbanging nonsense with a twist of underdevelloped sci-fi. Honestly a bad take on each genre and I am really disappointed!. Best open world city ever. And it's not a GTA city that's just a small version of the real life one, it's an entirely fictional futuristic city with the best lore and characters and NPCs. You just need to forget about your ""futuristic GTA"" assumption to understand how great this game is.. The developers put all of their heart and soul to make this a game where you feel for other people – where you develop warm connections and see human nature in all of its forms, for better and for worse. And even in the game’s shortcomings – you see the trials that the people behind the game had to go through in making it an actual product. It is the single most Human game I’ve ever played and it may be the most sobering piece of art I’ve ever played in my life.. One of the best story game i got hooked on every character in thus game, the lore and the npc is the carrying part i cant lie, the transportation system, the car that we get to drive, the versatility of builds that we could use, this just straight heaven for those who looking to spend an amount of time **** !. Damn, this game was so addictive. It is probably not my favourite game I have played in the last couple of years because, but it is packed with so many things you can do. I found myself wanting to enter this world way too often than I should. ^^ So yeah, this had a big impact on my recent life too.. ""Cyberpunk 2077 on PC – A Story of Redemption"" When Cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it felt like a massive disappointment. The glitches and performance issues were impossible to ignore, and I’ll admit, I wasn’t sure if CD Projekt Red could recover. But now, playing the updated version on PC, it’s clear that they’ve done the impossible—they’ve turned a rocky launch into one of the most polished gaming experiences out there. The way the developers handled the updates and bug fixes deserves praise. It wasn’t just about patching things up; they went above and beyond, addressing player feedback and improving nearly every aspect of the game. Night City feels alive, the performance is buttery smooth, and every corner of the world has a level of detail that’s honestly breathtaking. With each update, they’ve added content that not only enhances the story but makes exploration and gameplay even more rewarding. Cyberpunk 2077 is now what it was meant to be—a masterpiece that combines incredible storytelling, an immersive open world, and gameplay that hooks you from start to finish. The dedication of CD Projekt Red to overcome the odds and deliver on their promises is something we don’t see often in this industry. If you were hesitant before, now’s the time to dive in.. This is a masterpiece. Aside from still some minor bugs this was a blast to play. I don't always finish single player games but this one hits the spot. The world building, characters, story and gameplay are phenomenal.. Really good storyline and decision making. Action feels amazing. Stealth too. Decent customization. Radio variety is cool. Vehicle variety is nice. The game has several nice views. Riding vehicles feels good in both first and third person. What makes me subtract from 10? -I can't get in-between all the floors of the first megabuilding where V lives, which is gigantic, and you can see people standing in those floors too. -All enemies scale with your progress. -Trauma Team is just a plot device, they don't appear in random encounters, you can't interact with them in any way, nothing. -You really have to try hard to get all pursuit stars, only to hide yourself for a bit and lose them all at the same time.. It has officially become my favorite game; it's incredible. The story, the graphics, the setting, the DLC, and everything else—I could play it for years without ever getting bored! It's amazing. 10/10.. Cyberpunk has completely remade and fixed everything. I wish bioware would listen to cd project red. Can't wait for the witcher.. So as i've played version 2.13 i can say that the game is now playable. Of course from time to time you will find minor issues but it won't affect your gameplay. However technical issues might be fixed there's still other problems. I was amazed by this game at first yet after 40 hours i was struggling. It gets boring and repetitive. Story is keeping, it's the gameplay... more of doing the same thing over and over. Because of bugs it could never recive 10, because of repetitivnes it can't be 9. Anyway i'll give it 8 cause it's still very good game with incredible story.. I started playing Cyberpunk 2077 in 2024 on the PS5, and fortunately, all the significant bugs have been fixed. The game is fantastic and incredibly immersive; I truly feel like I’m living in Night City. It’s a masterpiece, and I want to play it forever.. Its a pretty good game with damn fun combat and cool aesthetics. The story was interesting and engaging though the male romance companions were very very underdeveloped. Loved Johnny though. It had potential to be great but alas fell short.. Even at launch, despite the frustrations, I’d rate this game an 8/10. Now, with the major issues resolved and the game finally delivering the intended experience, I consider it a masterpiece by CD Projekt Red. This world and its story are sure to be remembered even a decade from now. In my opinion, this is truly an outstanding next-gen title.. Even on release and how frustrating it was, it was to me an 8/10. Now after all the mistakes were fixed and the game feels proper now.. sometimes. I think its a masterpiece created by cdprojectred. This world and story will be looked back on a decade from now. it helps that Edgerunners anime is also such good cyberpunk lore and amazing writing added on to that. Its just an amazing next gen title imo.. This is one of the best games I've ever played and I've played a lot of games. The world is just so incredibly immersive. The combat is fun and you feel like your a part of Night City. Incredible work CDPR. good graphics, great voice acting, very interesting world, cool missions, but the game is BORING! I'm 9 hours in, just started act 2, and I have literally been in TWO action sequences. The rest is just talking heads and getting from point A to point B. Those 5 really awesome skill trees? Don't bother with them, because combat is about 15% of the game. Really hope that it picks up soon.... CDPR has some of the best script writers in gaming. This game is full of personal interactions and stories with amazing motion capture and realism. The attention to detail like future slang words and costumes. Every character has a story. This game could easily be more linear and work, as once you get into the game. It's actually about the smaller moments. The beautiful detailed open world becomes window dressing.. This game **** and its cost a lot its not worth John wick getting your brain its kinda a s#x sim. Played on PS5 2 years after its release, it wasn'tthe 2.0 version yet (arrived 1 year after) and the experience was clearly the worst I had in the last 20 years. Nothing worked, from incoherent conception of the city to the npc's AI during missions. I had a lot of really ""breaking the game"" bugs, a fair amount of softlocks and a ton of minor bugs. The city was emptywith no life, the driving system was a mess, ennemies could shot through walls... To me, no matter how much they worked on the game afterwards, they should never have released it in that condition, thus is not respectful towards the players.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. They announced content and features that were never in the game... But it's still 10/10 for so much reasons. Thank you CD Projekt.. I liked the story. Gameplay was decent. Voice Acting is excellent. Basicallyl and open world, First Person Shooter in the same vein as Grand Theft Auto's Vice City and newer. With a touch of Deus Ex, **** that makes any sense. Game had a rough release, but it's been patched and fixed. **** got in game engine nudity censored, after it's second patch, too.. Cyberpunk 2077 has taught all of us a good lesson - never pre-order any games, PERIOD. No matter how amazing the company has been previously, any company is capable of messing up its release. Cyberpunk 2077 may have been patched and improved significantly post release, but this will never excuse the awful decision to release it in a broken state. For context, police chases weren't even a thing in Cyberpunk 2077.. one of the best games that has been ever made, it has a rocky start, but CDPR has shown their dedication and fixed it, also they added alot of things and made it a master piece, i have even created mods for this game.. The combat and side missions can become extremely repetitive but the well-written story, extensive character creator and pulsating soundtrack more than make up for a few small gripes I have with the game, overall. If you have even the slightest infatuation with cyberpunk style and enjoyed the movie Blade Runner, then this game will be right up your alley and well worth the money spent.. After a rough launch this game was developed into a masterpiece that is a lot of fun to play and well written. Finaly got the game on PC, and its still amazing. i have mods, and the game just got even better,cyberpunk has gottenway better than from the start. Afterthought update and all the fixes, Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game with amazing graphics and good storytelling.. The immersion is crazy, the gameplay is very fun, the music is beautiful, the quests are incredible, the characters very well written.. The amount of content in the game is huge, it took me 100 hours to finish it. I know some people are upset about how the game used to be broken but personally I was lucky enough to discover this game in an almost perfect state because I am only playing it now in 2024, for me this game is clearly one of the best of all time, and it is one of my favorites.. Cyberpunk 2077 in 2024 is masterpiece. Phenomenal story, amazing characters, Night city is vibrant and full of activities.. I cant kill any children. They have I-frames and they disappear whenever I enter a car.. Most music is great. The gunplay is fun. The voice acting varies from very good to great. The cutscenes are great. The visuals are great. The quickhacking mechanic is fun. The story is captivating. There are many places to explore. The side quests are quite interesting. And the replayability is high because there are a lot of abilities you can use. There are bugs, but they couldn't break my enjoyment of this game. I played 100+ hours before the 2.0 update, beating the game.. The gameplay overall is pretty good. There are still some bugs, but nothing game-breaking for me. The problem is that Night City feels quite superficial and I find the story lacking, especially the endings. I've played through it 2 times, both times the endings were very unsatisfactory and didn't really fit the gameplay (power-fantasy) and story I was going through. Your ""decisions"" don't really have any impact. So I checked online and apparently all endings are bad endings. Now, I don't mind a bad ending (RDR 2 did it so well... but overall it works better in movies imo), but in an interactive game like Cyberpunk you should have a certain impact on where you want to go with the story. All the effort and time you put into the game doesn't get rewarded in the end if you wanted, because the writers wanted to be edgy with the thought ""iN nIgHt CitY tHEre ArE No GOoD EnDiNgs"". So yeah, play it for the gameplay. Don't expect much storywise, specially the endings. EDIT: oh yeah, the driving physics are absolutely horrendous..... Cyberpunk 2077 is in my opinion the best game ever made. No, it is not of the best quality, that title belongs to Red Dead Redemption 2, but that does not mean that Cyberpunk 2077 is of low quality. Cyberpunk 2077 is a combination of several things that appeal to me the most. It is set in the city of Mertopol, it is a heavy action game, it has a realistic story, it has lovable characters, it has great freedom of play and game mechanics, and of course it has main and side quests that support them. I am not talking about the 2020 version of Cyberpunk 2077. Because I played this game at the beginning of 2024. I know how wrong Cyberpunk is in 2020, but that does not concern me, I did not come across these because I played it 3 years later. It was much better this way because I experienced such a masterpiece in its polished form, not in its bad form. The scenario of Cyberpunk 2077 could have been great in my opinion, if it had not ended the story in a few main quests. If the plot ends too quickly, that's one of the biggest problems for me, but that's all, the scenario concept characters, especially Johnny's concept universe, all had great potential, but unfortunately it was a bit wasted. The only flaw for me in terms of gameplay is that sometimes you get a very nice reaction when you hit, sometimes you don't. Unfortunately, it's unbalanced, but as I said, other than that, you can develop and use your character as you want, and the mechanics are nice, both diverse and satisfying, limb amputations, etc. are a bit unbalanced but very nice. The game also stands out in level and mission design, there is a level design suitable for every approach style. My only problem with this is that there are not enough action sequences. I wish there were more like the part where Jackie died in the prologue section where we missed Hanako Arasaka, but unfortunately there isn't, but despite this, the level designs are great, you can indirectly or semi-directly affect the side quests with your choices, it's great. Although the NPCs in the open world are stupid, the atmosphere of the open world is there, I'm done with this, I'm finishing Night City. Just walking around is fun, there are activities you can do, many short side quests that bring the city to life, etc. are very nice. The character side quests are already great, each character is enjoyable in their own way. The visuals have the best visuals I've seen, but the problem is that unfortunately we can't see this beautiful open world and visuals from the 3rd person, it's a pity that I don't like the fbs camera, but despite this, Cyberpunk 2077 drew me in. In terms of performance, almost everything was fixed in the patch that came out with the Phantom Liberty DLC. I didn't encounter too many glitches. There is no other game that I've been as immersed in as Cyberpunk 2077.. Playing the game at it's finished state now, it really is one of the very best games I've ever played, story, music, visuals(both from a graphics and art direction perspective), everything is top notch. You can clearly see those are the same guys that made the Witcher 3. Don't be discouraged by its rough start, at this point this game is a must play for anyone who enjoys action and rpgs, great extensive experiences and expansive worlds to explore.. [SPOILER ALERT: Thi","a beautiful game with a well-developed universe that really draws you in . gameplay is floaty, wonky, and that of a bad PS2 era game (melee build) it's a masterpiece from an equally wonderful studio with an amazing game director ."
"1,055.Xenoblade Chronicles","First time I played this game was in summer of 2015 on my New 3DS XL. I can say that this is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. For about a month I was completely absorbed by this game, its world and characters. It was made with lots of love and thought. The music is phenomenal as well. Even on the small 3DS screen the whole adventure and story unfolds very well. Today the Switch Version is the best way to experience this game though.. Overall great game and incredibly special to get something like this on a hand held platform. I think I would have given this game a 9, but I never beat it. At some point I was ok with putting it down and never returning. (I got very close to the end) Hence giving this an 8. Definitely a must play for the device.. This game is definitely in my top 3 of every game I have played. I believe this game is perfect from insanely detailed and diverse open areas to explore to a cast of great characters and a perfectly crafted story that keeps you engaged the entire way through. Another very impressive piece of this game is the voice acting. Adam Howden delivers a fantastic performance as Shulk and the rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. The combat system feels unique and rewarding with many aspects that I have never seen in a game before. And the soundtrack is perfection from the calming and beautiful music while exploring to the triumphant epic music that plays during the fights and story cutscenes. The world building is arguably the best part of the game with the two giant titans you scale throughout the game. This game delivers in all aspects and in my opinion is easily better than the sequels that I also think are great. 10/10 Masterpiece.. Xenoblade Chronicles on the 3DS is an absolute masterpiece that delivers an unforgettable experience. As a long-time fan of the original Wii version, I was skeptical about how the game would translate to a handheld console, but I am thrilled to say that it exceeds all expectations.. I still don't know how they can fit this massive game into the 3DS but here we are. Phenomenal game that everyone needs to experience.. Literally my favorite JRPG of all time. I never played the Wii version, so I'm basing this review on the 3DS version. I absolutely loved the story, the soundtrack, the visuals & cutscenes, the gameplay, the voice acting and the equipment/crafting system. There was one boss where the framerate was so bad that it was basically unplayable, but other than that, the entire game ran smoothly. The c-stick on the New 2DS/3DS can freely control the camera in all directions. Can't recommend it enough, and I'm currently working on Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Switch!. Some amazing unique fantasy landscapes that big fantasy fans will not want to miss. Fun auto based combat. Cool enemies that sadly repeat in new areas alot. Some bosses you need to grind for, with the last boss being one you will most likely need to turn ""casual mode"" on for, even if you have a solid team that has gotten you easily though the whole game up the that point [and no they do not let you teleport away to grind for that one]. Half the writing is good, half is extraordinarily cheesy bad anime/ 80's kids cartoon level writing. Lots of plot twists. 8 overall.. The actual gameplay is meh. The real time, hybrid MMO hotbar combat is unexciting and boring. You're very dependent on AI party members to do combos or to heal but half the time they're stupid and not using the abilities they should be using at the right time. There are lots of sidequests but they're mediocre ""fetch X"" quests with no real interesting stories. The game's main claim to fame is its cutscenes. They're very well directed, and help carry an incredibly stereotypical and rather meh JRPG plot by distracting the player with the sheer spectacle of it all. About half of the main cast is likeable, while the other half are deadweight duds. The direction of the English voice acting is very good, though. The setting is interesting on paper (what if the world was giants?), but in game you don't really get to see that. You mostly see your typical fantasy RPG environments. That said, the art direction is good enough to make them visually nice to look at. Music is a mixed bag. There are some really great tracks, a lot of duds, and then a lot of really bad music that makes you want to mute the game or turn down the volume. Also, during battle, there is a cacophony of voicelines going off. You get used to it but that doesn't make it any less unenjoyable to listen to.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D released in 2015 as something of a pilot for Nintendo's New 3DS and Amiibo lines, both of which never fully lived up to their potential. And while there certainly is something to be said about giving an overlooked Wii game a second chance in full stereoscopic 3D, the visual shortcuts and downgrades of the New 3DS port often beg the question of whether it was worth attempting in the first place. If the 3DS line is your favorite (or only) series of systems, this is still a decent way to experience one of the best RPGs of the Wii era. Otherwise, the remaster available on Nintendo Switch now makes this version largely obsolete.. Can't believe the 3DS version is so well received... This is an awful version. Do NOT buy it. Game is great, but the 3DS version looks like complete trash. I'm not even picky about graphics, but this is a blurry mess. Avoid at all costs. Waste of money. Get the Switch.. This is the best video game ever made, only behind the recently released Xenoblade Chronicles definitive edition for the switch. the cast, world, music, combat, and story are phenomenal. A must play, limited only by graphics. this doesn't matter to me considering everything else. This version is portable, and has the collection mode and a 3D effect. I recommend playing it alone, uninterrupted, with headphones on to experience it best.. To be fair, it isnt a bad game, its just terrible at nearly everything it tries to do. Lets start with a summary: Anime cliche, action rpg, english voices, 3d, vast overworld, unique navigation premise, solid battle foundation, high difficulty. And then the problems begin in expanding upon all that. Anime cliche - nothing surprising, the plot points are all common sense goodness. The reason you cant do this, is because of that. The reason your godblade doesnt do this, is because they are doing that. You can see the future, because this thing creates that, and if you've played it, you know the story tells an interesting tale, but still usual anime style. Which is, to say.. entertaining. Creative in ways. But standard. Story gets a pass, because 'consistent and yet nothing special' isnt good or bad. Satisfying. :) Action RPG ~ thats what the kids are playing, these days. They cant be bothered to go buy god of war and button mash if it doesnt have RPG elements. Superficial rpg elements. You'll never be pushed too hard to deepthink anything in this game. Equipment? Just map the whole area youre in, stay 2 levels above the bad guys and you'll be fine. Gems? Meh. Equipment? Just max out your defensive stats. Which special godblade power should you use in any situation? They'll show you the mechanic to be learned right before you need it. The game is on rails. Even the FF7 remake is a button masher. English voices ~ no, I mean english accented. Not just english. har! Pleasing to hear, excepting the endless battle chatter repetition. (And no option to turn off post-battle yapping, you'll get tired of that within the first 5 hours) 3d - not bad, good view distance. Great for what it is, but with hindsight at 20/20.. almost no other games impress to this extent on n3ds. Beautiful world, very scenic. Its just.. its just that it isnt very compelling. After filling out the whole map, exploring all the little hiddenish areas.. it plays like an offline MMO. You'll have some roaming mobs at your level, some overlord level 70ish types, some flyers, some whatevers.. at least the towns are populated reasonably well. And the conversations flow logically and smoothly. Consistent, not good or bad. Unique navigation. You are on one of two guys, making your way up and over to find the other guys, just to find that they arent all bad, but are they they? But it is. But its about the over-guys, and then it isnt about them. And its about the godblade. But then it isnt. But it is, again. And then you hit new game +. Thats a no-spoilers summary. And it weaves a kinda good tale, if a little underwhelming. Except when it isnt, but the pacing is so.. consistent. But not. Like, it really doesnt rush you to the next objective. You know where its at, and it doesnt 'push' you to get there any faster than you want to get there. And you shouldnt want to get there. Because you havent grinded until you are 5 levels higher than everybody else. Its really important that you grind. In most JRPGs you can just barely slide by if you just kill everything on your way. Xeno is that odd one out that isnt JUST about grinding for the sake of it, its about being very consistent ~ you will absolutely die if you even tiptoe to the next area without grinding up. Like dark souls levels of 'you arent ready so die'. Whch isnt to say that it is hard, it really isnt. So long as you grind. It isnt like etrian odyssey where even if you grind to death, you still have to micromanage every single round of every battle, on every stage, with EVERY character type having to fit within the 5 you chose. THAT.. is hard. Xeno is just boring. Consistently. Battle foundation.. what can I say about this? Think of it like disgaea. You get some cool skills. Then you get more. Then more. Before you know it there is all this crap you can pick to use! Except by 'can use' I mean 'must use'. Which doesnt make the battle system complex, just complicated. Complex is final fantasy tactics telling you that your attack should do 18 damage, but due to the day, the month, the gender of you two combatants, the faith in your religion, the braveness in your soul, the class you chose, the direction you attacked, PLUS the RNG random number generator... AHEM, yeah. As where xeno is just.. complicated. You got autoattack, except its useless. You got knife up, knife sideways, knife down, and one works if youre on the side, one from behind, one for hitting multiple enemies, so on and so forth. And its nice and all to have these special attacks, but they arent special. They are mandatory. And you have to eventually start using them in conjunction with everyone else, to beat the special enemies. And the more special enemies. And you cant do much damage to those guys, because.. well, they ate something funny. Add those consistencies, the deaths, the absolute tedium of EVERY single battle requiring your attention, and it ****. Badly paced, cuz youre the pace. Slow down!. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a high-quality port of one of the Wii's most demanding yet brilliant experiences. A sizeable and stunningly diverse world, full of wildlife and fantastical cultures, is admirably recreated for the small screens of the New Nintendo 3DS. Its natural home may be on the TV, but this release gives more gamers an opportunity to set off on a lengthy and dramatic adventure. A brilliant portable version of a true classic, fans of RPGs willing to commit themselves to the task of saving Bionis shouldn't hesitate to pick this up - it is, quite simply, the biggest world we've experienced on such small screens.. Cast: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Fun: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 MUST PLAY ---------------------- ~75 Hours Played. I have at last finished XC3D and am left with that melancholy lull that only comes from finishing a truly special game. I loved the long hours I spent with XC3D and now consider it to be one of my favorite games of all time. I never owned a Nintendo Wii, so I regrettably missed out on the original all these years. Even after being down-ported graphically, XC3D ages wonderfully in most respects. What I loved: -Story, characters, and writing: most characters feel fully fleshed out, emotional and deep; dialogue is well-written with nice British voice-acting; the story is one epic roller-coaster ride with a very unique world setting, which struck a nice balance between being focused and easy to follow while also incorporating lore and overarching conflicts -Battle system: the battles were incredibly fun for me. I loved trying out different party formations and playing as each character to change things up. Some of the fights are super epic. Difficulty felt perfectly balanced, generally challenging but never frustrating. -Music: I can’t really put into words how great the OST is for this game. I would rank it as good as Nier Automata. -Art Style: Graphics are not great, but the art style makes up for this quite well. My Only Gripes: -Side quests: the side quests are tedious and uninspired. I generally only completed a few here and there. There are so many, yet most of them are meaningless fetch quests or monster hunts. -3D: the 3D on this version is there, but it is very subtle. It adds a bit of nice depth, but I felt like it could have been much better implemented. -Additional features: the 3DS version has unlockable character models and songs, but that doesn’t really add anything. I wish actual new gameplay elements, areas, or optional bosses were added to make this version more special.. After finishing this game, it became one of my favorite of all time. This game consumed over 132 hours of my life out of pure enjoyment, and I still have not 100%'d it yet. It has been a long time, since I think I have played such a perfect game. Every member of the party was perfect and had such amazing character development, the story was engrossing and compelling from beginning to end, the extra content was so fantastic I refused to progress to the next area without doing EVERYTHING possible at the time, and the music gameplay and scenery completed the masterpiece and made this game perfect in every respect. I wouldn't change a single thing about it, and I fully intend to get a 100% file. Truly this game is a mark of perfection.. Very unbalanced enemies. The combat is full of blablabla which Japanese people use to love, but it's annoying. The combat system doesn't help, it's long and boring. Graphics look worse than a Nintendo DS game.. I saw this game played by a youtube and I instantly knew I had to at least try it for myself, being a huge fan of JRPGs and all. I knew it was very different with the combat system but I was excited to learn the ins-and-outs of it all. As I progressed through the game I found many neat strategies for defeating enemies and winning fights. I ended up grinding to max level, completing every quest, and beating every super boss, and this was the first game I enjoyed doing this. The way it handles the superboss fights with unlocking them after certain points and having each drop gear that helps fight the next one. The final super boss was an insane challenge but so satisfying to complete the fight. Throughout the story, I was constantly guessing what would happen next and I was always surprised to see something new play with the theme of the game and using what I knew to surprise me. The characters and character swapping system was great and allowed really neat combat systems that I personally loved. I would max affinity between everyone so early because I would be constantly wanting to fight. The whole story is beautiful, it takes you through an amazing set of scenery and it really makes you think. it addresses themes of religion but none specifically, it really is an amazing game and I say you must play it.. I'm still confounded by the amount of hype this game got. The combat is a terrible combination of the worst that every F2P Korean MMO has to offer and the story and characters are bland and predictable. This game is a prime example of why you should never go quantity over quality. - There's hundreds of sidequests, BUT they're all the same kill x monsters, collect y items, ad infinitum. - The world is massive, BUT there's little to no reason to explore any of it. That cranny over there? Has the same items and monsters as everywhere else. - The game is long. You'll put in about 80 hours or so to finish the story, BUT it's all due to the horrible pacing and the game's forced marches across it's broad landscapes. It stretches itself incredibly thin in order to claim that long play time. The game really doesn't have any right to be longer than 30 hours with what's in it. Your time is better suited to playing anything else, really.. Good port to an already classic game. A good way to new players who didn't get the chance to experience its greatness on the wii. Unfortunately it's exclusive to the ""new 3ds"" models but it's understandable knowing the scope of such port. Nintendo players must be REA-A-A-ALLY hungry for rpgs if they think that this game deserve 10. Well, we all love rpgs for deep story lines, possibilities to make of playable character whatever we want and exploration. Let's start with story. It is there, it exists?.. Feels like the story line was written as a placeholder, because game needs a story and no one cares if it's intersting or not. But, that's the trouble of most nintendo games. Levelling. Yeap, you can level your party here. And nope, there's not many routes to do it. Exploration. It's nice. The world in which the game takes place is intersting an big enough to spend some time exploring it. Also, i'd like to write about battle system. It's great advanatge is in lack of random encounters, so player can pick any enemy he wants to fight and engage it. Another intersting point - positioning. Some attacks cause special effects if used from side or from behind. That makes battles more dynamic. In conclusion, the game is fine. It's not very good, it's not bad. It's just fine.. I spent over 100 hours on the Wii Version of Xenoblad Chronicles, so when I picked up the 3DS version i thought that it was going to be a downgrade. Visually, yes it was, but the immersion I felt in the game world and with the characters was even better. I could explore the Bionis on the go and bring a staggeringly huge world with me in my pocket. Fluid gameplay, great voice acting, beautiful scenery, interesting story. Totally worth a **** if you have some time.. This is a great game, on the wii, however they had to dumb down the graphics even further to run it on a system with ""updated hardware"". Now it looks like a playstation one game. The wii graphics were already terrible and this really makes the game unplayable. Add an extra small screen in the mix and the thing is just a mess. Bought this as soon as it came out, returned it the next day.. Bad gameplay, bad story, bad character, bad world setting, this is one of the worst games I played in my life, going to sell it cuz its such a waste of time and money. Probably the best RPG on the system. I've been playing it for over 30 hours so far & have barely scratched the surface. If you have a New 3DS you should treat yourself to this game.. SHORT VERSION: This game is amazing! Every RPG fan should give it a try. I never played the Wii version (why spend $65 on it when I can spend $40... plus an extra $200 for a New 3DS). I have two younger brothers that use the Wii U a lot for multiplayer games giving me little time to play a long RPG, and since I really wanted to play, I saved up the money to buy a New 3DS. Much like everyone else, I first found out about it through Shulk's inclusion in Super Smash Bros. GAMEPLAY: This is my first RPG that isn't turn based. The real time combat is really fun and not that hard to get used to. Shulk's foresight ability allows him to look in to the future and see if an ally is about to get severely wounded allowing you enough time to plan a counter attack. When the party gauge is full, you can perform a chain attack to severely damage your opponents. You can't have a review without mentioning the large and breath taking overworld. It's huge and magnificently gorgeous at times. It can take anyone hours to explore. STORY: I tried to go in to this game knowing as little as possible. I won't say any detail about the plot other then it's absolutely fantastic with lovable characters. It's serious, funny, sad, and very complex with it's themes. FINAL THOUGHTS: This is an amazing game that I recommend to anyone that hasn't played yet. If you already own the Wii version, I've heard from others on the internet that it's basically the same game without any major chamges.. One of the most overrated and overhyped games of the last generation, now on the New 3DS! This is final fantasy wannabe with mediocre story and bland, boring gameplay. I can understand how this scored highly on the Wii, after all Wii had no good RPGs (or games in general), so in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king and all that. But this doesn't mean that the game was good, it wasn't. The only really cool thing about the game was the setting, but a setting can't carry a 80hour slog on its own. The port is mediocre, as expected, and requires a New 3DS for no reason. The original 3DS is more than capable of playing this, as evidenced by other games playable on the O3DS, like the Monster Hunters. Nintendo used the lame excuse of ""needing more power to run it"" in order to sell more consoles. Which is disgusting, but that is Nintendo greed for you. The good thing is that we didn't need to play this anyway. Skip it. If you just don't value your life and your time, play it on PC using Dolphin. Thank me later.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a port of the Wii classic. Its the same story, same characters, and overall same game. This port has a few extras in the form of a model viewer and soundtracks that can be unlocked with play coins. Some concessions were made to get it onto the ""New"" 3DS. Its presentation isn't quite as clean as the Wii but its story is still worth experiencing. If you own a WiiU or a Wii I recommend that version instead. If the idea of playing this on the go appeals to you this is a great opportunity to play a great game. Its a game that offers over 70 hours of play time with a lot to see and do. The environments and world still are impressive in terms of their scale. If this is your only option to play this game its well worth the investment.. Although this is only playable on New 3DS systems, Xenoblade Chronicles just keeps coming back for more and when it does, we should give it a lot of respect on it. If you have a New Nintendo 3DS or a New Nintendo 3DS XL, don't miss this.. Maybe I didn't have the endurance necessary for this game. After putting 35-40 hours into it, it seemed like the game was still just trying to gain its footing. After having dealt with the repetitive combat for hours and hours, I decided that it wasn't worth doubling my investment in order to finish the game off. One thing that really surprised me (and also intimidated me) was the number of different quests and side projects there were to do in the game. There are seemingly hundreds (thousands?) of quests, but almost all of them are meaningless. Go to a place, find a glowing orb or kill a certain number of creatures. There is no efficient way of tracking these quests either- you have to simply remember when and where you're supposed to perform the quests, or you're forced into searching for them in your menu, which can be tedious. Additionally, there are too many side features in this game that can be very distracting. There's a crafting system, a unit relationship system, conversations unlocked by returning to points in the game once certain conditions have been met, far too many different types of loot, a system for tracking relationships between NPCs, all of which opens up so so so many things to do, but yet none of it feels rewarding. Why should I bother to figure out how to unlock new conversations between my characters? Why would I bother paying attention to how unit synergy builds up between my characters when the buffs they receive are so small? How can I possibly figure out the all of the different debuffs that there are in this game? Frankly, it became far too complicated for me, and I got tired of it. I made it roughly halfway through, and decided I would have more fun playing Fire Emblem or Smash Brothers instead.. I loved this one! Is fantastic! Is the first Japanese RPG that I've tried and is my second favourite game though. The story, the characters, the hours of fun and the battles are awesome! I absolutely recommend it!. Now let me take you back a few years: Xenogears came out on PS1 and I was addicted to it. It was one of the best games I've played and to this day I find myself going back to play it over and over. Then Xenosaga came out. Very good game once again. One of my favorites as a matter of fact. Then Xenosaga II came out... What the hell was this piece of ****. I hated this game. It was a huge grind and a very lackluster story. Everytime I'd play it I would be so bored after 1 hour. Finally, Xenoblade Chronicles was announced on 3DS (I never played it on Wii). I lost all hope when I found out another Xeno game was being released. But Goddamn This game is actually the best game I've ever played. It captures everything a gamer hopes of having in a game. An amazing story, an amazing soundtrack, and amazing visuals. Monolith Soft had a beautiful view of an amazing world and they brought it to life in one, single game. The characters have so much development. Join Shulk, Reyn, Fiora, Dunban, Sharla, Melia, and Riki as they set off on adventure to get revenge on the Mechon for the war. The game captures the aspects of the Mechon really well. Especially Metal Face. Metal Face makes you hate him and you always want to kill him. Whenever you think ""Man I've been playing for a long time,"" You realize that you need revenge on the Mechon and that you must keep going. There are amazing plot twists and there is an amazing combat system that is very easy to get used to. When I got this on N3DS I just couldn't put it down and it took me 120 hours to beat in a span of 1 month. The game is huge, the world is amazing to travel through, and the fun gameplay will keep you on the game for at least 5 hours everyday 10/10 its my favorite game of all time. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a port of the Wii classic. Its the same story, same characters, and overall same game. This port has a few extras in the form of a model viewer and soundtracks that can be unlocked with play coins. Some concessions were made to get it onto the ""New"" 3DS. Its presentation isn't quite as clean as the Wii but its story is still worth experiencing. If you own a WiiU or a Wii I recommend that version instead. If the idea of playing this on the go appeals to you this is a great opportunity to play a great game. Its a game that offers over 70 hours of play time with a lot to see and do. The environments and world still are impressive in terms of their scale. If this is your only option to play this game its well worth the investment.. The 3DS port of this game suffers from both the UX problems that the Wii version already had (difficult to browse menus, for example), with the added malus that the developers did not take enough advantage of the touch screen to make it more readable. It's a mess to get the right angle for the camera in combat, these combat are clunky with forced mechanics on you (especially against the Mechon). These things really hinder the experience.. I followed this game's development since the days when people were trying to get it translated for the west. Living in a small town, I never came across a copy of the Wii version. However, with this port, I was finally able to experience the game I had waited years for. And it was more than worth it. This is the best JRPG I have ever played. Great characters, great atmosphere and graphics (for its time, they're a bit dated now), and one of the best plots as well as OSTs that can be found in a video game. I'm also a big fan of the combat system, which is centered around timely uses of arts and cooperation with COMPETENT AI TEAMMATES. This port played just fine for me, I had no issues with the new 3DS. My one problem with the game was that I had a hard time getting into trying to complete the side-quests. I would always say ""I'm going to complete this quest today!"" and then end up getting bored and fighting rare monsters for fun. In all, this game is a must have for any JRPG fan. 10/10. Born into a world of strife, against the odds, do you choose to fight? Get this game and find out.. Well I had played this game for 150 hour and I can tell that Its a good game. Amazing story, amazing world, amazing music and regular graphics, but Its a 3ds game, apart of that, the cities are lives, each city has NPC, NPCs with name, with story, that make you a sense about you re not walking for a hollow path, you are in a world where if something happens that affect the life of the people. In conclusion a RPG in his definition.. I loved this game through and through I don't know when I'll ever have it in me to play this game again since I sacrificed over 160 hours to finish this game. Not to completion though. I never played the wii version mostly because lately I can never get into home console games. My biggest question going into the game was HOW THE IS THERE GOING TO BE A SEQUEL ON EARTH. The answer is simple beat the main story and you'll find out. Though if you really want to know just look it up and don't play through 100's of hours of awesome game play and story. Honestly I'm probably going to forget the experience but i really enjoyed it and I think anyone who bought a new 3ds who has lots of time to invest into this game will enjoy it. Don't misunderstand though I'm not saying anywhere that you need to upgrade to a new 3ds. That transition will come in time but right now it's unnecessary for lots of people so don't stress out about it. And by the time you need to upgrade the game will be significantly cheaper so you better pick it up then. Also little side note it does help if you just SLIGHTLY spoil yourself nothing major stay away from 7 because honestly to get started you do need a large amount of surprise and intrigue to get into the groove of this game. I'd recommend watching a playthrough of the first 3 or so hours maybe so that you can really become invested without going anywhere near ruining the story.. Great game!!! Innovative Gameplay, simple controls (for a JRPG), and excellent story! For anyone who didn't know, thi game needed to be played because the regular 3ds, the 3dsXL, and the 2ds didn't have tthe proccesing power needed to play Xenoblade Chronicles. Again, great game!!!. It is an amazing game it has the most amazing graphics i have ever seen i love the fighting system and i highly encourage you to buy the game. That is all that is needed to say. (:. Although I enjoyed the Wii controls better. ITS THE SAME GAME If you are complaining about about the new 3ds then go f**k yourself Great game 11/10 pepperonies. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I am loving this game. It has been awesome for long flights/travelling. It's good enough that I find myself pulling out my 3DS and playing it at home with headphones on. While the graphics are not the best, the size and scope of the world and length of the campaign/side missions is just amazing for a portable. More of this, PLEASE, Nintendo.. Not as good as the original, but still one of the best JRPGs you will ever play. If the game wasn't a billion dollars on Wii I'd recommend playing the original, but this is a fine way to enjoy a great game. The port isn't great, but its acceptable. The rating is mostly for the game being ported, and not for the port itself.. Great graphics, complex, challenging and a mature storyline. I have around 20 hours into the game so f",Xenoblade Chronicles on the 3DS is an absolute masterpiece that delivers an unforgettable experience . the combat system feels unique and rewarding with many aspects that I have never seen in a game before . the soundtrack is perfect from the calming and beautiful music while exploring to the triumphant epic music .
"1,056.Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright","Great at the beginning but gets tedious fast Pros: -A LOT of characters that you can recruit -I always love fire emblem's classic relationship system where you could ship each characters not just with you the main character but with each other as well seeing them have kids,getting in all sorts of scenarios and dialogues really heartwarming -gameplay is okay until it reaches a point where you get Ryoma...that brother is playing a dynasty warriors game where every foe you meet is a minion, no weaknesses in his game and trivializes every single boss -Generic and cheesy story unremarkable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I feel like a doomer for saying this, but Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright was a game meant to solely capitalize on the popularity of Awakening and the mechanics that made it popular. While I don't think repeating trends that made you popular is bad, it is when you don't understand them. Having to marry off each initial character just to get their children that have no significance in the story just feels tone deaf and weakens the story when on chapter 18 you can have next to no one in the story as your team, and yet the story plays out like you did. The fact the royals all have retainers and you slowly get them in clumps rather than every now and again also sets back how special units are, and really drives home that it doesn't feel like the Fire Emblem that we've known before. Further alienating the established fan base is the new found casual mode, which not inherently bad for making the game more accessible, made the devs skip on map testing and caused a lot of problems for classic mode fans. Most of the maps are balanced only if played on casual mode, and with the fact that the last two chapters of this game have to be run through all at once, makes for a super unbalanced mess. It doesn't help that the story falls apart in a number of different areas that you'd think would be filled by playing the other games, but it's simply not. A lot of half baked ideas and plot holes are rampant throughout, but what is probably the biggest problem with this game is the morality between Hoshido and Nohr. Hoshido is blatantly the good guy in this, and Nohr is only framed as bad, and when Nohr needed more supplies, at the end of birthright, Hoshido simply solves it with a simple ""we will help you now"". The fact that so much of this game is trying to send a mixed message while also giving you clearly defined black and whites is maddening, and a big reason why hating Corrin is justified. These games clearly needed to be tested and written out better, but they simply weren't to capitalize on new found popularity, and that's sad when the games had so much potential too.- Don't **** put two chapters back to back with permadeath HOW **** HARD IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND NINTENDO!?. Now let's be honest we all jokingly say ""Fates bad haha"" but I genuinely think Birthrout- sorry I mean Birthright is one of the Fire Emblem games of all time. Game is easy, even on Lunatic. Let's get that out there immediately so if you want a harder FE just go Conquest. Even if the game gives you the strongest character since FE1 Falchion Marth, it's still an actually enjoyable game. Some people don't enjoy Fates writing but Birthright had some amazing moments (so did Conquest but I think some parts, like the Hans map without spoiling were top tier) and some ""this makes no sense moments"". The units you get in Birthright are fun, but at that point you're probably just using Ryoma, Corrin, Takumi, Hinoka and your favourites. Overall, really fun game despite its flaws. 8.3/10. While being a lot easier than Conquest, it has a good difficulty spike towards the end of the game. The first 20 chapters are a cakewalk though. However, this doesn't mean this game is bad by any means. It can be a very good game to begin with the series. It can be entertaining for intermediate players on lunatic difficulty as well. Solid game. It's slightly below average. That's all you can really say about it. If you want gameplay, play Conquest instead. If you want a good Fire Emblem game, play almost anything else.. I love this game ! The gameplay is cool, and the characters are so incredible.. I did birthright after Conquest since i wanted to play the more challenging version first. Birthright was too easy in comparizon with Conquest, died only twice and was surprised with the story being less interesting than Conquest. Still enjoyable but not as dark as Conquest's story. What i loved the most in the version are characters that follow your avatar in this story. They are interesting and have good chemistry with the avatar. I'm just surprised and a bit saddened by how some viewers hate the game just because of the story and it's even worse for Birthright. The story isn't the greatest of all fire emblem games but it's decent and some reviews go a little too far In the end Birthright was inferior to Conquest because ot its story but still very good to play thanks the nice characters.. Having played Three Houses first, and then Awakening I was excited to continue my journey with Fire Emblem games by playing Fire Emblem Fates (Birthright). Oh, boy, was I disappointed. The story is probably the worst story I've ever had to suffer through to play through a main campaign. The characters are the weakest set of characters I've ever experienced in a game - period. They're not memorable at all, in fact they're mostly annoying - all of them. The dialogue is absolutely horrendous - even for a 3DS game. The music.. Well, it's basically one song for the most part and that's a pretty good song, but overall it's pretty lackluster. How come I'm still giving this game 6/10 despite this criticism? Well obviously, the gameplay is Fire Emblem so it's good - just like in Awakening - and if it hadn't been for that, I would never, ever have played through the entire game. Also the cinematics look pretty dope..

The story is weaker than Awakening, but the updates to the mechanics are really cool. I still really like this game!. Predictable plot elements, bland characters and underwhelming maps. Such great potential wasted. the gameplay is pretty good, the maps are meh but everything else is great. the story is a 5/10 its the best story of the 3 games. Absolutely love the gameplay! Classic Fire Emblem with a base that kept me there for far too much time than I would like to say. What is keeping me back is the general writing of the game just feels cheesy for my taste. Definitely give the game a go. It's worth it. Just be prepared for a story that might not thrill the average Fire Emblem fan.. Fire Emblem has always being a good quality franchise, until this game. I dont really like the Fates ""saga"", you don't have to play all of them because it's just gonna make you hate the story and Corrin even more. So what's wrong with it? OK so from 30+ characters, there were around only 5 that were actually good, or had a good character development. And Corrin OMG, corrin, she's just one thing in one game and one completely different thing on the other. And after you have to experience in the prologue of both games i don't think how can you like the Nohrian family, but the worst part is that you already paid for it so you don't have any more choose than to play as the bad guys or spend $40 more for the other game. This was a so bad decision. But after that do you think the story is the only bad thing? NO, the characters are over sexualize, in Awakening i would only say that Olivia and Tharja are the only ones than can be considered but in this game more than half the cast is. The maps are boring, and the gameplay seems so unbalanced. The only thing i would say is really good are the cutscenes to be honest, but i think at least the first 5 chapter i had some fun so it'll be a 4/10 for me. This was my second Fire Emblem game and I love it. The music is really good and gameplay is also good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Is the weakest game in the fate Trinity Plus it has a insane difficulty spike in the end of the game. Fire Emblem Fates is as enjoyable as puking up your spleen. You spend too much time running around an imaginary castle like Hogwarts, and I didn't like the weird drunk guy (his name was Gunther, maybe?). The goo monster dude was funny, but he doesn't excuse the amount of grinding in this game. Azura may be the worst character in FE history--there's absolutely nothing to her supports. Not to mention the UGLY graphics. I know the 3DS can do better, especially with the fancy-shmancy games Nintendo has been making recently (Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash comes to mind). Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is as dope as a dingo in a desert. The same can be said for Thracia 776 and Echoes. I even liked the one where Marth was a girl. But not even the fire-breathing sushi waifu can save this putrid pile of pitiable pixels. Given the choice, you're better off spending $40 on cheese whiz; unlike a 3DS cartridge, cheese whiz tastes good on crackers. ...Thanks for reading my fake review, F. Keep making quality videos.. Oh dear god this game was stupidly easy, even in the hardest difficulty. Everyone is OP, You can solo the game with Setsuna on lunatic (I did). If you're new to Fire Emblem I'd highly suggest going Echoes or Three Houses.. This version gets boring fast and is too easy. Get Fire Emblem Awakening or Three Houses instead. This game is way more balanced that conquest but its way too easy with only every map doing a single objective and that is kill all enemies. The story is not as good as conquest but that is not saying much since its more basic there is less plot holes but still does not fix the inherent issues. This game does not overstay its welcome but its pretty bland and disappointing for a Fe title after awakening or even its predecessors.. I was worried if I would like this franchise due to not caring much for Final Fantasy Tactics, but my fears were quickly dismissed as the simplified strategy elements of this game, while still maintaining decent complexity, were perfect for me to enjoy. I really enjoyed the characters I met (so many of them!) and going on this grand journey with them, and of course pairing them all off and doing shipping was addicting, especially when you got to meet their kids! This game broke my heart several times with it's tragic story, but it was still very well written. I do feel like I had a lot of questions that weren't answered, which I feel is why they want me to play Revelations to get those answers. If I were more cynical I may have made a comment here about having to pay more money to get the true ending, but that's definitely not the case! This was definitely a complete game from beginning to end, and Revelations is also it's own full game, so I don't mind buying it at all.. While it never quite reaches the excellence of its predecessor, Fire Emblem Fates is still one of the best RPGs on the Nintendo 3DS. If you're new to the series, it retains the same accessibility options as FE: Awakening, such as turning off permadeath and reducing the overall difficulty. While the Birthright edition won't give you access to the game's hardest campaign and true ending, it is still a solid tactical RPG with an addictive gameplay loop and a story that is just engaging enough to keep players coming back for more.. Although it all seems awesome it is not the absolute best I've come to expect from fire emblem games. The characters are forgettable and nothing really stands out. Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, it's just not what fire emblem usually delivers.. It's very good but I think graphics could be a tiny bit better I like the characters too. Prior to playing Birthright, I was completely inexperienced with Fire Emblem (unless you count Heroes), and I was really surprised at how good it was. The characters honestly could've been explored and developed a bit better, and the music got a bit old after a while, but the gameplay was well done, the story was nice and original, and the final boss music. MY. GOD. I don't think better final boss music will ever be composed. Overall, FE: Fates Birthright is a pretty great game, but could be better in some fields.. I bought this game due to good reviews. I feel as if I've been duped because it lacks a soul. The story is so generic and bare, and the horrible voice acting sounds just like it's been copied from Pokemon. I may have enjoyed the game if I was 12, but no. I highly recommend against this game.. While the story might be a little less intense than that of Conquest. It still seems like a perfect game that has the enticing elements of turn-based RPG. With the hint relationship simulation that feels like Awakening, it still feels like its own with My Castle feature and unique story-telling.. This game has the best class system in the franchise, good mechanics and a huge weapon variety, but as you can see by the score i gave this game is not flawless. The protagonist is annoying and bad, they tried to make your avatar a super good person, meaning that he doesn't kill anybody... in a clash of two kingdoms. The narrative and the story are terrible and deserve the protagonist they have. There are very few good maps, mainly because they tried to make the game difficult adding a **** ton of reinforcements, the game is still pretty easy and with always the same objectives. That game makes marriage weirder than in real life, you can watch your 2D avatar kiss, wake up and blow the hair of your 2D wife/husband. You can have a baby with another kid, and that kid is introduced in the game by a very poor explanation. JUST BUY CONQUEST.. And again even in Conquest, there's still more negative ratings than mixed ratings on Birthright. Something's definitely wrong with these users nowadays.. True Score: 8.6 Pros: - New unit/weapon types for the FE franchise! Exciting! - Children system has become less grindy compared to previous games - Soundtrack has great highs - Characters feel more unique now due to the revised skill system - Story is much improved from Awakening - The core battle system is as solid and fun as ever Cons: - New weapon system makes the weapons themselves seem less valuable and unique - Level design is horrid for the most part - Treehouse interactions are awkward and kind of empty - Censorship from NIntendo - While I love the children system, it pigeon holes you into a particular way of playing - Base management seems like a good idea, but is ultimately rather boring and simple. I wrote a lengthy review on Revelation's page, and I won't reiterate the pros and cons here. Needless to say, there are enjoyable things about the changes they made to this version of Fire Emblem (removing weapon durability in favor of having more diverse weapon choices, for example), but they also added some superfluous activities (everything related to My Castle). I don't wish they had made the game into 3 games because the story didn't deserve it, but it's still a Fire Emblem game.. Birthright is definitely fun, but in no means the best, it's a numbers game like Awakening, but it won't even let you grow as strong as you could in it's predecessor. Whilst the story is alot lighter theb Conquest it does have dark moments such as Elise's death, Zola sacrificing himself, and so on. 7/10, worst of the trio, but not a bad game. Should've had the removed features and Zola as a recruitable character. Needs more Zola.. Fantastic game. I choose to buy Birthright because the characters seemed more appealing - and they are. Graphics and style are awesome, you can't get any better than this on any console. But what's really great about this game is the new Castle mode, which I enjoyed more than anything else in the game. I hope they keep this idea in future FE games. It's not quite as perfect as Path of Radiance on GameCube so I'm giving a final score of 9 instead of 10, but really this is a monolith ****, even slightly better than Awakening in my opinion.. Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is a worthy followup to the critically acclaimed Fire Emblem Awakening. Like Awakening Birthright is accessible for new players as well as offering familiar options like permadeath for older fans. The game has a number of difficulty settings consisting of casual, normal, or hard. It also has variations to further augment the difficulty. Phoenix Mode revives allies instantly. In Classic mode if your ally falls they are gone for good. Then there is Lunatic mode which is incredibly punishing. Phoenix mode feels designed for those that want to enjoy the story while the other modes will appeal to series vets and purists. For those that want a challenge I recommend starting on Hard difficulty. Normal is still a bit too easy and your units will feel pretty overpowered early on even if you are playing on classic mode. It needs to be said that FE:Fate's presentation is top notch. The cutscenes and character animations are well done. The character models themselves actually have feet! In areas like my castle you can tap the L shoulder button to zoom down and see your surroundings in 3rd person. In battle the camera shifts from top down to also zoom in on your surrounding terrain. Birthright's story can be best described as standing with your family the Hoshido against the Nohr empire. Conquest on the other hand has you siding with Nohr. But as any Fire Emblem vet can tell you; its a bit more nuanced than that. Birthright and Conquest essentially start the same. At mission 5 you will then branch off into that version's storyline. Birthright is the easier more accessible version. It allows you to grind and fight random battles to build up your party. Fates introduces some new mechanics that shake up some classic Fire Emblem staples. Weapons no longer take durability damage (aside from staves and rods). The map can be altered using what are called Dragon veins. These spots can create bridges, level mountains and more. The game also introduces a new area called My Castle. You can build buildings such as shops, mess hall, fishing pond and more. These often offer items that you can use in a number of ways. In my castle you can also invite party members to your private quarters to boost your relationship. The dating sim elements of Awakening have been expanded here in that once you marry you will have new options within your private quarters. You may also have to use the stylus to wake your significant other for instance. My castle also has a little bit of online multiplayer in it that allows you to siege other player's castles and defend your own as well. Its advisable to play Birthright first followed by Conquest and then Revelation. Buying physical copies of both is essentially a waste of money because you get the others at a cheaper price as a download once you own one version. Overall Birthright is excellent part in one of the most expansive Fire Emblem tales to date.. Fire Emblem is definitely one of my top 5 franchises ever, and I think superior to XCOM as the best turn-based tactical strategy game, and with far better story and character development on top of better tactics. Birthright is the easier of the 3 Fire Emblem Fates, but it is still definitely worthy of your purchase and time. It expands and improves on everything in Awakening and keeps all the good stuff, exactly what a sequel in a long-running game series should do. I really hope they make amiibo for the top 5-6 characters from the trilogy. I would buy them all!. + Great difficulty level, its always fair and rewards tactical thinking, and turning off perma death is great for new players + watching your units relationships with eachother develop is rewarding and fun + Replay value, you can play through any of the campaigns again and have a new experience by favouring different units, trying out different romance paths or upgrading units to different classes + Emotional story with believable characters... - ...Even if the dialogue is stilted at times - Repetitive level design compared to Conquest/Revelation. Were to start..before I start. I played trough fire emblem 6,7,8,9,10,11 before this and on the last chapter on awakening doing optimization when it comes to s support , stats and characters/children. So what is there to say about fates: Birthright? First lets talk about the difficulty Well firstly i played it on hard ,did two paralogues and barely any grinding. And the game is fairly hard , when people say it is similar to awakening , i can because you have more option to grind , how ever i still found awakening harder. But with that said dont let it surprise you if you end up with some chapters that is really hard. The majority of the chapters i had to use multiple tries to get trough. Story- Well it has a better story then in awakening. The story feels more unique and has soem sad moments too. And the villains is mostly good too, with that said i liked some of the villains from the previous entries Aversa from fe 13 etc, Nergal, Limistella, Sonia , Lyon , The black knight etc. But mostly the villains feels a little better. Characters- If we count both games i would choose fates, if we count birthright simple vs awakening i prefer awakening cast. But never the less you find a lot of good characters, interesting once and it feels bad when you have to fight your "" siblings"" no matter what route you choose i guess ( just started conquest) Gameplay- Well if you played a fire emblem game you know how this is. The gameplay is similar to awakening with some tweeks like enemy pair up etc. Support is again unlimited. Weapons doesnt have durability, but staffs does. And you have some more options when you customize you characters. And there are some other surprises here. The only major con is that i wish there was more then one objective type. But again dont bother me to much, but if conquest has more variety as they say , then i will look forward to conquest and be happy ( started it yesterday on chapter 8). All in all a very good game 9.5/10 With that said i have played this for around 73 hrs and 30 min. My favourite is stilI fe 7 and 13. Fe 7 isnt because it was my first fe game , cuz that was fe 8. Now i am on to play conquest then revolution and also have to figure when to finish awakening. NB: Probably one of my favourite game series , and the only turn based strategy games that comes close is civ 5, and tw: Rome+ medieval 2.. The fire emblem series has really improved over the years it's been around. Fates as the 14th instalment to the series was very surprising on how different it was. There's an advantage to have a sibling since he got conquest and got birthright. After play both ended up leaning more towards Hoshido. It was because of all the new classes and some new weaponry they even changed the weapon circle around abit. Plus the way how they used the new mechanic called the Dragon Vains which can provide very useful way's of going through a mission or hinder your progession. Also love the castle system where you can walk around you very own castle and even customize it to you likeing. It gives the player the chance to have a little freedom in the game by letting them collect resoures to even later betting them to earn even more of that item for forging and food. Runing shops for buying weapons plus seals and staffs. Bonding with some unit in the treehouse and even having a quote on quote pet dragon. The game play it self is simliar to awaking gameplay just with some tweaks and really pretty animasion that runs very well on the platform it runs on. Even like how they did the pair up system and even where the enemy units can use the system as well. The system is broken into the attack and defense stance were a unit standing next to each other will always attack togther and if they are paired up with each other then they begin the defend stance where a small bar will fill up after your unit a enemy unit attack once it's full the secondary unit will defend the lead unit for one attack. Now for the Negative parts of the game. The way some of the weapons work are pretty cool but a majority of them are very risky to use or are very low on power for using them. For a little more detail the weapons in fates no longer have durability but some weaponry have negative effects like steel which lower the speed stat of units by 3 and sliver which lower skill and strength. The missions in birthright have some issues, during one of them it relies on weather you use the Dragon Vains with a 50-50 chance to flood the level your units are on with lave causing them to lose hp every turn or lift a bridge and progress with little issues. Some of the characters in the story really enjoyed but a good few really didn't enjoy as much. Some of the skills were either useful, risky, or not very useful on some of the classes. As for the the censorship and way they market the games its really not that big of an issue but don't really understand why some people make it a big dea. Love how they decided to take up this new FE and some of the ways how the improved it. Even though it has some flaw think that it very well worth the money. A good score of 8 outta 10. Once upon a time, there was this game for 3DS called Fire Emblem Fates, which had a rough time getting dragged through the mud due to unnecessary and inconsistent censorship. The result is the above user score, which, frankly, is a damn insult to the fine craft of Intelligent systems that has once again struck gold and strengthenes its position as king of strategy RPGs. In Birthright, as you may know, you get to experience an easier game (that can still be hard should you choose the appropriate settings before beginning your campaign). As is custom in Fire Emblem, when your characters die, they are gone for good - unless you rage quit, of course. You can also spend time shipping the hell out of every single character in Fates, which is fun given the broadly drawn personalities in the game. The story centers around a person born into a peaceful kingdom, but abducted and raised in a kingdom of cruelty. It's more decent than properly great, but the characters are a real treat. As for the gameplay itself, it's some of the tightest in the entire genre of strategy games. It's not different from any other Fire Emblem game, but its credentials are unquestionable. You can choose to watch the game play out with pizazz and pyrotechnics, or just skip past the fluff and make the game play out as quickly as possible. Regardless of whether you believe the dual-screen setup of the 3DS is worth anything, it's use in Fates cannot be ignored. Character names, stats and properties are shown here, and tapping on any of the statistics or names shown down below gives a clear explanation of what they mean, meaning it's super easy to learn as you go along. PRO TIP: enable permadeath. The angry haters who bemoan the censorship of the game aren't wrong, but they decry NoA's work so much that they forget the fact that, even with the censorship, the finished package of Fates is amazing. The game has a beautiful mix of art styles, the CG/anime cutscenes are among the most gorgeous in gaming, the characters are lovable, and - most importantly - it's still the Fire Emblem we all know and love, only with refined gameplay and sidegame mechanics to appeal to both the newbie and the pro.. This is a great game I had a lot of fun playing this game and it is one of the best games of 2016 so far in my opinion. The combat is great the characters are great the story is great this game is perfect.. After putting in about 12 hours, I realized that this game isn't for me anymore. I grew up loving this style of game, and really wanted to love it. But I just don't have the time that I want to be able to sink into this game. BUT I can say that I recognize how good this game is. If you are a fan of this style, or a fan of the series, this is a no brainer of a purchase. When you purchase one, you have the ability to buy the downloadable version of the other storyline for 20, which is really nice and gives you more to sink your teeth into.. It was great entry for those who never played Fire Emblem before. The RNG are not so brutal as Awakening, but the story and music are mediocre. But it's worth playing it. For those who veteran of Fire Emblem, just play Conquest instead.. Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is one of three Fates games released. The game follows a prince/princess who was abducted at a young age and now attempts to reconnect with his or her biological family and abandoning the family that he or she has known all their life. Nohr had just given Corrin a sword that literally exploded and was used to attack Hoshido, so Corrin has the common sense to not go back, thus creating conflict with his or her biological family. The problem here is that while Nohr is marked as an evil kingdom with an evil king, the siblings are not evil and are acting out of fear (though they have multiple chances to run away, they never take them). One of the good features of the game is the introduction of Phoenix Mode, which is like an easy mode because the only way you can lose is if all your characters die on the same turn. It prevents a single mistake from completely screwing you over considering how many instant kills there are in this game. The battles are pretty straightforward with most maps having you walk down some narrow corridor towards your enemies and killing all of them. Sometimes you only have to kill the enemy boss though. The problem is that there are no unique objectives and some battles rely more on luck than strategy. Dragon Veins are able to manipulate the battlefield, but the changes are often undone at the end of the turn. That spike pit the enemy created will always be there and will only hurt the enemy too if you choose to activate the Dragon Vein. There was another where you had a 50% chance to set the entire map on fire and a 50% chance to open up the next section of the map. Pretty stupid function if you ask me. I just used save scumming to get the right one and never touched that map, even for grinding purposes again. The biggest problem I had with the game is the forced online feature when online does not even work most of the time. I can access Inbox just fine, but the moment I try to update My Castle or connect to someone else's the game just fails. The problem is that you must go to other people's castles in order to collect the resources needed to upgrade your weapons. Without doing so, the late game is much more difficult due to the lower stat caps, useless specialized weapons, and that you can only get one or two resources from your castle at a time. If they had other means for you to acquire these items, it's not a big problem. However, the only other way you can acquire",fire emblem fates: birthright was a game meant to capitalize on the popularity of awakening . casual mode made the devs skip on map testing and caused a lot of problems . a lot of half baked ideas and plot holes are rampant throughout .
"1,057.The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD","Very average remaster, but still a more modern way to play a classic title.. My Favorite game of all time. Love the story, the level design, the dungeons, the characters, everything. I love this game so much. And i love this HD version. Just thank you for this game.. Daniel didn't like the Wolf Link part of the game but I don't agree with him. Very creative move of Nintendo and also making a more ""dark"" version of the Zelda series. 10/10 and a must play!. I was liking the game but.. This game is the life proof that Nintendo does not test its games. I literally dropped the game after 14 hours due to the dumb horse riding controls, literally how can you release a HD version of the game where you mess with the controls and does not test it? F Nintendo!. I FREAKING HATE THIS GAME, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL, WHY COULDNT THEY HAVE JUST MADE WIND WAKER 2!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is a pretty good zelda game and has the best dungeons in the entire series but, that comes with a cost. Everything other than the dungeons aren't fun to do. The main quests outside the dungeon has too many boring fetch quests (tears and the memory section). The characters aren't memorable except for midna and zant (they ruined him in the end). The art style looks really bad because of the dark and edgy direction this game goes for. It's so bad that it makes me laugh. The game is dark for the sake of being dark, not because it tells a really deep meaning (like majoras mask). For some reason the story contradicts itself at the end. The final boss is super disappointing from both a story and gameplay perspective. Some how in a game with fun and epic bosses the final boss is so underwhelming. (This is a small summary and doesn't go into detail) To top it all of, the twilight princess community is super toxic. I can't believe there're people that will go out of their way to ruin other peoples day for liking another zelda game or criticizing this one. This is the main reason why this game boils my blood.. This is in my opinion the best Zelda game that was ever made. People compare it to Ocarina of Time but Ocarina of Time by the end of the day is also just inspired by A Link to the Past. Also I have no problem with taking concepts that work and re-use them. For me Twilight Princess is pretty much better than Ocarina of Time everywhere, except for some interpretations of themes and the inclusion of characters maybe. Nevertheless, I like the artstyle way more, Midna is one fantastic character that helps the story of the game, especially as Twilight Princess is one of the more story-focused Zelda games and that is very important for me and the dungeons feel way more organic. I really like the idea of Link becoming a Wolf and the atmosphere that the game has. The final battle is excellent, especially the very last phase and for the Wii U version in particular I like the controls with the pad a lot. Also the HD graphics of course - the game looks great on Game Cube already but it is amazing what this 11 years old game looks like in the Wii U. I don't even want to talk too much about it anymore. It is just one of my most favourite games of all time and you should get it. Does it have its lengths? Sure. But those lengths never actually are a problem as much as it can be in other games, especially as you should not really be able to get lost and normally you are busy enough with a task that is still not long enough to really feel bored, even if it might be a bit repetitive. The only really sad aspect for me would be that a certain character is not included as much as I would like him to be.. the second best game ever made I really like the remake and I would play twilight princess 100 times more than ocarina of time if you like ocarina of time then you must play this masterpiece no more words need to be said. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is very beautiful with better and more detailed graphics this game is a 10. This is not a hd remake we wanted in the vein of Wind Waker, but it's still an amazing game overall. The textures are cleaned up but the characters models remain unchanged and you can tell its not a current gen game. Alas, if you've never played it before this is the definitive version of the game, but if you have you won't get much new out of this if you still have your wii or gamecube copy. Great game but if I play roll goal one more time I think I might jump off a bridge. The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess one of my favorite Zelda title's in the Zelda franchise tho a Link to the Past is my Number one Game Twilight Princess is either my Second or third favorite in the Series Franchise aside from the Awsomeness that is The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild still tho Twilight Princess is a great Platformer and great Storytelling in the Zelda story timeline.. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED! I love this game so much! I've played it at least 20 times and it still holds up today! I do have some critics for it but the game is too fun and enjoyable to really hurt the game. Play this game if you haven't already. It's amazing.. Back in the day when this game came out, I was actively disliking it for being serious and dark, the fact that it was made for fans that didn't like Wind Waker bothered me a lot (since I loved that game), it felt like an unfair apology. In reality, I liked it more than I could admit at the time but in my teenage mind it was ""far behind other Zeldas"". 14 years later what started as a cleaning backlog game ended in a wonderful rediscovery journey. Twilight Princess presents a story more in lines like Majora's Mask or A Link to the Past, it is darker and it touches more serious themes than other Zeldas, is not that is a grim game but I liked quite a lot how they put stuff like revenge, inequality, privilege, etc., into it, they didn't go full-on with them but at least they question things that in other Zelda games where took for granted. I won't say that TP was ahead of its time however I can say that narratively is more in tune with our current discussions as in 2020. One of the main differentiators from other Zelda games is its art direction, which I have mixed feelings with it, it goes pretty well with the dark atmosphere and tone of the game but some character designs or more specifically the 3d models and textures didn't translate that well, It's not that the art direction is that bad, but for every amazingly designed character like Midna (your companion in this game for those unfamiliar) you have a generic fantasy looking enemy, pretty hit or miss. Speaking of Midna, she's definitely a top tier character in the franchise, she really grew on me the more time I spend with her, plot and gameplaywise, the other characters are great too, some of them can be a little annoying at first, as the kids from the first village, but as the story unfolds, every single one of them have at least one good moment. One thing worthy of note is that this HD remaster has Hero mode (hard mode) from the start, on which enemies do double damage and they don't drop hearts, I believe this is the definitive mode to play TP since the normal mode is extremely easy, and it gives an extra layer to the combat which is not that bad but is pretty basic. As for the gameplay and maybe the one thing that surprised me the most was the variability of everything, mechanics, boss fights, progression, etc. Unlike Wind Waker which is for better or worse a simple game in everything, in contrast, Twilight Princess is complex (for better or worse) in a lot of its mechanics, dungeons are massive and have exclusive mechanics alongside the item you acquire there, for instance in the first dungeon you will have the boomerang mechanic but also a second mechanic with some characters you'll find there, it adds a lot, the problem is that in some occasions this also translates as not so clear puzzles, poor navigation and backtracking and so on, but at least they try to make it more interesting. Another great thing is the music and its sound design, most of the tunes have this dreamy feeling and are also memorable and catchy, they capture perfectly the tone of the game and yet they sound like they belong not only in the Zelda franchise but specifically in the TP universe, it might as well contain my favorite Zelda songs, remixed or original. Speaking of rhythm, the game progression and the story have an incredible flow, the only instance on which I wasn't thrilled to play were those parts that you need to collect ""light bugs"" to free an area, they were annoying, not fun and at times unintuitive, they break my immersion a lot, at least you have to do this only 3 times so it's not that bad I think, other than this everything unfolds naturally and beautifully. It also has these interlude segments in-between dungeons on which you will be required to do certain things to advance the story, they're different, fun, and memorable, this kind of stuff is part of the Zelda series but here doesn't feel formulaic neither repetitive. So what's not to like about this game? In summary not that much, my biggest problem might be the combat, it is dully simple even when the game tries to make the illusion that is complex via the skills you will learn but hardly use through the game, enemies don't require much strategy and on the other hand, the boss fights are fun and creative, they also have a second phase when things get a little mixed and add some challenge or variety to the fight, nevertheless, they're way too easy. I wasn't expecting to revisit this game and liked it so much, even loving it, maybe graphically it didn't age that well like the timeless Wind Waker or even the divisive Skyward Sword, and it has some issues that in the great scheme of things are minuscule, but aside from that the game has a lot of heart, it's fun and rewarding, the story and its characters are memorable and if you're into collecting things this game has a lot of variety in that regard, if you're a veteran or a newcomer to the series please check it out.. One of my favorites in the series, only thing holding it back from a 10 is the wolf segments.. An excellent HD remaster for those new to the series or the game itself. With new functions added and with the use of the console's gamepad, make the game easily enjoyable. Easily the best story and game from the classic Zelda format. Unfortunately, a better HD remaster would have been appreciated, such as reduced bloom, a higher polygon count for certain models, or even better a reworking of the music. All of those suggestions could be put on a larger disc format that the Wii U uses. Points are also removed due to a certain game areas being locked off due to certain Amiibo functionality, which is the Cave of Shadows dungeon. A great remaster for a game console with little 3rd party support. .. The strongest and most personal tale ever told by the Zelda franchise, in its most appealing audiovisual form yet.. I was never into the TLOZ franchise before I played this game. Took me a while to adapt to the game mechanics, since this type of gameplay was kinda new to me. But I was quickly attached to how the game works, to the challenges, to the battles and the characters of course. And the giant world to explore with tons of bonus content. The history in some points freaked me out, but it made me like it even more. The only thing I didn't enjoy that much is that Wolf Link is very ""basic"" in his abilities. I haven't read much about the franchise, but they say that this game's Ganondorf is terrible, but since I'm a ignorant with TLOZ, can't argue with that.. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an amazing game that still holds up. There's a load of emotion in this game and I love the characters. Midna is one of my favorite video game characters in general. Graphically, this game looks great. I love the grittier, darker Legend of Zelda. Gameplay-wise, I thought this game was amazing. This game's dungeons are easily some of the best in the series. I also love this game's combat. Link controls well in this game, and the game hasn't bugged one in my whole playthrough. In conclusion, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is one of the best 3D Zelda games and is certainly worth a playthrough if you're a fan of the series. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. More of the same Zelda formula, but with a bit of a twist. The ability to play as a puppy is always a nice little gimmick in a game, along with a mirrored shadow world to experience. The story is actually pretty good in this one, surrounded with a bit more mystery rather than a clear cut 'go rescue the princess' plot. But mostly follows the same steps as other Zelda games. Never the less, there is plenty of content to discover if you do a bit of exploring. The game play is a little bit more fine tuned than the last few 3d predecessors, but clunky as always. Platforming in the 3d Zelda games ****, but the combat is as fun as ever, even when you get to be a dog. The Wii U version (just like most Wii U games) does come with the added advantage of the screen on the controller. This made the game a lot more enjoyable as the player is given easy access to the maps and inventory screen. Really saves you from having to stop and start to equip an item or check your location. Overall, there's a lot of fun to be had for Zelda fans, I've played every version and this one is the best. But might be a little slow for most action RPG enthusiasts. Thumbs up from here still!. Seriously was an ok Zelda game until the ridiculously terrible escort mission with the garbage control of the horse started. Way to ruin a game, I just can’t believe how stupid the programmers are. You people should be ashamed of yourselves.. I know that many people consider this game to be a masterpiece, but after Wind Waker I was just unpleasant to play Twilight Princess.Boring start, unpleasant character and world design, dull music. Un Zelda sobrevalorado. Si bien no es malo, tampoco es tan bueno. Para empezar, los controles de Epona son horribles, en especial en la pelea del puente. El ambiente oscuro que tiene todo el juego, hace perder la magia de los otros Zeldas más ""coloridos"". Una trama que trata de emocionar, pero que en ningún momento emociona tanto como BOTW, o el aclamado OoT, Majora´s Mask, etc. Tiene cosas buenas claro, como los calabozos, el cambio de Link a lobo, pero le faltó bastante. // An overrated Zelda. While it's not bad, it's not that good either. First, Epona's controls are horrible, especially in the bridge fight. The dark atmosphere that has the whole game, makes lose the magic of the other more ""colorful"" Zelda's games. A plot that tries to thrill, but at no time excited as much as BOTW, or the acclaimed OoT, Majora´s Mask, etc. He has good things of course, like the dungeons, the change from Link to wolf, but he lacked a lot.. A Masterpiece. Metacritic should give the Must-Play bagde to this version too. The original game was extremely beautiful and this remaster works as the Wii or GC version. The graphics are visually perfect, the music is always awesome. The Wii U Game-pad functions are implemented very well. I had fun replaying this game again. Absolutely perfect. First off - the fact that this remaster manages to have a LOWER rating than the original is PURE FALSIFICATION. The review section here is mostly those who are rating 8's due to how little was added to the remaster, however, I am rating the game AS A WHOLE. Check out my full review of Twilight Princess over at the GameCube version! This review covers what's been changed. This remake gives Twilight Princess a much-needed fresh coat of modern paint and adds some bonus functionality. As a remake, it's alright, but the game as a whole is much improved. Visuals are retextured and bloom is reduced, leaving the style up to personal opinion. Human -> Wolf switching is streamlined and the Wii U touchscreen menus are a gift. The Wolf Link amiibo, who comes with the physical edition, brings the Cave of Ordeals, which expands on Wolf Link's capablities - or, rather, gives you the chance to use them. The Tears of Light are reduced in number (thank Hylia), the Poe Lantern improves the Poe Hunt a fair bit, and other amiibo functionality (despite being physical, limited run DLC) is inconsequential. Except for Ganondorf, who (when doubled with the VERY NECESSARY Hero Mode) brings a real challenge. While Twilight Princess still has flaws, it has improved in some big ways. I've rated it as 10 since I'm rounding up from a 9.5.. i did abort it in half , its not that funny as the older zelda games .. 12345678912345678123456781234567812345678 to get 75 letters is hard !. The original Twilight Princess on the GameCube amazingly preserved what made Ocarina of Time great, fixed what was wrong and made a few progressive strides. Without revolutionizing the series, Twilight Princess pushed it forward, and to this day, Zelda games can't seem to find the middle ground Twilight Princess hit so well between innovation and great gameplay. On the other hand, with this being on the Wii U, one might have had a realistic expectation of a surreal overhaul of the graphics and some sprawling new content and pacing fixes. Instead, this feels like a very barebones effort to celebrate a ten-year-old GameCube game. Sure, the textures look better, but not nearly on par with what the Wii U is fully capable of. The new ""dungeon"" is just another Cave of Ordeals, and the prize is pitiful. Amiibo support is woefully underutilized, and there's just not enough substantial new content for returning players to find a reason to visit, not even a spruced-up soundtrack. If you haven't played Twilight Princess before, this version still preserves everything amazing about the original almost to a fault and features satisfying horseback riding, some truly jaw-dropping moments and the best side character the Zelda series has seen so far.. What Kind of Adventure? Action-Adventure Was it fun? I wish it was, I really do wish I enjoyed this game but I just couldn’t get into it. Are there any similar games? There are Zelda rip offs but Zelda games are very original. Would you play it again? I tried to get into it a couple times and just gave up. I wont be playing this game again. Any Complaints? The game didn’t seem bad but I just didn’t care for the gameplay. It just seemed the like game was just bouncing from puzzle to puzzle to puzzle and I just got burnt out doing the same things over and over again. How many hours did you play it? I played it for about 8 hours. Which in my opinion is certainly enough time to decide if you like a game or not.. Although not as good as the effort of the Wind Waker remaster, this is the definitive version of Twilight Princess. HD graphics, spectacular gameplay and amazing Legend of Zelda story.. I am pretty shocked with the low quality of this zelda game, the controls, the camera, the animations, i don't know if the people in charge of the remaster are the responsible or the original developers, but this feels so out of the line, every zelda game has great controls and camera, but whatever they did on this one, well, i hope someone was fired to be honest.. Game Cube, Wii, Wii U... Doesn't matter. You MUST play this game, it's a f**** masterpiece, it's brutal, and if you play it in Wii U, HDMI... what a game!. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD is a great remaster of the Gamecube/Wii game and immerses you into an epic story with a dark atmosphere and lovable characters. The story can get a bit confusing, but it's like a really messy burger, and once you can fit your mouth around it, it's delicious. Zant is a cunning villain, and Midna is the best Zelda companion to date. The graphics are a major step-up from the other versions, but it tries to make the atmosphere so gloomy that it can sometimes be tough to see your surroundings. The dungeons give you a great level of challenge this time around, and are probably the best in the series and the optional combat mechanics are really fun to learn. Hyrule is really huge this time around, and while they tried to fix the problem of it being completely empty other than monsters, adding stamp collecting wasn't the way to go. Checking out all of the different side-quests are a fun activity as well. Overall, this game is a must have for WiiU owners and Zelda fans alike.. The best version of the second best Zelda game of all time (OoT 3D still holds that spot) this is the game where they have perfected the Zelda formula and have given us the best looking Zelda game of all time (style > substance) the gameplay is perfect since you don't have to use stupid motion controls. The Legend of Zelda definitely is without a doubt, one of my favorite franchises Nintendo ever produced. From the original, all the way to Breath of the Wild, every single title has its great aspects. Including Twilight Princess, which explains why they re-released it on the WiiU in high definition. Not only it plays an important role on the Zelda timeline, it was the first ever 3D zelda game I've ever played! One of my favorite characters are Midna who is a bit annoying at start but slowly throughout the game, once you learn a little bit more about her past you'll find that she has a reasonable backstory which'l make you like her a bit more. So yes, I hope that answers the question enough, the textures are a lot more clean and the gameplay is outstanding! My only issue is that the character models all look the same. Overall, Twilight princess to me is truly a masterpiece in its own unique way.. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD is the first time I played This game since i didn't own a GameCube and a Wii. The game is defintely great but suffers from a few flaws. Even though riding is a major part of the experience, the controls for it are terrible. Most of the time I instead used the wolf form to travel trough Hyrule. The story itself is good but suffers a bit from the lack of voice acting the series is known for up until ""Breath of the Wild"". But my biggest problem with it is that it takes quite some time to get to the meat of the game. Despite all these flaws this, mostly the gameplay and sometimes hard puzzles are what elevates Twilight Princess HD into greatness. The boss battles, especially the final battle are fun and challenging. The puzzles are frustrating at times but the satisfaction after solving them is worth it. The visuals are good but not great. You can tell that the original is over a decade old. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It took me about 50 hours to beat the game and it was definitely worth it.. I thought the original versions ****, but man this one **** even more. I was hoping Nintendo had fixed at least some of the infinite flaws this game has, but they haven't! Hyrule field and the overworld is still empty, the boss battles are still too easy, the soundtrack still ****, the AI is still stupid, and the wolf link sections are still unbearable. Zelda fans, do yourself a favour and skip this game.. As a remaster it is not as good as it should be, but as a game is just one of the best of Wii U and The Legend of Zelda Saga. Best soundtrack ever with a really interesting world to discover.. I have always loved Twilight Princess. The HD version could have been better, but even though I admit that Twilight Princess HD release trailer did not properly show it, Twilight Princess HD is a much bigger upgrade than The Wind Waker HD. Basically, all textures are new, from the grass of Hyrule to any painting in Snowpeak Ruins. The resolution boost is far more noticeable than in Wind Waker HD, because Twilight Princess is naturalistic and Wind Waker is toon. The game looks nicer and crisper than ever. I love Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, they both are absolutely wonderful games that no one in this world should miss, but I dare to say that Twilight Princess is the best The Legend of Zelda game ever, because: · It's absolutely full of the best features in the series, · the story is original and dark, · it doesn't seem to be continuously censoring itself, · it has a huge amount of varied things to do and places to visit, · it's never cheap backtracking unlike Skyward Sword, · it's not huge but shallow like Breath of the Wild, · The naturalistic visuals are the best in the series this far, specially in the HD version, and they fit best the nature settings of the series and the emphasis on making the player feeling an adventurer. · The dungeons are unique and really clever (feel more intelligent by not using any guide). · Midna is not a cheesy or annoying mentor (hello, Skyward Sword, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks). · The combat has some tweaks and twists including additional techniques, but it's not unnecessary complex. · You can be Link, his wolf form, you can ride Epona or a Bullbo, you can fly hang off a Twilit Carrier Kargarok... · There are cool mini games and side quests. · The soundtrack includes great old songs plus some interesting new melodies. · It's not too similar to Ocarina of Time as some people say. The people who think Twilight Princess is ugly are people that don’t like its dark tone. Twilight Princess is an outstanding game that conveys better than any other Zelda game all its content and intentions. Twilight Princess is arguably the best game Nintendo has ever made.. Great game with a great world. It looks okay not the best. it is enjoyable to play though and has great personality. I wish the character had schedules like in botw or in majoras mask. If I'll be honest, Twilight Princess the third best game of all time. This game features unique adventure with Link and Midna. And not only that, Link can transform into a wolf.... I never owned a Wii or a Gamecube, as both those consoles were released during an extended break I took from console gaming. So when I got the backwards compatible Wii U in 2013, as a huge Zelda fan, one of the first things I did was to get Wii's Twilight Princess. Halfway through the second dungeon, I gave up, as I simply couldn't stomach playing through a 3D Zelda with motion controls. Twilight Princess HD, then, was a very welcome way for me to cover this particular hole in my Zelda backlog. The first thing you have to know about Twilight Princess is that it was supposed to be a 'back to basics' of sorts for 3D Zelda. After two entries that successfully strayed from the Ocarina of Time blueprint, Nintendo probably thought it was time to be less bold. The result is a game that doesn't offer a lot in terms of innovation in the gameplay loop. Thankfully, this allowed a razor-sharp focus for the game design, resulting in a thoroughly fun experience. Link starts his adventure by helping solve problems in his pastoral hometown, which offers some basis to a few of the game mechanics you'll come across later on. Soon enough, however, a strange portal rips reality apart, sending forth otherwordly, hostile beasts. As a result, all of the town youngsters are kidnapped, and Link ends up transformed into a wolf for trying to cross the portal. He's then immediately acquainted with a strange little creature called Midna, who goes on to serve as the title's gameplay companion (and is thankfully a vast improvement over Ocarina's Navi). Overall, the storytelling is pretty good. Midna is an interesting character with intentions that are less than clear initially, and it's nice to watch as her bond with Link unfolds through the game. The cast of NPCs are all the right kind of quirky (you know, classic Zelda), which also helps in regards to the numerous side quests they present. If there's one thing that actually stands out here, though, it's the dungeon design. I admit I've always been more of an overworld guy, meaning I usually prefer to explore the vast wilderness of Hyrule, and see dungeons as a fun diversion instead of a main gameplay focus. In Twilight Princess, however, the dungeons are so excellently designed that I found myself constantly yearning to find the next one (although yeah, the blandness of the overworld probably helps here, too). Two absolute standouts are the Goron Mines, with its extremely cool use of the iron boots, and the Yeti's Mansion, which has a strangely ominous atmosphere and has a progression theme that's unlike anything the series has ever done for a dungeon. TL;DR: As far as 3D Zelda games go, Twilight Princess might be the most formulaic of them all. Still, this is the Zelda formula we're talking about. Even if the game plays it mostly safe, it's still a compelling, expansive, extremely well-round-out adventure. And yes, it features some of the most impressive dungeon designs to ever grace the series. If, like me, you missed out the first time around, Twilight Princess HD is a great way to remedy that. Rating: 8.5. A fantastic game in every way but one, and that one issue nearly ruins the entire thing: Every single battle fought on horseback is a rage inducing nightmare because the controls for Epona are so poor that I struggle to think of any other experience as awful from any other first party Nintendo game ever released. Add in awkward aiming with the bow and boomerang while riding Epona, and this game is at times an exercise in pure frustration. Poor control schemes should never be used to create artificial difficulty.. Graphics: 10 Sound: 9.5 Gameplay: 9.2 Fun/Story: 9.2 The real Ocarina of Time spiritual sucessor. Although its undeniable quality it seemed a little overdue. Perhaps the release to Gamecube and Wii has harmed it to obtain an usual 10 of Zelda games. Even so it´s a very beautiful experience.. Twilight Princess is among my favorite Zelda games. To say that the original hadn't aged well would be quite the understatement. Make no mistake that this is not a full on remake. You are still seeing the original character models and geometry with a fresh coat of paint. This is especially apparent when looking at Wolf Link. His paws still lack definition. Some of the original game's issues still remain but that is more due to the limitation of the hardware at the time. Hyrule Field feels a bit barren compared to more contemporary games. Going from place to place generally doesn't feel too exciting. Like MGSV's world, the game is at its best once you get to those dungeons and points of interest. Twilight Princess is a huge game which can easily take over 100 hours to find every piece of heart (5 per container), bug, etc. The dungeons are among the best in the series and boast some incredible boss fights even if they are a bit on the easy side. If you are looking for a greater challenge however? The Wolf Link Amiibo opens up an additional cave of trials. The Ganondorf amiibo unlocks double the damage. The game also allows you to play on Hero mode from the beginning. The most immediate benefit of this remake is the added detail and texture work on the character models. Link and Zelda's clothes have a noticeable cloth weave pattern. The enhanced detail really pops though it makes me wish the same attention had been paid to other areas. Wolf Link's fur still seems a bit flat. As I stated earlier his feet also lack definition. The other long standing criticism is that the game's first hour is tedious. It does set up Link's relationship with some of the characters and makes it a bit of a more personal tale. Further improvements include easier inventory management (courtesy of the gamepad), A reduction in the number of tears of twilight needed. Like them or hate them, motion controls have been removed for this outing. (I actually enjoyed them). One thing also struck me during my first few hours. Epona is actually pretty clunky in the way she controls. I couldn't remember her being this unwieldy in the original. I also occasionally got stuck on odd bits of geometry. For tho",the game is a pretty good zelda game and has the best dungeons in the entire series . the art style looks really bad because of the dark and edgy direction this game goes for . the final boss is super disappointing from both a story and gameplay perspective .
"1,058.Allegiance","I played Allegiance way back in 1999-2001 during beta/retail. It had a really responsive group of developers (Microsoft Research) and a vibrant community. All these years later and the game is still just as fun, while the community (with the help of Microsoft's release of the games source code) has continued to expand the game and develop its potential. 12 years on and this is still a must play... check it out at ****!",allegiance is still a must play . 12 years on and the community has continued to expand the game . check it out at ****!
"1,059.Mini Metro","A good puzzle game that serves more as a background to wake up in the morning with a daily challenge or something like that.. Game for those who like solving puzzles under increasing pressure scenarios. Wasn’t a bad game, but got boring quick.. Mini Metro . Played - 35+ Hours Paid - £6.74 Score - 9/10 Mini metro is a smart more-ish game that is easy to pick up, easy to get frustrated with and very very fulfilling when everything goes right. A lovely simple design which although may not look appealing to some at first, is a joy to play.. Looks simple, easy to learn - but difficult to master. The game offers more choises as you progress + more difficult challanges. Also a daily challange online everyday with leaderboards.. A fantastic game that is engaging for all the family. Often described as minimal but with plenty to look at, this game has a two-player mode, many cities to create maps for, simple but very effective music that changes as you switch line colour, three challenge modes (normal - where station overcrowding ends the game, endless - which means you can keep extending the tube lines, and extreme - where tubelines are fixed once you build them!), and best scores to beat (200,300,500!) The surprise for us after 30' playing time was the inclusion of interchanges - making the sudden build up of passengers more avoidable. I have no idea what the trailer was trying to convey -- I nearly didn't buy it because of the high level of dancing on the underground -- but we loved it and highly recommend it!","mini metro is a puzzle game that is easy to pick up, easy to get frustrated with and very fulfilling when everything goes right . played - 35+ hours paid - £6.74 Score - 9/10 ."
"1,060.Tetris Party","Tetris Party is a fun game with addicting gameplay and shouldn't be missed cause how exciting and fun it is. This game also got a great sequel as well.. Tetris Party is classic Tetris, featuring several fun modes, but Marathon mode was too addicting and kept me from playing any of the other modes in the game.. It's hard to do Tetris wrong, and Tetris Party does a lot of things right. As the name implies, this edition of the classic puzzler is geared toward multiplayer, both local and online. Easy to pick up and play, even for the Tetris novice in your household. A handful of play options add decent solo replay value as well. One of the strongest WiiWare titles to date.. First, a warning to anyone who is interested in picking up a Tetris game: if you have a Wii and an internet connection, get this game instead of the Deluxe version. I haven't played Deluxe, but based on what I have gathered from multiple sources, the Deluxe version simply contains a few extras and is being sold for more than twice the price. Now, on to the review. Tetris Party is the most complete version of Tetris that I am aware of. Several different game modes are available aside from the standard marathon, all of which I find fun except for Stage Racer. The Shadow mode adds a whole lot of replay value due to its relatively high number of stages, and I know people who do not enjoy Tetris (shocker!) and were still massively entertained by Shadow. Co-op is a very logical multiplayer variant, but once more difficult levels are reached, chaos ensues. Not that chaos is a bad thing - hectic situations in Co-op have been some of my favorite moments playing Tetris party. The standard versus mode is intact, and users have the option to play with items on or leave them turned off. Note that ""garbage,"" the junk lines you send opponents with bigger line clears, cannot be turned off. Many Tetris beginners may find this to be a disappointment at first, but the reason this option was omitted should become clear rather quickly. Playing without garbage would lead to matches that last far too long, especially for anyone who has already been eliminated. Also, for people stuck with friends who are far more skilled at Tetris, a practice mode is available so that they can keep playing while their friends duke it out. Aside from the boring Stage Racer mode, the only con I can come up with is that the music is mostly bland. You are given the option to turn it off, however, so you can simply play music you prefer from a laptop or something like that. All in all, I think there is by far enough content and entertainment value in Tetris Party to make it well worth the $12 entry fee.. This a fairly good Tetris game, but definitely not the best in the series. The game Tetris itself is one of the best block puzzles ever. This game has the swap option, quick drop and the ability to rotate the piece for a while before dropping it. Although the main Tetris game is great the other modes are terrible such as the stupid stage racer. The multiplayer could have been ruined by items but, thank goodness, you can turn them off. The online mode works well but I as always crushed by other people. Also, the game gives you customizable chat options, but there only only about seven things you can choose to say. Tetris Party is a great Wii Ware game, but one of the worse in the Tetris series.","it's hard to do Tetris wrong, and this edition of the classic puzzler does a lot of things right . easy to pick up and play, even for the Tetris novice in your household . a handful of play options add decent solo replay value as well ."
"1,061.Resogun: Heroes","Adds two new modes for $5. It is more Resogun and if you don't like Resogun you aren't going to like these. Heroes's Demolition removes your gun and just has you bomb around pinballs which I didn't think worked. They added new enemies and art throughout these modes. Fun but not essential. The vanilla Resogun is much better than anything in this DLC.. A very good dlc. Both new modes are great fun and the new set of trophies will keep you busy. The only downside is that demolition can have moments where the pace can drop, but only briefly. The need to climb up the leader board is also retained, with new power ups to help.. Fantastic DLC for a great price. Demolition is such a great mode, i have played countless hours trying to get a decent spot on the leader board. survival is also great and the power ups are a nice addition.",adds two new modes for $5 . if you don't like Resogun you aren't going to like these . the vanilla Resogun is much better than anything in this dlc .
"1,062.Cadence of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda","The music is nice, but I found the gameplay to be boring and uninteresting.. An Rythm game with the best franchise of all Time: The Legend of Zelda?!? With the Iconic Themes from Koji Kondo reinterprated?!? A master idea. This game is awesome. Shut up and take my rupees. Fun, yes, but not my cup of tea. It feels like a watered-down Zelda experience, and as someone who's never played crypt, I don't think I will. I don't dislike the game, but I would have rather put my money towards something else.. Fun gameplay, catchy music, attractive graphics and enjoyable story, totally recomendable. Pretty much Crypt of the Necrodancer with a Zelda skin. The graphics have been given a fresh coat of paint and the sound consists of Zelda track of course. The big change is the slight increase in difficulty due to most levels being a lot more puzzle based than it's predecessor. My biggest criticism is that the start of the game you are spammed mercilessly with tutorial prompts. If you love love love Necrodancer and are a Zelda fan, then this should be a no brainer. But if this is your first taste of Necrodancer, then maybe jump into the original first.. this is an S tier game in my opinion. And it's my favorite zelda game. I'm not really a fan of zelda, but... this is a phenomenal game. Great spin on a classic franchise! This is a fairly short experience at about 5 hours. I am not usually in to rhythm games but the way the rhythm elements mixed with elements of action-adventure and rogue-like genres really had me hooked! The soundtrack is phenomenal: remixed classic Legend of Zelda tracks that really immerse you in the action. I found this to be unlike anything else I have played and highly recommend it for any Zelda fan, or anyone looking for a shorter but fun experience.. this was a nice find. this is a roguelike rhythm game. what i really liked about this game was really the music and it was quite fun fighting to the beat of it. Just bought the game for 40 euro. And i never played a game this short in my entire live of 27 year of gaming. It is a joke. The art style and the camera from above a way to far away to even see what is going on. I loved donkey kong jungle beat so i thought he why not try out this bad boy. It is really not for everyone. 3 Minutes into the game and im already bored to death. Watch out before you buy it. it looks way more fun then it is.. Outstanding idea, very good implementation, great music but I just couldn't get into it because of the rythm based movement. Will have to retry it at some point, maybe with the rythm turned off. Try the demo, see if you get into it. A lovely surprise. I'm a big Zelda fanboy and this game is not only a deserving tribute to the series, but an awesome experience by itself. The gameplay basically feels like it would be a 2D zelda focused on fights, and where you have to follow the rythm of the music to execute your actions. The first hour/2 hours can be a little painful, until you understand well how to follow the rythm, how to hide from your enemies and read their patterns (which is the central aspect of fighting). Beyond this the game starts to be really fun. The OST is absolutely godlike. Nothing less. If you've played a few Zelda games it will be an absolute delight to listen to the reorchestration of these already legendary themes. As an ALTTP fanboy, I was pleased to see that most of the themes come from this episode, and I had a crush on the Death Moutain theme. In the middle of this overall amazing soundtrack, only one disappointed me: the Hyrule Castle, which seems at times like inspired from the ALTTP version as well, but is otherwise really so far from it that I couldn't really enjoy it. The layout of the world tiles being generated randomly, you can enjoy redoing this game multiple times, especialy since you can get to try the different characters then. This is an ""open world"" in the sense that, apart from the latest part of the game, no step requires the prior acquisition of an item or a competence, so you're free to go where you want. The only little flaw I see in Cadence of Hyrule actually lies here: although you'll be able to acquire many objects symbolic of the Zelda series, none of them is indispensable. Consequently, many objects will end up being gimmicks that you'll use occasionally to fight the mobs in a different way, and will go back unused in your inventory after a while. I would have liked to have maybe less objects, but with more importance along the game. Otherwise, if you've ever liked any Zelda, just get this game, you won't regret it.. It's an average mess **** and should be 5-10usd... the art style lacks height perception, and they knew this because they needed to put yellow edged squares where you will jump down, because otherwise it's not clear if you can move another square or fall off certain cliffs. This alone makes it an 8 at best already. Now many areas just have tons of enemies, and for whatever reason they expect you to learn to toggle back and forth in place, when they could of implemented a jump in place mechanic for sitting still and maintaining beat. I like the music, but why does it have to play like DDR where you have to constantly choose a direction. The concept can certainly be improved upon, and probably should have been, instead of just cloning necrodancer with zelda skin and charging too much for it. Music is great, and it does play ok, but it for sure is not that satisfying.. Awesome soundtrack but frustrating gameplay. I'm not a fan of this rogue-like (or rogue-lite) gameplay.. I rarely buy game full price, but I absolutely did not regret with this one. Cadence of Hyrule is one of the best games, if not the best one, I played on the switch.. This game is so gorgeous! It reminds me of the 90s Zelda games in the best way. Sure, the focus doesnt lie in dungeon secrets but they are there. All in all it combines both genres/games really well and it is just fun to have a breath of fresh air to the whole Zelda franshise. I really do hope they bring a sequel (maybe with a greater world and more secrets) so we all can enjoy this gem again. If you read this and are looking for a nice game to spent some time in, look no further, it is worth every penny. Have great fun!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. At the beginning I was all like ""why do people like this game so much?"". Then it simply happens. It's adorable, fun to play.. I love how Nintendo was able to trust an indie developer to make a Zelda game, that won't happen again soon and it never happened before. Also the game was basically perfect, music, playability, graphics. Nothing bad to say about the game. I'm writing this review for anyone who was not into Crypt of the Necrodancer, but is still thinking about getting Cadence because they love Zelda and the franchise's music, and the reviews are great. DON'T DO IT. I was in the same position and asked other people for their opinion, which was pretty encouraging. They said it was much more accessible than Crypt, and, aside from the rhythm elements, just a damn good Zelda game on its own. Once again, listening to others instead of my own gut proved to be a mistake. Cadence is really just Crypt with a Zelda coat of paint, in terms of items, characters, enemies, overworld etc. And it's got the exact same issues as its predecessor: There's next to no tutorial and the learning curve is not so much a curve, but more of a brick wall. It starts out fair enough and pretty slow for a few screens, but then it's the exact same BS as with Crypt: You walk into a screen or a dungeon and ten different enemies come at you from all directions, and you're supposed to just figure out on your own what their attack patterns are and when you can attack them; and of course do it fast and without missing a beat. It's a really punishing experience and aside from the look, gameplay-wise, it hasn't got all that much to do with a regular Zelda game. I should also say that I don't dislike games just because they're hard. For example, I absolutely loved Furi. But Furi, even though it throws you basically right into action and the tutorial is brief, does a much better job of explaining its core mechanics and GRADUALLY raising the difficulty. In that game, I could always conceive of how to do things better the next time, if I died. I knew what to do in principal, I just didn't have the skill to execute it yet. I knew what my mistake was, what got me killed. With Cadence, oftentimes I've got absolutely NO clue what would have been the right thing to do. There's just so much confusion because nobody explains anything to you and things aren't clear enough by themselves, as with the enemy attack patterns. One enemy I encountered REALLY early on could kill me in two hits and had a hitting range of two squares. How tf am I supposed to figure out how to take care of this dude, if going anywhere near him is likely to get me killed, which means all my rupees and breakable items get taken away from me?? But he keeps following me all over the screen, and if I want to progress and get diamonds, I have to kill ALL the enemies on one screen. Noone ever tells you what your overall objective is in this game, either. It's basically just: Hyrule is in trouble. Go! Story presentation is dysmal/close to non-existent. Then there was an item at the fairy fountain just called ""Energy Depletion"". U-huh. And now I'm supposed to know from this awesomely descriptive name what this item does and if I wanna spend FIVE diamonds on it? Is it depleting MY energy? If yes, to what gain? Is it depleting my enemies' energy? It's unnecessarily confusing and, to be honest, it just seems lazy to me to not have accurate item descriptions. I'm also not really a fan of randomly generated worlds and dungeons in this case. While this system does give you something fresh every playthrough, it lacks the charme, atmosphere, and attention to detail that Zelda usually stands for. A lot of people seem to be forgiving of these flaws because it's an ""indie-game"". Well, I expect a bit better from a game that costs 25€ and carries the Legend of Zelda name. If Nintendo offered e-shop refunds, I'd probably get one for this. Alas, this is not the case, and I've spent 25 bucks on a game that will probably just collect digital dust in my Switch library.. Really fun game. If you like the zelda franchise it's a refreshing experience, and if you liked crypt of the necromancer, I think this game has great changes, though it might be too easy for you. I had tried Crypt of the Necrodancer before but it was way too hard for me, whereas this game was the right difficulty I think.. I bought this game because I loved Necrodancer. I think most people who wrote reviews for this game are content with anything ""Zelda"". Not me. This is no longer a roguelike dungeon crawler with amazing music, which was everything that was good about Necrodancer. The game is downright annoying, the music is just a plain mediocre remix of worn out Zelda tunes. The exploration fun is gone. The stages are zelda style screens, except they honestly not fun to play with. Necrodancer used to be an immersive DANCE. Now it's just a mind numbing ambient music that picks up the pace once in a while. I'm not feeling the groove! I just threw money down the drain on this one. And let me be very clear: I absolutely love the old Zelda hames. Do Not buy into the hype. Some things just don't mix well. Zelda's top down design is a contradiction to everything that made Necrodancer so engaging. Unless, of course, you're a Zelda fan, and will be pleased with any game that lets you play as Link. To me, that's just. Not. Enough. I do not get The Shivers just seeing Link on the screen or hearing the washed up old tune. I look for originality, or at least immersiveness, and I feel like I was too quick to buy this one. Downright silly of me. I just love videogames so much, I sometimes just believe the hype. I'm here to be, apparently the ONLY one to tell you: watch out. Overhyped. Not worth even 50% of it's price.. I loved this game as a Zelda fan. I switched between fixed beat mode on and off. Off for the dungeons and on for exploring. I ended up with 12133 hours played snd 63461 steps. I didnt exit out of the game so my hours were counted. I would say I played a total of 8 hrs. You’ll quickly forget it wasn’t made by Nintendo! Short game with a light story, but excellent gameplay. Replay value is high. Multiplayer is a massive plus!. Cadence of Hyrule is not just one of the best Zelda spin-offs, it is a great game by itself.. Great music, great gameplay, great dungeons and overworld. However short game for its price and limited replayability.. Liked the rhythm in the beginning, especially once I got better with it, but got a little tired of it by the end of the game. It is a good game overall, including a lot of Zelda elements and assumingly Crypt of the Necrodancer stuff, which I haven't played. The game looks very good and captures well the 16-bit era feeling, with well designed sprites. I found the map quite small for the large amount of ""hidden"" stuff it contained and the dungeons far too easy and short. Finding new permanent items became so normal that it was less and less exciting. Nothing I would have complained about for a $10-15 game, but for $25 I was expecting a little more on that side.. I may be a bit biased as a NecroDancer speedrunner, but this game is absolutely amazing. It's a bit on the shorter side, taking about 5 hours to complete the first run, but what gameplay Cadence offers is refined and chock full of life. The music is a banger (to be expected), and the art is such an improvement over NecroDancer that I find it jarring when I play NecroDancer again. What would make this game even more excellent would be more weapons (I like the vast selection of weapons in NecroDancer) and ability to replay bosses (as well as harder versions of bosses!) and more game modes, but the game is already great as it is. IMO it's completely worth the money.. crypt of the necro dancer is a great mix of a roguelite game with a nice simple combat system with even the most advanced of attacks being able to be performed by amateurs and then it is also mixed with a rhythm, game that has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard which can only be matched by soundtracks such as breath of the wild ocarina of time planet coaster an many more than mix that with zelda and you have what may debated the best indie game of the year so far.. Excellent game all around. Incredible soundtrack, endless gameplay, additive rewards system-- even if you don't like Crypt of the Necrodancer, you will love this. If you're not great at rhythm games, you can turn on fixed beat mode, and the game becomes a turn-based strategy RPG with killer tunes. Once you're done with the main story, the game unlocks new characters and abilities, and the whole map is randomized so you can play again afresh. Highly recommended!. Making a Zelda, rhythm game is so obvious and also combining it with a great Indie game was a great decision. This game has great music, fun game play, and an addictive play style. You wont regret picking it up.. Superb gameplay and music, i would say that playing as Zelda is the ""harder"" mode as you need stamina to defend and is kind of harder , the rogue-lite/like mechanics are great, the story mode is more of a roguelite where there is no permadeth, if you want a roguelike experience you can do it in a custom gameplay, create a seed, theres also a daily challenge.. Wife and I enjoy this game tremendously. Developers did great job capturing the zelda feel. Music is great. Wish it had more dungeons, but still great game nonetheless.. Absolutely stellar game. A wonderful upgrade to Crypt of the Necrodancer, and the most worthy Zelda spinoff game ever. On each new game, the world is generated to make each gameplay experience unique to the last. The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard in years, and the visuals, animations, and Zelda flair is so excellently implemented. I was glued to the screen for my whole 5-6 hour first playthrough. The difficulty has been toned down from the previous installment (Crypt of the Necrodancer), so that will help ease the fears that many had about the game being inaccessible.. Music has a way of captivating us. When a tune catches on, it stays with us for days. The same goes with Cadence of Hyrule. The moment it became available to download, I never stopped playing ‘till its most satisfying end. Cadence of Hyrule is an action adventure rhythm game that combines the gameplay of Crypt of the Necrodancer and The Legend of Zelda’s timeless overworld, specifically that of A Link to the Past. Combat takes centerstage here. Or in this case, combat takes the dance floor. The exchange of blows felt like the push and pull of a tango. The pivots and parries felt like the twist and turns of a waltz. It can get disorienting at first, but it’s easy to catch on. Not to mention, if you’re moving to the beat of these beautiful remixes, occasional deaths becomes the least of your worries. The music is truly to die for. It took the epic runs of the Hyrule theme and turned it into a rave. And whenever you wipe out all enemies on screen, the music winds down to a soft hum as well. Even boss battles changed the texture of the sound. For example, if a boss was carrying a xylophone, you’d hear a little clink and clank in battle. The game makes use of a ton of fan service. Many Zelda fans will spot familiar elements from the classics. However, everything is a pocket sized version of the original. Villages are not as expansive. Dungeons aren’t as complex. Everything is simplified to make room for the rhythm battle gameplay. This sacrifices the usual breadth of a Zelda game. I finished and completed every single thing I can in only 20 hours. Speedrunners are finishing the game in even less than 2. Dungeons are procedurally generated though. It’ll not look the same every time you come back in. The overworld is also created at random to a certain degree. No two runthroughs will look the same. This make room for some level of replayability and surpise every time. The first ever indie Zelda game is a stroke of genius. It shows Nintendo’s willingness to collaborate and open up their most beloved properties with even more creative minds. This move not only diversifies their franchise but makes them flexible and immortal.. Fantastic game. Cracking soundtrack. Zelda and necrodancer mixed perfectly!!. This is a mix between Zelda and Crypt of the Necrodancer, so i rate it as this. Art: 10 - Because it fully fits as a Zelda Game and looks like SNES Zelda with Necrodancer touch. Music: Outstanding remixes from different Zelda games with Crypt of Nacrodancer style which also fits 100% into the game. Gameplay: As a rythm game you move with you guess it: The Rhythm like in Crypt of the necrodancer AND have to fight enemies, bosses, collect items and solve some puzzles. So also 100% fits into a mix of both games. Longplayability: You play through pretty fast the first game, but like in Crypt of the necrodancer, world seeds are different every playthrough, there are speedrun scores, step scores, hardcore mode, and an insane double speed mode. Get bored alone, play with a friend! For 25€this is a lot in my opinion. Learning curve: Hard like in Crypt of the Necrodancer but after around 30 min kicked into the hylian graves, you get used to it. Also, after dying, you can spend your diamonds to upgrade yourself too. This helps a lot! For absolute beginners there is a mode without having to be on beat but this game is a rythm game and this makes the mechanics pointless. Nice to have for younger adventurers tho! Does this all fit into a mashup too? Yes, you get used to the beat and mechanics so 100% Co-OP: You can join anytime and switch between 3 characters. It's a lot of fun and helps a lot to play together. We even sometimes blocked movable stones while the other was puching it to get up a hill or see more together ""There is a wall to bomb up!"" and stuff like this! Fits also 100% into this type of game. Funmeter: Still playing, having songs in our head when going asleep, brother plays it all day OH WAIT! We play it all day. ... Thats what i want from a game. i purely enjoy it! Looking through it for negatives ... I don't know where to substract a full 1? Too short? But i can play again and for speedruns and on other modes. To hard? First 30 min but now and help at death is great! ... no, so this falls too. So i have to keep it like that.. 100% worth the price. Wonderfull soundtrack. Cadence of Hyrule is really fun.. Easily the best Switch game of the year. Simply amazing game blending the innovative gameplay of NecroDancer with all the lovable aspects of The Legend of Zelda. I have seen no collaboration to date done so well. The music is unquestionably amazing, the graphics are some of the best sprites I've seen in ages, the varying challenge levels are great for any kind of player, and the simple but surprisingly interesting story elements are hidden within the dialogue. Exploring the overworld is a lot of fun, and going through the dungeons and fighting a ton of enemies and bosses is extremely entertaining. One of the only games worth playing again and again.. Fantastic game with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard! Only took a couple minutes to get used to the rhythm mechanic and it's absolutely delightful. The bosses are super fun and the combat is terrific. My only gripe with the game is that there's a lack of usefullness in the weapons such as the flail, short sword and long sword. Most of the game I just stuck with the spear and broadsword. I also wished that there were more Zelda like puzzles in the game, other than that if your a Zelda fan such as I and I love the music this game should be an automatic pickup on the switch and I'm sure you'll have tons of fun with it!. Brace Yourself Games has done an amazing job taking care of these Zelda characters that we all love so much. There is so much attention to detail and if I didn't know better I would've thought Nintendo just made this spin off game themselves. But this is not a 10/10 game and I don't really understand how people can put it on that level among other masterpieces like Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time. It's a perfectly fine game and it does what it's supposed to do pretty good but in the long run it's nothing special. The gameplay is something that can take some time to get used to but when you do it feels really fluid. The only problem I have with it is that it's only hard for the first hour or so. When you get some hearts and better weapons the challenge kinda fades away and the end of the game is really easy. I died a total of 13 times during my 7 hour run and 10 of those were during the first two hours. The only other complaint I have is the pricing. It's a Zelda game and people will pay for that but that isn't an excuse for it costing 25$ with 8 hours of gameplay (if you 100% complete it). I want to play more but there just isn't anything else to do. Good game, not a masterpiece though.. Wow, wow, just wow! This is a FULL original Zelda game. Without a doubt. This is a rhythm game. And it's a wonderful challenging game! And the music, oh boy, that great music! Just buy this now (and, if it's still on sale, STEAL the original for $3.99. Though play the ""easier"" Hyrule version first!) (and those PRAISING the game though complaining about a 10 hour game being $24.99, what is wrong with you? U spend that much for a dumb 2 hour movie and popcorn. When you beat this game, there is a ton more content to do and replay at greater challenging levels to give you 30 hours of play) And, I truly want to attack this DUMB 1/10 review below, because, the person is simply lying so many times. He says: The level design,music and graphics are great. (So you give it a 1/10 even though you say these are great? SMH) The map has that Zelda feel to it. (lol) The enemies feel like they belong in a zelda game. (ok, and??) Problem is the playability of the game rivals that of StarFox Zero. (STZ is pretty darn good) Players are forced to move and attack only when the rythm allows them to. (you are lying. You are not forced to do this. You can drop bombs, move away, go in another area, just a bad lying comment) You have no clue when enemies will attack. (are you kidding me? That is part of the joy of the game! You have many clues on how creatures move. And when they will attack, like holding up there hands! Stop lying) Forcing the player to guess and take damage. (another lie. there is no guessing in this game. You see the pattern of an enemy, you move to the beat to find a space to get in your attack. ) Waiting to move and attack only when the rythm allows makes the gameplay feel slow and restricting. (lol. It's quite the opposite. It makes u make fast decisions and blast through some areas at a breakneck speed. See Youtube for Speed Runners who have defeated this game in under 40 minutes then come back and apologize for you lie) With the rythm mechanic their is literally only one way to play this game. (and yet another horrible use of the word LITERALLY. Literally means this is fact. Which is not. It's a lie. There is many different ways to attack. To explore. To mix and match weapons. smh) There is no freedom for the player and basically turns the game into a on rail experience. (lol. This is too a lie. ON RAILS means the game forces you to go down a set path. I would dare say that there is over 1,000 different paths one can use to beat this game. Especially as each overworld and dungeons are randomized. Change that number from 1,000 to 1,000,000. People like this Reviewer987 need to be banned from posting reviews that prove they lie and never really played the game. if you love crypt, like i do, play thios game on permadeath, random char and maybe double tempo. Cadence of hyrule became insanely good for rogue like lovers. Each run is different, there isn't any progression between run but the amount of item you have to randomly choose from feel exactly like any rogue like game.. Cadence of Hyrule is a fun spin on the Zelda series, mixing the rhythm style of Crypt of the Necrodancer with the Intellectual Property of Zelda makes for an enjoyable experience that everyone shouldn't miss! At an astonishingly low price of $24.99 USD, anyone can enjoy it! I've been playing for at least 3 hours and I don't think I will stop anytime soon. Shoutout to Antoine Lendrevie for having his dream come true being credited in a Zelda game!. Cadence of Hyrule brings to Switch players a lot of the retro charm of the forefathers of the Legend of Zelda franchise and tugs at one's nostalgia heartstrings in the most endearing ways, while at the same time bringing the renowned gameplay of Crypt of the Necrodancer into it. Not only is the game thoroughly challenging for those unused to rhythm games or even roguelike games, but it also has high replayability thanks to the fact that it's a brand-new layout for the world and dungeons every time you start a new playthrough (thanks to procedural generation). Also, thanks to a feature found in the 'Options' section of the menu, players have the ability to turn off the rhythm limits, meaning that the enemies will only move when you move...that way, you can focus more on the gameplay and less on keeping beat with the rhythm (which can get extremely hectic in later parts of the game). The story is not too convoluted, and is quite simplistic (which works as both a plus and a negative depending on who you ask). I would say my greatest gripe with this game (and the only reason it doesn't get a 10/10 from me) is the difficulty I mentioned earlier. The game has a VERY steep learning curve, and doesn't pull any punches. From the moment you leave the tutorial dungeon and step out into Hyrule at large, the enemies come at you in droves, bent on your destruction. All in all, while the difficulty of the game may turn some people off, if they can find the enjoyment in the challenge, this game truly shows itself for being one of the best 'side' Zelda games, as well as a thoroughly addicting and excellent second chapter in the Crypt of the Necrodancer series.. One of the most refreshing new games I've played in a long time. Blends the Zelda aesthetic with a wholly unique style of gameplay. Well worth the price. Completely killed my weekend. Amazing game, basically a LTTP randomizer with sick beats. i played and beat it in one 5 hour sitting, and then saw the high score at 30 minuets, and knew this was going to be a great game to replay. and then, i called up my brother and we sat down and beat it in 3 hours. great game with great replay ability. I love it to bits. Best Indie so far in 2019. Presentation. 9/10 Graphics TV & Handheld. 8.5/10 Music. 10/10 Controls. 9.7/10 Fun-factor. 9.3/10 Score. 9.4/10. The level design,music and graphics are great. The map has that Zelda feel to it. The enemies feel like they belong in a zelda game. Problem is the playability of the game rivals that of StarFox Zero. Players are forced to move and attack only when the rythm allows them to. You have no clue when enemies will attack. Forcing the player to guess and take damage. Waiting to move and attack only when the rythm allows makes the gameplay feel slow and restricting. With the rythm mechanic their is literally only one way to play this game. There is no freedom for the player and basically turns the game into a on rail experience.. What an absolute hidden gem. I was initially hesitant on purchasing this game as I haven't be too into rhythm games in the past. Oh boy am I glad I decided to pick this up. Easily one of the best titles for the switch, and personally for me one of the better games of the year so far. There is lots of Zelda in the game design and the added rhythm mechanics are simply a blast. The music is phenomenal as well of course. For 25 bucks I absolutely would not hesitate on picking this up.. An unique add to the already great crypt of the necrodancer. A must have on the switch. This is the pairing I never knew I needed, but am thrilled exists. On paper you wouldn't think these two game types would work together but the developers have proven they know EXACTLY what they are doing and Nintendo was right to trust them with the Zelda brand. The biggest gripe I have against the game is that it's a tad too difficult for those who are, let's set, not rhythmically inclined. Still, a wonderful title and worthy of your time and money.. Do You want a new The Legend of Zelda Game? Do you want actual epic music? Well, then you most probably want this game ;D (It's hard though). A perfect blend of what made Crypt and classic Zelda games so special. I am in love with this game. It's also great for couch co-op with a friend.. It's hard to believe that a Zelda action adventure / rhythm game could actually work, but it gets the best of both worlds, with an amazing soundtrack, beautiful art style and great gameplay there is so much to love about this game. They took the time and consideration to implement all the classic Zelda items (as well as some new ones) into a beat music system and actually made them work in fun ways. I got to say I wasn't expecting this kind of quality and depth when I got this game but ohhh was I wrong. This game is amazing and I hope it helps Nintendo realize that Indy Developers have some cool concepts and ideas that can mix really well with their IP's.. If you like Crypt of the Necrodancer and Zelda, this is 100% must get. It's a brilliant game.. This is definitely a game made for people who played Necrodancer and wished it had a story mode, or a hook for people who like Zelda, because it has enough polish and rhythm fighting that both groups would leave satisfied. It's a ","fun, yes, but not my cup of tea . graphics have been given a fresh coat of paint and the sound consists of Zelda track . the start of the game you are spammed mercilessly with tutorial prompts ."
"1,063.Monster Hunter Generations","GAME PLAY TRASH AND DUMPERSTER DOO DOO GRAPHICS ATTOCIOUS THE ONLU THING EXOTIC ABOUT THIS GAME IS HOW PEOPLE LIKE IT YEAH ETHAN IM TALKING TO U! AND YOU TOO JOSHUA! THIS GAME WAS A WASTE OF MY 20$. The best way i can describe this game is ""average"". This spin-off game is supposed to be a celebrations of the MonsterHunter series, so it will contain a lot of popular references to past games that won't be fully appreciated by new players. There are a lot more monsters to fight, both older fan favorites and new ones, more gear to craft and plenty of quests to complete. There is A LOT of text to read so it can be obnoxious to go through. The newest feature are the hunting styles and arts that let you customize your hunting experience, although in my experience it can sometimes trivialize the game and make it a lot less challenging than past games. Another new addition to the game are Deviant Monsters that are basically more difficult versions of some species of monsters and offer unique equipment to craft. The graphics are definitely no the best, even compared to older 3DS titles, so don't expect to be visually impressed. If you are a big fan of the series i would recommend you give it a try, but if you are a new comer to the series, I recommend to skip this game.. One of the best MH games. They played with new mechanics that can be hit or miss even for veterans. But watch youtubers, get a MH babysitter, and one you get it you'll love it. I had to babysit my husband and now he's just as excited about new releases as I am.. An amazing step in the monster Hunter franchise, taking everything already established, and adding alot more. With literal thousands of combinations, no two hunts are the same. It's a must play.. I didn't really get much entertainment value out of this game despite spending 40 hours on it, I really wanted to like it but it requires oodles of time I felt I could be spending on more enjoyable games. Its more action with minimal RPG elements. I liked upgrading my equipment and stuff but to even kill another monster after your first (Which takes significant time for a first boss on its own) requires a lot of grinding and is pretty difficult. Fighting the monsters themselves is a slog and you have to hit, hit, hit, throw a paintball to track it and try and follow it as quickly as possible when it inevitably runs into the other area. The game is incredibly difficult and needlessly time consuming. I've noticed this game is very highly rated everywhere I looked which makes me think it serves it's niche well but the learning curve is just way too high. I still occasionally pop in the game to give it another shot or try and get something out of it but it turns out to be a waste of time It has non existent story and the mechanics are not explained very well. There are multiple locations you can get quests from but these are basically just cosmetic as you can access the same quests anywhere and all locations have a blacksmith, a vendor, a home for you and a palico shop and nothing unique to that area. I personally liked the game. This is my first MH game, and it does not disappoint. It is a solid game; the controls work well, the visuals are solid, and the soundtrack is very nice. It definitely suits the 3DS well, as it is very easy to pick up and play, as the in-game manuals are very helpful. Out of all things, the only thing I have issue with is that the menus are a bit difficult, but overall it is a solid game.. MHG is obviously a spinoff game. It contains too many monsters, quests and weapons for it's own good. The game can feel overbearing at times with so much to do with little incentive besides for fans of the series who just want to hunt. For me personally I felt that it was a great place to train and learn monster's move sets and attack patterns before playing MH4U or 3U as I would then have practice fighting the monster for fun without the stress of losing zenny and being unable to accept a quest to progress the story of the game. A way I thought about this game was that each quest was a story, I would always read the quest description and try and think how the events described there happened without the client losing their lives in the process. All in all I loved this game but for newcomers to MH I would recommend Monster Hunter World or Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.. Pros: Nice graphics. Interesting weapons. Multiple control schemes (styles). Cons: The controls feel unresponsive. Some of the weapons have very long attack animations and it doesn't make sense to be unable to cancel such an attack after it has started. And to compensate for the bad control scheme most monsters spend most of their time flailing around without any purpose and screaming in order to give you time to position yourself for a proper attack. The fights just feel fake and staged most of the time. The game doesn't explain a lot of things to you. If this is supposed to increase immersion then it fails miserably when you have to leave the game and look up where you can find that material that you've never heard of before. There is no reason not to have some markers and more helpful quest descriptions like a bunch of other way more immersive games like the Elder Scroll series etc have. The world looks really nice at first but then you see all the invisible walls which make it feel more like an arena for fighting and not something that you enjoy exploring to find stuff. I tried local multiplayer with a friend and it did not affect any of the above. All in all, this is the greatest waste of potential I've seen in the 3DS. I really don't even understand how people enjoy this sluggish grindy thing but each to his own taste I guess.. Prime Monster Hunter gameplay, varied monsters and quests to do. Solid entry overall, a must-have to fans of the franchise.. My favourite MH handheld entry. So many quests and events, a great choice of towns and environments, great crafting system and palico management. Everything that I wanted out of a Monster Hunter. Takes a while to get used to the controls, but once you find your weapon, you're going to have a great time. Highly recommended for fans of the series.. A great addition to the series! As a veteran player, I was expecting a slight upgrade from 4U, and that is basically what this is. Obviously I did not get nearly the playtime I did out of 4U, but cross introduces some new refreshing mechanics that I believe enhance gameplay and make things feel more fluid. I just wish there was village high rank and G rank ... hyper monsters are fun though.. So far, every addition to the MH series gets 10/10 for me. MH series is always the reason I buy any platforms (Wii, WiiU, Multiple 3DS XLs for siblings, Nintendo Switch, PC). The series as a whole is always continuing forward, and I can feel that the devs poured a lot of effort in making each one of the entry in the series. Thank you, Capcom.. Monster Hunter Generations is EXACTLY what I hoped it would be. It is a culmination of all of the previous games with the largest pool of content to date. The only con I can think of is that the graphics don't seem as great as MH4U or MH3U.. MH4U is one of my favorite games of all time, the sheer amount of content and game-play available is staggering. MHGen is a flashier MH4U, while it lacks G rank and some of the early fetch/gathering quests hurts it a little bit, it ends up being more of what I love about Monster Hunter. I love the extra particle effects and the hunting styles adds more depth to the weapons, I personally prefer Monster Hunter Generations over MH4U but I can understand why some prefer MH4U, the frame rate is locked at 30fps while this is not an issue with me some are not too pleased. MHGen is an incredible game with an incredible amount of content, it is hard to say which is the better game when compared to MH4U but MHGen is worth trying that's for sure.. This is the polar opposite of shallow gameplay, this may be the deepest 3DS game you will ever play. There are hundreds of hours of game play to be enjoyed here. This game is very well executed and such a treat for anyone willing to put the time into truly learning the fundamentals of the game. It could be a gripe that some systems are overly complex as they keep adding layers over the years and there are almost too many ways to access the same functionality. But lets be realistic, no game is ever perfect for everyone. I personally find the complexity fun and rewarding to explore. You can play this game in so many ways. If you are relaxed you can just collect items and learn new weapons. If you want to be alone you can play solo. If you want to play multiplayer and go all out and fight the biggest monster, have at it. This game should also be noticed for its amazing AI and monster behavior. This version of Monster Hunter also takes creative risks, which is rare these days. The addition of playing as a cat is amazingly ridiculous, but awesomely fun. If I had to be critical, the only negative things I have to say about this game is that it is mostly devoid of story relative to other Monster Hunter games and some of the levels from other Monster Hunters were better in the other games. I guess I also don't understand what going to other towns really gets you in this game, it could be just one and would be the same. But its classic Monster Hunter awesomeness and as always very rewarding to play with your friends over and over.. As a huge Monster Hunter fan I have to say, that MH4U and this game are overrated. Unfortunatly Capcom dicided to release them exklusivly on the 3DS systems and not on WiiU. I spend 300h MH3U and loved it. However, Playing Monster Hunter on 3dsXL without a second circlepad is just painful to play. If you own a 3DS or 2DS then you are simply out of luck, because the 2ds does not have a circlepad pro at all while the 3dsXL circlepad pro costs around 40$ and is only aviably in japan. Dont buy this game and support capcom with their disicion to exclusivly bring this game to the 3ds. It should have been on the WiiU aswell, like MH3U was. Dont waste your money, because this game is simply unplayable on a handheld without a second analog stick.. A awesome acquisition for players new to the series, if you're veteran maybe this game isn't for you, as there is, slights changes to previous. This game is a crossover between the other series with adds on gameplay, that now have 4 styles and new hunter arts; You can play as a palico, there is a awesome content from all previous MH games plus more new monsters, that now fit the four elements of series: water = Mizutsune, fire = Glavenus, thunder = Astalos and ice = Gammoth. The gameplay as said before, has now 4 styles that improve experience on every way. From now, I've used only 3 Weapons and 1 of the 4 hunter Styles and I fell like I can do a lot more on the game if I want; the liberty to change is incredible and every weapon, style, hunter art, have a huge impact on your playstyle and consequentially on hunts. Other add is the possibility of playing as a palico (prowler) a funny experience. If you're looking for graphics that's not you game, the graphs are stuck as last releases appearance, not many chances here, but this game is a crossover of the series so I've not downgraded my score because of it. MhGen is most about gameplay, as a crossover, there is not many history, the history, the other series have more to offer on history itself but overall MH is more oriented on hunt than history. Because of format of the game I've not dowgraded my final score. The soundtrack uses elements of previous ones and are nicely engaging and turns battles addictive, some monsters have they own sountracks battle themes, I recommend to buyer beating Amatsu and relate the experience, the soundtrack fit awesomely. The DLC quest and Multiplayer are fun and rewarding, hunt online make a whole new experience and it's a must if you buy this game. The community on reedit and gamefaqs have all nice players, the whole MH community is cool and not toxic, one of the reason I love the series. DLC armors are good and pretty, bad thing that transmog isn't avaliable, so you can't use the visual you love the most. Graphic = 8/10 Story = 6/10 Soundtrack = 10/10 Gameplay = 11/10 Community = 9/10 Total Score 10, It's a masterpiece. If you're veteran you can stick to MHGen to try the new gameplay changes, otherwise you can stick with the other titles with no problem, the experiênce is almost the same.. the game is horrible hate the gameplay and expected it to be RPG style don't get if you hate adventure battle games unlike cod and and other fps and I got this for a test I don't even use my 3ds anymore so why dad so the game I hate a lot so please do not get this game. Monster hunter is a series that does not give two **** about your skill level. It is long, hard, frustrating, and at times, unfair. And that's this game's selling point, aside from the massive number of armor and weapons to craft from the massive number of tough-ass monsters you can hunt. Though this game in particular is somewhat lacking, there is an upcoming expansion to add at least another 100 hours of gameplay. These games have consumed hundreds of my free hours, and sevenfold of that ammount in my tears of rage from **** so hard at it. If you like challenging, deep, and immersive gameplay- give it a nice big try. If you have half decent taste, you'llfall in love like I did.. i love this game so much, best monster hunter series. finally every hunter can use skill and jump graphic same as MH4U but i dont care about this good story and a lot of offline quest but we stuck in HR7 not G-Rank reappears monster from MH2-MH4 and new monsters n evolution. Generations adds new Hunter Styles, Arts, improved/additional skills and a mix of some of the best Monsters of all time to create one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series yet! Ever since the original games, every weapon has had relatively the same style of fighting. However with the new “Art Styles”, combat sees some new, dynamic play-styles. Aerial style, much like the bug staff, allows you to launch on top of monsters and topple them with ease. Striker is focused on all-out attacking and faster charging of Arts and Adept is all about swift evades and devastating counterattacks. Of course there’s still the old standard “Guild” style which is the only one that doesn’t augment your moves in favor of new mechanics. Each new style, for any weapon, was a bit hard to learn but once you settled into it, the combat felt refreshed. The option to fluidly swap styles between fights was important, allowing you to change up your technique vs different monsters. Some monsters telegraph their moves often, opening them up to counter-attack opportunities while others are big, stationary brutes, making it much more efficient to attack aerially. Alongside the new Styles are Hunter Arts, which are basically super-moves based off your weapon choice. As an example, the Long Sword has a move called Sakura Slash which after a short jump back, your character will unleash two sweeping slashes and upon hitting the monster, will raise your spirit gauge one level and unleash a series of after-image cuts like an early Japanese anime. Unfortunately, there’s not all that much diversity in the Hunter Arts with only about 3 different moves but it’s a step in the right direction. Maybe in the next entry… Armor and weapon skills saw a huge upgrade as well, giving even more depth to the play-styles with completely new combinations. As an Aerial Long Sword player, I would sometime use a combination of Mounting, Evasion and the new skill Vault so that I could topple monsters faster, position myself better with evades and deal more damage while going for the dunk. They even added “Village Skills” which were a combination of things like “Ice Resist + Sharpener” or “Fire Resist + Gluttony”. It made experimenting with different styles and skills all the more fun. I could go on for days on how the styles and Arts has changed up the combat but I feel like the lineup of boss monsters needs to get some solid praise as well. Generations brings in all of the staple classics like the Zinogre, Rathian, Rathalos and Tigrex; but it also adds new awesome fights like the new “starting” monster, the Great Maccao which is a jumping raptor similar to the Velocidrome. There’s also the games flagmonster-hunter-picship monster, the Glavenus, which I can only explain as a more rampagey Deviljho with a razor-sharp blade for a tail that it ignites just so it can set you on fire to add insult to injury. Oh also, it also enjoys whipping it’s flaming tail around to send huge waves of flames directly at you. It’s an intense, but fun fight. On top of that, certain classic monsters like the Lagiacrus from 3U have gained new moves and patterns, making the fights you might’ve remember completely fresh. There are so many Elder Dragons in the late game it’s unreal. I don’t want to give any surprises away but just know that your time is well rewarded if you can make it up to the higher ranked fights with some of these beasts. Capcom really did listen to their player community again by trying to implement some more Quality of Life improvements, like being able to cook multiple meats at the town rather than the horribly painful process of previous games where you would have to cook one at a time out in the field. Oh my god, it was painful and I never want to go back. However, on the other side, with so many different systems to manage between quests, I still noticed that familiar mini-game fatigue. Between, running a farm, maintaining a Palico Army, grindy quests and regular village upkeep, it became much-more tedious than it should’ve been. Overall: 8/10 + Diverse New Monsters/Tons of Old Favorites/Revamped AI + New Arts and Skills Keep the Combat Fresh + Palico Hunter + Quality of Life Improvements + Multiplayer!!! - Slow Start - Grinding Quests Recommend for: Anyone looking for challenging but rewarding boss fights with huge Dragons, solo or cooperatively with friends. Ol’ WoW raiders and fans of Shadow of Colossus.. As someone who cut their teeth on the 3DS version of MH3U, then sunk over 300 hours into MH4U, I consider this game a mild upgrade at best. While I do like the fact that the story starts with a little better pacing than the last game, with all of the tiny, wingless wyverns and such as early punching bags to prepare you for the giant monstrosities that come later, the pacing gets a little weirder later on when certain monsters that weren't really seen as a big deal in earlier games suddenly get built up as some sort of grand ordeal like that of the legendary dragons in MH4U. I also have mixed feelings about the overhauled combat. The hunter arts rock, no question about it. However, some arts clearly got the short end of the stick. It's fantastic that some styles can have 2 special moves bound to them, but the tiles for the touch screen can fit one or three arts, resulting it an open slot taking up space should you chose the three-ability tile. These are fairly trivial matters, though, and I'll probably end up losing few hundred hours of my life to this game regardless. Good stuff.. Greatly overrated. Monster hunter is only good if you are a kid with tons of free time and have a close circle of friends to play multiplayer with. Otherwise, there is nothing of value here. As a single player experience, this is a boring grind with no story. There is no real challenge, you don't need to be smart to win, just have a lot of time in your hands to grind and gather stuff. The graphics are meh and the controls on the 3DS are total garbage without the add on. All in all, totally overrated. Get this if you are a japanese fanboy and don't know any better about good western games, otherwise, skip it.. Albeit it feels a bit less of a complete game than 4u (the story is definitely lacking and i miss the animated cutscenes for the various monsters) it brings the game in a fresh new direction. I can't possibly imagine going back to hunt without the various styles and arts. Love it!. I put in 100 hours in MH4U in a year of play. I was very reluctant to pick up MHG because I thought it would be roughly more of the same and I would be burnt out on MH. This is not the case at all--100%. This game is very fresh. As everyone has said the styles and hunting arts has made this game feel very different. Why do the styles and arts matter? Well, the styles matter--the arts are just like special moves. The arts make every weapon have a different way of playing. In MH4U I really only used the insect glave. I wanted to use the hammer but found it clunky. Now, I am rocking the hammer because the styles (and some arts that make you mobile) allow me to play the way I like to play. I am having fun trying out each weapon on the varied lineup of monsters. I never really used the lance, gunlance and hammer. Now I am really enjoying these. But like with MH4U (the only other MH I played), the game takes time to learn and a few hours to get to the actually big game hunting. Fetch quests in the begining are just tutorial like quests. Get to at least HR 3 and you will have fun. Great game and worth the money. Enjoy!. Hunter arts ruined this anniversary game hopefully it doesn't come back in 5. Game was always about simple dodges with unforgiving iframes and simple attacks you need to time and position for. Now is dynasty warriors mode where you get evade +2 just for going adept style and everyone else just flies all over the place with aerial style. 3U > 4U > G. Still a good game though. OK as someone who played most of MH3U (never finished completely as I hated the underwater battles) and then put 200+ hours into MH4U (yeah finished the key quests, and it was fun!), I must say MHG is a step up in fun! For people who have played any of the previous few MH games, MHG will immediately feel familiar given the 100s of hours of training the hands to hunt monsters on the 3DS! So I didn't find issue in the seemingly slow starting couple of hours (and this is important for the benefit of newer players) - because I knew what was coming was going to be fun. And fun it is! I'm about 40 hours into it, and all the fun elements from MH4U are there - but it's the additional stuff that makes MHG the superior one, and I'll name a few: + Hold A button to keep gathering (in the previous installments, you have to keep tapping A, getting RSI) + Hunter Arts is a fun additional moves that builds up a gauge over time to execute a strong move + Hunter Styles mean no matter what weapon you have, you can jump over monsters! (no longer need to envy those fun jumping Insect Glaive hunters!) + Play as a Palico - yeah the cat! As a cat, you have 9 lives instead of 3, you have unlimited stamina, etc... so fun...! If you've played any MH in the past, you'll just slip comfortably back into it. If you're new to MH, this is as good a time to join in the fun (plow through the first couple of hours, and the world will open up!). And of course, the best aspect to this game is being able to hunt some of those monsters with 3 other hunters! Love it and highly recommended!. MHG is a worthy addition to the series, but ultimately is a 'popcorn' game. A lot of fun to be had and it makes various improvements, yet falls down in many areas. I can't quite figure out what they were going for, the game seems aimed at people new to the series, yet lacks the narrative & progression of MH4U to drag people in. The nostalgia factor seems to be aimed at series veterans and yet they have nerfed the general difficulty, to the point where much of the earlier game feels like a chore due to the lack of challenge. Why the haven't included a difficulty setting if this the direction they want to head in is beyond me. If you are looking for a less time consuming and 'grindy' addition to the series then this is the game for you. If you're looking for a challenge and storyline is important to you then, as a newcomer I would recommend looking into MH4U first. Overall it's a more polished and fulfilling game.. The new combat styles, ultimate moves, prowler mode, improved graphics, and monsters make this game a refreshing ans highly enjoyable entry. However, playing it on a old 3DS is not exactly ideal.. A great love letter to long time fans of monster hunter and a decent starting point for new players alike. Monster hunter generations tries to bridge the gap of previous monster hunter games bringing old villages and monsters into the current generation of monster hunter with improved hit boxes and a much more fluid movement system. good game all around. highly recommend if you like 3rd person adventure games. Monster hunter is one of the most successful franchises for a reason. It is classic storytelling, no dialogue required. You, the hunter, must face your challenge, the monster, and overcome. There is no greater tale, there's only the friends you bring with you, be them the Palico warriors, which are certainly not useless if you have even a small degree of skill. Or your fellow hunters. This title, as compared to prior ones, allows for a greater degree of freedom of play, along with style. You don't feel pigeonholed into a single weapon or armor set (or a small few) like previously found, and you can fight a pantheon of great beasts from titles often to small to remember. A true masterpeice of the series if ever there was one. The only way they could have made it better, was give the capacity to play it on a sterling high end PC to see the environments and beasts in grand luster. This will be the portable game you play with friends at your lunch hour, and the game that you'll play at night over and over again like when great portable games came out when you were a kid. Pick up MHX, you won't regret it.. Honestly, this game is an insult to anyone who is a fan of the series. Far too easy, weapon upgrading has been unnecessarily complicated, palicos are all but useless and the Hunter skills/arts are pointless and clunky... It has a few good points such as the roster, Prowler mode for a change of perspective and nice graphics but outside of that... its the worst game in the MH series. I keep playing it **** by sometimes i mean rarely. Every time I do, it pisses me off more. there is no challenge to this game at all. And the weapon upgrade system is worse then I thought it was. It gimps your weapon until you can level it up. Every time i play this game, my score of it goes down.... This game packs an insane amount of content. You're going to $40 and get well over 100 hours of game play if you do the online. The game play is fun and interesting. The developer does events and is creating more free DLC. What is not to love about this game?!?!. The whole thing feels and looks a bit... unfinished. The visuals are less polished than previous entries. I'm guessing they chucked some graphical content in order to try to beef out the monster roster and include all of the different starting towns. Unfortunately, many of the small monsters are very similar and I'm not certain there's actually a point to the different towns other than getting to choose which you want to use as a ""main base"", which just means you go there for everything. Game play is good and solid as ever. Hunter Arts are interesting and add a neat twist to things, but not enough to justify the thrown together nature of the rest of the game. Overall, if you're new to the series, pick up an old copy of Monster Hunter 3 or 4 and give a pass on this. If you're a veteran, this is nice because its largely more of the same, but you're probably also still fine sticking with a previous generation too.. -An honest trial: Monster hunter is one of the best games ever, but this ""Generations"" might not be their best title. I still love it but I have to rant about many things. The 40 bucks you throw into this one is more like a subscription fee to keep up with Capcom's latest efforts. I might venture to say that this is like a patch for MH4U. More work is done with smoothness of the game rather than introducing new things, such as resource gathering is now HOLD A rather than SMASH A continuously, monster and weapon hitboxs are reconsidered, weapons are reworked and balanced. -Lack of innovation: There is however, and many have pointed this out, a huge lack of content: Mostly lack of G and monsters and weapons and everything that one would expect from a new monster hunter game. Capcom spends way too much time paying tribute to previous games (or is this laziness?). No one wants repetitive gameplay, and MHG shows that it is repetitive everywhere (monsters, weapons, movesets, armor) and ... slowly eats away at a player's patience. -With things they fixed, with others they also broke: The hunter arts is supposed to be the magnum opus of this title, I have contradictory feelings towards it. While having the ability to cast skills seems to make monster hunting interesting, I'm not so sure about Air-Style being accessible to all weapon classes. Graphics-wise is another hit or miss: When I played the demo I thought they skimped on map details in order to minimize file size, well guess what it looks just as bad in the real game. They might as well draw a green circle on the floor and put me in there with a rathalos. I'm unsure of the reasons of the graphics nerf but probably due to 3DS limitations and the added hunter arts effects. I have never had problems with immersiveness in previous titles due to bad graphics, but somehow it got to me this time, especially with the heavily re-used maps and sprites. I will cry when the day comes that MH releases on a more capable platform. In conclusion, this isn't the best MH game but it still beats a lot of other games out there. I went crazy on MH4U and bought 2 copies of it along with a new 3DSXL. On this title however, I doubt I can muster enough enthusiasm.. The best monster hunter to date! Even without addition of G-rank, this game is still challenging and play with others is really fun! For those who have played MH games since the past, can have nostalgic about the village, field, heck even the monster like plesioth is here! The feel of mounting past gen monster is great! really recommended. This game is nice, the graphics are beautiful, the enviroment so deep, battle system is easy and intuitive. with this game u can play and play for hours and don´t get realize! BUT at highers levels u need someone else for defeat strongest monsters and at least in my country matchmaking take a bit time to get someone to play. Brilliant game so far, have played most of the mh series. I like how they have evolved each time by adding different elements. Big plus is the new monsters. Game is like the others starts of easy and progressively gets harder. Monster Hunter Generations is awesome. The music is what you'd expect from Monster Hunter, that is to say, pretty good. MH4U had a few problems with framerate, but MHGenerations is locked at 30FPS. This means that some textures are lower resolution, but I hardly noticed it. I still think the game looks great for a 3DS title. They've kept the new mounting mechanic from MH4U and added something else new, hunting arts. Hunting arts are a lot of fun, and add something new for veterans to master. Chaining together hunting arts is a lot of fun, and I just can't get enough of it. There are 4 different hunting styles to choose from, and each style changes how you hunt. Guild style is like your classic Monster Hunter Style. Striker style fills up hunter art gauges quicker, and encourages the use of many hunting arts. The aerial style changes your roll into a midair flip, allowing you to try mounting attacks on monsters with any weapon. Finally, theres the adept style. The adept style requires precise timing, so you can dodge or block just at the ","the best way i can describe this game is ""average"" the game is supposed to be a celebrations of the monster Hunter series . the graphics are definitely no the best, even compared to older 3DS titles ."
"1,064.The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom","Honestly it's a pretty fun game and a nice spin on the LOZ games. However it felt like the developers added way to many mechanics that aren't necessary and take away from the core 'Echos' mechanic. I think they would have been more fun in a third BOTW game.. The game is remarkable—a modern classic with all the elements we Zelda fans expect. However, one thing I missed was a shortcut to use echoes. It feels a bit anti-immersive to sift through a lengthy list of echoes for simple puzzles or battles.. I like Zelda games but this one just doesn‘t cut it. It‘s just weird I don‘t like the battle system and the abillities. I actually enjoyed this game more than I expected. At first I wasn’t sure about the echoes mechanic, but it turned to be pretty good. I also like how emotional the story gets sometimes. I think it makes you connect with the characters and make them feel alive. Perhaps the only thing I don’t really like is that the rifts are kind of repetitive, but I guess it’s fine.. An enjoyable, colorful and overall fun game. I can't deny that at some point I found it pretty boring, as it happend when i played Link's awakening. I'd give it a 7 but Condé was the sweetest character. Plus Zelda is a badass. Echoes of Wisdom is a pretty decent game. I was initially sceptical of the echo mechanic, which allows the protagonist Zelda to summon monsters and objects into the world to solve puzzles and for combat, and though it does fumble this mechanic in some respects, other aspects of the game make up for it. I really enjoyed the story in this game including the characters and lore implications. The game has quite a bit of openness, but enough linearity so as to support an actual story. There is quite a bit of good optional side content here too and quite a few compelling collectibles, including all the summonable ""echoes"". The echo mechanic is unfortunately quite a weak mechanic. Most of combat revolves around summoning a monster echo and waiting for it to dispatch your enemy, then summoning a bed echo to heal the damage. Not very challenging or exciting. The puzzles are a bit better, but I found I used the same echoes to solve a lot of the platforming problems which is also a bit boring. I did like the dungeons overall and they are more reminiscent of classic Zelda dungeons. All in all, I had a good time with this game.. A great installment to the classic top-down series of Zelda games. The puzzles and dungeons are very fun, combat as Link is great, good story, overall fits RIGHT in with A Link to the Past or Link's Awakening. My only contention is that battling as Link is limited and battling as Zelda is not fun. But the greater emphasis on the puzzle aspects makes up for this.. Credit to Nintendo for the unique design of the mechanics wrapped in a typically straightforward and bland overhead Zelda game. It does genuinely feel like there are dozens of ways to solve the puzzles here. The presentation, soundtrack, and design all have the top line Nintendo polish. I am still excited for the future of Nintendo but hardware changes are desperately needed. This was the only switch game i played in 2024.. As someone who enjoyed windwaker, LBTW, and Link’s awakening, I have to say this Zelda definitely holds up in terms of charm and gameplay. It’s true combat takes awhile to get used to and may not necessarily be for everyone, but it’s definitely worth trying out. The game is albeit short but sweet and the game’s narrative is conclusive. The game makes use of a lot of it’s assets, the soundtrack is memorable with minor amounts of nostalgia here and there. The Echo system also can lead to hilarious shenanigans and an element of creative difficulty that thematically fits with the game. My main disappointment was it felt too short, but that’s cause I played it for like 3 days straight and enjoyed the experience. (Still working on collecting heart pieces and etc). Some quick Recommendations for new players: - Play blind (No google : 3 unless needed) - Don’t rush it - Thinking outside the box tends to be rewarded so don’t be afraid to try it -2 ish dungeons have this “Press the switches at the same time” puzzle that the game doesn’t explicitly give any hints at (looks like a flower tile.) giving you the solution to that one to save you a HUGE headache later.. It's really bring me to my childhood i want so good amount of this kind of games more! Bring this more! It's warmth my old hearth, i want more!. A refresh for the 2d zelda franchise -Zelda deserved the protagonism after all this years - and the game is not boring and has some challenges for those who want it -recommended. This Game Is BAD. Breath Of The Wild Was, And Still Is, My Favourite Game, With It's Amazing Design And Vast World Size. There's Always Something To Do. Totk + Wind Waker HD Are Also Amazing. However, Echoes Of Wisdom's World Is Minuscule, And The Combat ****. The Enemies You Spawn Are Just Trash At Fighting, AND You Have To Find Their Echoes First, Which Is Also Annoying. I WAAAAAAAAAAY Prefer Botw And Totk. This Game Just Doesn't Appeal To Me At All.. This game was AWESOME! It hooked me onto the Zelda **** great after-game content wise, but everything else is a positive. The balance of uniqueness with Zelda being playable and the echoes system, there is a hearty dose of nostalgia. Great game!. A lot of the same puzzles repeated, just presented slightly different. World seems big at first, but there isn't a ton to discover. Once you get a specific objects to place, it makes a lot of the games puzzles and enemies trivial. Story was very run of the mill, nothing special.. This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a mobile game. This game copied and pasted so many assets from Link's Awakening 2019, it is the exact same game. First TOTK and now this? And you Zelda fans have the audacity to make fun of COD for being the same game every year, yet you have to wait at least half a decade to get the same game. The graphics are a joke. The physics are beyond horrible. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. No tree variety, you see the same tree copied and pasted everywhere. You can't open chests in real-time. The broken pieces of a pot or a flying tile magically fall under the ground, rather than landing on surface. Zelda's clothes don't get soaked nor does the water land on the surface, a basic detail PS3 games can get right. The UI is terrible. ● When I pay $60, I expect top-notch AAA quality. It's already bad enough that BOTW looks like an indie game, but the quality of this game is downgraded even further for the same price. Just look at the eyes for example, BOTW has the sclera, iris, and pupil whereas this trash only has the pupil, shaped like the ones you see on Steamboat Mickey Mouse. This was clearly a lazy attempt from the developers to avoid animating eyeball movements and blinking. Furthermore, the lazy developers used the top-down camera in a pathetic attempt to not have to design the fourth wall or roof in interiors. Speaking of which, there are no real-time interiors. It's the same trash as GTA San Andreas where you go inside a small building and you spawn in a giant ""interior"" that's clearly too big for it. Speaking of GTA SA, the characters' fingers are stuck together. It was pathetic in 2004 and I can't believe we have that same problem 20 years later. No voice acting. Dude, you can't be taking all these shortcuts and charge $60. I expect you developers to work hard for that price. ● One thing that frustrates me about video games is when developers prompt me to ""do it your way"" and they don't even allow me to do it my way. I ran into invisible walls or my abilities weren't working accordingly, all because I didn't do it the developer's way. I've noticed not a single ""AAA"" game has ever been able to achieve the open ended mission design since 2006. The closest AAA game (after 2006) I can think of that does ""open ended"" mission design right is GTA V, contrary to popular belief. Obviously I'm not talking about story mode, but the Online contact missions by Gerald, Simeon, Madrazo and others. In those missions, you get a few prompts and have complete freedom on how you want to do it, without ruining the logic of the mechanics. And if you can't make open-ended missions like that, then give me step by step instructions like GTA V story mode, because you're wasting my time. Many indie games absolutely nail the open ended level design, like Human Fall Flat. It's embarrassing when indie games do a better job at open-ended level design than ""AAA"" games. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. So all I get is a campaign around the 11-hour mark and that's it? I would've beaten it faster if I was allowed to do it my way. They should've at least added co-op for the campaign, so we could see how other players solve puzzles. Although that's not good enough for me, I prefer PvP or exclusive content for co-op. The developers heavily advertised the ability to play as Zelda, which is nothing more than a gimmick that gets old fast. How about they spend time actually improving the performance, instead of coming up with gimmicks. It's unacceptable that this indie quality game has the same price tag as something like RDR2 or TLOU2, even if I hate the latter moreso than this game. This is the equivalent of a McDonald's cheeseburger being priced the same as a truffle, it's pathetic. I don't recommend this game at all. ● P.S. Metacritic, it's my way or the highway.. The Perfect evolution of Zelda, this takes the vision of Breath and Tears and mixes it perfectly with the heart of a true Zelda game. I hope 3D Zelda in the future will take a similar route.. I love this game and i think that it is extremly underated, it may not be as big a game as breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom but i think it is a good zelda game for what it is.. Let me start off by saying that 7 is a good review score. ign has prisoned the masses with thinking 7 is bad. its not. i think this is a great game overall. i just have more problems with it than i do with some zelda games i find better. The devs definitely are trying to things with zelda, which i like. zelda has always been trying to push innovation. and the echo system is cool and varied. maybe too varied for my teste though. there are so many echos you can choose from and its great that we get so many options. but i catch myself using the same few. there are some just clearly better for the tasks than others. which is the issue with giving the players so much freedom. its great that we get somany options but then more experienced players learn quick how to break the game or optimize it. i like that we can solve puzzles in any way. but some puzzles feel hard because they are too open and im not sure how they intended it to be done. TOTK did the freedom better but i think thats cause of it being a 3d zelda. the freedom of choice is still great and it feels great to overcome an obstacle using anything you want. I think they learned from the complaints people had about TOTK story, with it being too free they had to cut back on making it deeper and we had to hear about the same things over and over again and our character knows more than what the story leads on cause of the freedom. here we get a more sectioned story that still has open elements. its a bit more of a simple story but it worked. im hoping in the future 3d zelda we consider linear story with open world elements more. gameplay wise, outside of the echos, is very solid. my only main complaint is the dependence of the side scrolling areas. half the game is more like playing a platformer like zelda 2 or mario rather than a top down zelda and im not a fan of that for this franchise. overall its a fun experience. and its cool playing as zelda.. I really wanted to love this game, the music, the dungeons, the classic zelda story, the moments, all was awesome, but the open world design doesnt completely work with the top down zelda experience, the metroidvania elements and ""eureka"" moments in a link to the past and minish cap are the things that make those games memorable. Also, some systems feel completely useless, like the smoothies. In Botw or Totk, colecting things is rewarding not only because of cooking, but because items help you in everything, from helping you explore to upgrading your armour, but here, all they do is replenish your hp, so the motivation to collect them, or get them as rewards isnt there.. This game is a great change from the main series although I prefer the latter. The world is great to explore and very open and free compared to the other top down games of the series but the dungeons are very easy by my opinion. Another thing that kind of annoyed me is the way you choose echoes. At some points you just have to look for some echoes among a huge selection. I don't know how they could implement this mechanic better though. Amazing game overall and a great addition to the series.. Its a easy game, but sometimes easy isnt so wrong. It gives me the original Zelda feeling, and i love it! It feels like a refreshing game.. Just wasn't that fun. I like the idea, but placing beds and random enemies isn't actually that fun. Personally not the biggest fan of the art style but it's not bad so I don't take points away for that. Didn't even finish the story because 1. I didn't care at all and 2. Gameplay was just too boring to keep going. I have a feeling the story gets better but I'm not sticking around.. This might be my favorite 2D Zelda game tied with A Link Between Worlds and The Minish Cap. This game has so many cool ideas and is so fun to explore in. Some puzzles were too cryptic and confusing and were impossible for me to complete without a guide. The lock on feature doesn’t work well most of the time.. An original top-down Zelda that breaks the glass ceiling on letting us play as the titular princess, Echoes of Wisdom makes a strong case for sticking to simpler designs as long as the challenges are fresh, but with very little replay value, this also goes down as one of the smaller games in the series.. The game has definitely its enjoyable moments. Artstyle in general is fine. There are frame drops but not as bad as in Links Awakening. Some parts are fun (e. g. dungeon at Hebra), some are really bad (like Eldin vulcano dungeon). Nevertheless, atmospherically the worst Zelda I have played. Music is by far not that catchy. But what really **** is the ""AI"" of the echos and enemies. The Echos are stupid as hell. I could upload so many ridiculous screen captures where the echo tries to through a boomerang through a stone but do not recognize. 95% of fighting echos are completely useless at all. Very frustrating. And at some point you have to rely on the echos and they can do **** because of stupidity and inertia. Hero mode is uninspired ****. At the beginning of the game everything just kills you randomly in one shot. End of the game you will not even notice this ""hard mode"".. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom blends traditional Zelda elements with new mechanics like the echo system, offering freedom in combat and puzzle-solving. Players use echoes, magical abilities tied to different elements, to tackle challenges in multiple ways, making for a dynamic experience. The game’s visuals reuse the Link's Awakening engine, providing charming but familiar environments, with standout locations like the surreal Still World. Despite some frustrations with the echo management system, the engaging exploration, puzzles, and live orchestral soundtrack make it a rewarding experience for Zelda fans. 1. I enjoyed this game SO much more than Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. It was much smaller and more varied so you don't have to drag yourself through endless same-looking landscape and it doesn't feel like looking for treasure is wasting your time. You do have to to tolerate the graphic style though but in my personal case, I like it. 2. More than that, you aren't constantly annoyed due breaking equipment and you don't prefer avoiding enemies as much as possible since fighting them doesn't make you think it's not worth it. Unlike the weapons in the Switch games, Echoes may “break” too but at least you can immediately summon them again with fresh health. 3. Speaking off, some bosses are still a real chore to fight because they damage you so much while you can only attack them so many ways and they still just won't go down cause there over-bloated health pool. Additionally you have only limited ability to directly attack and sometimes that's the only way to do things. So if you don't have enough recharges on hand it gets to an unhealthy attrition. The A.I. of you Echo-monster also leaves a lot to be desired to be useful against bosses and certain enemy combinations. 4. Other things also need optimization. The menu for Echoes is still too big or rather long and sorting doesn't help much either. There are just too many Echoes, especially with Monsters that just make you groan on how much time you spent in the menu just to choose the Monster/Object you need or want. Even after you have your favorites, you still need to switch every so often to solve a certain puzzle and there are always new things coming, stretching it even more. You never know what you might need or you just want. While everything still has many possible solutions on occasion you still need to get to the Monsters/Objects that can archive what you need. 5. That said, I REALLY appreciate to have more proper dungeons, bosses and puzzling to augment the gameplay experience. For old school Zelda fans like me, this finds a much better balance in almost everything than BotW or TotK had, though it still lags better story directing even if it's not as bad as BotW or TotK in that regard. 6. Ultimately, EoW may be just a “pocket version TotK” but due it's more condensed world and at least some light restrictions put on the player in dungeons it did the experience so much good and while people have complained about performance, I didn't notice any of it. It's a worthy play but you do have to make your peace with the graphic style. I would rate it an 8,5 due the few issues it has, they do accompany you through the whole game but that is not possible so I choose 8 but that is still way higher than what I gave BotW and TotK which is lower than 3 to me. Take from that opinion what you want.. Charming presentation with visuals and music. Chill difficulty. It starts off strong but ends flat. It doesn’t quite go above and beyond. It peaks pretty early on… so it’s a good but not great game.. I think this is the first Zelda game I actually don’t like. The combat system is way too tedious. I prefer traditional swing your sword or weapon to defeat enemies, not spawn an echo and just watch it fight. If it weren’t for the combat this would be a great game.. Solid game. It’s fun but the combat isn’t always the best and the puzzling is only ok. Also frame rate issues.. just an incredibly pleasant game, I played every zelda on the Switch, this is the only one that didn't get angry or tense a game you just want to play, a game in which everything is good. yes, maybe in some places it could, theoretically, be better, for example, more memorable quests, characters.. Echoes of Wisdom is charming, fun and engaging game. The art style fits the game perfectly, and the game mechanics were really creative. I hope Grezzo goes on to develop more original top down Zelda games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a great Zelda game which made me fall in love with the Zelda franchise. it is a great game that focuses on being creative and for that, it deserves a 9/10,. First original 2d zelda in a long while, and first time zelda is a protagonist (CDi don't count)! The echoes mechanic could have been perfected a bit more, but it is a lot of fun to mess around.. Great 2D Zelda game. Liked this slightly more than the Links Awakening Rework. Pros: -Great world and quirky characters -Lots of cool things to explore, nice side-quests, and collectibles -More platforming than in other 2D Zelda titles -Fun puzzles Cons: -While I do like the Echo system for puzzles, the traditional fighting system is more fun -Dungeon's are on the easier side -I'm not sure why, but while 2D Zelda titles I like a lot, I don't quite love them. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a very good game in general. I REALLY like the concept of Zelda being the main character but i will give it a 9 because i dont think spending 60$ is worth it. If it costed 40 then yes 10/10 game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a pretty fine 2d Zelda game, but compare to others like A Link Between Worlds, Link's Awakening (remake) and Minish Cap, this one is just pretty average in my opinion. There's obviously pretty smart puzzles here and there that implement really well the new mechanic/gimmick that this game introduces, but nothing really mindblowing or anything, the story is also pretty whatever but to be honest that is something to expect in a Zelda game, there aren't many games in the franchise that actually has an amazing story (nor even a good one). Also the performance of this game is terrible, the framerate is terribly unstable, and it's surprising to me that a game like this can't run at 60fps nor at 1080p resolution.. I am glad that we finally have a game where we play as Zelda for once. I also think the mechanic of being able to copy and paste certain enemies and objects that Zelda sees in the world is a interesting mechanic; at first. The combat is really dull when you have to basically rely on A.I. to do the work. You paste a monster to fight for you and then run around in circles is the combat. Becomes a bit dull after a while. The game does give you a ""swordmaster mode"" where Zelda can become like Link and use the sword,bow and bombs but there is a time limit. You can upgrade how long you can be in the mode for and the damages done with the weapons but you lose the ability to use this mode in the final boss which makes all the upgrades you provided feel pointless. There is like over 100 echoes for Zelda to get. The problem is that the UI for picking an echoe is horizontal for some reason which makes finding the echo you want to summon a REAL hassle when you have a lot. It doesn't help that you will be only really using 10 of the echoes throughout the game anyway. Wish the game allowed you to favourite echoes to make it easier but NOPE. The story has some nice mystery with Link being missing and all these dark rifts appearing over Hyrule. It is also nice that Ganon is not the villain in this entry. The answers to the mystery isn't amazing or anything but there is some interest there. The overall game is unfortunately, way to easy for a Zelda game. The puzzles weren't ever that hard and exploring is never that interesting. The game also allows you to craft smoothies for healing or heat immunity or defense boost etc but what is the point when you can just spawn a bed and heal yourself that way XD I am also disappointed in the partner character in this entry, ""Tri"". It is just another dull helper with no personality. I really wish they would make a partner character that has depth like ""Midna"" from Twilight Princess. Overall, it isn't a bad game. I do think it was a fun experimental Zelda game and I do think there are some creative stuff in it and I do like that Nintendo really tried something with this one. Definitely not up there in the top 10 Zelda games but it was a decent entry.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom not only met all my expectations, it greatly surpassed them. I knew from the moment I turned it on that I would have a unique and fun experience, but I never would have imagined it would be one of the best games I’ve played all year. This is so much more than a heroine debut title for our Princess, it is one of the best Zelda games ever made. Echoes of Wisdom is a perfect title for this adventure. Aside from the obvious connection to Princess Zelda and Wisdom, this game pushes the puzzle solving elements of the franchise to the next level, requiring you as the player to have your own wisdom to advance. Along the way you learn Echoes which allow you to create perfect copies of over 100 things you can find in the game whenever you want, meaning how puzzles are solved and bosses are defeated are constantly decided by you the player. This also includes the monsters which scratches a Pokemon itch that made me excited every time I seen a new one. If I had to sum up this experience in one word, it would be charming. The characters that Zelda meets in her journey are often colorful and comical with individual plots that can occasionally pull at the heartstrings. The music is incredible and matches the standard the series has set through the decades, and the unique spin on combat by summoning an army of monsters (or just one big warrior) makes things intense. Pair these elements with side quests, collectables, different outfits, and a big world to explore and you have the perfect Zelda game. Even the Deku Scrubs came back! There are even more surprises beyond what I listed in store, but I dare not spoil a single one. This is a game made for every Zelda fan that does not disappoint in story or gameplay, and delivers an amazing adventure in an adorable package. The Princess has never been more amazing to me than now, standing proudly as a strong protagonist wielding a magical staff and kicking butt. I’m not certain how many Zelda games I consider perfect, but the first one starring its namesake most certainly is to me.. Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was a big surprise for me. A game that promised nothing and delivered everything. The gameplay is captivating and innovative; Nintendo managed to blend the best elements of its successful Zelda games and create a new recipe for success. I enjoyed every second of this game; you never get bored or find any task tedious. The summoning of the Echoes gives each player immense creative freedom to explore the game in a unique way. Having highlighted all these qualities, we can't avoid mentioning the game's only flaw: its performance. Even without complex graphics, the game occasionally stutters, showing that the Switch hardware is really taking its last breaths in this generation.. A nice and fun echo mechanic, music and graphics are OK for switch, no bugs at all. Few negative things: - Too easy (even in heroic mode) - Too quick to finish - Maniability with echoes is a bit horrible sometimes - Too many echoes, such a pain to find the wanted one. My first experience on top-down view game was link's awakening and it is a masterpiece i think...i didn't expect echoes of the wisdom to be this good... honestly it is much better than i expected...i definitely recommend. fun game. and while the echo mechanic is kinda fun, i'd prefer the sword and items. good game, just not my cup of tea.. A really good game. It feels very much like a mix between Tears of the Kingdom and A Link Between Worlds. Unfortunately, the difficulty level is low, so it doesn’t provide much of a challenge. I like the idea that you can copy things and create them yourself later. However, you end up making so many copies that you never use again, which can make it quite difficult to keep track of them. It would have been nice if you could organize and move them around yourself. But there are many hours of entertainment here, so it’s a game I would recommend.. Amazing to play through thanks to its creative usage of the echoes and Zelda’s playstyle. Meh, but artbook with development, idea and design process in the end is cool though.. Nintendo got many things right this time around, however the gameplay is just too tedious due to the echo system. It is nice to see the return of the link to the past map as well as dungeons that require keys, items, etc. This is where the fun unfortunately ends. 99% of your time will either be spent reading text as conversations are unnecessarily drawn out time after time, and the new echo system is downright monotonous. Having to constantly switch between dull items, such as a table or bed, to build stairs, bridges, and other contraptions is not Zelda. Instead, it is boring and detracts from the adventure itself. Nintendo needs to get over the idea of having random objects that have no place in Zelda games. You can wield Link's sword, which is the most fun the game offers, but only for a few seconds until your magic meter depletes. It is like Nintendo is taunting us with a beautiful world and dungeons, just to laugh as we fumble through the horrid game play. Maybe one day Nintendo will care enough for both fans and the Zelda franchise to make a descent adventure again. Until then, we are left with roms of the real Zelda games.. So while very easy, and it should have been named Zelda: Bed and Breakfast... The game was super fun, although, just like Tears, Breath, and Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts. Once you figure out the most overpowered thing to create, the game becomes to easy. For Zelda it really is the bed and the Spear Moblin. Thankfully they don't give one of the echoes until the very end because it would have made it even easier. Now with all that said, loved the story, it was nice to finally get a good you play as Zelda game. The game play was fun and felt very much like Sabrewulf on the GBA. It was wonderful to have standard Zelda dungeons back. Also, it was a neat way to let Zelda and Link meet in this timeline. Also major props in including both Zoras, I literally squeed. Performance wise, I played this on my launch Switch and noticed no problems, I found one glitch with one of the echoes, but nothing ever game breaking. In the end it is a nice love letter to Zelda fans of old and new. While easy which causes the 2 point dip for me, it definitely was worth the time.. An average at best zelda game with frame rate troubles, Nintendrones please have better standards. An Incredible game, a 2D zelda with things of tears of the kingdom,estrategic, with the objects and the monsters. We can say whatever we want about Nintendo, they are real expert when it comes to game design. At first I was not found of the Art Direction, but incarnating Zelda + this new mechanic in this franchise was a pretty solid selling point.. What hurts me the most is the lack of mistery and sense of adventure in this game. There is no challenge of problems to solve, there is no incentive to progress. For example, in ohter Zeldas you saw a heart you couldn´t take in the current situation and generated a tension to solve that problem. In this game all is available, all is reachable. Thats really boring. And the dialogues, please... the amount of dialogue is too much. Something I can´t understand is why Nintendo keeps on a item management that seems done whit the minimun effort. Oh! And the drinks mechanics: Again Nintendo? really? One by one preparation taking an eternity to do a few drinks. About the combat: it has no thrill, you are an espectator, its like playing and not playing at the same time. You summon an echo I pray to god that the echo does his job before midnight. I dunno man, I think is my least favourite Zelda of all. Zelda 1 is better, no joke.. Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a creative and enjoyable experience, though it feels like the lesser entry in the Switch trilogy. The art style is captivating, and the music is absolutely phenomenal. While it’s on the easier side, it’s hard to put down, which is definitely a great aspect.. First time I've tried a Zelda game and I loved every second of it. The echo mechanics are extremely w","the game is remarkable—a modern classic with all the elements we Zelda fans expect . but one thing I missed was a shortcut to use echoes . the game has quite a bit of openness, but enough linearity so as to support an actual story ."
"1,065.Shantae: Risky's Revenge","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Completion: Finished game. Pros: - Great 2D sprite work, especially in the animations - Whimsical plot and characters help to keep the game tonally tight - Dungeons are fun and feature engaging level design Cons: - Boss fights are too easy and repetitive. The game as a whole is pretty easy, but boss fights are a fragrant offender. - Too much aimless backtracking, even for the genre - this is especially true due to the lack of any kind of quick travel system and the linear layout of the map - The transformations are a good idea, but they take far too long to activate, especially the final one - Overworld is generally boring and linear - Audio leaves much to be desired with forgettable tracks and a complete lack of voice acting Final Word: Shantae: Risky's Revenge is nothing revolutionary for the Metroidvania genre, but as a short and simple and romp through a light-hearted world it succeeds greatly. Final Score: 7.7. Can't think perfectly straight with this game. Its gameplay feels strong, story feels interesting, characters should need a lot of changes to go through; overall, Risky's Revenge is only bought by fans of this Shantae franchise and gamers because they love this game. For me, not so much.. This game is nowhere near the complexity of the original GBC title. It is also much easier and shorter. It is still fun to play, but it ends too fast and is not that memorable.. You can get this game now on you 3DS, it's totally worthy!! for the price, is the best 5-6 hours you'll get on this console. I sure wish it had double the amount of dungeons... but I can't complain at all.. Last night I beat Risky's Revenge. The game's clock put my efforts at about 6h30min of playtime. I was a bit disappointed when it ended, I felt like a game at that price-point should have offered more content. My overall impression of the game is quite positive, however. The graphics were detailed and beautiful, and the gameplay elements were varied enough never to get boring. There was a lot of backtracking and exploration, but it never really felt tedious to me. The game's writing was silly and childish, which actually worked in its favour, as it didn't try to be something it wasn't. This is a kid's game with an adult appeal. While not particularly difficult, many of the game's puzzles were quite challenging, and I found myself using a gamefaq on 4 separate occasions to progress onward. The dungeons were all quite massive investments, they took time and concentration, which I enjoyed. They never gave you anything on a silver platter, including your objectives, and yet they never quite abandoned you either. Overall it was a well-balanced game that only suffered from being too short. Was it worth $12+tx? No, I don't think so, not unless it proved to be longer. Money aside, was it worth playing? Yep, definitely, enjoyable and memorable gameplay with a solid visual style and excellent sprite animations made this game a pleasure to experience.. Shantae keeps running into issue of coming out toward the end of the console's life cycle. I don't think people even know there was one before this DSiware version. This is one of the best DS games. If you enjoyed action adventure such as Metroid and Zelda series (2D ones), Castlevania (starting with SotN), you will love this game. I was hoping this game would come out as a packaged game so DS Lite and DS Phat owners can experience it too.... S:RR is a fantastic game. I'm not a very big fan of platformers and I didn't play the original. Nevertheless, this is a very fun, polished and good looking game. The audio is also very good. The complete soundtrack is available from the developer, on a pay what you want system. All in all, this is a very good value for $12.00. S:RR Is better than some full retail DS games, costing twice as much.. The best way to describe Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a 2-D version of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Incredible art, well developed and puzzled filled dungeons, and an emphasis on unlocking new items and abilities in order to progress. Yes, it can also be compared to Metroid or Castlevania, but to do ignores one of the games greatest strengths: its charm. This is the first game on DSiWare that is a must-own, which is not only an admission to the terrible state of the DSiWare store (it's terrible and filled with garbage), but also a celebration of the incredible value this game provides. It's easily the best $12 that can be spent on either the DSiWare or WiiWare stores.. If you haven't played the original, Shantae was a Metroidvania released in 2002 by Wayforward Technologies. The plot was simple: Risky Boots the Lady Pirate/Leader of the Tinkerbat Army has stolen an ancient Steam Engine to use for a Doomsday device. Shantae, a Half-Genie, vows to to recover her Uncle's discovery and bring peace back to Sequin Land. Controls were simple: You could jump, whip, run, and use items bought from the shop. What made Shantae unique, however, was the Dance gimmick. It was very akin to how the Ocarina was used in the 3D Zeldas, but, instead of pressing the buttons at any rate, you had to wait for the beat to press the correct button. Shantae went over well with many review sites, getting 9's and 10's left and right. It became a smash hit...however, hardly anyone bought it. Matt Bozon, Creative Lead at WF, spent years trying to revive the series. GBA, Wii, DS, PSP, all didn't make it of the design floor, until last year that is, where Risky's Revenge was announced, and many rejoiced. Shantae: Risky's Revenge takes place presumably a couple months after the orginal. Shantae heads to her Uncle Mimic's presentation at the Relic Hunter's Expo after being told by her friend Bolo that she's late. At the speech, Mimic is given the honor of presenting the Mystery Auction Item, which is encased in hollow rock . It turns out that the Mystery Item is an Old Oil Lamp, which Mimic tries to hide and ignore. Just then, Risky drops from the ceiling and swipes it. Shantae chases her down to the bay, and is knocked unconscious by a unfair blow. Mimic wakes her up, and tries to keep her at her lighthouse, away from possible danger. Shantae refuses, and asks what the possible danger is. Mimic refuses to talk about it, but instead tells her how to stop Risky: by locating the 3 Magic Seals. Shantae heads out of town and seraches for the said artifacts. Shantae: RR's controls are as simple as it's predecessor's: you can jump (B), Whip (Y), Dance (X), Use Items (R), and do a backwards dash (L). Dancing has been simplified this time around: instead of using an OoT-esque code system, you just hold the button til the right formation, and then release. The item system has also taken a turn for the best, items can now be bought and used indefinitely, as long as you have Magic in your Meter. Items are also upgradable, but you must also pay in hidden objects known as Magic Jams, an item that's hidden in various nooks and crannies throughout the game. One major gripe the game has recieved is the map system. It is very simple: all it does is show you what room you are in, and that's it. At first, it seems like a problem, but it isn't. It's very hard to get lost, really. There's only one point in the game where you might get stuck, but that's it. Overall, Risky's Revenge can run you about 4-6 hours of gameplay, depending on whether or not you try to go 100% or not. Replay Value is really high, it's something you'd want to challenge yourself with for various runthroughs. If you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre, get it. If not, get it anyways. Shantae has returned from a 8 Year Hiatus, and she wants to show us who is the Princess of the Metroidvanias. Best 12 Dollars you shall ever spend on a Downloadable Title.. Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a 2-D adventure game in which you guide half genie, Shantae, on her quest to stop Risky the pirate. Shantae uses her hair as a weapon against her enemies but can also wield magic including types that can turn her into an animal to reach places otherwise unavailable. I particularly find it very fun to look for some of the hidden items necessary to further upgrade Shantae and her arsenal of magic. This is the best original game I've played from the DSiWare library. I have to give credit to the developer for making something from scratch just for the DSiWare when there's been other games ported from other portable devices and phones.","the game as a whole is pretty easy, but boss fights are a fragrant offender . audio leaves much to be desired with forgettable tracks and a complete lack of voice acting . overall, this game is only bought by fans of this Shantae franchise and gamers because they love this game ."
"1,066.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin","Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is like a hidden treasure for gamers who crave that classic vampire-slaying action. If you're a fellow gaming enthusiast, this Castlevania installment hits all the right **** storyline is a real page-turner, immersing you in a world of gothic horrors with that perfect touch of mystery. It's not just a mindless hack-and-slash; there's depth to the narrative that keeps you glued to your DS. The atmospheric vibe is pure Castlevania, and it's a nostalgic trip for **** let's talk gameplay. The dual-character system is the star here. You get two heroes to switch between, each bringing their own skills to the table. It adds a layer of strategy to the traditional whip-swinging mayhem, injecting new life into the series. Plus, the variety of sub-weapons and spells keeps the combat fresh and exciting.Graphically, it's not pushing the DS to its limits, but the art style captures that iconic Castlevania aesthetic. And the music? It's like a haunting symphony, setting the perfect tone for your vampire-hunting ****, here's the catch—it's not a walk in the park. The difficulty level might raise an eyebrow or two, especially if you're new to the Castlevania scene. But for those who appreciate a challenge, it's the kind of difficulty that feels earned, not **** sum it up, Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is a must-play for Castlevania fans or anyone seeking a satisfying blend of classic action and strategic depth. The dual-character system, coupled with the engaging story and atmospheric soundtrack, cements its place as a standout title in the Castlevania legacy. Grab your whip, gather your courage, and venture into Dracula's realm for a gaming experience that's truly enchanting.. Portrait of Ruin really could have been better if we didn’t actually return to Dracula’s castle. However that is not the case, and while it’s not a bad game, a lot of potential was missed. Still Portrait of Ruin offers a lot to players and I think if you're even remotely interested in Castlevania you will have fun with this game.. Castlevania Portrait of Ruin is one of my favorite Castlevania games. The two character system adds another layer to the combat, there's a wealth of awesome subweapons and spells to try out, the portraits allow for more variety in the locations you'll visit, and the soundtrack is very memorable. It's an excellent game and a must have for the DS.. Adding a second selectable character into the spooky Metroid-style mix, this is a fun arcade adventure and probably the best instalment of the Castlevania series.. Just okay game, blank world and easy to get powerful weapon. Boss so easy because 1000 blades skill so imba. Music 7/10 Graphic 9/10 Gameplay 8/10 Boss 6/10 because very easy. It became my 3rd favorite CV game after Dawn and Aria. I like the painting concept. The difficulty of the game was balanced. It wasn't as hard as OOE. A wide variety of abilities and items. Level design was good overall. Music is nice. It was fun to play with 2 characters. But I think it is more appropriate to play with a single character in boss battles. There are quests in the game, but it is a bit difficult to do without looking at the guide. I finished the game 956%, I wasn't bored, the story was good too.. After being a little bit disappointed by DoS, this one made quite the shot for me. Nice dual mechanics which you can choose to use or not most of the time, nice graphics, fantastic musics. it may be a bit subjective but i find it to be more action-oriented than DoS, and that goes well.. Quite a wasted potential with exciting first half yet waste dual mechanics, simple narrative and annoying boss RNG. Don't let the Anime aesthetics and tropy characters turn you off, every thing else here is simply amazing. from the varied levels and playable characters, this ends up being the beefiest Castlevania experience. Want a Killer soundtrack featuring new tracks and remixes of old ones, including some from other Konami series? Did you prefer the Japanese dubs from past Castlevania games? New Game Plus? Multiple characters and different ways to play each time? Immense amounts of polish and room by room curated game design? Portrait of Ruin has it all in spades. While slightly different and less mature than previous Castlevanias, Portrait of Ruin is a knockout in it's own right. If you're looking for a game more like Symphony of the Night, Order of Ecclesial is that way. For those still here, buckle up and be sure to never skip the cutscene before fighting Death. I Debated with my self for a long time if this truly was the ultimate IGA castlevania experience. While Symphony of the Night does take itself more seriously and as a piece of art might be objectively better, Portrait of Ruin manages to strong-arm it's way to the top with sheer amount of content variety, replay-ability and top-tier game design. Portrait of Ruin is a completed work from a Master of his craft.. The content of the game is good, but for some reason this title is very buggy compared to Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia. It just freezes too much, and then you have to start all over again. It happens when you do fast travel, and special moves.. Castlevania Portrait of Ruin in my Opinion is the best Metroidvania I've ever played. First off the music is some of the best in the entire series with fantastic remixes of songs like Cross your Heart(known as crucifix held close in the game), Iron Blue intention and Simon's Theme. They also have great original pieces like Invitation of a Crazed moon, Gaze up at the Darkness, The Hidden Curse, and Jail of jewles. Even though this is not my favorite Castlevania soundtrack its pretty up there. Now that I've established the soundtrack but now let's dive into the gameplay. Now since this is a Metroidvania so there is a lot of familiar territory but there are some welcome changes . First off Side quests, for the first time ever you can undertake special tasks in different areas of Portrait of Ruin to get a stat boost, money, a new and powerful item or weapon ETC.. These range from punching butcher's meat, to entering button combos, or mastering a skill. Each new quest has a different fun and uniqe maybe a little difficult task. Unlike Order of Ecclesia most of these tasks are not endless Grind-fests and boring fetch quests and they feel more rewarding as you go on completing them. Now the core gameplay of explore the castle kill enemies collect relics, armor , weapons and leveling up hasn't changed much. Except now you have two chracters to play as that you can switch freely between them at anytime. They each have their own weapons armor and accseories. You can also obtain crush attacks that sap your mp like nothing else but they deal a lot of damage. All these things accounted for this game is actually not very easy especially towards the end. Thankfully unlike games like Harmony of Dissonnance and SOTH this game does get harder and thats a good thing. Overall after you beat the game you unlock 2 other sets of chracters a hard mode with 3 sub difficulties and a boss-rush mode. SO all in all for what ever you can find this game at its a really good deal. I will say there is a boss later on that will make you ooze with nostalgia if your a long running fan and its one tough cookie so be ready. But besides that Portrait of ruin is filled with content with 10 maps to cover, a boss rush mode, a total of 5 difficulties, and 3 sets of chracters to play as your gonna be here for a while.. I believe in all rights this is one of the best Castlevania I've ever played, and I've played just about every one of them. (This includes Castlevania 64.) As far as the level designs go it's pretty much Castlevania. Some areas with tons of floating platforms and a segment that always has giant turning cogs. This of course isn't a problem as it just feels like a Castlevania. (Much unlike Lord of Shadows which feels like a God of War wanna-be.) The two main roles of the game, Jonathan and Charlotte are both interesting characters who play off of one another. Like Charlotte's way of playfully **** at Jonathan or his insecurity that she helps him with. Charlotte has an adorable way to point out his flaws, and he has an adorable way to point out the horribly obvious. I believe that these two characters are better fleshed out then most Castlevania characters who just kind of waltz around and smack things with a whip in a silent stupor. As far as the story goes it breaks away from the generic Castlevania storyline which is nice to see. The main protagonist for the longest duration of the game (Brauner) has entirely different goals then most other enemies. (Who are not Dracula.) Of course for the sake of not spoiling anything I'll refrain from going any further. It was just nice and refreshing to see a new idea for Castlevania instead of some cult raising Dracula. Or some cultist priest raising Dracula. Or some other cult derived from the past cult of cultists who worship a cult of resurrecting Dracula. (See the pattern?) Pretty much...there is no cult. Then we boil it all down to the gameplay. Switching between Charlotte and Jonathan is a nice addition. Charlotte's spells make grinding for items much quicker, and everyone who's played Castlevania will be grinding for items. As for Jonathan he's the man you use for the boards you'll be traveling to. Then you switch back to Charlotte to annihilate the bosses. All in all, it's not a gimmick but a new way to play your Castlevania. In the **** gameplay is pretty much Castlevania. Before it got bad of course. (Insert lame God of War wanna-be title here with giant roided out meathead as the protagonist.) So, with that **** you like Castlevania, if you like interesting plots, if you like engaging characters, and if you like that good old Castlevania soundtrack then this is the game for you. If you own a DS you should definitely get this title. Also, I forgot to mention but the sprites look very nice as well. Pretty game for the DS. If you like mashing the square button a hundred times without having to worry about dying...then I feel for you.. Portrait of ruin is a tonka truck wishing it were a big-rig. It looks, smells, and acts like Castlevania, but at the core it's simply a watered down adventure game derived from more successful ventures of the same franchise. The anime art direction undermines the serious Gothic overtones that should prevail in any Castlevania entry. The characters are surface level and cliche. There is little to no innovation, nor are there any clever game play elements. Portrait is frustrating. Not in the sense of difficulty, or boss fights (both can be solved by simply gaining a few levels and trying again not much skill required there), but in that you find yourself meandering around lazy copy-and-paste environments filled with cheap challenges looking for the end of the dungeon so you can move on. Then, the game has the audacity to send you back through those levels on fetch quests for a fat, bald priest and a ghost with too much fashion sense. The game's redeeming factor, the boss encounters, save it from a score in the red, but it's not enough for me to recommend this title over others for the DS. The story is lame. The levels are lame. The action is decent. But then again, you can get incredible action, story, and levels with Order of Ecclesia, so go buy that instead.. At a distance Portrait of Ruin smells good. But when you give it a bite it isn't really that tasty. The Good: Great replay value since it's a long-lasting adventure (with many unlockables to go for besides a whole bunch of items); amazing soundtrack, well worthy of the tradition of Castlevania's melodies; good animation, especially in Dual Crush moves and in some boss battles. The Bad: Replay value is all based on doing the same things over and over; stupid dialogue, and story/plot running faster than it should; stretched rooms just to make a bigger castle. This new installment in the Castlevania series has the right ingredients: two different characters to switch between or to play together, a huge map to explore, many--really, many--items to get, relics to collect, side quests to solve, skills to learn and master, a superb soundtrack, and good animation/voice acting. So, after all, what's wrong with PoR? The problem is that under all this stuff rests buried a lazy production. The main question is about the replay value. OK, it may last for weeks or months, but what for? By unlocking some features you can play with other characters and under new difficult levelsâ. It's OK, but nothing special. Too short and kind of unimaginative. The story is incredibly boring and uninteresting, so it all comes down to the gameplay and level designs. They're OK but even after 10 hours I found myself thinking ""OK, when is this going to get fun?"" The dual character thing feels like a gimmick, I used Charlotte about three times and played as Jonathan the rest of the time.","Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is like a hidden treasure for gamers who crave classic vampire-slaying action . the dual-character system is the star here, adding a layer of strategy to the traditional whip-swinging mayhem . the difficulty level might raise an eyebrow or two, especially if you're new to Castlevania ."
"1,067.Inscryption","First of all, the difficulty and balance of the board game aspect, which is the core of play, is well done and **** addition, the worldview and the behavior of the characters, which extend beyond the game, create a highly immersive experience that keeps the player's hands on the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is really enjoyable. I wish there was an option for unlimited play and the ability to create crazy decks. It brings a fresh perspective to its genre.. Act 1 is incredible, but you simply cannot trust devolver to put out a finished game. all they had to do was keep giving us more of the same. Act 2 is a complete mess that should have not been introduced. it's overcomplicated, they removed squirrel draws for no reason which makes many matches simply a process of hitting the bell and waiting to be killed because you cant spawn more than 1 single creature. when i first got to act 2 i was excited to see the different art styles and that it was so clearly inspired by pokemon tcg on gbc, but the gameplay is completely ruined. there was no reason to overhaul the card game so abruptly and yet give us so little information on how it functions, while on top of that making the graphical style drastically less detailed and harder to read. i was in love with act 1 but im severely disappointed to see how low effort and just un-fun act 2 is. you have an amazing card game here, why for the love of all that is sacred would you overhaul the entire thing in 10 different entirely backwards ways half way through the experience? we didn't pay for a game jam, we paid for a finished game. if we just had a few more bosses and stayed in the cabin setting, everything would be fine. instead, you just cram literally everything the devs came up with into the final release and it feels like 3-4 unfinished games and a very bad short film. i should add that 100% of the found footage content is a waste of time. nothing happens, they just make you use another convoluted interface to individually select short clips instead of playing them all in a row. it was a good concept to add found footage, but the footage itself was entirely lacking, boring, and an excuse to pad out the run time with content that should be cut from the final product. act 3 is fine, i dont know why they didnt just go straight from act 1 to act 3, but it's overall much more boring and has so much less interesting content to explore than act 1. they just threw everything to the wind after act 1 and it's incredibly disappointing because this could be a very good game and modding has proved as much.. This game deserves its flowers. It's that good. I can't say anything without it being a spoiler. If you like horror mixed with deck building, play it.. This is the deck builder with the best narrative and story I've ever played. Characters that border on perfection along with a great atmosphere and artistic style make it impossible to stop playing it, the only bad thing is that its duration is short and you're left wanting more, that's fixed a bit by the kaycees mod giving it more hours of gameplay. 10/10. An extraordinairily well thought out card battling system that pairs well with a balanced method to add cards to the deck. A moody and rich atmosphere so thick and immersive that you get lost in it. This game fully takes advantage of the fact it is a card game turned video game extremely well implementing creative cards everywhere you look. The game is able to keep you on your toes throughout your first playthrough, and mix up gameplay to keep the player hooked.. I love Inscryption, I'm a **** for interesting atmospheres like Inscryption's. The gameplay is simple but fun, the roguelike mode (Kaycee's mod) Is a great addition where you can just focus on the cards and unlock new ones that aren't in the story mode. Speaking of the story mode, It's also fun, there are multiple chapters that differ in gameplay and have different cards in them. There's an overarching story in them centered around a card unpacking content creator who discovers the Inscryption video game, It's not an amazing story or anything but if you like ARGs you'll probably like it more than most. Overall I'd recommend it to you if you enjoy card games or anything else I described previously in the review.. This game was a complete banger, can only recommend it to anybody that is into roguelike cardgames. All in this game about cards. So, if you like card games you can find very interesting patterns of gameplay and somewhat complex systems. However, this game has not much to show but cards. Story, visuals and other aspects of the game either will be pleasing for you or be a burden that makes no effect on overall experience. The game itself is not bad, but has not much to offer but iteration of the same system for a long time.. I don't usually like card games like this, they feel like too much to me but Inscrption makes me regret not playing enough. It does dip massively in the second and third acts, but eh you can't win 'em all.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Inscryption is a fun card game. The story is pretty weird and engaging. The balance of the game however leave to be desire because, many things are not well explained. If Act1 and Act2 are fun and acceptable, Act3 is way too hard. In top of that, you have to learn a new way to play, which never bode well when a game finishes. I was able to do two bosses at the right side of the world, but those to the left makes no sens, except to grind a type of specific powers and cards. For the price it's a great game with a lot of nostalgic effect and strange humour. I give it 80%. I've picked this game, almost by chance, so I am not complaining. I still played 19 hours.. My favourite game of all time. You simply cannot expect anything this game will throw at you. It just does things that a game shouldn't and that's **** sick. You could compare it to Undertale, but it exceeds that in so many levels. I can't tell you any more than that without spoiling it. The atmosphere is incredible, the gameplay is fun and it has one of the best plots I've ever seen. **** PLAY IT!. One of the most unique games ever made. And a fantastic rouguelite cardgame too. Inscryption was an unforgetable experience for me. The vibe, the gameplay, the visual style, the story, the characters. All of these thing and more were nailed so perfectly.. It is true that at one point the game gets kinda dull, specially in the rpg more styled part of the game, but the charm of the beginning and the endgame its soooo good. Very recommended. An incredibly designed and vibed out deckbuilder, mostly in terms of atmosphere and characters, the card game is simple and streamlined so that the rest of the game can shine.. I'm not usually a fan of deck builders, but I was told that this would be right up my alley, and sure enough, it was! It's crunchy enough to appeal to people who like that sort of thing, while also providing options for people who prefer a less complicated strategy. There are reasons beyond the card games to pick this one up- boy howdy are there ever- but even without that, the gameplay itself is super solid and fun. (Am I going to talk about those other reasons? No. Do yourself a solid and go in unspoiled. This is a game that throws you right into the deep end, and it's all the better for it.). This beautifully bizarre game exists in a world of ripoffs, remakes and uninspired cash grabs, and succeeds in setting itself apart in every way imaginable. I was absolutely **** into its strange and creepy story, and incredibly unique but addicting gameplay. The game gives nods to a lot of different types of games from the past, with a clever variety of mechanics and design that bring old products into the fresh new realm of gaming. The attention to detail is not limited to the gameplay though, with the score, sfx, characters and visuals combining together to create a one of a kind experience that I suggest everyone gives a try at some point.. The gameplay loop is fine, I don't think its anything special. The ""extra"" stuff and the weird stuff is why you are here. I think that stuff is good, but it didn't know me on my ass like it seem to do for a lot of other players. Some of the gimmicks it used have been done before in other games. Also, some of the RNG for improving a card at the end of a run can be either really good or completely worthless, which feels bad, especially when you are counting on a good card there to make your next run be good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Personally couldn't get into it. Found the gameplay dull. Will admit I normally am not a massive fan of turned-based RPGs (exceptions being Pokemon games or RPGs with a lot of personality like Undertale and the Mother franchise). Just not for me. Great game, it has great art style, music, atmosphere, mechanics. It is very immersive.. A very original and immersive experience. The game is a mix of concepts, with a core of a card game, but also embracing the escape room genre and some roguelike elements. The artstyle is very good and the gameplay is fun, but the narrative is surprising and totally unexpected. It's the kind of game that reminds us why we play games in the first place.. The developer of this game offers incredibly unique games. The story is well written and kept me engaged.. A very cool card game, with diverse, evolving and engaging gameplay mechanics. It's set in a thrilling, creepy and mysterious atmosphere and narration. I only regret that the second half of the game is not as mechanically engaging and immersive as the first one.. It's a masterpiece, I can't say anything else about it or it would be a spoiler. Hope this helps. Inscryption is the perfect example of ""more is less"". The core gameplay is great (flawed and not balanced... but it's short and fair enough to be addictive without being too frustrating). The atmosphere and art direction are really great and the escape room elements are simple but fun. The whole game could've been just that... but It devolves into a convoluted mess as soon as act 2 hits... (no spoiler): the 4th wall breaks really kill the atmosphere... wether on their long from or when there are short burst of audio reminding you of the 1st hidden layer of the game. It feels so cheap and mixes with the game as well as water and oil. The other gameplays are really poorly designed (with a lot of confusing UI) and too long. It's amazing how act 1 feels fresh and new everytime (despite being the same game over and over) while the subsequent acts really feel like repetitive chores. And don't get me started on the 3rd and 4th layers... not only all that energy is wasted on most players so I cannot count that as a **** the hidden overarching story is really bad. Like cartoonishly bad... and completely disconnected from the feel of the game. This game goes to prove that it's often better to stick with your core idea and gameplay rather than cramming all your ideas in one place.. Just finished it, still have no idea what just happened - but this was great - everything a videogame should be. If you enjoy deckbuilding card games, that is. Otherwise, it's a bit of a drag to play that many card games.. This game is phenomenal. It's one of those experiences that are very hard to describe without spoiling, but it's safe to say that it has an excellent and intriguing lore, told by unconventional means, combined with great card game(s?). It never ceases to surprise you, and it' very pleasing to play not only for ""optimizing"" your strategies and tactics, but also because progressing into it's story is just so great.. My feelings for this game fluctuated quite a bit throughout the course of my playthrough. But now nearing the end, I think I can safely give it a 9 or 10.. The game is fine. Act 1 is by far the best one and the ending was also pretty cool.. Act 1 alone is incredibly in-depth, and so addicting it should be illegal. Act's 2 and 3 are amazing bonus add-ons, and the Kaycee's Mod unlock at the end really bumps this game to new heights. The gameplay loops of acts 1 and 3 are SO fun, act 2 is a bit slower, however it crucially builds this games (admittedly simple), but fun story. Don't spoil yourself on anything about this game and go in blind, I promise you will have an unexpectedly wonderful time.. YES, Unimagimable card game experience . A MUST PLAY......spoil/ help with riddles necessery, don't spoil game imo ...Enjoy. Really really fun game, but it got boring after a while. Worth the money tho.. One of the best indie games of all time. the ending is shocking, the story is thought provoking about how we see A.I. as a whole, and unironically addictive deck building. the game keeps expanding on what it establishes leading to an absurdly fun game.. As you play this game, you discover that there's a deep rabbit hole of secrets hidden behind the initial card game. But when you follow that rabbit hole all the way to the credits... there's nothing. You have to solve an insanely complicated ARG to get answers to most of the questions you may have at that point, or, more likely, watch a video that explains it all. And even then there are a lot of questions left, and a lot of mysteries that don't make sense. I adored the conceit of this, and I enjoyed following the path while it went. But when it went nowhere, I felt like the whole thing was a colossal waste of time. Such great ideas, so much promise, so little payoff.. A unique mixrure of deck playing game and escape elements. It has a fun story and is quite diverse with it‘s card games as they change in style and system in every part of the game. Not too easy to win, not too hard to be frustrating. A very refreshing indie game.. *SPOILER FREE* People like to exaggerate on reviews, give amazing games a 0 because of something quite small. Like how people would give The Last of Us Part 2 a 0 because it had ""bad graphics"". However, if there is anyone reading this, I would like to make this clear, this is one of the few games where a 10/10 is an acceptable, and totally understandable rating. I do feel like the main criticism for this game is that the gameplay didn't match the story in quality, while there are some parts where the game may be frustrating (when the game makes a big change), if you go into it expecting to change your strategy, the gameplay is perfectly acceptable. This is a once in a lifetime game, it really is as good as people said it would be. If this game has been on your backlog, I encourage you to play it. This is the best game I have ever played, and it might be yours too.. next to perfect fun deck building good story over all I like every part of it the only thing I even slightly am upset about is that theirs only one ending It would be great if there were more but still the game is 11/10. A fantastic game, original, fun and thrilling. One of the best I've played in years.. This game is insanely addicting in its base mechanics, but the real magic lies in its breaking of the fourth wall, and the experience that continues to unravel as you play it.. The Best of its Genre This will be a largely spoiler free review to the best of my ability, it is a very difficult game to review at any length without spoilers but I won't put any in here. In truth, Inscryption is in my opinion one of the best games ever made and is easily the number one in its genre. How the developers managed to fuse a deck-building game with psychological horror, two totally polar opposite genres into one game is nothing short of something that's worth being universally lauded. The game starts in a cabin with a mysterious figure, you can't leave the cabin and this figure, who acts as a sort of Dungeon Master, leads the game and you play along. Most of the game is deck-building and playing with its set of unique rules, it's honestly not that hard to learn and you'll likely end up finding it the most enjoyable part. The gameplay for the card-playing aspects is genuinely fun. Around the cabin you've got little things to do, you can leave the table at more or less any time, a few puzzles to solve here and there that are worth doing and will aid you in your quest to beat the mysterious cabin figure. That being said, I'll mostly end my review here, what I will say is though, the game only gets better the more you play it and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you find. The writing is phenomenal and philosophical as well as downright sadistic. The Soundtrack is also an absolute banger. I'll recommend this game to anyone and everyone, it's genuinely some of the most fun I've had in the last year. 10/10, don't even wait for a sale, it's worth the full price, Go Fish!. Absolutely fantastic Game, the mechanic is unique and presented in an interesting way. Graphics whilst simple do the job. The several acts of the Game keep it fresh whilst not changing the core concept to much. A near perfect Game.. Cool strategy game with a nice story and a nice rogulike mode. Really fun to play. 9/10.. Super weird and fun game. Very misterious, a bit of card roguelike with escape the room, that is, until the game shifts wildly and you are left confused and wondering. Recommend.. Interesting card game but not very deep and you get railroaded into impossible matches that will have you restarting all over. Unique and very interesting gameplay. Some levels are a little repetitive and it can be broken with the right card combinations like any other single player card game.. rounding up :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))). I loved the twists and turns in this game. I won't spoil anything here, but the story and community are definitely worth engaging with. I enjoyed the card game for the first playthrough. The design of it is solid, but it did not hold up as well for repeat playthroughs. It lacks some depth. It's competent, but not transcendent. I understand that the depth of the card game itself isn't the point, but I cannot give it a 10 for that reason. Very good, 9/10. For some background, I have played a lot of Magic the Gathering for over a decade. My standards are high for card games, and this game meets them without exceeding them.. Just play this game, stop reading reviews in metacritic, this is one of those experiences that are better the blinder you go into the game.. An incredible game that every gamer should play. A really good card game at it's core with plenty of WTF-moments (the good kind) that will have you wondering how deep the rabbit hole goes. The presentation is top notch. The writing is fantastic. The music appropriately atmospheric. A wild ride right to the end. Go play this game NOW!. At it’s core Inscryption is a decent roguelike deck-building game, but the intriguing story and ever changing mechanics help elevate it into must play territory. My one piece of advice would be to go into it knowing as little as possible as to not spoil the surprises.. It is impossible to tear myself away from the first part of the game, but in the second the mechanics become so annoying that I simply could not continue playing.. No idea why this game is so popular. The first part is really good: solid card gameplay, great ambiance, and amazing visual design. In the second part however, the mechanics are far less enjoyable. Deck building becomes tedious and the number of new mechanics dropped on the player at once is tough. It wouldn't be such a big issue if the story actually went somewhere instead of trying too hard to be meta. Third part was better, but the more linear progression, coupled with no deck thinning options in the beginning, made some fights frustrating. At least it had some very good twists to keep the player entertained. All in all, the game is worth playing, but I do not see it deserving the incredible praise I've read here and there.. first act of this game is simply masterpiece with it's dark atmosphere and meta-game tricks with entertainment gameplay, but the rest of the game isn't that satisficing cause it is about narrative story and don't have a challenge at all. and you can't and no one can't understand the main plot of the game without YouTube explained videos and it is very frustrating. Over-hyped. It's just a bad deck builder. Don't even bother if it's on sale.. This game is crazy good, literally inspired me to finally branch out of exclusively playing first person shooters and give other genres of games a try. Sets a really creepy atmosphere, the perfect game for a horror enthusiast.. This is probably my game of the year for 2021, barely being out Cruelty Squad.. This is simply a masterpiece. Totally immersive and novel. No other game is like this. A must play!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A masterpiece **** (which is something I do not say lightly). All I have to say is DO NOT spoil it for yourself, because if you do your experience will be greatly hampered. There's too much to cover so I'll try to rate all the things that make it so special. Music: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Style: 10/10 Creativity: 10/10 Memorability: 10/10 There are (at the time of writing this) no other games out there like Inscryption, so please note that this is an experience that you most likely cannot get anywhere else.. Incredible game. Loses a perfect score due to one particular section I found grating, but amazing regardless! Has inspired me to learn Unity, and anything that makes you want to learn a skill is a good thing!. A quite brilliant game that's built to spectacularly subvert your expectations. It takes pleasure in setting up rules, then letting you break the game spectacularly... and it's not afraid to cheat. Dark, ingenious, mesmerising, surprising. This kinda game is why I play games! 10/10. The first few hours of Inscryption are amazing, easily one of the best deckbuilding card games Iv ever played. Everything after those initial moments is mediocre at best and **** stuck to a wall at its worst,. Without trying to spoil much there are different levels in the game that have completely different art styles and game mechanics that center around cards and the results are not very consistent past the first level. I also didnt like the self insert videos that bordered on creepypasta levels of cringe, I feel like it took me out of the experience for no real benefit.. ---{ Graphics }--- ☐ You forget what reality is ☐ Beautiful ️ Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{ Gameplay }--- Very good ☐ Good ☐ It's just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{ Audio }--- ☐ Eargasm Very good ☐ Good ☐ Not too bad ☐ Bad ☐ I'm now deaf ---{ Audience }--- ☐ Kids Teens Adults ☐ Grandma ---{ PC Requirements }--- ☐ Check if you can run paint ☐ Potato ️ Decent ☐ Fast ☐ Rich boi ☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer ---{ Difficulty }--- ☐ Just press 'W' ☐ Easy Easy to learn / Hard to master ☐ Significant brain usage ☐ Difficult ☐ Dark Souls ---{ Grind }--- ️ Nothing to grind ☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks ☐ Isn't necessary to progress ☐ Average grind level ☐ Too much grind ☐ You'll need a second life for grinding ---{ Story }--- ☐ No Story ☐ Some lore ☐ Average ☐ Good ️ Lovely ☐ It'll replace your life ---{ Game Time }--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short ️ Differs depending on post-game ☐ Average ☐ Long ☐ infinity and beyond ---{ Price }--- ☐ It's free!

Just trust me, play it. It’s a wonderful experience that plays with your emotions through the whole game. Dialogue is some of the best I’ve ever seen.. A must play. Amazing setting and addictive gameplay. There are some cliche moments and there are some minor design flaws so it's not perfect but very close.. This one took me a little while to get into. It feels like a bland card battler at first but eventually it morphs into something else. Definitely worth it.. I've been thinking for a very long time about how to rate this game. Well, let's try to dive into this game. First act is amazing in every single aspect, if whole game was like first act it would be 10/10, but it has second... Don't understand me wrong, but first act is much stronger as game than second one, i would rate it around 6-7/10. And third one, well... Third one is between first and second acts in terms of rating. Overall i would rate it 8.5/10, but if i have to pick between 8 and 9 i would pick 8 just because of second act. Don't get me wrong, this game is amazing indie and i hope we will see more games like this one in future, but it's not perfect and it shouldn't be! It has it's own charm and nobody can't take it from Inscryption!. Usually I don't like card games, but this game has managed to entice me. Great idea, interesting mechanics, great implementation. I return to it again and again and strongly recommend. unique game mechanics made this game super interesting, i loved the first part of the game, it was fun and nice to explore. the story was also awesome and i was expecting to see more of the same thing... however, after you defeat the first boss, the second stage turns into a 16bit game, the game gets cryptic, adds bunch of new game mechanics and explains almost nothing. it was already hard enough for me to enjoy an indie game, and they seriously dropped the quality by 95% and turned the whole game into Pokemon red/blue from the 90s. i have also looked a bit on the net and it looks like it gets even worse after the 2nd part is done. i was trying to get a refund but was already over the 2h playtime mark. i would suggest that everyone should first check a quick review of the full game before buying it, dont expect anything big.. i love this game its just sit into my heart with this music characters and atmosphere. Great game. Recently replayed it and the atmosphere is just perfect. And the game mechanics just add to it perfectly. But the first part is definitely the best.. The deck-building game with the various card mechanics and unusual ARG narrative.. Garbage game that doesn't have a clue what it's supposed to be (roguelike ? nope. Escape game ? Nope. Horror narrative ? Nope again) and that is nowhere as smart as it thinks it is. Act 1 is meh, act 2 and 3 are utter garbage. Yet another overhyped and overrated game given exaggerated praises because it's an indy game that tries and fails to do something a teenier different. Mullins is ANOTHER pretentious pseudo intellectual geek that is oblivious to the fact that DEVS AREN'T WRITERS and IT SHOWS. Stick to making games and stop thinking you're Truman Capote, you fraud. Just another hollow concept masquarading as a thought piece, filled to the brim with pseudo meta BS and navel gazing.. I can't believe this game went where it did. I did not expect it at all. My only criticism is that the middle portion is lengthy and boring.. it's an extraordinary game, i couldn't believe it too, but just try it and you won't be regret it. This game was super close to being one of my favorites of all time. The plot is super unique and able to repeatedly subvert your expectations, which is something I absolutely love. The only thing holding it back (in my opinion) is the very end of the game. Narrative-wise, it ties things up pretty well, but it just felt super abrupt to me.. I beat this a month or so ago but I can't stop thinking about it. Amazing deck-builder, amazing story, and a really inventive format/narrative. It's really, earnestly original. And fun! The integration of escape-room mechanics, horror-survival, all with Rogue-like elements and deck building is also awesome. I like all of these kind of games, but they're often hard to get right. Inscryption nailed all of them. I think it's a must-buy.. 10/10 Wow, what a game. I'm speechless. I can't list many pro's without spoiling it, and I honestly can't think of any cons. I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish, which is something I haven't said about a game in a long, long time. The unexpected twists and turns, the secrets hidden throughout... just when you think you've figured it out, you'll be left scratching your head (in a good way!). If you're considering this game, buy it. Don't watch YouTube videos of it, don't Google ANYTHING, just buy it and do a playthrough before you even try to figure out everything inside. It is absolutely worth it.. Almost perfect card battler with an intriguing story, balanced and interesting mechanics, and all you'd expect from a Dan Mullins game. Unfortunately, though the plot picks up the slack, Inscryption never reaches the gameplay highs of its first act after it wraps up.. Very pleasant card game for few hours. Gets very easy very quickly, thus repetitive and boring. But the first coupe hours were pretty neat.. Fun game, hard to say if it was worth the time spent though. It kept feeling like it was leading somewhere big and interesting with its narrative, but it ended up just feeling like a bit of a mess by the end. The gameplay itself was fun, but I just couldn't help but feel let down by the end. Reading about the ""ARG"" afterwards only contributed to that.. It's more than a little bit tragic. Daniel Mullins has always been an engaging storyteller, but the gameplay in his games was never something to write home about. Prior to Inscryption, I would have broadly defined a Daniel Mullins game as a twisty narrative that uses thin gameplay to take us from one story beat to another, to great effect. With Inscryption, Mullins has finally developed some incredible gameplay, but the narrative is really, really poor and comes to sabotage the very gameplay that might have made it tolerable. I won't spoil Acts 2 and 3 except to say that they well and truly **** in the gameplay department, to an extent that any narrative would struggle to salvage. But the narrative in Inscryption isn't just mediocre compared to Mullins' other works. It's really, really poor. Where Pony Island and The Hex did a lot with a little, Inscryption struggle to do a little with a heck of a lot.. An exceptionally well-developed game that never gets boring. (Doesn't have a lot of replayability though) Might be the best ""card game"".. Best indie game of 2021. Such an artistic game that kept me hooked for days.. A masterpiece for setting, atmosphere and gameplay in the first part. The roguelike component combines perfectly with the dark atmosphere and the escape room puzzles making it impossible for the user to get bored. The card game is interesting and really well balanced. If the game had ended after the first few hours I would have assigned a score of 10. Unfortunately the second part loses considerably in terms of atmosphere. The card game is much less balanced and I found it difficult to lose a match. This combined with the extreme length of very similar game sequences made everything less challenging. Also in my opinion the plot that initially seems very intriguing and inspires curiosity leaves too many questions unanswered, making you lose the desire to proceed. The ending left me very disappointed because it doesn't give elements to connect the dots and understand what has been done throughout the entire game.. Rare work that manages to be a fun game (if you're into strategy card games) and an incredible piece of art.. Very unique and innovative. Everything you do feels super important. The atmosphere is simple yet magnificent. Creepy vibes. The tactical gameplay is a lot of fun. Progression feels great. Best of all, when you lose, you get to create a “death card” out of the cards you obtained during your run, which is added to the game an","the difficulty and balance of the board game aspect, which is the core of play, is well done . the game is really enjoyable, but the gameplay is completely ruined . 100% of the found footage content is a waste of time . it's a good concept to add found footage, but the footage itself was entirely lacking ."
"1,068.Risk of Rain 2","I love the whole idea of the game and I think it is totally fun. The only problem is the multiplayer kinda ****. So if you play solo then yes this game is amazing.. Holy **** ****. This is the greatest roguelike of all time. Nothing tops the incredible soundtrack, visuals, and item combinations that this game achieves. It's hard to overstate how consistently fantastic this game is.. This is the best game I have ever played. They are planning on adding Big Boss next DLC which will make it definitively better than MGS 3: Snake Eater. I had it in my library of quite a while when i decided to play it realised i was sleeping on a hidden gem, it's grate if you like roguelike game also fun to play with friends.. This game is great, if you like rouge likes or rouge lites you'll love this game, it takes the concept of a 2D rouge lite and translates it (Maybe too perfectly) into a 3D space, alongside of it having amazing game play it also looks AMAZING, and surprisingly light on your computer. With infinite re-play ability and so many mods just in case you get bored of the main game, its definitely on my top 5 games, no questions asked.. if you like mindless shooter, this game is for you, I don't. The story which you've to discover yourself is decent at best, but seems very disconnected from the gameplay. Oh and co-op in this game is so broken might as well just don't bother with it, it'll disconnect out of nowhere and all progress will be lost, so good use of everyone's time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best rogue like ever. I can go on and on about how perfect this game is, but I won't. Just play the game. 10/10. Hands down the best OST for a game ever made. And one of the most beautiful pieces of music to have ever been written, not even exaggerating. Collect power-ups and manage your time carefully due to the increasing difficulty over time. Each character offers unique abilities for replayability, and the open-world sequence changes with every playthrough.. Very addictive and unique experience it's absolutely worth trying. Although the lack of narrative and story is a huge disappointment.. HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS GOOD. Every stage, every item, every character ( except rex ) is AMAZING and there are almost no limits to what you can do with your character. If you are thinking of playing this for a fun experience then you are in for a treat because this game lets you unlock stuff really easily and start making crazy builds right off the bat. There's even multiplayer which makes this experience even crazy. One last thing is the DLC and the extra stuff in the game, I don't remember what they're called but there a modifiers that either make the game really hard, or make you a god, like the command modifier which lets you... command what you get from loot boxes. The DLC is an amazing addition to the game, but the game feels very empty and incomplete AT TIMES if you don't have it making it mandatory to get it, but its like, 15$ so unless you're broke as hell, just get the DLC and move on. Anyway 10/10 play it NOW..................................................... A correctly made rougelike. there is a bit too little in this game for my taste though. Aesthetically pretty too!. Perfect, addicting, unique! I wanted to purchase this for so long, I finally got around to it and it doesn't dissapoint!. I was skeptical at first when my friend told me to buy this but I eventually caved in. I now have over 250 hours and I am enjoying the game now more than ever. The graphics look good but also don't require a super good PC. The enemies are fun (except blind pests. **** blind pests). and dont even get me started on the music. Chris Christodoulou is an absolute chad. But what really makes this game so fun and what keeps me coming back is the variety. There are around 150 items and 40 equipment, each one doing something different. Pair this with the 13 (not including heretic) survivors and you have infinite possibilities. The best part about items is that you can stack them infinitely. Artifacts and the eclipse mode offer new challenges and ways to play the game. But again, the items are what make this game so fun. every item, no matter how useless it may seem, has some sort of synergy or use in at least one item build. I may be failing calculus but at least i know the statistics of every item in this game Overall, anyone who may be skeptical like I was, this game is 100% worth it. The base game is not too expensive and there is already 1 DLC, with another on the way.. I have over 200 hours on this game (so far) and it is one of the best games on pc ever this is one of the gems of indie gaming and should be way more popular and praised, this 3d roguelike has so many traits that make it hard but fun.. The game is hard at first but one you get the hang of it you *really* get the hang of it. And as an Engie main, I am legally obligated to say the word ""Bungus"" at least three times when talking about this game, so therefore: Bungus, Bungus.. A funny and hard time waster. if you like rogue likes you definetly like Risk of Rain 2.. Risk of bad more like... beacuse its very risky bad game,,, hard disicion make me think fast... dont like! but it looks cool. This game takes all the elements from its predecessor Risk of Rain and makes them better. It might very well be the BEST game ever created, and it is almost CERTAINLY the best roguelike.. As someone who was a big fan of the original and questioning the decision to make it the sequel fully 3D, this game surpasses RoR1 in every way. Co-op was mainly the way I played this one and it was a blast every step of the way. The weapon combos and damage can get insane and your screen can melt away, but that is what makes it fun.. The highest replay value that I have ever experienced in a game. I've been fortunate to play this since day-one release years ago, and my friends and I have been coming back to it consistently since then. The concept of the game is relatively simple, however there is a wonderful recipe that Hopoo baked that makes this game so fun. Creative, distinct, awesome soundtrack, and some really entertaining survivors to play as. Getting extremely overpowered and looping multiple times with friends has created some of my favorite gaming memories. Cannot wait for the upcoming DLC and all we can hope for is that Gearbox gives the needed attention to this title moving forward.. This is probably the single greatest game ever made. The art, the music, the gameplay, the bosses, the LORE. It's indescribably amazing. Seriously amazing. It only being $25 is a STEAL. this game is worth at LEAST 30 bucks. It is so much fun.. Risk of Rain 2 is even better than the first opus. At first I was afraid it might not be suited for a 3D game but then I was petrified when I saw how much it seduced me. The gameplay is really well done and each character is very unique. You can select the difficulty, the rules, the speed of your runs and therefore there is a lot of freedom that makes it both a great game for try harders but also casual players. Because the quality of the gameplay is so high, I would have maybe expected a slightly more ""accurate"" environment. Let me explain: when you start playing, the first levels feels too big as your character is slow and you have only a small jump and a travel ability with cooldown for most heroes. Later, after getting items, you can travel the entire map within few seconds and it feels like the levels are now too small. That being said, it's very difficult to continue playing after playing a long run, as the character is a lot slower. I think this frustrating feeling could be removed by sizing the levels based on the time/items.. good game it has even more women than risk of rain returns so its automatically better. cool characters and cool things to do youll never get bored with this. i played this game once and i died and i liked it. Although having a repetitive premise, the variety of items, monsters, and artifacts has helped carry flavour to this game. Fun to play solo and with friends. Could play this game after a long day or when wanting to be serious but anyways, it's generally fun!. This game is incredible and if you have the money I 100% recommend, great soundtrack, equally incredible gameplay. Only minor gripe is multiplayer is a bit laggy but that is prolly mostly my fault.. Really solid roguelike with a lot of characters who have varied abilities. It just gets quite repetitive after a lot of runs, but it's a lot of fun for those initial runs.. Roguelike shooter to just hop into whenever you feel like it. Everything about this game is kept pretty Simple. Gameplay and Graphics are nothing special, but it does everything right. You can enjoy it solo for sure, but it really shines if you play it with your friends. Good price for a great game.. Risk of Rain2 is a brilliantly designed game thatsuffers from some problems inherent to the genre, namely, the way power scaling works. The game has some genius features, including the director credits system, artifacts, and the fact that enemies cam have items. It's incredibly good for modding. I do wish it had auto sprint, though.. played.. It's a great roguelike shooter. The characters all feel significantly different, but my main problem is that they almost all want to build the same items anyway. It's still a fun game, and there are some cool modifiers to try, like the one that lets you choose your items, or the one that makes items drop from enemies instead of having X chests per level. Choosing your items is a little too powerful though, as you can just make the perfect build every time. This game really shines in multi-player with random item drops, as you can decide to leave certain items to certain people and assign your loot in a way you feel is optimal. The main problem in multiplayer is that if you die, you're just watching until next level. If you're player with someone much worse or much better than the rest of the group, it could be annoying for those that spend a lot of time dead. They also fall behind because they get no items while the person who's already stronger and managing to stay alive gets stronger by hoarding all items. Runs can last between 30 to 60 minutes, but you have the ability to loop infinitely, though at some point stuff will start to one-shot you. Overall, it's a fun game, and definitely not bad, but I find myself preferring Gunfire Reborn over this basically every time.. near-perfect roguelike. I didn't think I'd like this game as I couldn't get into the first one. This game is excellent and incredibly fun, especially with friends. The variety of ""builds"" you can choose from gives it a great deal of re-playability. Highly recommend!. one of the best rogue like, i played. this game dont have any minuses, if you wants play roguelike you must play of this. Pros: - Gameplay - Enemies - Modes - Artstyle - Dev support Cons: - MF POT!. Best game I’ve ever played, the only problem with it is that the dlc is only on the pc version of the game.. Things I like: - Large Amount of Replayability - Good Amount of Fun classes to try - Decently hard boss fights - Plenty of detail in the logs - Stylistic Graphics Things I dislike: - Can't save mid-run - No option for turning on some sort of mini-map Conclusion: this game is worth every penny. As an avid player of the dark souls games and rougelikes I have enjoyed this game for hours at a time. This game is great for those looking for harder games. I personally prefer this game. There are some problems such as enemies can be too powerful but it is fine eventually.. What a dumb game, no story, no tutorial, just start the game and shoot, die and start again, shoot and repeat.. this is not a game; this is more like a drug. you try it out and you think it's cool, and so you go back for a little more, and then you finally get a multiple hour run. 4 hours of your life are now gone as you finally die by obliterating yourself. and then you immediately start another run. Just a really good game go and buy it now + it has a large modding community.. Im not kidding when i say that RIsk of Rain 2 has the best Gameplay on the market rn. It feels SO GOOD to play, all the characters are unique and the randomness mixes up the gameflow so no run will be the same. Absolutely play this masterpiece.. This game is very, for you play with with your friends , if you wanna have an hardcore experience play eclipse and take luck you gonna need. If you're addicted to porn and want to **** just play this game instead, you'll cum instantly.. I love rouge-likes, and this ticks all the boxes for me. Unlockable content that doesn't create barriers from enjoying the game, multiple endings, and a bangin soundtrack to help you get through the repeated playthroughs. Solid gameplay to boot. Things can be said about the delay in rolling out content for console, and the recent acquisition of the game by Gearbox, but those are conversations for another place.. The peak of Rougelikes, and has been one of my favorite game of the past years. If anyone shares a interest in the genre you will be greeted with a game that has love poured into it. From the music, to the bosses, to the gameplay loop, you will experience a game like no other. Anyone that gave this game below a 7 is just complaining about the rouge like aspects in which I've yet to see someone give valid flaws of the game. This game is incredible and anyone that like roguelikes should try this game!. Actually the most overrated game of the past decade developers make 2 hours worth of content and stuck in into a randomizer and call it a game. Gameplay’s not even fun. Just run around in circles and kill a bunch of things over and over and over and over, all with Minuscule changes, pathetic excuse for a gameplay loop, mildly enjoyable for 2 hours and that’s it. And it just so happens that’s the refund timer on steam. DO NOT RECOMMEND if you have competent taste in video games. This is one of the few roguelikes that I have really enjoyed. The many different survivors you can play as made this game unique and fun.. probably my favorite of the rouge-like genre. great game, good time, very fun. Quite easily one of the easiest games to pick up and just sink hours into. Not to mention the phenomenal soundtrack is a plus.. I have 300 hours in this game and just completed my first of undoubtedly many Eclipse 8 runs. I've seen quite literally everything this game has to offer. Despite that, I will probably dump hundreds more hours into it. Difficulty options, co-op, and artifacts make it easy to play the game exactly how you want to play even if you're a casual player. Other artifacts and Eclipse modes give people like myself craving a challenge options to keep doing runs when difficulty options aren't enough. The concept is cool, the levels are well crafted, the music is so good it's on my main playlists, and the gameplay is tight and makes it a delight to play. I'm a big fan of many roguelike games and this has become my favorite by far.. Risk of Rain 2' frantic combat and weirdly addictive randomness still excite me even after countless runs.. This game is literally one of the best rogue-like games ive ever played and will still be the one of the bests on its genre after years.. Very nice rougue-like TPS. Many combinations of heroes/abilities/upgrades, but ultimately too much colorful flashes - sometimes hard to understand what is going on lol I don't know what, but something is missing. becomes too repetitive too quickly. Co-op is fun, but the same issues.. This game has an amazing gameplay loop that it lets you get lost in with its near endless possibilities, while its lore only consists of item descriptions in the menu, its story is not its central focus - more a backdrop to its amazing gameplay. Each character's playstyle is uniquely distinct and the variety of items and modifiers always keep the gameplay fresh. As someone who is not particularly a huge fan of rogue-likes, this game stood above the rest as a leader of its genre in my eyes, certainly give it a try.. Awesome very fun it is long, but it is a very big game to explore so much new stuff would recommend.. Great game! Super fun. I love roguelikes. The only problem is that it takes up a lot of time when you're playing. Sometimes it can take up to 1 hour. The side quests are fun. Playing on the hardest mode (monsoon) is really fun. I recommend getting it!. this game is one of the best roguelike games you can get. but keep in mind that it gets boring quick :P (By quick I mean after like a 100 or so hours). Great dynamic game. Good rogue-like. Good gameplay. And everything is sent.. I don't know what else to say other than its really good! Addicting as hell and the definition of ""Just one more run"". Very approachable for newer players and challenging for veterans too.. If you're a fan of roguelites, third person shooters or games in general you NEED to play this game it is (in my own opinion) the pinnacle of the genre and one of the best games I have played.. 7/10. Amazing roguelike, very repayable and fun in coop. Fun to pick up and go for a run, but doesn't really hook me or get me addicted.. If I could say one thing about this game, its that its not a game. Its a drug, and I cant stop coming back to it :.). Hoopoo Games is a relatively small team of incredibly talented people who really cared about and loved this project enough to help it grow into the indie dynamo that it is. The beauty of RoR2 and why its so addicting is that the only limiting factor in this game is time. The longer you spend playing each level the more the difficulty rises creating this growing tension which never seems to stop. Will you go that legendary item even if it take you and extra 5 mins to get it? The choice is yours, but is it worth it? That's what draws you in and urges you to keep playing. Gamplay: 9.5 Story: 9.5 Enjoyment: 10. Spacey glowy point and shooty with many enemies and powerful items make fun multiplayer. You know when you get wiskey and can for hours. This game kinda like that. You're drunk with power and have to Everything up. The Girl keep asking you chill out but you can't All you see is red.. Certainly one of my favorite games, it carries almost all of the charm from the first game over. If I had to say one critique would be that the game is lacking slightly in content in particular areas, such as alternate survivor moves.. This game makes you feel like a god and then you die on one hit. Still haven't been able to beat the main boss. Was addicted to this **** for a while. The jump from 2d to 3d looks great ! Love you devs. Waiting for updates to jump back in this game.. I like enjoyed this game a lot. I was pretty skeptical about buying this game, I bought it only when my friends told me to buy it to play with them. And I did. I was not disappointed. I really like the graphics, they look stunning, and they fit the game perfectly. The visuals and the animations are great either. The abilities and the skills are varied and enjoyable. It's so satisfying to build your skill until you become overpowered and it's so great. You could easily get addicted to this game. Getting into this game is super easy because it's not too difficult and everyone can play it. The soundtrack is so fun to listen to and it will make you feel like a bad-ass. There are some problems with this game. You could call it ""over-animation"". The animations could be very overwhelming and intense so it might be hard to keep track. I have a problem with the first stages of the game. They are pretty bland and not very fun.. Shooter slasher, with endless waves of mobs, random weapons and cool modifiers. There is a big bug with the game where it constantly shoots rockets when your not doing anything and it lags out the game and crashes it. It happened to many times to me and it got to the point where I deleted the game. Before the newest update that never happened but something in this certain update is messed up and I’m disappointed honestly because I loved the game and now I can’t even enjoy it because it always freezes or crashes cuz of this glitch/bug. I hope it gets fixed but until then I don’t think I’ll be playing much if at all at this point.. Fun ass game, a lot of stuff to achieve, to earn, such as characters and thropies. Also really fun with friends and family!. This is Probably the best game I have played in a few years. It’s just amazing and has a high replay value. broken multiplayer, can never find matches. great when you can actually find a match which is rare otherwise your waiting for a good 15-20 minutes for the next match to be over and theres no clear indicators which matches have started or not.... Hopoo Games what a joke. Risk of Rain 2 is fun, addictive, challenging, very frantic and the soundtrack is incredible. Being one of the games I spent the most time on Steam, I can say it is one of my favorite games of all time.. 8??????????? Wow. ""I miss the pixel art style"" SHUT THE HELL UP. This cel-shaded MASTERPIECE is some of the most impressive visual design from a TWO person studio that developed the game in UNDER TWO YEARS. FROM THE SECOND THIS WAS RELEASED in EARLY **** ACCESS it was GOD DAMN PERFECT in its VISUAL DESIGN AND GAMEPLAY. THERE WERE SO MANY CHARACTER BUILDS FROM THE MOTHER **** START that led to DAMN NEAR INFINITE REPLAYABILITY. However. The anniversary update absolutely BUTCHERED this game. THE COMMENCEMENT CHANGES **** BLEW **** I TRUSTED YOU. I TRUSTED YOU, HOPOO. I PLAYED 125 HOURS OF THIS GAME. and you gave me nothing for months. UNTIL YOU F I N A L L Y RELEASED THE god damn ANNIVERSARY UPDATE, WHICH **** r u i n e d the final god damn stage of this near-masterpiece. Eight out of **** ten.. A great croissant in three dimensions. Highly replayable due to the many characters with different playstyles and thanks to the challenges that the player can set before himself to unlock a new item or an alternative ability for the character as a reward (apart from the achievement). There are also many secrets (including hidden locations) in the game, which are quite a challenge to find. The title is definitely worth recommending, especially after the release of version 1.0, where we already have the final boss added. The only downside that I could point out is the small amount of tracks for the soundtrack.. I HIGHLY recommend this game. One of/or the Greatest Action Roguelike Co-op game created so far. I love everything about this game. The characters all unique and the gameplay ever changing and THE MUSIC IS GODLIKE! This game is great solo or with friends and you can play runs for hours. Overall consensus this game Is Amazing. (This game is a MUST BUY.). Very fun and addicting experiance if you get over the inital learning curve and massive dificulting spikes.. The entire game is built around RNG and progression is time gated.. So if you stick with the game long enough to beat it, its not cause your skilled, its because the game allowed the right items to roll and didnt implement 1 hit insta kills.. Super fun addicting game that gets better the more you play it with a lot of replayability. You start off struggling and snowball into a god that destroys everything around you.. what a great game. Ive gotten many many hours out of it for the price. One of the best values on Steam. Worth every cent. Shows that you don't need a big studio and 7 years to make a good game. Hopoo's dedication to making fun their first priority really shows in every part of the game. Some people complain that the stages aren't randomized, but this would be nearly impossible to do in 3D and this is made up for in the massive pool of items along with the unique characters that change the entire playstyle. The scaling difficulty mechanic was a stroke of genius from the devs and makes the game easy to get into unlike many other games in the same genre. Many people complain about the difficulty and repetitiveness but they just haven't given it a chance and actually tried to see what the game has to offer. The characters are all unique and provide an entirely different playstyle and you can get a god run with any of them. I'm shocked to see how balanced these characters are in a game all about becoming overpowered. The items aren't just simple stat boosts, but all have their entirely unique properties. All the complaints about graphics are unwarranted; I personally love the artstyle of this game, and would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into. I am super excited for the next content update, and for anyone worried about the game dying after it stops development, it has an active modding scene that will keep the game alive for years. Hopoo deserved every word of praise they get, so please, buy the game. It's only 25 dollars and is more fun than most 60 dollar games. 11/10. Interesting roguelike concept, where you can prioritize either getting stronger while making enemies stronger as well, or trying to beat it as fast as possible before the time pumps up the difficulty. Unfortunately getting new heroes is a massive grind, and the core gameplay loop becomes extremely shallow and doesn't justify the time it takes to get alternatives to your starting hero. I got 4 unlocked and got bored of the grind it takes to get the rest of them. I think the series has a great potential, but the reward factor needs to be optimized to the time invested.. I find it hard to understand the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review score on Steam. There are so many issues with this game. This is a roguelike with poor balance and terrible RNG systems, which means that every so often you have a fun run and the rest of the time its a total drag to play. There's only a few levels and they get samey really fast. There's only a few bosses and they get samey really fast. Movement always starts off super slow and clunky, and this only changes if the RNG allows it to. There are many things that could have been done to improve the experience, but the main one for me is that the game should give the player more agency over their build. The way things stand, the player is a slave to layer upon layer of RNG. There is RNG as to how many loot item boxes spawn in a level, where they are, what type they are, and of course what's inside them. There is one loot box that is a choice of three, but often one or two of the three is a question mark, aka, a random item! (why???) Roguelikes work best in these ways: either let the player choose between two or three pickups most of the time so that they can consciously move toward a build (like Slay the Spire or Hades), and/or make sure there are enough pickups that the player can figure it out on the way (like Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac). ROR2 does neither. And on top of that, it slaps you with a countdown, making the levels harder if you take time to look for more loot. I can only assume the people rating this highly are rating it off of their rarer god-like runs and are forgetting about the drudgery runs. A good game should be FUN first and foremost, from the get-go, not promising potential fun somewhere down the line, and only if you're lucky enough to snag it.. Easily one of my favorite games ever. The game is so replayable with every run feeing different. The game is so fun that when I die I’m not even upset, I’m just ready to start a another run.. this game is **** i cant even believe how dood it is dude? :DDDDD. Excellent on every aspect: graphics, audio, gameplay... The only problem? I **** big ass at it but hey, it's still fun. I'm not generally a big fan of rogue likes but this one really hooked me in. For starters it feels like it's been a while to have a game that's fun to unlock things. You start with 1 character and lots of items, and as you play you quickly first unlock some good items and characters and then later will tackle the more challenging tasks. As you unlock more playable characters you really begin to feel the weight of your character. Each one has such a unique playsyle of how you will find yourself moving and operating within the world. I feel the weapons were designed very well. For instance one weapon is a nail gun that is automatic but when you release it fires a shotgun like cluster of 12. Another weapon fires 3 times in little bursts but if it crits it fires 6 times. These variances along with the wide diverse set of items sets you up for a fantastic experience that wears down incredibly slowly. I can honestly say that on my current 40th hour of gameplay I am just as, if not more excited, for my run than the first hour. To me this is a hallmark for a machanic truly made with love and care. The level design is fantastic. The procedural generation makes you always wonder what you're going to see around the corner and how you're gonna tackle the level at hand. The graphics are it's own kinda like when borderlands was big and it was it's own sort of art form. In the same way the models and world around you is absolutely gorgous and extremely athletically pleasing. The item diversity is incredible. The number of ideas you'll have and different things to try feels almost limitless. What I'd say regarding to items and builds for this game is seeing as there's no real winning the game, you do what is fun or sounds good at that time and this keeps the gameplay constantly fresh. My only regret is looking up how to unlock things. They said if you look closely at the maps and explore deeply, you will find many hidden secrets and they are most definitely right. With enough time and being blasted around the map I definitely believe I would have eventually found everything on my own and I'm absolutely horrible at finding what to do in games. After seeing the gameplay of the first game (never played it btw) I'm absolutely stunned they manged to get this out as the sequel to be as beautiful and fun as it is. Top 5 games of the year for me and a must play for anyone who watches it and it looks remotely fun. (initially I thought i had no expectations. I saw the gameplay and thought it looked somewhat fun. I was absolutely blown away.). A good basis for an early access game... Its definitly not finished. Mostly empty maps. Stat check items. Long, painful runs that can and will stretch for hours. Multiplayer is very unbalanced. Either one player gets everything and just rolls or everyone gets a little and get crushed. No middle ground. Characters are a blast to play, each and every one of them is very unique. Definitly the highlight of the game. But they're just dropped in a map with same-y enemies and uninteresting items that do not change how they behave in a fight. It just feels like a demo showcasing character designs. Mediocre roguelike at best.. Even with a small team, the game improves on the original in nearly every way. Better with friends as well.. This game is one of the best rouge likes I have played. With 300+ hours I can confirm that the game is amazing. The final boss is epic and the game is so fun to play, seriously if you have not already bought the game please do it is worth all its 25$ and better than most 60$ games now a days. The devs really know how to make a great game. I have almost 100 hours of this in co-op, and yet I struggle to find any kind of fun in its extremely uninteresting gameplay loop. Character differences are miniscule and get overshadowed by a good selection of items anyway, the only exceptions being the engineer (just barely) and the melee characters (same as ranged, but more annoying to play). Each run feels like it's almost exclusively controlled by the random items you get, with everything else barely mattering at all. Even then, none of the items I've seen change the playstyle (unless you get one of the godlike lunar items that will let you beat the entire game without pressing left clic",if you like rouge likes or rouge lites you'll love this game . the story which you've to discover yourself is decent at best . co-op in this game is so broken might as well just don't bother with it .
"1,069.Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction","""Conviction"" is a polarizing entry since it marked a departure for the series. Like ""Hitman: Absolution"", it streamlined the gameplay to make the action faster. ""Splinter Cell"" purists will probably hate it. But anyone open to a different spin on the series will have fun. The story picks up after the events of ""Double Agent"". Sam Fisher is on the hunt for his daughter's murderer. He no longer uses his trademark night vision/thermal vision goggles or the gadget/assault rife. In addition, he's much faster when sneaking around. Multiplayer is no longer competitive, but cooperative. There are several modes including a two-player campaign which takes place weeks before the single player story. If you're a fan of James Bond or Jason Bourne, than you'll enjoy ""Conviction"". I would rate it with an 8.3 out of 10.. Definitely the black sheep of the series but I'd say its still a really fun game. This does not play like a traditional Splinter Cell game, this is just the Sam Fisher game (or a John Wick simulator lol). Gone are the stealth sandboxes of old and now we have linear arenas where the objective is dispatching enemies in the most satisfying way possible. The mark and execute system does make combat a little bit trivial but I can't deny the amazing feeling you get when you clear a room in 2 seconds. I do wish the gameplay was a little deeper because the game doesn't doesn't change much besides for slightly harder enemies near the end and the occasional environmental hazard. I'd say this happened due to the chaotic development this game had, its a miracle it came out as well as it did. Story is good, its still not amazing but our leading man is at his best here. Sam is now on the run and doesn't have to follow the law to get the job done. I honestly wished they went further into this as it makes the character far more interesting. I'm happy with what we got though. Michael Ironside gives his best performance as the character, especially in one particular scene, if you know, you know. This might sound controversial but I prefer this over Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. Pandora Tomorrow felt like a weaker version of the first game while Double Agent tried to do a bunch of new things while also still trying to be a traditional Splinter Cell game and I think it failed to balance its old and new elements. It didn't reach its full potential. Conviction didn't reach its full potential either but I still think it did what it set out to do better. Its not a traditional stealth game but a fun action game with hints of stealth.. This game is a Third Person Shooter disguised as a Stealth game this game has little to no stealth to it is it bad? no is it good? Kind of I will continue to play this game as it is still fun but it's not as good as other splinter cell titles out there the whole premise of this game is supposed to be you moving around silently taking out enemies maybe causing some minor ""Accidents"" to kill those same enemies but in reality the slightest thing you do alerts them to your presence like shooting out a light so you can be hidden in the dark as soon as you do that they go ballistic and try to find you. Overall this game is fun but not what it was supposed to be.. Less stealth, more action. This new approach works well with Splinter Cell. Still waiting for a sequel. Overall rating: 8.7.. This rehaul of the series included new mechanics that speeds up the action. It also has shades of The Punisher game since Sam Fisher uses brutal interrogation tactics. The game is good, but purists will probably hate it. But if you're a fan that doesn't mind a few changes, than you'll appreciate the changes. Even Metal Gear Solid V seemed to borrow from this. I liked the story and the cooperative missions are great fun. I would rate this with an 8.3 out of 10.. Game is amazing I love it payed 5 bucks no need for stealth it's a great shooter graphics look great on xbox x. Everyone knows that this splinter cell here is the second best, losing the king's crown only to chaos theory. The only one that comes close to this masterpiece is double agent xb360/ps3 version. Don't be fooled by the mediocre 7.7 rating this game definatelly doesn't deserve, is way better than Metal Gear Solid 5 (and I am a metal gear solid fan) the only downside to this game is I still don't get why it didn't release for my ps3 back then, only now with xbox series I had the opportunity to play it, and TBH, i think that the low ratings are from sony fanboys, I've alwas had a play station and I was confident with the platform strong exclusives, but 7.7 is way way low for this game. Outstanding graphics even for today's standars, the bathroom scene is still insane and beautiful, the game gives you a strong voice actings and very relatable characters, something quite close to the emotional level I've had when playing the last of us for the 1st time! Yes, I still think that the last of us is a better game here, for many obvious reasong, but where the last of us reaches a 11/10 score from me, splinter cell conviction is a no brainer for stealth and strong emotion storytelling fans, and it is a straight 10/10 game, it doest everything perfect. It has aged very well and it's formula is quite unique the way it introduces the oldfashion splinter cell mechanis with more dynamism, definatelly the second best splinter cell game, but with the best gameplay within the series, blacklist, though should receive this rating, funny thing, blacklist has 7.8 user score for ps3, and 7.5 for xb360, and as a ps3 owner, I must say almost any multiplatform runned way better on 360, mass effect 2, mafia 2, bayonetta, skyrim, just to name a few... So just because ps3 never saw conviction that doesn't mean it deserved that low score, it is the best along with chaos theory, and I must say it as a splinter cell fan! Putting aside dumb flame and console wars.. For a long time, i hated this game, for me it was the worst in the series because of how different it is to the rest of the Splinter Cell games, more generic and less memorable, but recently i decided to give it another chance and play the game again. As the result, did my opinions about the game changed? Yes, and for the better. Is the game great? No. Is the game bad? Also no. Splinter Cell conviction is actually fun, the fast pace action gameplay actually feels good to play, and the animations and graphics makes takedowns satisfying. The game is also good from an technical point, i didn't run to any problems with fps and glitches, and the graphics look great even 11 years later. If you forget that the game is called Splinter Cell, and that the protagonist is called Sam Fischer, you can have a good time with it, and to be honest, i had a much better time playing Conviction than Double Agent (at least on PC, i know that DA is a broken port). I would actually recommend the game to people who like action, but for those who want stealth, or want to play a Splinter Cell game for the first time, i would highly recommend starting with the first game. 6.5/10. massively underrated game. forgot about it and now bought it for my Xbox One as it is backwards compatible. Great campaign. Believable AI. Cool weapons. Splitscreen coop both in Campaign and Side Missions!. My xbox 360 came with Conviction and this was my first Splinter Cell game. I really enjoyed, the interogations were so brutal and the UI on the builds were different and modern, the gameplay was amazing. A fun little one that betrays the the former games , If you want after stealth shooting game hybrid Then it will not disappoint you , But if you like a stealth game when you can ghost through every level, Then you are going to hate it Because you have to kill every enemy in every level so it's it's not about sneaking through. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ah yes the John Wick game we havent gotten theres still time but will they be able to top this ?. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction is so great action game! You really want to kill all bad guys!. First off I really like the presentation things like the objectives being on objects in the environment. I also like the gun play it defiantly feels more smooth then the games before it. However what I don't like is the clash of tones. They wanted to go for a more personal story with Sam Fisher at first but by the end hes storming the white house to save the president these things don't mix. What i also didn't like is that there isn't any real choice in your approach. Most of the time it will just be a shoot out and stealth is used simply to hide and shoot the enemy you cant do no kill runs and you cant just go past them. The gameplay is still enjoyable just not very splinter cell like and the story's kinda whatever by the end.. The good: An excellent infiltration game. A great story to continue. The game allows Sam to be as stealthy and lethal as always or to be Rambo's unofficial double (as long as you have bullets and coverage. Excellent setting and level design that allow you to be creative with the environment with your weapons and with the gadgets Difficulty selector Personalization in detail of your agent in multiplayer and weapons The option ""Mark and execute"" allows you to make lanterns AI very well programmed and in the realistic mode is a real challenge especially in the last levels since you will face mercenaries of Black Arrow and Forth Echelon that have the same gadgets as you and your same techniques. Two very different **** includes a previous / alternate campaign in cooperative.Exclusive of Xbox 360 / One / PC / IOs. Backward compatibility with Xbox One with X patch for Xbox One X Enhancement. The campaign has narrative and cinematic elements The bad: It has a ""Call of Duty moment"" that cuts the pace but it helps you get an automatic rifle and allows you to be Rambo himself. The multiplayer is empty (this one) and you can only complete the cooperative campaign and the challenges playing with a friend who has the game. In Realistic mode, AI, having your same advantages and gadgets, is very rough and will not fail a shot (with two dead shots and it's no use hiding in the leftovers, they have the Echo viewfinder and they will see you Lo Meh !: Apparently they did not reach an agreement with the molding that used their face for Sam's face and in the Backward Compatibility version on Xbox One the face appears blurred. There are scenes from this game that today many designers would shake their hand to make. ""The tricorn"" / Visor Echo, replaces the thermal glasses-Night Vision and arrives shortly before the middle of the game and suggests that it is not the big deal (although it is the best gadget of any game). When many think of stealth games, they always think of the “most solid snakes” games, but this game teaches that it's worth nothing to hide in a barrel or a folding box or throw porn magazines at Black Arrow mercenaries or Voron agents. This is best Splinter Cell game with Chaos Theory and Blacklist in my opinion , but blacklist isnt better than Conviction . Graphics in Conviction is good for 2010 and amazing storyline , awesome gameplay . I like Conviction and I think this game one of the best games of 2010 .. Splinter Cell Conviction is a superb game, that should be in any stealth fans' collection. The gameplay is great, fun, and easy to master. The story is interesting at first, but soon becomes generic and boring. After you beat the main campaign, you can play coop missions and side ops, which to add some time to the gameplay. Buy Conviction if you are a Splinter Cell fanboy, or you were burned by the mess that was Hitman Absolution. Or, play through the Metal Gear games.. Bringing a whole new level of mediocrity, Conviction is Splinter Cell in name only. I have no problem with developers dropping old concepts and modernizing games, like with XCOM; the rule is that if you're going to drop a mechanic, you'd damn well better make it worth the switch. In this case, rather than the clunky but rewarding stealth of previous entries, we got a rather basic cover-based third person shooter. That sums it up rather nicely. There's simply nothing to talk about, because if you've played any cover-based shooter you've already played Conviction. Aside from the obviously unbalanced weapons (silenced pistols are insta-kills on headshot and have infinite ammo, why use anything else?), there's no actual stealth in the game and all you can do is take down any and all opposition. This extreme linearity and doing nothing wrong is exactly why this game feels wrong. On Xbox 360, there are plenty more games to play that far surpass this, like the aforementioned Gears of War franchise and Bioshock. If you're a big Splinter Cell fan and simply have to play all games in the series, it might be worth a look at the cheap prices you can find it these days. Again, it's painfully average-- it doesn't really do anything wrong, there's just nothing particularly interesting in this game besides the series-defining Sam Fisher, still played by Michael Ironside, who was sadly replaced in Blacklist. Playing both the PC and Xbox 360 versions, I can say that the PC version is deserving of a 4.5 for omitted features and bad performance, not to mention its failure to detect modern graphics cards properly and its unstable nature, but this port can score a bit higher for having a rather fun split-screen co-op mode involving Third Echelon agents Archer and Kestrel.. With the days of play your way most games suffer from bad set pieces because of it but this is one of the exceptions where it actually plays really well, even though it does allow you to go in guns blazing it encourages you to be stealthy because it may be slower but it's less hassle. Here is the break down. Graphics: This is a Ubisoft game so that means that it will be highly stylised with the black and white and colour contrast which isn't usually my thing but it works here, the Splinter Cell games are usually dark in colour but this game feels darker and grittier despite it being more lit up than the average Splinter Cell, I believe it's because of the contrast between the lighting. Story: Splinter Cell has always been a good game but the story had always been lacking, it wasn't until Double Agent where it got more depth but the story in Conviction is the most compelling story I've seen in a Splinter Cell game and most games I've played, instead of focusing on the mission like the other games this story is more about Sam Fisher and it is glorious, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next piece of the mystery to unravel and this new unhinged Sam is a very interesting character and I like how he's more brutal now because he doesn't work for the government any more. Gameplay: This game is also the smoothest game yet, the climbing is fluent yet restricted enough to be realistic, the take downs make sense, the gun play is a bit on the easy side but no less engaging and Sam moves like a man who had spent his life in the military. The Co-op also works really well, the new last known position mechanics really shines in the multiplayer where you can draw the attention of an enemy so your team mate can get a clear shot is just riveting. Co-op: The Co-op story is also a brilliant addition with it not being a gimmick that's just spattered on because multiplayer, the devs took time with the story making it effectively two games in one. I found myself liking Kestrel and Archer, they were new characters but in such a short time I manage to connect with them and found myself liking them and they had chemistry which most franchises can't manage. Verdict: I love Splinter Cell: Conviction it is one of my favourite games and I recommend it whole heartily.. Probably one of my favorite Splinter Cell games of the series. It had great graphics for it's time, great mechanics, good plot, and a variety of weapons to choose from. The Deniable Ops was another great gamemode. I have clocked some hours into this with siblings; unlocking all of the suits and upgrades. It was a load of fun. Just a great game to go back to when bored and want to have a good time.. It is very different from older installments of the series however they fit into Conviction very well. This is a great third person shooter with great storytelling, gameplay, and mutiplayer options.. this is my first splinter cell game and damn!! it is the best stealth defining game ever. i always wanted a stealth game and this was perfect!!! as a PS3 owner the only reason i borrowed Xbox 360 from my friend was to play this game. some real awesome advanced weaponry and gagets, night vision goggles are by far the coolest. completed it thrice and both of us had really tough time completing the co-op mode. the hardest part of this game is the co-op mode as it needs a lot of teamwork and perfect timed kills. this is one hell for a challenging game many bashed about this game. i personally think this is a great addition in the splinter cell series. Splinter Cell Conviction is one of the best stealth games to date. Rather than have players bored waiting and using clunky controls; Conviction uses speed and smooth controls. With a story mode that isn't stretched out and has a much more brutal Sam Fisher; the campaign is paced well and even lets the regular action crowd go Gears of War style sometimes. The campaign relies on smart tactics and sharp reflexes-super addictive. There are also coop modes-campaign, elimination, defence and even versus modes for more gameplay. The story is fun and interesting, gameplay is fast and intelligent and there are plenty of hours to play. One final note is the light meter and cover system; the light meter is simple-when you are invisible; the screen goes black at white. And the cover system has you smoothly and precisely move from cover to cover, without getting stuck. Action and Stealth fans-this is a must own.. All Splinter Cell games were horrible except Pandora Tomorrow. Pandora Tomorrow was very good, but it was too difficult and everything were green, and I didn't like it. What I like about Conviction is graphics, characters, colorful colors, steal, silencer. But I hated the the pinpoints, and Fisher can grab and throw a guy by one arm from the window, shooting enemies by guns, very unrealistic.. Sam Fisher is a total bad*** in this game! No rules, no gadgets, no mercy, what an awesome guy! Though its not the same Splinter Cell we know, which is what the fans are complaining about, it'll definitely catch their eyes!. I really love the Splinter Cell games. and after playing through Conviction multiple times, I can say this is my favorite Splinter Cell game. The story is very well written. I found myself wanting to find out more as the story progressed, and I felt bad for Sam Fisher in emotional moments. the gameplay is as great as always, but some changes to it I'm not a big fan of that much. the way you can now move around stealthily is when the screen turns black and white. no sound meter, no HUD, just staying in darkness makes you mostly invisible. I don't see why they abandoned things like the goggles and sound meters, but this change for the game is ok at best. The game controls very nicely; possible one of the best games I've controlled. the soundtrack is pretty good. some tunes are pretty catchy, but nothing stands out, making the soundtrack very forgettable. the graphics are among the best I've seen in a video game. the character models look very impressive, and environments in the game look beautiful. the voice acting in the game is great. all the actors do excellent as usual in this game, and even some new ones do their performances very well, giving this game excellent presentation. there is also co-op in this game, but honestly, I didn't bother as much with this. the co-op is very chaotic at times, since you have to help each other, and it gets more chaotic when split screen is enabled. Overall, Splinter Cell: Conviction is a great stealth game. the story is among the best I've seen, the gameplay, while kind of a downgrade, is still tons of fun, and the presentation of the game is excellent.. Note: the review is only based on 1 playthrough of the campaign on normal difficulty. Admittedly, this is my first SC game. I had heard great things about the series and for whatever reason, I felt as though as I was missing something throughout. I know I'm jumping mid-way through a giant story based off multiple games but all in all, my experience felt ""choppy"". While it took some getting used to, I found the controls to be somewhat clunky and not as fluid as they should be for a game where diving for cover is prevalent. Perhaps it is because I have been playing more recent games and these but darting out of the line of site was tough and ""full stealth"" while possible seem extremely difficult to do correctly. Later in the game, I decided to forgo stealth altogether and was able to just end up sniping/killing everyone in my path, more or less. The story is decent, the level design is pretty good but (and perhaps this is me, as this is my first SC game), I'd like to jump in and out of the way and as ninja as possible.. Decided to play this to get in the mood for the 2013 re-re-boot. While not as good as the Big 3 Splinter Cell games for the Xbox it's a vast improvement over Double Agent for the 360. The move away from stealth is lamentable but not a deal breaker because blending sneaky stealth gameplay with Uncharted-esq 3rd person shooting is enjoyable. So much so that I am able to forgive Sam for his sojourn into Bro-dom. That this is the last we'll ever see from Michael Ironside Sam I have to commend this series for ending Sam's tale on a decent note.. Id like to start by saying this game is fun. Theres nothing wrong with it playwise. However this game took the ONLY stealth series available and steals it from us. Even if this is the best game youve played this year its still worth considering that because it was released as a splinter cell game it spells the end for the true stealth game genre. So if you ever feel like hey im in the mood for a sneaky stealth dedicated game..well now it no longer exists. To take a one of a kind unique and successfull series and change the most basic point of the game steals not just from old fans but from all gamers because now the only game if its kind has been replaced by just another heavy action setup. This would have done well as a game under a new title but to purposly rip a whole way of playing from the fans and replace it is a sad occurence. No matter how much you love it its still a betrayal and the end of an entire type of gameplay that only splintercell offerd. Splinter Cell: Conviction. Consisting of perhaps the greatest cover-system in gaming, and the best graphics I've seen on the 360 to date - with a solid frame-rate to boot. Splinter Cell Conviction takes a major leap forward with this proper next-gen revision. Ubisoft finally found a perfect Checkpoint balance, and gameplay pace. The level design got a bit repetitive, but looked visually appealing. The character are more relatable and the narrative is better than ever - even the animations all look wonderful. Though the game does become too action-oriented for my taste at times, it certainly sets the standard for sequels to come, being a great new start for the franchise. Ubisoft did well on betting on the Unreal engine with their brand new vision, and in my opinion this was a franchise that needed a change, which certain people may not agree with - though personally they checked all the boxes for me, so I can't really complain.. This new installment to the splinter cell series has its ups and downs. With an amazing story line this game will have you sitting on the edge of your seats in excitement and suspense. But some of this does come at the toll of poor voice acting and annoying one-liners. The multiplayer is also different from your standard death matches and makes it more of a spy against spy situation which can also be fun at times (emphases on the can). Another flaw is its cover system which can sometimes leave players stranded in high octane combat scenes and leave them frushstrated with the countless amounts of deaths to come. A positive though is its remarkable A.I system and the several gameplay techniques you can use to defeat them. I found myself in several struggles thinking of new ways to take out my targets weither I wanted to take them out 1 by 1, or in a large blaze of glory with the exacution tool. The last thing is the controlls. Though confusing at first to get, once you have them down theyre hard to forget. Overall this is a great game with an intriguing story line, bold new direction in gameplay, and only with a few minor flaws.. In my opinion the best Splinter Cell so far. The graphic is excellent, the way the shadow effect are made, the way how Sam Fisher moves, the way how your objective appears lighted on wall, the after close-combat-take down gained system of Mark & Execute... On the other hand, the Splinter Cell series' fans might not like this absolutely new, bad ass, Sam Fisher. Also the game difficulty isn't too high, Conviction's REALISTIC difficulty is as hard as the original Splinter Cell's easy difficulty... The campaign is very well-done, the story is beyond amazing, maybe except flashback Iraq mission, which is totally different; it's more like third person shooter... The Interrogation system is also very nice, the way you can for example bake your prey's head in the oven... The multiplayer/CO-OP/Deniable Ops are also quiet interesting, CO-OP offers you another story, which works like the Pro-log to single-player. Multiplayer contains 3(4) different game types, Infiltration (which you have to download from the U-play store for price of 50 UP), Hunter, Face-off and Last Stand. I give Conviction rating 9; it has few mistakes, yes, but there's just a minimum of them.. Game was okay. Wasn't that fun.. Brilliant 2 player **** the fact that its a different story from the single campaign makes it more **** literaly made me an my friend whisper in the living room... I was never a big fan of the other Splinter Cell games. Found them a bit clunky - all that split legged climbing up wall nonsense. Conviction was quite a bit different - and all the better for it. Some fan boys of the series might not like it but I did. This was one of my early purchases. The game was so good I played nothing but this - then on completion on medium skill, played it again on hard.. Awsome game , Awsome graphics , Awsome meele , Awsome everithing , , I love how they searched every detail , Infortunaley it cant run with out lag in every pc, I dont have a pc Gamer so I need it to install Game Booster it help me a lot, but with out that its awsome , one of my best games 1710. This is my first time playing a game in the Splinter Cell series, and my first time playing a stealth based game like this, and as a newcomer to both I can say that this game has made a fantastic first impression, the story is awesome and backed by phenomenal voice acting, the graphics are phenomenal, the game play and controls are tight and responsive, and it's just a lot of fun, it also has some multiplayer and co-op levels and they were fun, but the single player was my personal favorite part and is what will keep me coming back, so in closing as a newcomer to the series and genre I recommend it, it's the perfect jumping on point for newcomers, and I believe fans of the series will also love this, I mean why wouldn't they? it's so much fun, a truly fantastic game.. I love this game so much, it's very interesting and unique. probably the best graphics i've seen in a ubisoft game since the 2008 Prince of Persia. Plot is so-so but the combat and camera angles are perfect. Best Splinter Cell game in ages. A Must Buy. I have been a massive fan of the Splinter Cell series, beginning with the first title that was released for the original Xbox. My play through with Splinter Cell: Conviction was, to say the least, average. It's the kind of game where developers take 1 step forward and 2 steps back, despite their passionate effort in 'reinventing' the genre. Length: ""Splinter Cell: Conviction's"" story mode will last the average player an upwards of around 6-10 hours, depending on the difficulty (mind you, this is not the same ""lengthy"" duration they claimed and boasted in their interviews. The Co-op portion of the title will last approximately 3-4 hours, again, depending on the difficulty. The rest of the multiplayer length is relatively subjective, because it really depends on the person playing and whether they truly enjoy it or not. Controls: Excellent. Some issues with trying to climb up and some such but other than that, the controls were very solid. Sound: Again, also excellent. Single Player Story: Not too much peep out of me for this part of the game. It's a pretty interesting storyline, but I wish they did a few things differently. In short - and without spoiling too much - it's just obnoxious playing as Sam Fisher one moment, and than being thrown into Diwaniya, Iraq as a completely different person. It just derails the narrative focus of the game for the sake of telling a side story that is completely irrelevant to the main plot of the game. Co-op Story: Interesting to say the least. It really reveals a lot of the interior motives of a certain someone in the single player story, but only if you play the co-op campaign first. The ending was truly a disappointment although my friend and I had a pretty good laugh the first time we played the ending. Gameplay and design: Now, this is where it gets really nitty-gritty. The game-play and overall design of Conviction is quite clear, it's meant to be played as a run and gun, Jason Bourne on speed style game. There are a huge amount of key and refining features missing that made the originals so damn good. The knife, whistling, controlling your light exposure and movement speed, Night/thermal vision goggles, moving and hiding bodies, hallway split jumping, etc. Big and small things like the ones I mentioned above are just completely eradicated from Conviction, all for the sake of making it fast paced, something the Splinter Cell series is *not* known for. Enemies are just thrown into each section of the level, each one being in a convenient spot for players to make full use of the Mark and Execute feature. So much is sacrificed for one feature, and quite frankly, it's just disgusting to see a title stripped of it's roots and garnished with mediocrity. The exclusion of key features is one thing, but the illusion of the stealth in conviction is also another. I couldn't shake the feeling that Conviction was not designed with the originals in mind. For all intents and purposes, Ubisoft felt it would be a good idea to force players into unavoidable gun fight scenarios with little hope for pure stealth. The addition of the Sonar Goggles is more of a burden than it is a boon. Special enemy types are later equipped with these very same goggles, further eliminating the use of stealth mechanics and forcing players to draw their guns and mark/execute their way to victory. These same goggles also completely eliminate the use of one such gadget, the sticky camera (which had it's smoke feature replaced with the explode feature). I can go on about how this isn't a true sequel to the Splinter Cell series but this review has to stop at some point and I'm just sick of having to juggle why Ubisoft felt it necessary to try and reinvent the wheel. For me, this title in the series is a 5/10. In short, as a Splinter Cell title, Conviction is complete trash that spits in the face of it's predecessor in hopes of garnering the undivided attention of the fast-paced shooter crowd. As a 3rd person shooter with some stealth elements, it's an average game. Make of that what you wil","""Conviction"" is a polarizing entry since it marked a departure for the series . the story picks up after the events of ""Double Agent"" i would rate it with an 8.3 out of 10 ."
"1,070.Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope","The open world concept and the pokemon like encounters where the average loading time exceeds the time you actually fight really do not work well. The game tried a lot of new and outright interesting battle mechanics but is held back by its complete lack of difficulty and structured and well prepared fights like Kingdom Battle had. The game tries to tell a more indepth story (even with voice acting which I personally didn't like but your experience may vary) but none of that saves it from being an overall tedious and unenjoyable experience. Play Kingdom Battle instead. Mario Rabbids has an extremely fun battle dynamic, and if that were the main focus, I might give this game a 9. However, the open world becomes a major annoyance because it forces players to hunt for battles across confusing maps filled with boring, tedious puzzles. Many times, I found myself frustrated, eager for the next battle, only to be wandering around the map without a clear idea of when I'd reach the next challenge. This is the kind of game that would work much better with a level-based system or, at the very least, with more linear maps.. It's a very good game but not perfect.i like it but it's short for my standard.good game play good sound,good graphics.. One of the better Tactical RPG's, but trys to focus on the story too much. With that being said the combat is great, the levels and envionmetns are fun to go through, and I'm so glad this game got as much attention and love as it did.. Bigger and better than the first game. Great tactical gameplay, cool mechanics and actually funny humour.. You will have a lot of fun! ..The reviews should start with this since it is the first important thing in a video game and is its original reason for being. The charisma of the characters, the craziness, the cinematics, the colors, the setting, dialogues, effects, everything is very well done and harmonizes very well, aiming at one goal: Have fun, get some laughs and have a good time. The battles and combat system are decent and you enjoy them more on maximum difficulty. The only relatively minor thing is some moments of the music, then the rest is very good. I also appreciate and highlight content made with love, which is there, but many players and critics will overlook because they won't have the patience or sensitivity to appreciate it. For example: the collectible robotic turtles that, when you obtain one, the AI narrator provides funny and curious dialogues and stories in the menu; the quite beautiful paintings or artwork throughout the world; the Rabbids scattered around the world making funny faces and expressions, and some well-thought-out and very humorous dialogues. I hope you can appreciate these little big things in this incredible game.. I liked the previous game, so I was excited to touch a new one. It's a pretty decent game with enjoyable and various gameplay. Good jokes from Rabbids and a nice collaboration with Mario characters.. A frankly Mid game that doesn't feel like a Mario game whatsoever, people who consider this a Mario RPG are kind ridiculous, the dialogue is pretty forgettable and the basic enemy combats last to long to be worth it, half of the time you don't even know where to go. I stopped playing this game and know I don't even remember what I did other than battle. The only saving grace for this game for this game is that the battle system is creative I guess and that there are no micro transactions or an overpriced subscription service(Knowing Ubisoft) Also, Mario has a gun in an official game which is cool. The game is a bit confusing, you always have to complete a puzzle to advance and you never know which character to use on your team because there are too many. 8/10 confusing but entertaining.. Still fun to play, yeah......................................................... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Greatly improved over the original. The free camera, map, and compass make traversal much easier than in the original. The art style is great. There is a lot of content. I’m playing on hard mode, and it looks like it will take me at least 60 hours to complete the game. Combat is much better than the original. Being able to move around freely with all your characters during the turn has a lot of strategic potential. The sparks make the combat more fun. There is more to do in each turn. Exploration in the overworld is also greatly improved. The puzzles are more challenging and better integrated with the environment. Overall, a very polished game. The only major negative that I can think of is the choppy frame-rate in some areas while panning around. Not a big issue for me.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. I'll say it right off the bat, Sparks of Hope is NOT as good as Kingdom Battle, by comparison the latter is far superior. With that said Sparks of Hope is still a good game and you can feel the developers cared when making it, it's just not a great game like Kingdom Battle. Gone are your secondary weapons from Kingdom Battle and no longer will you find new weapons with different abilities to equip your heros with just lame skins, these two omissions simplify combat and strategies significantly, abilities have been substantially stripped back compared to Kingdom Battle as well. Much of the charm from Kingdom Battle does remain but having the Rabbids and Beep-O actually speak hugely takes away from their charm and comedy appeal. Most things in Sparks of Hope don't just feel but ARE inferior to Kingdom Battle but the team jump in Sparks of Hope IMO is at least better and personally I don't have an issue with the change from movement squares to ""zones"". I'd also have to question the balancing in Sparks of Hope, you can choose the regular Easy, Normal, or Hard options but when you manually go to the game options you can customise things like if you take damage from enemies or not - an outright cheat, along with options like Hero Health where you get to choose if health gets partially, fully, or not restored at all on each new level. Do yourself a favour, select Normal difficulty and forget all other options exist except for Hero Health - set this to not be restored so there's some sort of semblance of challenge because Sparks of Hope is significantly easier than Kingdom Battle. Bottom line: Send the developers a message if you buy Sparks of Hope and only buy it when it is deeply discounted, as in less than £20, their reinvention of gameplay ruined what in actuality only needed minor balancing changes.. Improves on it predecessor in almost every way and whike it does have some minor flaws overall it's an incredible game and it's even better than the original game especially with all the dlc. I'm not a fan of strategy games except for a few rare cases in which I became passionate about sagas that made the history of the genre: Age of Empires and Command and ****'s true that it's always the strategic genre, except that in the case of Mario and his companions the type of combat is turn-based and not in real time.A Mario game within a genre in which it is not usual to see it and which attracted critical acclaim also attracted my interest. Even though it is the second chapter after Mario + Rabbids kingdom battle, I wanted to play it anyway, leaving aside the first work made by Ubisoft Milan/Paris and I must say that it really deserves a **** game puts you in the shoes of a team of some of the most famous characters of the big N accompanied by their counterparts in the Rabbids version: Mario-Luigi-Peach and... no spoilers!... with the aim of defeating the evil Cursa who wants to take over the Sparks to conquer the world. These flying creatures act as important weapons to assign to the characters (for a maximum of two at a time) to vary the way they approach battles, but let's take it slowly because there are several things to **** basic title, because more DLCs have been released and will be released again, is made up of six different worlds to explore with settings that recall the four seasons, a key world to fully understand the plot and that of the final battle. The aim obviously is to stop the villain and his subordinates, gradually canceling the influence they had on the worlds they attacked and recovering the energy of the Obscutiferio to be used as fuel to advance to the final destination. Tentacles, portals and wells of this evil energy are scattered throughout the environments and it will be up to the player to get rid of them to free the population and gain access to new areas of the world. In case you are undecided about the store, a demo is available which will clarify any doubts about the quality and genre of the title. Dealing with these energy residues or facing the evil creatures that fill the levels will result in the transfer to a separate arena where the real battle with the enemy will begin.Within this area the player will have to choose between a team of nine characters, three members to deploy to overcome the objective of the battle of the moment which can be of various types: from defeating all the opponents or just some, to physically reaching a certain area or resist for a certain amount of time. of shifts. These objectives differ just enough to decide to field one character over another.Rabbid Luigi is an expert in close combat while Luigi is an expert at ranged. Rabbid Peach is the healer of the group while Mario uses his blasters to eliminate multiple enemies in one turn. Everything revolves around the actions that the characters can perform during their turn, move, jump from one floor to another or use a companion to be thrown into the air and then glide, hide behind shelters or use the basic attack or the slide, the PC's unique ability or those of the Sparks. There are many options, but although in words it seems very complex, the initial tutorial allows you to learn the basics of a title that is all in all simple and within everyone's reach.Defeating enemies, such as completing short side missions or collecting treasures allows you to obtain Star Shards, which are used to increase the level of the Sparks (up to a maximum of five), gold coins to purchase consumables at the Bot- 9.99% + VAT and experience to level up. The enemies themselves have a level indicated above their icon, so the player can always decide whether to face an opponent or not; but be careful because if you are too close to an enemy there is the risk that the latter will chase us to attack **** menu, in addition to letting us choose the basic team with which to start the battles, allows us to strengthen the team by assigning the points obtained by leveling up to increase the life points, the duration of the glide, the damage counter, decrease the cooldown of the skills and much more other; also allowing us to enhance the Sparks and assign them to the characters we believe are able to use them **** the full review come to ****. Mario and rabbids is a fun game, battle is much better then previousedition. Worth every penny! So much better than the first title in every aspect. Smooth and dynamic, fantastic combination of 2 worlds and many cool ideas. It takes about 25-30 hours to beat it 80-100%. This is a pretty solid sequel. Personally I enjoyed the first installation better but only slightly. The Mario Rabbid series is a good introduction into strategy games. My son enjoyed watching me play the game which was a huge plus. I'm not a huge fan of removing characters from games especially games as small as this one. I would have like to see the return of Yoshi, Rabbid Yoshi and maybe make Donkey Kong a playable character. Overall nothing negative to say about the game. I had a good time playing it and it was easy to pit down and pick back up on the fly. Can find the game for relatively cheap these days. Very much reccomended especially if you have kids.. Mario characters and Rabbids team up in a turn-based tactical strategy game ala Xcom. I loved it! The characters were varied and interesting. The enemies and the encounters were unique and presented a lot of fun scenarios to conquer. There are lots of strategies to employ and when you find the sweet spot you feel uber powerful. Especially when you start figuring out how to travel across the maps with just a few movements and kill enemies before they even get a turn. Awesome. If you are looking for a compelling story, this isn't really it though. It's super generic. Big bad galactic enemy who wants to kill everyone. Let's stop him. Simple, gets the job done, but ultimately is uninspiring. The environments are nice, but also not terribly innovative. Exploration is somewhat fun with secrets to be found. Overall I enjoyed this game. It was smooth and unique in the Mario universe. Would recommend!. I won't judge story too much, it's just the way I expected it to be; not incredible nor super bad. Great improvement from first chapter for level and puzzle design. Free roam is good to have. Planets are cool and unique and nice to explore to find all they have to offer. The main gameplay mechanic (fights) is where the game suffers a bit. The free movement doesn't fit very well to a tactic game, it's just easily exploitable with some characters and Spark combinations. After few fights they just feel repetitive and boring so you want to rush through them.. Every bit as good as the original, with enough new improvements and neat ideas for additions to the mechanic, that Sparks of hope is simply put, even better than the original masterpiece. SUCH a good game, well worth buying! If youre sitting on the fence, just buy it. I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase for any reason.. This game is a pitiful excuse for a sequel. The changes they made in gameplay mechanics served to break the game. Removing the grid was a HORRIBLE idea. None of the other aspects of playing seem intuitive. The dashing and jumping are clunky and don't allow for proper strategic planning anymore. It's frustrating and pathetic. So far the game is way too easy. And the story starts out in a very poorly planned melodramatic way. It's not at all engaging or interesting. Glad I bought it for $20. But it's not even worth that!!!. Probably the best game Unisoft has published in a decade. It contains a great amount of content with innovative and challenging gameplay. All of this is nicely rounded up with great character, world design and animations.. 10/10 the first game was good on its own but this game takes it to the next level new mechanics new weapons and CHARACTERS also the DLC in this game is AWSOME and you should play it well done to the writers as well most funny writing in a Mario Rpg Game. This was a pretty fun strategy game however it was not very challenging. (it did help that Mario characters were in it I'll be honest.). Amazing **** has a great story,Amazing gameplay and Great graphics.This game is an amazing game even though to find the directions is kind of hard this game is amazing all around and a true upgrade to the previous **** only thing holding the last game back is the limited character selection and main man always having to be **** that is why this game is amazing.. Still a very good game, but how can the critics' score be higher than the one for the predecessor game. OK, you can move more freely in battle now, but the game has been watered down in difficulty. Battles don't even get rated anymore, so it doesn't matter how many turns you need to win a battle or if your whole team survives. And who the hell taught the Rabbids intelligible speech? Their charisma takes a hard hit with this.. Well, after a game that i enjoyed for many years, this is the sequel. It is similar to Steep and Riders Republic, but not as bad. This game misses the fine details that made me love Kingdom Battle. I personally prefer the old, more tactical battle system over the new one. Generally, the game feels like it was now more focused on kids and really amplifies these kind of jokes. But, the game itself isn’t bad, it has an interesting story and gives some characters some much needed, great new abilities. So, decide for yourself if you want to get this game, i would rather get Kingdom Battle which really feels like the devs put lots of work into it.. Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is a fantastic sequel to the original game. It features improved gameplay, a more engaging story, and stunning visuals. It's a must-play for fans of the original game and anyone who enjoys tactical RPGs.. Amazing game it’s too short needs to be longer I wish there were more planets. The tactics make this game all the more fun I will play it a secound time. For me this is one of the best Mario Games on Switch. Nice that they kept the good mechanic of the first part and added some more great stuff. I'm excited for the DLCs.. Although it's not as good as the first one which I felt like a casual version of XCOM, it's still enjoyable. Story is fun, more action-like gameplay but still needs pretty deep strategy. I think they made a good improvement in graphics too. If you liked the 1st one, I think you won't disappoint much.. Sadly this is not like the first Mario & Rabbids which I loved. At the gameplay part they have replaced the squared movement and gameplay for a free movement and aiming, choice I don't personally like. The team jump is worse, with the dron making your movement, battles has no score, I like to have mi stars rating and try to improve my developing of the game. A good point is that the playable characters that are not playing the game raise their experience and level too, although they are not playing. At the technical part, the game is beautiful, but not as much as the first one. Also, and this is a spanish problem mainly, we can't change the voice language of the game, I hate the translation, and I also hate that the caracthers has voices now, Rabbids are more wholesome making noises instead of talking. At the narrative part, well, the first wasn't a George Orwell book, was a harmless and dumb story, but enjoyable and funny. Now we have a woke culture boring story which is not harmless and with woke and vegan indoctrination. It's not funny, is not wholesome, is despicable. I've finally given up after try so hard to finish the game and you can find the game in a second hand store now.. The original is one of my favorite games of all time, and this sequel is an immense disappointment. The gameplay is repetitive and it lacks the interesting strategy planning the original game had. The level designs are boring. The open world looks ugly. It’s often difficult to find visual cues to tell you where to go. I’d much rather go back to the linear format of the original game. Also, a weird thing, the one element that could have redeemed this game is the music, but something about how it’s balanced makes it impossible to hear, and the sound effects are far too loud. This is even after going into the menu to rebalance it myself. Why downplay one of the better elements of the game? Overall seems like a rushed cash grab. Nothing like its unique, fun predecessor. Glad I got it on sale but I shouldn’t have got it at all.. The game generally doesn't add a lot. The bossfight i feel is neither challenging nor particularly interesting, some quests are not clear enough for me (possibly bc i'm a moron). But the general Gameplay is good and it's fun figuring out which combination of characters is best.. + nice graphics + Absolutely stunning soundtrack + Surprising story + Very well realized characters - Repetitive sidequests (little boring from time to time). it is a good game with no multy player ~. This game is an absolute masterpiece, my favourite game of the decade so far, highly recommend it, 10/10 game.. Update: May 2023: Bumped score from 4 to 7/10. There's a charming, well polished game in there. The music/sound, over-world environment design and attention to detail is very good. If you're able to reset your expectations and approach this as if you didn't play KB, you'll enjoy it more. I still stand by my original review, but my gripes aren't getting in the way of my enjoying of the game as much. It's still too easy, so no reply value. Downgrades: 1. There are ""real-time"" actions like hovering and picking up bombs that are on timers. It loses that aspect of ""take as much time as you need"" to make the perfect move that make turn-based strategies. 2. Removing the movement grid makes this feel more vague and sloppy. 3. Rabbids talk. They're fine as primitive creatures that can speak in broken sentences like previous games. When they speak in coherent sentences and can carry normal conversations, they lose a big part of their charm. 4. The graphics look Gamecube-era at times. By choosing for full camera-control, the game lost the ability to perfectly frame environments. The world doesn't feel as alive and lush anymore. It looks generic and lacking in detail. 5. Exploration is gone. Things are marked on the map in typical Ubisoft-fashion. Any sense of discovery is removed. 6. The battle grounds are shockingly bland. In Kingdom Battle, the battle grounds were built into the world. Here, you run into an enemy and you're taken to a generic battle ground with randomly placed cover. 7. The actual battles are lifeless and it's not only because of the boring maps and real-time actions. There's no satisfaction in setting up the perfect move and watching in play out. 8. What happened to the great music from KB? Across the board, this is a very disappointing game for anyone who liked KB. They over-thought the game mechanics and crippled themselves by going with free camera movement. On a fundamental level, the game just isn't fun anymore. 8. WTF happened to the great music from KB?. This game looks perfect! Its like a masterpiece that it has many great features,characters and more! I will forever remember it in the bottom of my heart!. I sincerely don't know how, but I didn't enjoy this game at all. I loved Kingdom Battle, but I almost hate this one. The map feels dispersive, the battles are too repetitive and it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to not get hit in the battles. I played at normal difficulty and these motherfuc*ers always hit me, every fuc*ing time. At first I thought it was just a skill issue, but I've soon realized that it wasn't. It doesn't feel rewarding at all and it bis also graphically glitchy. And also... WHY DO THE FREAKIN' RABBIDS TALK. This game isnt as good as the first one. Not as challenging and confusing at points. BUT OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GAME! THE VHARM AND CREATICITY IS ALL IN TACT! This game brings back memories of having so much fun with the original.. Very entertaining game. It's super chilled. It's one of those games that can be used to relax a little bit. I really enjoy it. This game is absolute trash compared to first one. Its development is lazy and feels like a game that was made as quickly as possible to make some cash on the back of the Mario name. 1. Poorly Optimised - Runs like absolute garbage. Constant stuttering and lagging. Constant. 2. Bland world's with none of the personality or character of the first game. 3. Would Beepo please shut up? Voice is very anoying and adds nothing to the game. 4. None of the comedy from the first game. 5. Same generic battlefields over and over and over. Battles leave the game world and are taken place on random battlefields that are more or less exactly the same. 6. Sparks replace secondary weapons. These are very generic and some are clearly far better then others. 7. Game is mindlessly easy and has some of the most pointless repetitive battles. 8. Many many many missing features from the first game. 9. Puzzles are boring and again make you complete pointless repetitive battles. 10. The loading screens. My god. Think 5-6 seconds of loading for everything you do. Open quest map, open hero screen, upgrade sparks, walk into any structure (even if it's just an empty room). Levels take 20 seconds plus to load in some cases. Game will have you looking at loading screens more then the game itself.. Really good game, I really like it but previous one was much better (mostly because battles was much more tactical).. It is just the game of the year. Improved from the original version. New characters, plenty of hours of gameplay and difficult scenarios to enjoy. For $30.00 totally worth it. This is a really good strategy game the things that make this stand out is the movement mechanics the movement are what makes it fun. You can't really powerful but the enemies also become really powerful and they make you work hard to get money in the beginning but later you will be able to heal through all of them it eats fights because you just get too much money. The character animation is fun and the edge whether it is so cool. I enjoy character dynamic, but the story was just kind of day and all the world puzzle just make me sad because I just wanted to fight more. Is a really good game please play it you'll enjoy it. First Ubisoft game since late 2010s that doesn’t feel like a total cash grab. Kingdom Battle was good but this one is on a whole another level. Loved every second of it. Ubisoft - please make more.. This game is trash. Idk how anymore likes it better than Kingdom Battle. The story is bland and the gameplay is way too easy. It's not worth $60 by a mile.. It's a great Mario game even for the rabbids I love the attack's enemies and I the bosses were better than ever and the storyline was amazing All around and combat was good even Bowser is playable.. The game is really good. The battle system is great and improves on the one in the original game. It's more creative, diverse but easy to understand. The strategy part goes in the the creation of the team: you can mix and match characters, sparks and abilities to make your team stronger. I played on Normal difficulty and found it maybe a little easy but the difficulty was exactly what I wanted: Normal. The open areas and sidquests are a great addition and they never get boring if you don't do them all at once. The biggest issue with this game is that it get SO REPETITIVE. The entire third world could've just been deleted and I would've liked the game even more. With how long battles and especially bosses take the game needed to be a bit shorter. It's not even a story issue, because the story is actually decent, it's mostly just that it starts getting boring and repetitive. The game itself is actually good though, and definitely something I do not regret buying, but I never see myself replaying this game again.. To be honest, I haven't finished the game yet, but I have a hard time doing so. The Combat, while decent, isn't quite as good as the grid system of the First Game and XCOM, arguably the Idol of the Mario + Rabbids Games. But Problems don't stop there. The charm of the first game vanished almost completely. The Voice Actors did a good job, but it really hurts the humor of the game. In terms of Graphics and Soundtrack, they did a fantastic job, but sadly, the game just is worse than its prequel in almost every way. You can still have fun with the game, but it sadly couldn't fulfill my expectations. Maybe my thoughts on it will change once I'm finished. Sparks of hope is a very good sequel to Kingdom Battle. It has elevated the gameplay and the mechanics to a higher level where the game feels way more open and satisfying. The addition of the Sparks is also a great new layer of ""complexity"" to the gameplay. Each level is well crafted and feels like you have to choose carefully your strategy to win effectively (choose the right pair of Sparks for each character and choose the right trio of characters). On this topic, I'm not sure if I like the removal of turn count after each level, I thought it was something in the first game that forced you to choose every moves carefully to finish the level in least turns possible. On an other topic, I also like the new art style, I think it's beautiful and does a great job showcasing the planets. In the end, if you like turn-based games like Kingdom Battle or Fire Emblem you should love Sparks of hope. If you didn't like Kingdom Battle, maybe you'll like this one. Just try it out. I give it a strong 9, great job Ubisoft!. The rabbit character is terribly unattractive. The basic system is monotonous and quickly becomes boring. There are too few Mario characters.. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope: 8.4/10 (B) Spoiler-free review: Good: - Presentation is gorgeous - Orchestral music is lovely, and fitting for bizarre worlds - Characters are fun and interesting - Simple puzzles make for great brain-teasers - Exploration is well rewarded - Even challenge level Middle: - Voice acting is good, but diminishes physical comedy and leaves less to the imagination Bad: - Not much is left after main game - Lack of other modes (multiplayer, challenge, etc.) - Bugs and frame rate issues make it feel like it wasn't made specifically for Switch at times. The hardware can't handle certain graphical elements and transitions. Very occasionally the game will softlock A sequel of such an odd premise had no choice but to eventually occur. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is certainly serviceable to this end. Fans of the previous installment will be both impressed and puzzled at the great many changes present here. Some are for better, some are for worse, but the overall product ultimately speaks for itself. The immediate and most obvious difference lies firstly in the game's presentation. The graphics here look richer, and more detailed, and the characters are as wildly expressive as they were in the previous installment. The character models are brilliant, and the attention to detail obvious. The worlds feel bigger and more impressive, and the overall look of the game exhibits a freeing sense of wonder and discovery. The game will reward one's curiosity for all of this, with clever puzzles and challenges hidden in some devious places. Each level can last several hours when exploring it completely. The game is riddled with all sorts of discovery from lore (presented in the form of ""memories"") and hidden challenges to tickle the completionist's urge. Multiple changes to the battle system keep the game's conquests fresh and interesting. It still works with a grid format, like the previous installment. However, the grid is presented in a circular fashion, and the character movement seems much more natural. The other big change is the lack of secondary weapons. Instead, you may equip ""Sparks,"" which each have unique abilities and often substitute as a secondary attack. The skill tree is back and customizable as ever, lending more diversified skill sets for each fighter. Overlooking each area are the brilliant orchestrations accompanying them. Although some loops are admittedly short, most tunes are quite hummable, and are always pleasant to listen to. Some music from the last game makes an appearance. Unlike the last title however, this sequel takes advantage of not just one, but three legendary video game composers: Grant Kirkhope, Gareth Coker and Yoko Shimomura. In terms of the audio, most characters are now equipped with partial voice acting. This is a mixed bag. In the previous installment, the story and events were told through visual events and slapstick. It was amusing, and well done. Therefore, it can be a bit jarring that each character now has a script and voice clips. It isn't so much that the voices are bad, or uninteresting, and C-3PO Beep-O's voice is fairly entertaining, but I have to concur with his ironic assessment that it was probably better when we didn't know what the Rabbids were saying. That said, the characters remain interesting and the game has an uncanny ability to make each feel unique and characterized to their original potential. They all have individual personalities, from the vain Rabbid Peach, t","the game tried a lot of new and outright interesting battle mechanics but is held back by its complete lack of difficulty . the open world becomes a major annoyance because it forces players to hunt for battles across confusing maps . the combat is great, the levels and envionmetns are fun to go through ."
"1,071.Aggressive Inline","For a short period of time, this was one of the premier extreme sport video games. This game introduced skitching before THPS4 did. There are levels that change drastically as you activate parts of the environment, including dropping a boulder on a movie set, and unhinging a Ferris wheel. These levels are surprisingly huge, with sometimes a whole other half of the level hidden behind doors that require keys from other levels. Every level is distinctly memorable, including the amusement park, the museum, the airport, and the cannery. You can skitch on a plane, sink a ship, grind roller coaster tracks... Abilities level up as you use them, which can be pretty addicting, and adds a natural progression to the game. Ultimately functions like a Tony Hawk game. It introduced non-timed runs based in an open level where you can activate challenges before they did. Definitely an innovator for the genre, and worth considering playing if you appreciate this type of game. The only downsides I can think of about this game: - Leveling up doesn't occur evenly, as wall-riding and manuals will always be a lower level than all the more important stats. - Some parts of levels might take some finagling to reach properly. - Level editor is underwhelming. Just play the main game.. Absolutely fantastic. Fun, colorful and I don't usually even like these kinds of games. Great visuals, great soundtrack, over the top moves, varied level design. Just utterly amazing! Overall: FANTASTIC!. I played this game when I was still agressive skating as a teen. This game doesn't really cut it. It doesn't get the feel of real skating. Jet Grind radio is better. Tony Hawk was also better. I felt this was a poor clone of tony hawk. They just added skates.",this game introduced skitching before THPS4 did . levels change drastically as you activate parts of the environment . level editor is underwhelming .
"1,072.The Talos Principle","What a great argument ""if you like the story and narrative of ****, it is because you have only played the ""vidia games"" and haven't done/seen/read anything else in your life."" Truly worthy of any good underdeveloped 12-year-old.. if there's one thing i hate about some reviews(the TRUE dogwater),it's people who pose as great experts on something,and then spend half the time judging other people's tastes rather than exposing their **** you didn't like this game ok,but is it possible that you can't write your own opinion without belittling someone else's? if you can't express yourself without first pointing out that people who liked the game don't understand anything,then maybe,next time,keep your opinion to yourself because no one really cares. It is also quite ridiculous to talk about ""philosophical themes being annoying or not worthy of attention,"" even going so far as to classify everything as garbage and then writing that you didn't even put a moment's effort into reading some text because you were fed **** you don't like to use your head(in every sense)there are thousands of games more suitable for you out there,play those. This game won't be a 10 for everyone, it is ""just"" a really great puzzle game, an 8,5 maybe. But everything around it is just... perfect. If you like philosophy, or if you just sometimes question yourself and the world around you, go for it. I am sure you will love it and you will never forget it.. Maybe puzzles aren't everyone's cup of tea, but for those that are this game is top notch. The only puzzles I was unable to do and had to cheat on youtube were those that involved some mechanic that I wasn't aware of. For example placing blocks on top of sentinels and jumping on them. The rest of the puzzles often seem impossible at first and then there's the aha! moment. Whoever designed these puzzles is a genius. Add to that really pretty graphics and a great looking environment and you have a winner. The only thing I didn't like about it was some of the more complex tetris puzzles, but you can look them up on the web. Honestly I don't feel like I've missed out on anything by doing so.. Addictive puzzles that are just challenging enough to not be discouraging. The ""aha"" moments where you realize how to solve a puzzle is really satisfying. It is great puzzle game if you like puzzles and frying your brain just play it. Not sure how people can rate the game without finishing it. This is a game that presents itself as a simple but decent puzzle game, but the real meat of the game is the story. One of which can have a profound effect on a lot of people. One you can only appreciate when you finish the game. I originally played the game when it originally released. But for whatever reason gave up on it after a short time playing it and forgot about it. So glad I came back to it.. Very neat puzzle game. environment are pretty but simple. I have not finished the game yet so I have not seen any form of can and life. The game is a chain of puzzles with beams and barriers to overcome. It is a very peaceful game. It is a game I keep installed and play occasionally with. I am looking forward to do more.. Rating: 10/10 ""The Talos Principle"" is a masterpiece that seamlessly combines clever puzzles with deep philosophical exploration. Its challenging puzzles will keep you engrossed, its soundtrack will envelop you, and its profound narrative will make you ponder. It's a game that challenges the mind and touches the heart. A unique journey you shouldn't miss.. Cool game! Pros.: - Story. Actually interesting to check the story line through the messages. - Enough game depth. Not just puzzles but background and variety of decision-making. - EASTER EGGS! YEAH! - Music. Meditative and nice. - Variety of puzzles. Cons.: - Didn't find anything serious.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. I started this game without knowing anything about it, except that it is recommended. starting to play it I found out it is a 3D riddles game with many many riddles, (this is not a spoiler, by any means), playing the games individual riddle is very satisficing, and you can stop at any time, but, the true magic of the mage is the mystery and the need to figure out what is really going on (as I said, no spoilers here). I liked the soundtrack, I liked the graphic, soundtrack, and the story. I didn't liked the fact that the story is given in snippets, and every time by a little bite. totally recommended to anyone who love games with riddles, or games with philosophy story line.. The Talos Principle uses its puzzles as part of its story about artificial intelligence, learning, and philosophy. Most of the puzzles are fun, but the recording mechanic is terrible.. Absolutely one of the best puzzle FPS games. Storytelling is great. Graphics are awesome. Tons of easter eggs. Had fun playing and solving its puzzles. I can easily say that some puzzles are hard but not **** If you like this one also give it a go for Portal, Portal 2 and Antichamber.. ***For new players looking for an engaging puzzle game, The Talos Principle is an excellent choice. This game offers a unique and thought-provoking experience that will challenge you both intellectually and creatively. ***The game takes place in a beautifully designed world filled with ancient ruins and futuristic technology. As the player, you will take on the role of an artificial intelligence tasked with solving a series of increasingly challenging puzzles. Each puzzle is expertly crafted and requires you to use your problem-solving skills and critical thinking to progress through the game. ***One of the game's standout features is its storyline, which explores complex philosophical themes such as the nature of consciousness and the meaning of existence. The game's narrative is delivered through various means, including notes left by previous visitors and encounters with a mysterious figure known as ""Elohim."" ***The puzzles themselves are challenging but not overwhelming, with a good balance between difficulty and accessibility. The game also offers a lot of replay value, as there are hidden secrets and alternative paths to discover that can lead to different endings. ***Overall, The Talos Principle is a must-play game for fans of puzzle games and those looking for a unique and thought-provoking gaming experience. With its beautiful world design, engaging storyline, and challenging puzzles, it is a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. P.S. even better if you played serious sam game series). A truly top-tier spatial puzzle game, with a beautiful and diverse world and a magnificent soundtrack. Over 100 individual standard puzzles plus a bunch of additional mini-puzzles and dozens of much more complex bonus puzzles may sound intimidating, but the progression of complexity and difficulty is designed so well that the game never gets tedious. The inherent non-linearity also means that you're almost never stuck at a particular puzzle, because you can just move on to others and come back to the tricky ones with a clear head later on. The puzzles themselves are fantastic, ranging from fairly simple ones to some really complex brain-melters, but each giving a sense of fulfilment and a job well done once you figure them out. One of my favourite aspects, especially in comparison to many other puzzle games, is that the difficulty doesn't rely on hiding stuff - all elements are in plain sight, and you're job is to figure out how to connect them to get through, with an elegant solution possible in each of the standard puzzles. However, if you're happy to go the extra mile, the bonus puzzles involve a lot of secret elements and require proper exploitation of the game's mechanics, to the point where you'll have nothing left to give. Truly something for everyone. My only real complaint is with the story/lore. The basic concept is fun and interesting enough, but the reading scattered throughout the game didn't really engage me emotionally, which it feels like it could have.. Absolute masterpiece, all high points, from graphic to puzzles to fantastic soundtrack, can't wait for the sequel to be released. An excellent puzzle game, but it may not be for everyone. This game is constantly compared to Portal, which I suppose I can see, but Portal was far more approachable to everyone. In order to enjoy Talos Principle, you really have to enjoy puzzle games. The game is kind of similar to Portal in the themes of the story, but the puzzles are more logic based than physics based. It ramps up pretty slowly, which is a blessing and a curse. It allows you to get a feeling of momentum and accomplishment early on, but after a couple hours of puzzles that take minimal effort it starts to get a little boring, but they expertly start laying the groundwork for the overarching plot and theme. Once the difficulty ramps up a bit, it becomes much more rewarding. This isn’t the most complex game, but if you’re a fan of the genre you’ll really enjoy what it offers. The atmosphere and overarching philosophical plot are also pretty good. The game itself reminds me of a PC puzzle game from the 90’s in terms of the visuals and presentation, which I mean as a compliment. It gives this really comforting sense of nostalgia. I also appreciate that the focal point of the game is the puzzles, and the plot is more of a passive intrigue, yet still interesting. This is especially important because the game is rather long the later puzzles may stump you for longer periods of time, and you may not get a steady feed of purpose in the game. So it offers a lot of content that you can readily start and stop without losing any context to the story, as it’s more thematic than a narrative.. Top quality puzzles. Reminescent of Portal, but with far more content. Graphics have not aged very well, but who cares? Terminal dialogues are amazing, too.. This game will make you think about your/our existence. It's very philosophical, but also educational. What I didn't like is that it bugged out towards the end, making it really difficult for me to solve the riddles. All in all, a good play, but I don't like people comparing it to Portal.. A game that is worth playing, at the beginning it seems like an ordinary puzzle, but it hides an incredible story that makes you think about the existential questions of life.. My favourite game. The best puzzle game. Amazing intriguing story. This game let me believe in my power to solve hard tasks.. The Talos Principle is a 2014 puzzle video game developed by Croteam and published by Devolver Digital. The Talos Principle is a narrative-based puzzle game, played from a first- or third-person perspective. The player takes the role of a robot with a seemingly human consciousness as they explore a number of environments that include over 120 puzzles. These environments interlock greenery, desert, and stone ruins with futuristic technology.. When The Talos Principle was only released it was so hyped. And i expected so much from the game. But now when i finnaly played the game, it not even close to expectations. The puzzles is okey. Except the 'Recording' thing. It is **** if game force you to spend your time to standing for minutes or running circles. But puzzles not a main thing in puzzle game, no one even care about it. In post-Portal era you just can not to make a game with such a dull plot. Really game is empty. There are not characters, no story nothing that can make you enjoy the game. Again couple of texts - not a story. Every review in freakin internet said that The Talos Principle is ""soooo clever and philosophical. It's make you think!!!!"". Know what? It's dogwater. Don't believe to such review from people who spend their lives playing vidia games, and know nothing more. Whole plot can be fitted in one sentence, but devs stretched it into 100 pages of text. After world B i didn't touch a single terminal because i tired to read those schizophrenic garabage. All 'dialoges' in the game are traps that force you to choose between two-three wrong answers what you not even agreed and after blame you that you choose wrong. As i said the game not worth you time. But almost every puzzle game what i played has same problems. Devs tries to make a serious game but in the end they got a dull and boring that just pretends to be serious.. The Talos Principle came out 8 years before this review, but it's important to note that it was already outdated trash back in 2014. It's an extremely basic puzzle game in which the puzzles are pretty poor and everything else is exceedingly bad. Were gamers really so starved for a decent game in 2014 that they mistook The Talos Principle for something worth playing? Apparently, but I think I would remember if 2014 was that dire.. This is it, the best game ever made. First game since Final Fantasy X I went through and 100% completed. Was perfectly challenging getting all the stars. I would say most of the puzzles are ""easy"" but not so easy they get boring like the Portal games. When the game does get challenging though it's fantastically rewarding. Pair these puzzles with some of the greatest video game storytelling ever, and there you have it. The Talos Principle.. This game made me frustrated with its unnecessary annoying puzzles! I couldn't bear to play any further! 14hrs on record!. Serene atmosphere, light puzzles, this game is just a relaxing experience. This does make me lost interest after a while though.. Nice 3d puzzle game. Beautiful visuals, good audio and an overall relaxing athmosphere. I like the level designs for the most part. It's fun that you can be rewarded with some cool easter eggs if you do some optional exploring.. I think, it's a good game in its genre, but still despite all beauty, it's a casual bunch-of-same-puzzles thing, which is, again, great in its genre, but can't be compared with the classic quest tops.. For the first time a video game is able to combine with profound philosophical basis, with impeccable story writing, and decent puzzles and game play. It's easily one of the best experiences on games, if you are interested in philosophical subjects or AI. Great games allow you to actually learn something, take something away rather than simply squandering your time, and the Talos Principle is one of the best of them.. The Talos Principle was a game that surprised me a lot, I bought it thinking it was just a puzzle game but it has a very good history and philosophy behind it, and it makes you think seriously after playing. The game is based on going through ""phases"" and solving puzzles involving lasers on targets of the same color, which at first is simple but as the game progresses it gets really complicated, while developing a whole story about ""following what they say, or what you want ""among others. The setting is very good too, varying from islands, deserts, forests, among others, even being ""a little open world"", you go to a place and choose in which order you want to solve the puzzles. Recommended for people who liked Portal 1 and 2, The Witness among others, in general I recommend it for lovers of puzzle games.. Many intersting puzzles. Philosophical themed. Check it out if you like puzzle games.. Best puzzle game out there. If you look for more, there is more. It's that kinda game.. Story of unknown the best immersive philosophic social RPG: «The Talos Principle» Not many people know about this niche masterpiece. But «The Talos Principle» really delivers some principle experience to the philosophical journey. What so unprecedented about the game is its smart niche combined with instead abnormal philosophic knowledge. It is in a way abstract for being philosophical, yet still it is classical straight forward philosophy which in its formalization can be found even in ancient philosophy. As mentioned, genre it stands for is immersive philosophic social PRG. But more conventionally game described as first-person philosophic puzzle game. It is puzzle game mechanically and feels like «Portal», but puzzle it’s just the formal gameplay to suit the narrative. What’s more important is not to miss its huge RPG part in it. Because not to mention role playing yourself as a robot searching for purpose game has would be a sin. It is game’s main feature. To get it strict game is: 1) Immersive – for you to first-person relive the experience of emerging in the unknown world, yet beautiful and interesting to find purpose of all this: from what’s happening to the why the way it is; 2) Philosophic – for problems you given to solve are mostly philosophical, those of the interest, not the puzzle ones. Game has huge philosophic background in it and will drag you by; 3) Social PRG – for you to communicate with the world, chose right in the dialog tabs who you are and what is happening, chose yourself and how the world solves (many endings required). Game will trouble your life with existential questions such as: 1) What’s the meaning of life, what’s the meaning of meaning of life, when the recursive chain ends or there is none of any of it? 2) What’s the difference between being born and begone dead? 3) What’s the difference between you and android? What’s the difference between you and the android you playing? 4) De simulation, de memory, de god and de transcendental; 5) Why. Although the game is already 5 years old, it’s engine and graphics recently has been updated. So, it is played very good in every way, not to mention the narrative still being the main feature. 10 out of 10 for the vivid philosophic gaming experience of your life.. I originally went into it with the wrong mindset, and judged it too quickly at first. The game really is all over the map with what one could take away from it. It takes many parallels to many philosophies, and really makes you ask the difficult questions. At the same time, you explore a series of well-defined and visually gorgeous worlds, solving dozens of excellent, mentally challenging puzzles. It's like Portal, elevated to a higher thematic & social level. I can't say I 100% agree with what I read was its theme, but give it a shot, see what you make of it, and let yourself grow with it.. Gorgeous graphics, beautiful story, mind-blowing voice acting (Elohim's voice is so GREAT!). Puzzles hit the spot in all sections; they're difficult enough to be rewarding when you overcome them but not difficult enough to be frustrating, there are enough puzzles to keep you entertained for a good amount of hours, etc... As well, new elements get integrated to puzzles often enough to keep it very interesting. On top of all that, the philosophical aspect of the game is the most interesting part of all.. An amazing philosophical puzzle game with genius puzzles but sometimes too furstrating and hard to solve puzzles. Most of the puzzles are too easy as well, it needs some balance.. The Talos Principle is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. The game touches some philosophical and religious tropes, asking questions such as ""what qualities make a person?"" or ""what is beyond death?"". Those questions are not directly answered, but that is not the point, the point is to make you think about them. The puzzles themselves are witty, comprised of a few mechanics that interact in various ways, making every single puzzle fun and unique. I recommed The Talos Principle to everyone, who wants to enjoy some good puzzles or just wants to think a little bit deeper.. I played this years ago when it came out. I remember thinking the puzzles are a chore, the computer terminal annoying and the storyline and philosophizing not worth paying attention to. It did look very nice. I would not play a sequel. I would not necessarily recommend it to just anyone but if someone was inlcied to like this then I would suggest they might give this a try.. Addictive fun interesting puzzler, with an ok story via text walls. Sometime repetitive, sometimes downright dirty difficult. Thinking outside the box is mandatory late game, and sadly tight angles/ pixel hunting should always be an option when stuck. There are no clues for the practically impossible 'star' puzzles, so trust me go to YouTube. It would take a lifetime to solve some these developer quagmires.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfect game. Just buy and go through it. Just don't miss messages and terminals. This game is a real masterpiece!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Surprised by the reviews honestly, should be at least 7/10. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story (yes there was one); 4/10 Music/Sound: 7/10 Outdated Graphics, lifeless world, however the puzzles were unique and rarely repetitive but cmon though this is not 9/10 or 10/10 game. You got to take all the other attributes in a game to get a solid overall score, it had strong gameplay but everything else was a bit average. It's like The Witness game all over again with the reviews.. This is surely a great puzzle game. The puzzles are funny and logical and there are plenty of them. Fortunately you will have several mechanics to solve the puzzles and not just one, like in Portal. The worlds werde made brilliantly: very good idea to bring history to this game. The setting was a great idea, also: You start as a robot and a god welcomes you. In addition there are some philosophy texts to read, that makes this game more interesting. Portal was very funny instead. Graphic engine is great, it doesnt need a lot of hardware to show you nice graphic. Music is very beautiful, also the voice actors. Bad: No retail version. The most stupid ending, I ve ever seen ... no I will not write any spoiler here, it is not about the content, but about the save **** is overwritten very often und if you are not careful, you cant go back before the ending to see alternatives: I needed to research a bit in the internet how to solve this problem. How can you know, that your save file saves your last 10 checkpoints? So -> after an ending, load one of the last checkpoints, you dont need play everything again.. The Talos Principles has very different approach to puzzle games than Portal series. Serious plot with barely any jokes, less casual puzzles and atmosphere of loneliness are main components here. And it works.. This is one of those rare cases when you can’t help but give a 10 score to the title. 9/10 for being an amazing game, with great (and unique!) puzzle mechanics, beautifully crafted levels / worlds (especially the GORGEOUS Egypt locations - what else do you expect from Serious Sam creators), and captivating plot. And the last - and most precious - 1/10 - for making me believe in your world. All those scattered terminals with bits of information from the archive, all those chats between forum users, all the letters from the developers of the “Talos” project, voice recording of Alexandra Drennan - it built the whole world for me. I cannot overstate the emotional effect this masterpiece had on me. The philosophy behind all the story - it is so pure, so beautiful, that you just can’t resist it. P.S.: this game has RIDICULOUS amount of Easter eggs. And it makes this game feel so warm, so alive - I literally felt how much love was put into this project. No one cares about Easter eggs these days. Devolved Digital do. Thank you, fellas.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Most surprising game I've played in a long time. It gets better the longer you play. Wonderful atmosphere. I can't say its better than portal, because portal was the perfect game with every last bit of fat squeezed out. But, this is absolutely as good as Portal 2 (I prefer this to Portal 2 by far).. The Talos Principle is one of the best games I've ever played. I absolutely love how much the game forces one to think outside the box, while providing solid and straightforward challenge within each individual puzzle chamber as well. The music and graphics present a soothing and lovely atmosphere that works as a constant sort of coolant for the mind, as one works at overcoming each trial. Beyond the intended puzzles lies a rich layer of secrets, ranging from gaming and music references to curious little oddities that leave one questioning the meaning of the game itself and what it truly represents (maybe even life, if you're feeling totally deep, man). I did not find myself terribly interested in the backstory or philosophical ideas presented through much of the game, but loved the little bits and pieces of mythology, history, and science around. Whether one pays any attention to the attempted meaning behind the puzzles and dialogues, or just focuses intently on the mental exercise provided by each puzzle itself, I believe this game will deliver considerable enjoyment to anyone fond of puzzles, lovely environments, and serene atmosphere.. This is a very deep and inspiring game, with the great world for those who love exploring and solving puzzles. Astonishing visuals and great sound design both just feel like a nice addition to the amazing puzzle design and story.. It was pleasant for me to find out that I have only good things to say about this game. Unlike many modern titles, that are either frustrating, derivative, or unfinished, Talos Principle is a pleasant, focused game, that resembles a quiet, lazy autumn afternoon when you go for a walk alone just to sort through your thoughts, passing people, observing, thinking, enjoying that precious little moment when there is no task at hand, no time pressure nor a danger that would force an immediate action. Everything in the game is ""just right"" - graphics, although very static, are pleasant to look at, the soundtrack is serene and enjoyable, the puzzles are not too difficult but not trivial either. Many of them feature clever twists, their structure indicating certain direction towards the solution that in facts leads nowhere while thinking out of the box is required. Solving such puzzles provides great satisfaction. I have not finished the game yet, but I would gladly play something similar again. Perhaps the best of the recent ""puzzle games"" I have tried, including Witness, Fish Fillets, etc. Fantastic little game, one of the few I will gladly give the perfect score!. Beautiful, fun first person puzzle solving. It can get a little repetetive because there are basically only 4 kinds of levels textures, but if you play it more casually and like puzzle solving, it can be fantastic.. Any fan of the puzzle style games, similar ish to Portal and after a good challenge will really find something here. Puzzles get progressively difficult and a great narrative and setting make this worth your time.. Decent graphics, nice atmosphere, and a cheap gimmick for a storyline are there, but they are not the most important aspects for a puzzles game. After all, I'd just come for a few puzzles per session, when I'm in the mood, and I consider a well done context as nothing more than a pleasant bonus. Maybe more useful to you is the following warning: Some 3D games give me motion sickness, others don't; The Talos Principle makes my stomach uneasy quite quickly, therefore I couldn't do more than a few puzzles in a session even if I wanted to. Anyway, here's what seriously lowers my opinion of this game: The puzzles are not intellectually challenging whatsoever, but do require a modicum of dexterity, with failure resulting in death and a puzzle's reset. Unfortunately, there are no free saves, only checkpoints. I'll never tire of repeating it: Bad annoying design ! I'm not interested in carrying a cube for 2 kilometres of desert only to have to do it again if I ever drop it at the wrong place or time when the actual play begins. No to backtracking. No to repeating. No to artificial lengthening. If you make your puzzles depend on fingers rather than brains, at least make it amusing. Still good enough for a very casual session once in a while. For its relaxing environment, not for its actual puzzles.. This was just shockingly terrible. Vacuous, uninspiring, and full of psuedo-philosophical nonsense, there's almost nothing to do here except look at the graphics and solve -extremely- simple puzzles. As a mobile game... ehhh, maybe. It **** and is simple enough, but the graphics are too nice for mobile. As a Portal clone... ehhh, also maybe. It feels like a Portal clone, looks like a nicer outdoor version of Portal, and the game seems generally trying to copy the Portal FPS-puzzle-physics-placement formula in order to print money. As a benchmark... doubtful. The engine looks nice but doesn't seem to push my rig like other benchmarks already widely available. As a good game? Not a chance. Maybe I didn't play it long enough to see something worthwhile, but every single second that I played absolutely ****. It felt like I was playing a Myst-Portal hybrid made by an untalented, copycat developer. It also crashed my entire rig when I tried to switch resolutions to Surround. I regarded Serious Sam as cynically designed, generic, and generally tedious company, and I dislike this for similar reasons. It was on my wishlist based on hype, genre, and screenshots, but it sure isn't now. Goodbye trash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a perfect example **** that could have been that much better by being substantially shorter. What is most surprising is that some puzzles are almost duplicates of others, which is unnecessary. That said, the puzzling aspect of this game is quite good and has nothing to envy from Portal. The atmosphere is intriguing and puts the player into an introspective stance. The visuals are serviceable and the music is quite enjoyable yet quite repetitive. You will be at times invited to debate an AI through a DOS like interface, but in my personal experience, the choices allowed felt disloyal and rarely approximated my actual thinking. It is easy to recommend the game to puzzle solvers, however, I advise you to turn around if you are not particularly found of puzzle games in the first place.. Someone sold me the idea of the Talos Principle by telling me it was Portal meets the Stanley Parable. I waited for a good sale and eventually bought it, but was so unsure of the concept that I decided not to grab the DLC (a decision I now regret). Here’s the thing: it’s not Portal meets the Stanley Parable -- it’s a reimagining of Portal. It trades the gun for several tools (each more confusing than the last) which you unlock as you systematically complete more and more puzzle rooms. It trades the trademark humor of the franchise for heavy-handed philosophy about perception, artificial intelligence and, of course, what it really means to be human. The gameplay is great. I do not suspect anyone who is a fan of Portal will not be a fan of the gameplay. The graphics are pretty solid too. Not as great as some of the higher budget AAA games out there, but surprisingly good. The environments are a bit sparse, but that’s by design. There are some places in the game that I stopped to admire because I thought they were particularly beautiful. Even the voice acting, which only employs the talent of two actors, is quite good. The place the game falters is that heavy-handed philosophical conversations do not appeal to everyone. If you are not trying to pay full attention to, at the very least, the interactions with the computer (most of the documents are unnecessary but some of them are quite funny or interesting), you will not really enjoy the game enough to really stick with it. I loved that aspect of the game, though. If you think that would appeal to you, give this game a shot. The Talos Principle is enabled in the Steam Workshop, so you can get lots of fun stuff and add-ons through there, which is a welcome addition to any game, although I have not yet bee","reviewer says this game is ""just"" a really great puzzle game, an 8,5 maybe . if you like philosophy, or if you just sometimes question yourself, go for it . the only thing i didn't like about this game was some of the more complex tetris puzzles ."
"1,073.Cities: Skylines","Very good simulator but i have problems in it that are hard or impossible to fix without dlcs.. I love playing this game, especially the PC version because of mods and infinite replayability (in a good way). best city building game ever. Hard to master but its just amazing. Make sure to get mods to maximize the experience.. Real classic - after playing it almost 6 years I didn't found any bugs and it's much cheaper than his successor. I really like it, but whitout DLCs it isn't that much of fun. Compered to the PC version it's a little worse, but no surprise there.. Surely a great simulation, that revives the mood of playing an old Sim City. It starts with very limited buildings and options, but nonetheless the game introduce you very bad into the game, so I watched a guide to understand the basics. After achieving some milestones you get more and more options, the game gets more complicated. But in the middle game it starts to be more a work than fun, when public transports is unlocked. You need alle the DLCs to get more fun, the basic game itself it not enough. The price to buy all the DLCs and the basic game is ridiculous, especially after 10 years. Its a reason to reduce at least one point here. In addition it is very helpful to download some mods. The music is relaxing, the various radio stations are a great idea, but the talking between the music is annoying. The graphic is nice. Another bad thing: its only on Steam. An excellent City Builder, the mods created by the communities add a big plus! The DLCs are quite nice and once again allow the creation of **** optimization would need to be reviewed, however.. Neat game about simulating a city. Somewhat hard to learn in the beginnning but play it and you'll learn it.. Still arguably the best city builder in the market. -at least for me- (CS 2 didn't have the expected because it's an early and unfinished game.) I spent so many enjoyable hours in this game. There are a lot great details and of course a decent gameplay here. But without the unofficial mods It's not very good, so it doesn't deliver its potential. Offical game with all dlcs without mods is so limited and lack of crucial features.. Best city builder for its time Amazing technices Great gameplay and great graphics. Revolutionary City Builder Game For Its Time And With The Mods Still Holds Up In The Current Time, Still Cant Make A Good Looking City Tho. Best city builder out there. After the epic fail, that was SimCity, I gave up hope for a good, relaxing city building game. Then, I came across Cities: Skylines and my hope was restored. Right from the start, the appeal, calm music and peaceful, non-forced gameplay had my deepest respect. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. You start with your piece of land, which you choose at the start of the game, and start building your glorious city. The mechanics are well implemented and work great. You start small, having limited building, roads and facilities at your disposal. As your city grows, new buildings will unlock. This keeps the game in balance and is, at the same time, some sort of tutorial which lets you know what you might need next, now that your city has grown. If you want more control and freedom, you can also play sandbox mode, in which you can choose unlimited funds, create your own landscape and make everything exactly the way you want. I used this mode a lot to create (or trying to do so) a realistic presentation of my hometown and its districts. Although the game never really ends, the goal is to create a healthy, accessible and proper functioning city, in which your citizens are happy. At the start of the game, this is easy, because the city is small and does not require that much facilities and work, but later on, you are managing fifty things at a time, constantly keeping an eye on your finances, happiness in the city and problems that need your attention. Although I really liked playing the mayor of my humble city, later on in the game, I sometimes lost a little control and overview of what needed to be done and were some problems originated from. However, this is to be expected when your city grows and grows. Visually, this game looks amazing. The detail does not just include landscape and buildings, but also people, cars, traffic lights and much more. Every person and car is animated properly and, when zooming in, the game almost feels like watching a movie. I could enjoy myself for a good hour just looking and checking out my city while zooming in. In terms of sound, the best aspect of this game is the ambient, calming music. The little ping sounds when something is happening, the many voices when a lot of people are in the same place, the sound of cars stuck in traffic, it is all just right. The buildings and options in Cities: Skylines are endless. Besides the public service buildings, you can build parks, monuments, wonders, art, and so much more. Each new building adds something to your city in terms of functionality and look, and it makes your city look so much more alive. The modding community for this game is awesome. So many new vehicles, buildings, skins, landscapes and mechanics are added each day and, when you are finally done with the base game, it opens so many new possibilities. By far, the best aspect of this game is it’s calming and relaxed nature. You are playing a videogame, but for me, it feels like a little vacation in which I certainly do stuff, but can just relax and watch my citizens go to work, read some info about them, give them a new name, attach myself to that person and then realize that I am playing a game. It is the experience from this game that I missed from SimCity and I am really happy that this game came along my path. Needless to say, I definitely recommend this game.. You can really get stuck in the game, but there is a significant drawback: when paradox doesn’t finish its games, they add paid DLCs, specifically in this game they cost $80, which is a lot for a city planning simulator. Also, when building large cities, FPS drops significantly, which cannot be corrected in the settings. p.s. I didn’t think that I would criticize my favorite simulator like this(. This game is great! The developers polished this game and gave it so much love even after the launch of its sequel. The only thing I wish it had was better landscaping tools, an easier way to identify incompatible mods and understand those random errors they throw at you in the game, less DLCs (Everything is behind some kind of paywall), easier ways to control water (water is the most unpredictable thing in the game, I can't add or remove water without mods, a bummer, and it's so unpredictable, the tools you have to control water and its spread is so limited I often find myself deleting days or weeks worth of hard work because my city flooded and you never know what's going to happen. The traffic AI is also horrible. I made around fifty detours and they only go on the one with the MOST traffic to the point where I have to use TMPE to straight up force them to go on detours.. The top of city-building genre by a wide margin. Whilethe game can be clunky at times, that doesn't ruin what is otherwise a comphrensive and addicting game.. The traffic simulation is terrable. The car AI is allergic to using more then 1 lane. Game is pay to play. There so many Dlc and i play without them and its boring. Dlc everything because they try to monetize every real life building.. A great way to relax, and a great game to play whilst waiting for Cities Skylines 2 to be fixed and updated. Thousands of free mods, assets and presets available on Steam Workshop. If not bought in Steam, but still on PC, you can manually download them via the internet.. Absolute, is the best city builder of all time. It makes SimCity series see as a shame. Cities: Skylines introduce to us revolutionary mechanics that have not ever seen before. The game introduces big horizons and you have truly more freedom to build a tiny town, or a giant Megapolis. The freedom in the game to build also shames SimCity games series.. Eh. Money is hard to make.. extremely fun! play!. Neat game to spend days and days on. Really not much wrong with it and possible to have a lot of fun. Mods and cheat codes are available if you simply want a creative mode. The good part about it, is that they do not force you do play or unlock anything like the (Jurassic park games) so it is much better. Worth a try if you get a chance.. Graphics and views: Grate. You can change the angles, enlarge buildings and look at the everyday life of people and transport or on the city at night. There is no change of seasons without a separate DLC, but in general, the weather can change and the rainy city also looks good. There are only three city styles in the base game. I didn’t like the fact that the water in relatively shallow areas looked too clear and that there was a limit to how big the houses could be in a close up view. Music: The same type of background with the pleasant sound of rain or people's life when zooming in. It gets boring over time. Gameplay: Interesting step-by-step development, many development opportunities. There are several different zones (residential, business, commercial area, attractions, etc.). Maintenance and improvement of everyday life (clinics, transport, parks, etc.). The interface is intuitive. There are different scenarios as an alternative to a full-fledged company. Both simply pleasant and quite difficult. It’s a pity that there is no grid for convenient construction planning and limited opportunities for influence. In general, I liked the DLCs that I bought(15), but they also had their problems.. Better than simcity. Very good game, the best of city builders. But the DLC politic is terrible and the late game tends to be boring. In any case, the amount of content is incredible, and has very solid mechanics.. Good game but you gonna get bored soon in like 20 hours max, Then if you want to have fun again you need to buy dlcs. This game is very **** cool seeing you town **** to play this game for the full experience you need to buy dlc's, so expect to spend a extra 80 usd on the game. Better than Starfield Better than Fallout 4 Better than Elder scroll skylim. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yeah good game, create the city, and then destory it by big waves, buy this game.. Some issues with traffic simulations still exist, but compared to other games of its era this was a great city building game.. A classic that still holds up as one of if not the best city builder, and for good reason.. This is the best city simulation game out there, no other game can beat it, even Sim City. The game gives you the ability to manage everything, from the roads and public transit system to the police and fire departments. There are few if any bugs and the scale of the game is impressive. The game is also very mod friendly so you can download anything you want, so if you want to have the Sydney Harbour Bridge in your city you can. My only problem with the game is that way too many features are locked behind an expansive and expensive selection of DLCs, this is a Paradox game after all. Now you can the game without DLCs and still have a lot of fun if you download mods but thats not something a game should make you do if you don't want to spend hundreds on overpriced DLCs. At the end of the day though, the game is still astonishing so it would be worth your time.. This game is potential wasted. It has great graphics, asset creators, and is almost perfect for those who just like to create cities to look at. If you want a city simulator, though, Cities: Skylines falls flat on its face. There is very little content in the vanilla game. To actually have a good experience, one needs to purchase a load of DLCs. The graphics, while better than some games, are not optimized for all but the most high-end computers. Even with the lowest graphics settings, I struggle to get more than 5fps. To make this game playable, one needs mods, which is unfortunate for such an expensive game. The simulation is not realistic, and does not represent how actual cities work. It is very hard to go bankrupt, even on the hardest settings, and one spends the whole game fixing traffic around freight rail stations. Additionally, big deathwaves come through the city, and kill off half of your population every now and then for no reason. There is no mixed-use zoning. You can't have streets without cars. You can't have alleyways, or canals, or a lot of the things that make real-life cities good. Transportation is basically swept under the rug, and the way people get around shares no resemblance to real-life. There is a lot of potential here for the ultimate city-building game. Unfortunately, there are a few humongous flaws that hold it back.. i think cities skylines is a wonderful game but it has its down sides. but i do love this game. Very good game but it has its issues, one of the issues is that you have to spend an unbelievable amount of money to get all the DlCs even when its on sale. The game does get a bit repetitive but you can set yourself challenges and it would help you keep playing but ultimately this game is a game you can actually play for a long time without getting bored.. One of the best urban planning simulators today, it's pretty boring to play without DLC, but thank you that new buildings are not hidden in the battle pass. In general, it's fun to go to build a dream city from time to time.. Why isn’t there ground pounding in this game! I’ve invested so much money to get all the mods but I still can’t ground pound. Henry Ford/11. This is a city PAINTER, not a city simulator. The only thing it simulates is traffic. The economics are absolutely laughable.. One of the best simulation games and undoubtedly the best city simulation game so far. Of course it is for the game quality and most importantly, all sorts of mods within the steam workshops.. n short, the game is good, but the sad thing is that for a good and ""fast"" game you need at least a powerful computer, with my computer time starts to go very slowly over time, I understand that the problem is not with me, but the developers could optimize the game more, and so the game is cool. Yeah good game, create the city, and then destory it by big waves, buy this game.. A beautiful and incredibly feature rich city builder that will continue to be expanded at pace for many years to come through the wonderful community mods and expansions!! This is how city sims should be!! * Huge maps * A deep transportation system * In game citizens that feel like they're really actually living in your city! * Both simple and complex tools depending on how deep you want to go * A fully integrated mods and custom assets experience, with a highly active community I could go on and on.... You can tell the developer's built Cities Skylines with real passion for the genre and to deliver a fantastic experience for the players. They genuinely want people to love this game, and because of this **** seems the player's do! Well done Colossal Order and Paradox!. You do the same things over and over again, there is no in depth politics system and the game is mostly about optimizing things. New discoveries are only done in the beginning; later on it gets repetitive.. Without a doubt my favorite game of all time. I could never have imagined to play a game 500+ hours and still can't get enough. Of course the game is what it is thanks to the super active modding community but I wouldn't suggest any modding other than visuals for the beginners, at least for the first play through. The performance of the game is its weakest point where it can't take full advantage of modern CPUs but considering it's a 2015 game, not that bad either. Hoping they will fix it for the sequal.. I'll be honest, this wasn't that great at launch, but was better than SimCity 2013. Throughout the years, with many updates and DLCs (as well as the great community of modders and asset makers on the Steam Workshop), it's turned into a fantastic game. It's turned into an extremely fun city builder that I think is now even better than SimCity 4. The vanilla game traffic AI is atrocious, but TM:PE easily fixes that up. Lots of cool custom assets to build any sort of themed city. I hope that a sequel comes out and incorporates many of the must have mods for this game.. This is a dream come true kind **** to me when it was released. A city builder with depth. Finally, something after Simcity 4. Over the course of the last 7 years, I have played this game for around 100 hours. I have most of the DLCs too. It's still the best big modern city builder game in the market. However, coming from the developers of Cities in Motion, the game feels more of a traffic simulator. It doesn't take away from the game in any way. You can add mods to improve your experience. I'm not a mods guy. Must buy for any city builder fans!. This is a great citybuilder and it is fantastic fun. The few drawbacks are some of the vanilla assets from 2015 don't look as good as the newer stuff and some of the depth requires DLC and mods.. The game could also benefit from some more late game content, but as a citybuilder I can't rate it any less considering how much I like to play this game. Hope more game play centric DLC is released.. The best city builder it years. Not perfect though. Its on the right path for an extremely good city builder in a sequel though.. Overall a fun city sim. Nothing really super special about the game. Unfortunately, you need mods in order to truly unlock this game's creative potential. Not to mention all of the expensive DLC, some of which don't add much to the overall experience. Highly CPU-intensive game which can be slow at times. But managing traffic is fun, so 8/10.. Undoubtedly it is a very cool game that guarantees hours of gameplay. The city management system is theoretically simple, but as the city grows, it becomes complex and challenging. Despite being a game that was released 7 years ago, it still has its place! It's not one of those games that you care about graphics (although the graphics are reasonably good) and it guarantees hours of fun. I recommend!. Loads of stuff to do, and i like how it comes with an unlimited money mod for sandbox!. Best city builder right now with a little problems about performance but it is stable. Has a good and big community doing mods to improve the performance and the experience. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. Such a nice relaxing game with one of the best modding communities you can find for a PC game. The developers commitment to brining out new content and their support for the modding community means that this really is a game you can sink countless hours into. A game that fulfills my childhood dreams of building my own city of course there is DLC as usual in Paradox games, but there is also the support of the workshop, where you can find many valuable mods that do not differ from the paid extras. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 83 IIIIIIIIII====================. Alright game, keeps you entertained for a while. (Keep in mind I played it without any expansion packs and barely any mods). good execution and a well fleshed-out game. have spent many hours over the years here. This is the best building city game. You can do whatever you want, build metropolis, yes, bulid small village, yes. With mods the game is better, but the dlc, you can install mods. All npc have, home, car, work, and day cycle. They go to work and get back to home, there are unemployed. This games are best from building city games.. Really good one citi builder, outperformes simcity sooooo much. spand more than 100hours into it. There is a lot to do in here. if u like citybuilders just try it 9/10. Just just... LIIIIKKKEEE IT! the sim city is a sit when you play this game.. The game was accessible enough to play. The game was not engaging enough to trigger flow state. The gunplay was too dull.. Good game play, dynamic data, takes hundred of hours gaming, good graphics.. Most of the score 10 reviews are people rating this game because of the simple fact that its ""Not EA"" but let me brake this thing down: ""Paradox"" has gotten like EA (here come all the fanboys), they release micro DLC after micro DLC (that cost a lot of money, like 30$ a pop) while some glaring issues in the game never get fixed. This game is not better than SimCity 4, Its nowhere near SimCity 4, it can't touch SimCity 4 So what is it? Hype, delusion and marketing :) I don't think this game is worth playing at all, I think its very tedious actually. Fun for about 9 hours, then It becomes a grind and traffic fixing simulator. But don't let me steer you away from this game! Go ahead and buy It if the money is burning in your pockets. 3/10 - Very underwhelming. Okay, it's good. No, wait, It is the single-best game I have ever played. I am rating it 10, to offset the negative reviews. it deserves 0 negative reviews. So if it wasn't for that, 9. Why? because of the shallow tourism and non-modular buildings, which would have been cool to see. So honestly, those are petty complaints in a sea of great gameplay. MICROMANAGEMENT PEOPLE! BUY IT!. Even Tho It's Optimize like trash It's really fun I even bought some DLC, and it adds so much to the game good job Colossal Order Ltd. and Paradox Interactive when you buy the game for the first time it's one of the best city builders out there with you having to manage sewage water power and ECT. When I bought the game for the first time I kinda got bored really fast then when I bought some DLC it changed a ton of stuff BEST CITY BUILDER OUT THERE now I'm going to get to rating it How it's Optimized 10/10 even tho it Feels Like It's lagging it's still a good game Amount Of Stuff To Do 10/10 So Much To Do! How Much DLC Effects The Game 10/10 Adds A Lot To This Game OVR Rating 10/10. Great game, even better with mods. Almost everything missing in the game can be fixed with mods.. Your only and best chance as a city building game. Sometimes, explaining problems also gives little information. Apart from that, it also creates unnecessary problems, but otherwise, it is perfect.. At the initial release, it was a great game. 5 years later, it is the modding community that makes this game still playable. The only criticism I have is the DLC strategy and severe performance issues. It's really time for a successor.. This game is milestone! I played this game +500h and only after so much time I got bored, but this is more because after exceeding 650 000 people in city it started to hang a bit and work slowly on my gaming computer. But despite this, I highly recommend the game, it develops creative thinking and the concept of world, thanks to mods you can upload cool buildings and vehicles and extend the city to the entire map. I don't regret wasting all hours in this game. If we want extend city so much you will have at least i5 9400F and 16gb of ram, but it is worth. Recommend it to everyone. The game is very good, but without some mods or DLC(of which there are sooooo many)the game is not for long.. An amazing city-builder. Since its release it made great progress. It is beautiful, soundtrack and audio atmosphere are great. The level of customization is impressive and it is incredibly complete and not too difficult. It is hard to be a PC game when the date of your release rhymes with those of 'GTA V', 'The Witcher 3', 'Rocket League', 'Kerbal Space Program' and 'Ori and the blind Forest'. Cities: Skylines"" should have had more public visibility. Steam achievements bring a whole lot more challenge. Steam workshop is also a true blessing since other players appear to be really creative, smart and altruistic. To unlock all the content of this game you will need more than 500 hours of gameplay, making different cities organized in different ways. The game encourages you to think a lot about how you choose to develop buildings. Add-on's are a huge exaggeration: they are expensive, some of them bring nothing but few buildings, even when installed they appear to be non-functional, andthey spoil all the achievements of the Steam platform.. Good game. Give it a try it has nice graphics and mod community is very big.. None intuitive game... Didn't know how to start and on this kind of game, it""s too bad... You must build roads to evolve your cities?? In despite of this, it seems quite beautiful.... ı think game good becasue it really give the feeling of building a city very successful. It is nice to watch the city from afar. The best strategy of its kind. The best city-builder there is. Brought so many new mechanics to the lovers of this genre. The only successor to the SimCity series. if you have workshop, the playtime of this game is endless.. When Skylines when on sale, I picked it up with some of the DLC. I played it for about 12 hours. Here is my personal view on the Good and Bad... ----- THE GOOD Full Weather Effects Night/Day Cycle Tons of Mods ----- THE BAD Lags at points, even on top end systems. Repetitive Buildings (same over and over). Can't zoom to ground level without a mod. The AI traffic is not very good. Only a few of the DLC's are note worthy. Graphics are not very good for 2015. The music could have been better. Citizens can actually teleport. ----- So, Skylines is not a horrible game, but it's not a great game either. SimCity 4 with Rush Hour is much better. Even SimCity Societies is a little better. So, I'm not sure what all the hype is about Skylines. All I know is, it's not for me. I give it a 6.. Have been A Simcity Fan And This is the second generation. It's Amazing! It Has More Features With A Good Community And Mods Including Assets!. Currently the best city builder sandbox management game out there in my opinion. 7/10 With DLC-s 8-9/10 The dlc expansions enriches the experience, but its best with mods and accessoriesfrom the workshop. 10/10 Good graphics, very good sounds and music (radio stations). You may switch stations from time to time (after like 5 hours), but it basically never gets old to listen, and everyone can find heir own desired taste to listen to, with some interesting and most times funny interactions, news, and commercials as well. I find it almost a necessity at this point to have mods. To be able to build fast, efficient, and CLEAN! To set custom give way, no crossing, etc rules to junctions, Set custom traffic bans, speed limits, but if someone really wants to fool around and ""break"" the game, you can also have unlimited money, needs, etc....there are a TON of mods. Also there are quite a few models as well (bus,train,tram,trolley,etc...). This is the typical type of game, you will spend HOURS upon hours, and can never stop, because just tidy this junction, just add 1 more stadium, set 2 more buses to this busy monorail line, just 1 more barrack to boost this industry's zone efficiency/yield, a meteor strike incoming...need some shelters and routes ASAP, **** get my point. :). This is basically a loveletter toward simcity and way better than simcity 2013. The mod community is awesome and Best city building game after the Simcity series :D. i just want to hug out the developers for doing this masterpiece! I spend my money with pleasure on Cities Skylines. M-A-S-T-E-R-P-I-E-C-E Electronic Arts better learn how to make an amazing game with a honest price.. Even years later with continued release of content expansions this game is still fun. Unlimited ways to build and design cities plus new content means many more years of play. Terrific value for the money considering the replay value. Belongs in every gamer's library.. My big problem is that the developers did not warn me that their game would destroy my life/career/relationships with engaging and addictive gameplay. JK, but this game is seriously great, and super cheap during a sale. The two must have expansions are ""Mass Transit"" and ""Industries"". 11/10, the TRUE sequel to SimCity 4.. An excellent urban simulator, that's just infuriates the game so that you are immersed in the game completely, you need DLS. Best city builder on the market, having steam mods support and not having bigger bugs. If you want to have some additional you can choose from one of many DLC's.. My favourite city builder Pros Lots of content Workshop support Great price Cons Runs pretty badly A lot of DLCs. Optimized Like Garbage ! i have an i 7700 with an gtx 1060 and it runs about 14 fps. This game has everything a City builder fan needs. The graphics look fine and the music is ok but it gets repetitive after a time and even annoying. But the gameplay shows the strenghts of C:S : It offers all the things you expect of a city builder like building streets or maintaining emergency services and the maps are massive. Every map is divided into 81 2*2km² squares. In the base game you can only build on 9 of them but with the help of mods you can unlock avery tile and build on a massive map that is almost 26.000km² big. And mods are the biggest selling point of this game. Everyone can submit mods and you can download any mod you want some of them I would consider as essentials. This game is just overall good it doesn´t have one big feature rather it is great in every aspect.. Everything you want from a city building game, tho the dlcs being too expensive can be a problem. It really depends what you are looking for when you play a city builder- Cities:Skylines gives you all the tools to build a beautiful city with fantastic vistas and a shear endless pipeline of mods to make really impressive screenshots. Should you however search for something that requires strategy, planning and management, you might get bored and/or frustrated really fast. Unfortunately the developers focused mostly on the cosmetical aspects and added a number of DLCs and patches that more or less forgot about the simulation and instead had you plop down buildings like in the long (and rightfully) forgotten ""Sim City Societies"", producing large sums of money until you literally have no use for it anymore, while clogging up your streets to the point where the 5000 inhabitants of your little paradise need a network of highways and public transport like the kind of metropolis that it will never be for that very reason. The traffic has been a disaster since day one, and up until this day cars will calculate their path based on their goal, not the avaiable space, so you will have to use workarounds that, while not really fixing anything kill any kind of immersion or realism, which I was really looking forward to. This will slowly cause a meltdown of the whole city since most ""agents"" that control the simulation are dependent on traffic. But it doesn't matter anyway- people are always happy, as long as they have electricity, water and a road to wait on. And so should you: As long as the game starts - with ridiculous loading times - and you found the button to mute the subpar music, this is still the best 3D-city-builder out there. The development team has been riding on the wave of hate against EA and their indeed inferior Sim-City-Not-Five. Even these days people seem to think that they are dealing with an indie developer that really needs every penny since they saved the genre, but five years later they have become exactly what they swore to destroy (insert Obi-Wan screaming at Anakin here). If you don't care for your rights as a consumer and have too much money, you can add 2 points to my rating: I deduced one point for the terrible DLC-policy and one more for the changed license agreement that was forced onto me years after my purchase.. [ ] Perfect [x] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber ","after playing it almost 6 years I didn't find any bugs and it's much cheaper than his successor . Surely a great simulation, that revives the mood of playing an old Sim City."
"1,074.DiRT Rally","Not fun for casuals. What is the problem with difficulty sliders exactly? That you’ll feel smaller if someone else can accomplish what you did in a video game? That’s sad. Almost as sad as saying “get good” instead of accepting criticism. It might be surprising to find this out, but some people like to enjoy games without sweating and have zero interest at all in learning the finer things about cars and rally racing. Some people would like a very basic driving option. Refer to Dirt 5 for the solution. And to all you try hards, honestly, get a real life hobby and let the games be for fun.. Super realistic gameplay super realistic graphics, lastly played the rally game on ps1, what an amazing development, really like the red mini cooper. Terrible game. The RWD handling on dirt and gravel is far too sensitive, meaning you have to drive too slowly or retry countless times till you learn the stage. There's enough different cars, but each class has one outstanding car which renders the others pointless. Dirt Rally was, almost certainly, not even tested on a console gamepad, as it's virtually unplayable - but the game is far too minimal to be worth buying an entry level wheel and pedals for (>£150!). Game modes are very poor. Rally Cross has unfair AI at top level, where the AI cars drive flat out even when sideways and are solid when shunted, but easily smash you off the track when you're winning. There's no time attack mode, no ghost cars, no real way to test set ups, there's no official World Rally Championship licence - which is very **** d l y considering how low budget WRC has gone, so they could've bought it cheaply. The fake rally season mode only has 6, yes SIX, events! It all seems pointless. Online modes and leaderboards are worthless, only silly Rally Cross races against humans, who no doubt cheat as there's no non-collision options, and no downloadable car set ups or user ghosts to time attack. Very overrated, a very small and minimal game which should be a budget game, it's not a full game. Even if this game was perfected it's so basic it'd only score 6/10.. Cars feel a bit too weightless but other than that this game is fantastic. Super fun to play!. Brilliant racing SIMULATION with amazing graphics and physics - but TO DAMN HARD. This game could be a 10/10, but it just fails to give the player any easier tracks to play. Skid half a meter to the left or right and you will crash or get stuck in terrain instantly. The game basically forces you to play on the hardest setting by default and just says ""If your not good enough to handle this then to bad for you!"". I think a great racing game needs to be able to scale back the difficulty. It would have been nice for example if you could have 3 different settings for how narrow the roads are (sure - that is not realistic, but come on - this is a video game still). And some setting to make the handling of the car easier. Dirt refuses all of this and only caters to players who are on the extreme difficulty end of the spectrum. It also fails to provide good driving tutorials and tracks where you can perfect and hone your skills. To me, this difficulty problem is a serious flaw and if codemasters ever want to grow out of their dwindling fanbase of ""hardcore or nothing!""-players they better address it. I'm not picking up any sequal unless they can prove they have fixed this. (I bought this game at 20USD, if I had to pay a full price of 40-60 USD the score would drop another 2 points. Im giving it a pass due to the fairly low price point).. Perfect but missing a real time multiplayer rally.. Like in dirt2................................................. This is the most realistic and difficult driving simulator i have ever played. The physics and behaviour of the cars are absolutely stunning. U really have to be a pro driver to compete at the highest difficulty levels of the game. There are a lot of instruction videos made by the developers, so you can really educate yourself in terms of racing mechanics. I do not say this about games normally because i really like a challenge, but this game was just too hard for me to progress to higher racing levels. But i do not blame the developers for this at all. I'm just a solid gamer and a good driver, but absolutely no pro so this game is not for me. But if u are a pro driver and u wanna compete at an insane level of difficulty, u must pick this one up most def. This is called the Dark Souls of racing games for a very good reason. And if u will play this game, u will realize dark souls is actually a cakewalk ;). Absolutely exhilarating. I was in 2 minds earlier about either buying Dirt 4 or Dirt Rally. I researched a bit, observed the game-play for both, in either case Dirt Rally was coming on top with its neat graphics, superior game-play and loyal following. Nevertheless, I asked my games vendor to fix me up with Dirt 4, he said he got one in stock. I went to fetch it and it turns out he didn't have on and he confused it with Dirty Rally being in the pre-owned bundle. I picked the Dirt Rally by chance and what a fortunate event it happened to be. The game is sheer thrill and absolutely fantastic. It mind-blowing control of the car, the exhaust noise, fluid traction, beautiful European landscape and everything about the game is just incredible. Especially, the Swedish tracks are too tormenting but amazing play overall for the game.. this game is the one of best car simiulation ever very hard and breath taking roads, nice graphic, nice cars, dont miss it.. I was a big fan of the Colin Mcrae series so I'm stoked with this game after such a long time between drinks. The physics/handling is amazing and gives you a real sense of satisfaction as you get better and better, taking corners faster and even keeping the car on the road on straights at high speed. 2 things that coud improve though are the graphics, and multiplayer setup. It's so hard to organise leagues to play against your friends.. The level of immersion on offer here is immense - from the sheer raw difficulty to the guttural engine roars. A return to form from Codemasters, and one that rewards patience and persistence. It could have done with more content (cars, stages etc), but it's an insanely good rally game as it is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really enjoy a good racing game, and I guess this is good in some respects. But I also found this to be a slight struggle to play at times with this game.. I love this Game. You can not judge it without a force feedback wheel. I also own DiRT 4, but it is almost as if Codemasters, the creators of the also very good F1 2017, passed this job to some other team. DiRT Rally is better in every aspect. And no, it's not too hard (speaking a relatively noob). Codemasters: MUCH LOVE!. I've always been a fan of racing games, obviously good racing games. DiRT Rally is such a good game, it may be a little different because is a rally game, and almost everything is based on times and nt on head to head races. But the gameplay is so good, but at first it may be a little hard, but as the races goes you'll get used to.. Good Racer, BAD Game - This game feels VERY unfinished. A lot of things you would expect from a racing game a missing: - Very few track - Very few modes - every car has only 3 upgrades that install automatically and you won't see any difference in performance. - Every Menu is mostly text, instead of nice designs - After a Championship is finished, there is simply a small button that says ""next event"" - You can't go back to events you already did, replay them or even see your score - The controls feel nice, but the car ""swims"" a lot, so it's very hard to keep the car on the road on almost any surface - touch the edge of the car even a little bit and you either spin 360, topple over or just fly of the track - it doesn't matter if you win or loose, the game will never encourage you or praise you. and don't think you get any titles or contracts with sponsors or anything like that at all. the ""career"" mode is nothing but one race after another after another. - the graphics are kind of ok, but they look like a remaster of a ps3 game. the people next to the road don't even have actual faces and the shadows are very rough square patters. All in all, this game as very little to offer. Within the first 3 hours you will see every track thins game has. After that it's nothing but driving these tracks again and again - while you are never celebrated in any way or form for your success. I'm, really happy i didn't pay more than 15€ for this. At that price it's kind of ok, but don't spend more on it.. Incredibly thrilling, heart-pounding, exciting and realistic rally sim. Also very demanding and requires you to fully commit to the game, but it's so rewarding as your skills gradually improve. You kind of feel like becoming a real rally driver as time goes by. One of the most intense racing games ever.. The best rally game I have played. It is very difficult but also very rewarding. Don't let this be your first foray into racing games. There are three different modes giving the game a lot of variety.. I'm done with DR -enough hours wasted trying to tweak the cars. I am not sure what coders had on their minds- must have been ""they will never beat this game""--- It started off as an exciting game - only to realize I will never be able to win. Why can't the tires be picked or air adjusted? That makes the suspension adjustments completely worthless. therefore as the game.. You really have to focus to decently play this game, but when you get in the zone, boy does it reward you. The cars handle great and there are just enough stages to keep it fresh. The collection of cars is really complete. The graphics are ok, not great but not bad either. But it's the physics and feel that make the game excel. The handling is pretty realistic without being boring. You have to learn how different surfaces (gravel, snow, asphalt etc.) change the cars driveability. It's not the easiest game if you never played racing games, but if you really sink your teeth in it, it rewards you a lot.. I've always **** in car games, I only bought this to try the VR mode, and oh my, this is another world! Being on the car, perceiving the depth and seeing all the details on the game just changes the way you play, it's like being on a real car on a real race, the pilotage is totally different, as you can perceive the depth (at least me) you can know when really start taking a bend, when to use a brake and so on. Hope to see more games like this on VR.. It's a fully featured Rally game with fantastic handling, that supports PSVR and the Pro. What more could anyone ask for. A true gem in the PSVR catalogue. With this and RE7 things are beginning to get very exciting.. Got this game around release, and even though I enjoyed it quite a bit in the beginning, I ended up trading it away long before I was done with it. Maybe its also relevant to mention that I am by no means a racing game fan - I rarely play them. Anyway, with the release of the PSVR version I had to buy it once again, which I did yesterday and I must say this this is one of the most incredible gaming experiences Ive ever had. Wow! It really feels like you are inside the car. Non VR: 8/10 VR: 10/10. I've been playing the Colin McRae rally series since the original on the Playstation 1 and this is one of the best. I went into my first rally knowing that I'm very good at these games. I was confident of picking up where I left off and I turned all of those unnecessary driver assist options off from the get-go. That's when i discovered that this game is great at humbling even the most seasoned Rally gamer. As I rolled my mini off the side **** cliff, my pride followed with it. I lost my confidence. I was crawling into corners and excessively feathering the throttle, lest I spin out of the corner. Slowly I built my speed up and got to the point where I'm winning stages and rallys. It's still not easy, but at least I can compete. I haven't given the game top-marks for a couple of reasons. First, the selection of locales is limited compared to older games in the series. I know I'm in the minority, but I don't like the rallycross mode. The spirit of Rally is man vs the road, and I never feel like I'm lacking for competition on a class timed rally stage. I don't need to see other cars on the track in order to get my adrenaline up. Pikes Peak feels a bit tacked on, and really requires that you memorize the whole circuit as there's no co-driver. I'm sure I'll grow to like it, but for now I'm only trying it occasionally. I really like the daily/weekly/monthly rally events. There are no do-overs, so it feels like a real rally against real people. If you pop a tire, you can kiss the whole event goodbye because there's no way you're making up that 1:30 it took for you to repair. I'm sure a lot of people might find this mode a bit sparse, but for me it's a real highlight. To wrap-up: this is a great Rally game. It's hard, but fair. and it never feels like it's cheating you. It's my second favorite Rally Game after Colin McRae 2005 on the original XBOX, and that's high praise indeed.. Why are people giving this game good ratings? It's a load of rubbish. Trying to drive a car is impossible with ps4 controller. It's not realistic and certainly not fun. Do not waste your money on this game. You can mess with the car settings and game settings all you want, you will not get your sluggish brick of a car round the stage. This is not a sim or arcade game, I would not recommend to anyone.. For true fans of rally racing and driving sims, Dirt Rally is a must own. It gives us everything we want, and nothing we don't. Rally Cross is fast and chaotic, and the hill climb event is pure adrenaline. The rally stages are beautiful and highly technical, requiring tremendous focus and nerves of steel. Those who say this game is too difficult to be enjoyable have no place here. They're better suited for games like Asphalt 8 and Need for Speed. This game demands more from its players, rewarding those who provide proper input and punishing those who don't. You will need to choose the right line and proper angle of entry. You will need to learn how to feather the brakes and throttle with minimal steering input. You will need to master the pendulum turn and e-bake slides. You will have to interpret your navigator's pace-notes like a second language. It will take time and it will be frustrating; but the payoff for perfecting these skills is infinitely more rewarding than any arcade-racer could hope to be. I'm docking one point because the selection of vehicles and tracks is limited, and there is minimal customization. Aside from that, Dirt Rally is a technical work of art that will surely satisfy the desires of any racing-sim junky.. A great and challenging rally game, though as with many games of this type it's easy to lose interest after a few championships. Technically this feels like a very good game and rewards concentration, for this it deserves credit. As you progress you get slightly faster cars, slightly harder challenges and slightly longer events. Other than these small increments it lacks any new challenges or reason to stay. The online mode does add extra scope with the daily events etc..., but again there is little reward for progressing. This game is fun to pick up occasionally for some high intensity rallying but doesn't offer much long term.. Perseverance, patience, learning programs and the closest path to the abyss, are the ingredients for victory, and only then will grow. Worth every penny spent, and the finger of the brakes will be much in demand.. Here it is in few words: Have my driving license + Don't own a car + Don't have experience + The best rally game out there ATM = Fly through the trees and crash my way to the 1st places, ocasionally killing some of the expectants. 9/10 will keep killing the camera guy and trying to be at the first places often.. I really wanted to like this game, I've enjoyed Dirt Rally 2 and 3 a lot. But this game is so short on content and it really isn't fun or rewarding at all. You have three game modes, two of which are basically the same, set in six not so different locations. If you're driving with a high end gaming wheel, as I have, you are going to want a manual stick and proper handbrake for this game. Sequential shifting is for some reason extremely slow and the handbrake very unforgiving. The simulation on snow and ice feels about right, gravel is fine I guess, but tarmac is like driving on a wet rubber carpet. I drive a lot, and often way faster than I probably should. I live on the Swedish countryside and trust me, this is not much like actual off road driving. It's an exaggerated racing sim, I don't think game reviewers drive at all or they'd know that just because a game is way too hard and unrewarding, doesn't make it a hardcore racing sim.. Before I continue, I am NOT a fan of racing games. My favorite racing game before the DIRT franchise was Need for Speed : Porsche Unleashed. Yes, I'm old. I could care less about cars or racing games in general. Consider that before hearing my opinion. With that being said, I love the DIRT franchise. It's fast, fun and dirty. I enjoy Rally racing and there's nothing like the feeling of finishing a round with no accidents. Nothing but smooth riding, quick turns and drifting a tough corner. DIRT 3 was IMO, the best of the series. Lots of modes, lots of fun things to do and the graphics, oh the graphics. One of the biggest reasons I love DIRT (don't hate me, even if it sounds petty) is the in-car camera view. I cannot for the life of me play a video racing game using a 3rd person cam view, except for GTA but is that really a racing game? First thing you have to acknowledge is the time and patience needed to succeed in DIRT Rally. It's tough. It's very hard. No hand holding allowed. You're just going to have to figure it out. It took me a good 4-5 hours to get the hang of the first available cars on snowy, muddy or gravel roads. I can see a lot of people giving up within the first 5 hours. One of my biggest complaints this time around are the graphics. I'm playing it on the PS4. Inside the car looks great. I love all the details depending on the car. Outside the windshield? So so. I've come across situations or particular sections where shadows are pixelated and ugly compared to everything else. Even when watching the replays of the race you just finished used to be one of my favorite things to do but there's a ton of glitches, like shrubs and weeds disappearing and then re-appearing. I'm not 100% sure on this but I'd imagine games like GT & Forza have more modes than DIRT RALLY. All you get here is career, custom events and online. Not bad but it could've featured more modes, cars and options. Overall, DIRT Rally is up my alley because I like a good challenge and I prefer rally racing over GT. Considering the rewind feature has been removed this time around, it might be too difficult for some. I bought it on sale for $40 and there's a bunch of new games coming out now since it's almost October so I don't see myself playing this or being addicted to it like I would be if it was June.. Good. God. Is this game ever hard. I've been playing it pretty much consistently since it was released and unlike many other games where I grasp the curve and it becomes easy, this game is always hard. You have to focus on your technique every race, every turn. It's almost sadistically unforgiving, too. Slide off an icy bridge two (real) hours into an event? Did not finish, last place. I call it the Dark Souls of racing and I think that's apt.. Good game, if you consider yourself not a good but a great driver. Anything less and your going to be dissapointed as the game is ruthless but rewarding. Nice handling when you have tweaked the feedback settings (g29) but not quite enough variation. 8/10 here. Bought this until GT7 finally comes out. Waste of time, after taking an age to set up wheel exactly right, (which rarely saved settings) Codemasters then release a patch that completely removes support for the wheel.(thrustmaster) The replays are poor. The games consists of basic time trials, which is ok graphics are average, hill stages are very dull with no co pilot or map just keep replaying same track for ages. mostly just time trials and graphics are just average little fun, and ultimately a rather dull product, which is very similar to F1 2015 was. The only competitive racing you get is very short rally cross stages where the AI is unrealistically aggressive and just takes you out for no reason. Some weird upgrade system for mechanics and stuff but certainly not fully customisable. Traded in...wait for GT7!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Only Racing game which doesn't get boring. It's technical and therefore the player grows in knowledge. The graphics and frame rate are insane as well.. One of the best racing game I ever played. I would like to give it 9.5/10 since there are few things that I don't like, however they do not affect the main quality of the game. First of all, the driving system is so great. The car goes as what it should do. The car customization and team management feel real. Co-Driver plays the crucial role in this game. I NEVER EVER listened or cared about co-driver at all in other games, but in this game you really need his information about the course or risk yourself flying off the cliff. The light and damage system seems realistic. You will notice them when you drive in the night. It is really dark and if you damage your front light then you have screw up. I have to change my view from 3rd person to 1st person specially for this game. I never did that when I played Dirt 2 or 3. Second, Map design is top notch. We have asphalt, ice, snow, gravel maps. All of these surfaces play differently to the traction of the car. There are dangerous everywhere. You can easily crash if you do not play attention to the road ahead and Co driver. I never liked rally this much before. In previous Dirt games, I always play Rally cross more. Third, it has ""Dark Soul"" difficulty. If you are familiar with Dark Soul title, it is the game that is considered one of the hardest games in the world. Why is it Dark Soul ? that is because Dirt Rally removes many features in their previous games that help players. For example, you can't rewind the time when you make mistake, you can let the game to recover the car from crash but you will get 10-15 second penalty (which is huge), every damage the car getting will be transfer to the next run and you have limited time to repair with your crews, you can still restart the race but your reward will decrease every time you do, you can get demoted if you do bad. These are what make the game so intense + challenging. Moreover, AI is strong, very strong for casual players even on the easiest difficulty (Open Championship). Other points - Graphic is OK for the current genre, not the best, not bad - Rally Cross Multiplayer is doing OK - High Peak mode is not that interesting but I considered it a free plus. - Very few BGM (but it is not needed anyway) Bad parts -Need more maps, especially in Rally cross ( Rally cross mode is bare bone) -Racenet is sometimes not stable. -Replay view is below average. -Cannot save replay, why ? -Too difficult for casual gamers. - AI in Rally Cross sometimes hit you in the back. They are brutal In sum, I have to say this game quality is beyond what I expected. I have spent more than 50 hours, still playing and considering to buy a wheel controller. I have reached Master Championship in both Rally and Rally cross. However, because of the difficulty, I would suggest only for veterans to buy the game. If you are casual and have no patient, I suggest you stay away. This game needs a lot of practices to win. You gonna keep going off the cliff, crash, restart -> repeat. Furthermore, If you are a fan of Rally Cross, you might not like the game because it focuses more on Rally.. I've spent a lot of time on a lot of racing games, including other simulators like the Gran Turismo series. This game is literally NOT FUN. I loved all of the other dirt series but this is pretty awful. Worst game I've purchased in a while, and I honestly don't understand all the high reviews. There are 3 modes to play in, two of which you are racing by yourself. After spending hours on a single race, the best I could ever achieve was 2nd place. Difficulty doesn't bother me as long as I'm having fun, but in this case, I wasn't. Played it about 5 times before selling it off. Really disappointing.. An authentic rally driving simulation. Great graphics with no technical failures, solid 60 fps. Perhaps the biggest problem is the excessive realism for the common players. Should have more locations. Graphics: 9.0 Sound: 9.0 Gameplay: 8.8 Fun/Story: 8.0. this game is one of the best I have played in along time and I would recommend it to everyone out there, I love how you can choose your own car and have loads of cars to choose from and also can choose your own colour so you can have you favourite colour car but I would of liked it more if you had the option to be able to upgrade the car such as its engine performance, handling, breaking ect but over all it is a great game. The rally stages are a lot of fun and really force you to improve your driving. The game runs at a butter smooth frame rate and the cars really bounce and slide around in a realistic feeling fashion. The rally stages can get quite long so it's not unusual to have a rally stretch over 6 minutes of real time. That means driving flat out for six minutes with no mistakes. This is where the game truly shines. It's not perfect by any means but it's close. For example, you can still win or get second in a race where you flipped your car. It's real, but not real at the same time. Unfortunately the game is very spartan when it comes to features for the single player. Win a championship (that might have taken hours to complete) and nothing happens aside from getting credits. The game design behind progressing is also a bit annoying. You start out with a slightly gimped car and as your engineers get more experience with the car, the cars stats improve. I suppose this is realistic but it kind of puts you in a box where you have to be perfect to proceed because your competition has been fully upgraded. In rally or hill climb it's not a big deal but in Rally cross... it's kind of a deal breaker. Rally cross for me is kind of boring and a chore to get through. The tracks themselves are not that fun to drive around and seem to lack variety. Aside from that, the AI drivers smash into you all the time and cause spin outs, yet when you crash into them they recover perfectly. I have never seen the AI crash or mess up in any significant way. In summation this game is like a race car itself. All racing and no bells and whistles. I would suspect Dirt Rally was designed for the hardcore and probably excels online. Which is a shame that more effort wasn't put towards customizing liveries. It's also a head scratcher that tires and tire types play absolutely no roll what-so-ever.. As a non-super rally racing fan I have no means of gauging this game's credibility as a sim but having been a casual fan of racers throughout my gaming history I know this is one with a refined and tuned focus on absolute skill. I played Dirt 2 and whatever the next title in the series was called and where I previously was sold by the availability of SUVs and dune buggies I can see a younger me closing the lid on Dirt Rally for lack of that range of vehicle variation. Long gone is the indie, Americanised, 'dude' vibe of the earlier titles, the rewind time options and a lot of features that had me relish in my year or so spent having it over stadium jumps and losing tyres after smashing in to trees on some insane rally cross - but the very core of Dirt has of course, remained the same: Rally racing as tricksy and devilish as it comes and it was this very premise that was the most (obviously) gripping and skill-pushing feature that was the overall reason I clung to those previous titles over the more zany racers like the ever increasingly poor Need for Speed titles. It was 2 months ago me and my house mate were sat in the living room having just played through another hour of Alien Isolation, sweaty from evading the black beast and pondering our life on the sofa, swapping controllers, nostalgically reminiscing the days of split-screen. My friend started pining for a racer - a gripping and intense racer. I pondered the available market and remembered that I'd seen a new Dirt release, fondly remembering my times careering across dune and desert, forest and cliff-side trail. I said that would be the one. Suffice to say when I booted up I was somewhat shell-shocked to find how aesthetically different and stripped back the title was in comparison. All the selling points I'd thrown at my friend were false - it seems we were not in for another addition of crashing and smashing, crowds cheering and dudes dude'ing us on. Nope, we were met by a single-track soundtrack, the retro-vibe of the arcade that pumps through our surround sound system (a tune I can't deny I love more and more with each play - bizarre considering it really is just one song for hours and hours of play) - a menu stark and simple - the only sell I had left were the reviews flooding the web: ""[one of the] best Rally Sim[s] EVER!!"" ""oh"" I said, hopefully; ""It's a Rally simulator... as opposed to a straight up rally racing 'game'""... Thrown straight in to the rally-cross whilst our game installed (loved that.. you get to play whilst you install? Awesome) my concerns were dropped; a scotch rider at my side shouting details of the course ahead, zero map (in my previous Dirt experiences I intentionally always raced in drivers' seat view, always had my huds completely blank and left it to intuition and skill to best the tracks) and just dirty road ahead: I was comfortable and in all fairness I smashed the race with a clean 1st place! My friend wasn't so lucky... at this point I was worried that we'd just purchased a racing game that was entirely lacking in 'easy' fun. And that was the truth of it. Diry Rally is challenging as it comes. But that's WHY it's so GOOD!! I was worried my friend wouldn't dig it but luckily his natural desire to conquest all challenges (unless they're entirely banal) had him hooked to beat the rocks and trees constantly spinning him out. A few hours in and plenty of 20 second behind finishes and soon we were finally catching the pack. We're a few months in now and we're having it! Sure there's loads of losses and wipe outs but boy oh boy we can give it to the best of them. Dirt Rally is no easy winner, there's no second chances, only relentless penalisation for being a lazy racer, no corner cutting, no shunting and spinning out opponents, no rewinds, no respawns without time penalties... just absolute drive to master every corner and come out feeling like a true racing king... just how I like it. We all like and bit of rough and rumble but I'll gladly leave that for the poor show racing on the latest GTA's sandbox tracks, where smashing is like some sort of law. I've always been about the clean race and the clean finish: across the line without a scratch, after all, every bump is seconds lost and Dirt Rally really reigns that home to the point where you clip and corner and find yourself instantly reaching for the restart option, despite being on the 4th and final painful lap - every second counts! The landscapes are fantastic, the graphics are good enough for a racer, the business ethic, that sort of campaign manager feel with the engineers you hire and of course the racing itself is top notc","the game is too minimal to be worth buying an entry level wheel and pedals for (>£150!) there's no time attack mode, no ghost cars, no real way to test set ups, and there's no official world rally championship licence . a very small and minimal game which should be a budget game, it's not a full game ."
"1,075.Project Gotham Racing 4","Pioneer in its genre with circuit in real streets. The best Project Gotham Racing. He gave a kick in graphics, speed and gameplay to PS3 Gran Turismo. Kudos to Bizarre creations for trying something different, this time the races are set over a series of seasons and you play the championships one by one. But my gripe about MSR on the Dreamcast still rings true; there are too many time trial and cone challenges and not enough races. The format also doesn't quite work because the constant chopping and changing of tracks and cars means you never get a chance to get completely familiar with any of them, and because you constantly earn Kudos whether you win or lose it's possible to win the game even if you come last in every race. Which is completely unsatisfying and makes it all seem a little pointless. The best bits of the game are brilliant, but as a whole it doesn't quite work.. Best racing game on the xbox 360 in my opinion, handling model and car variety are awesum. I wish I could give this game a higher score but AI is quite frustrating (if not infuriating at times) and the learning curve for motorcycles is not optimal at all, despite these being really fun to ride. Another flaw I want to take note before stating the good points is the analog stick deadzone. I'm not the only one to perceive this, many other players reported the same damn long deadzone issue. You can't make precise turns in this game, since it forces you to go all the way on the analog just for it to register something and this can be really annoying because the game is a simcade so tight turning would be possible and is a must for getting decent lap times on hardcore mode. But anyways, into the pros we have quite a few things that make PGR4 such an incredible game: - Good selection of both cars and bikes - Decent amount of cities and routes - Suitable soundtrack - Amazing engine sounds - Very natural handling - Detailed interior view for ALL vehicles - Most cars look nice - Challenging arcade missions - Geometry Wars: Waves - Various weather choices And now, for some cons: - Shallow career mode - Difficulty spikes - Stupid AI (this one seems to be a must on any racing game) - Rubberbanding - Lack of local statistics (explained below) - Dying leaderboards Unfortunately all player statistics were tied up to their online database, presented to players as PGR Nations. This was some kind of primitive tracker, used to rank players based on their nationality. It also featured individual statistics, so since the site is down, you aren't able to obtain gameplay time and stats anymore and this, to me, is a huge letdown since PGR3 still had local statistics. Overall the game is good, handles well and will keep you coming back for days. It runs nice on split screen so you get tons of replay value with friends. Like most racing games, the AI will force you into restarting races and you'll struggle with some arcade challenges. Kudos system is solid but after the shop runs out of packs, you'll be stacking these for nothing.. best racing game on xbox 360 and in history.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Great graphics for a 2007 game. Very fun game, action packed and has a lot of vehicle variety compared to Forza.. PGR4 is a very good game. It’s a game I’ve played almost entirely the way through, DLC included and one which I can confidently say is one of the best racing games I’ve ever played. This should have gone down in the history books as one of the greats but never did due to it being a relative commercial flop compared to its predecessor.. PGR4 axed the ""supercars only"" motif of the previous game, but the title's abundance of tracks, multiple campaign modes, and weather conditions resulted in a fitting send-off to one of the greatest racing game franchises ever. The game is packed with content and ways to play it, something a lot of modern developers could take notes on.. PGR4 is a good racing game; there's nothing really wrong with it. It just feels sterile and lacks personality and substance, making it hard to justify choosing it over superior racing games.. Probably the worst racing game I've ever played. handling is basically non-existent, and all the cars are given to you at once. Unlike Forza Motorsport 2/3, you earn money by drifting. Racing here is almost impossible like trying to race in this game is like trying to butter corn that's on a drill with a spoon. Drifting is almost impossible since you always over-drift. If you want actual handling in racing or if you want a good racing game with actual customization, look at Forza Motorsport 2/3, Need For Speed: Carbon, and Need For Speed: Most Wanted.. Project Gotham Racing 4 is a great racing game. The gameplay is solid.While it may feel arcady at first,once weather comes into play,you learn how realistic it **** game has icy conditions,and cars will slip about on sheets of ice or in rain or **** car and track lists are huge,and the career mode is great **** game also has loads and loads of unlockable cars and tracks,so there is a ton of replay value in here.There are also bikes,and yes,you can race car vs bike and knock the biker off for endless comedic value. The graphics are nice,with lots of weather variants,and the framerate remains solid,though there are occasional drops. The sound design is amazing,and the soundtrack is quite good too. Overall,PGR 4 is an amazing racer that you need to pick up and play.. PGR4, presented as the last game to approach this franchise (due to some problems with Bizarre Studios) does a pretty solid job doing so. Right as the opening movie plays and ends, you know you’re up for a really intense, emotional ride. While there isn’t any actual story mode, there is a single player campaign mode where you race in tournaments to increase your rank, eventually increasing your car selection/class and motorcycles. Oh yeah, motorcycles - they’re pretty cool, but for me, not a new feature that I incorporate into my gaming. The single player custom match mode is really fun, where you can customise each race to a great extent, and I found myself spending a lot of time. While there is a lot to say, I have to keep this review short, and just tell you this - out of the four PGR games, this one comes in as the second best one. The solid graphics, good car selection, gameplay, and custom matches + multiplayer are all very very solid! The menus and all that are also very stylish (dynamic main menu theme? cool) Gameplay: 9/10 Story: N/A/10 Music: 8.5/10 Presentation: 9.5/10 Length: 7.5/10 Overall: 8.5/10. Pretty much my ideas for THE perfect arcade racing game. I first played this WAY after the game originally came out in 2007, late 2014 to be slightly more precise, and naturally being more focused on the completion of the year's most recent games, Far Cry 4, The Crew, GTA V etc. I wasn't expecting myself to put much input into PGR4, especially its career mode. But once I got into it, I really came across one heck of a racing game! And considering the prices it goes for now, €4 at best, you get an awful lot for your money: a dynamic first person camera, a diverse soundtrack of rock, electronic, classical etc., rain effects on cars and speaking of cars, a whole lot of 'em, arguably the best collection of them in the series alongside PGR2. There is so much right about this game, but it isn't flawless, as much as I hate to call it that. The career is shallow, but it's the only way to meaningfully earn kudos to buy new content, which redeems it and the damage is unimpressive, but that's it. Everything else about the game is awesome; it's a shame the series has pretty much died. Happily though Forza Horizon fills that void like a puzzle piece, which has some PGR blood in it's Forza guise. In short, if you love racing games, buy this whenever you can! It's easy to find, it's cheap, and trust me, for what you pay you'll get a whole lot of game!. I think this games shine amongst the other racing titles out there. Excellent presentation and wonderful tracks. Can't wait for a sequel, the genre really needs it!. One of those hidden gems. The cars do not look that great but the cities look awesome and the tracks are some of, if not the best tracks of any racer on the market. The look of the game is unique. Love it. Also the handling is great. A touch of realism helps it stand out. The big bonus is bikes and weather effects. Bikes got the same care as the cars but feel different enough to make them stand out. The learning curve is also a tad different. The weather effects are great as well. The rain is convincing, the fog is good without being distracting and the ice and rain makes the roads realistically slick. The biggest thing PGR has over the competition is the kudos system that rewards you on how you drive and the types of races the game has. Never has a racing game had so many different types of races. From time trials to cone challenges. It is packed. Bizzare Creations could make a PGR game in their sleep at this point and it has its own look and feel. Sadly Activision bought the developer and closed them down putting the series in hiatus. It is a great game. It would be a shame if Microsoft never gets around to making another one.. Project Gotham Racing 4 is the last great game from Bizarre Creations. A challenging arcade game mixing cars and bikes (very few games have this feature). To me this is the game with the best engine sounds. You have a very good feel of each vehicule. This game worth more than any Ridge Racer or Need For Speed game (as far as arcade game goes). Sadly, it failed against Forza Motorsport 2 (a great game too). For many gamers PGR 4 will have a special place their heart, knowing that it all started with Metropolis Street Racer on the Sega Dreamcast .... It was an interesting time to pick up PGR 4 and give it a whirl. At first I was impressed, but then I was really impressed. Backstory: I picked up PGR back in July as I thought 3.99 for such a highly acclaimed game had to be worth i, but shortly after put it down. I then picked up Forza 3 in August as I felt the need for some racing games in preparation for Forza 4. With those two racing Goliath's in my presence it was hard to want to play such a dated game. After plowing through Forza 4 and dabbling in some other games I finally decided to jump back into PGR 4 and just finish it out. Going from a racing sim to such an arcady game was shock at first but as I played it more I grew fond of how realistic it actually was. Flying through races as if they would never end the idea grew on me of how impressed people must have been when this first came out. If I was impressed with it after breathing one of the most current sims for over a month straight it really must have been a beautiful experience in its launch year. The graphics have such an effect of realism I almost don't believe it is its age. The fact that Bizarre was actually able to put in rain let alone snow!?! and still hold a decent FPS. I have zero experience with game development but I know that these guys had some crazy talent. The course selection was fresh, fast, technical and constantly exciting. The forgiveness in the game probably made it a overall more pleasant experience as I didn't feel as though I was having to hit lines perfectly every time to win and was able to just race and have fun. The car selection was great and even better because I was able to put them in my virtual ""garage"". I could not have been more pleased with this game and really wish I was around in its time so I could have joined in on some online action. Fingers crossed for a PGR 5!. This game is absolutely horrendous. I would recommend it to no one, unless I hate them. I only own this game because I got it as a part of a Xbox Live subscription bundle. The graphics are very poor, the game seems like it tries to be realistic, but isn't in anyway. The presentation is very underwhelming, and the mechanics are downright atrocious. Nothing about this game feels natural, especially the driving. Not even worth a rent. Do yourself a favor and go get a copy of Forza 3 or 4 instead.. The is a beautiful game especially for its time trust me this review is coming from the year 2011 and this game still looks as good as the top racing games today. The Project Gotham series has a lot of history. Back when the first Xbox came out Project Gotham is the game that made it popular. During this time Gran Turismo may have been the grand daddy of simulation racers but Project Gotham was the grand daddy of arcade racers. Now can Pgr4 live up to it's predecessors name. The answer is yes it does and then some. Pgr3 may not have been the game people were look for but Pgr4 makes up for it. Starting off with the visuals it is still among the best looking racers to date and easily has the best look tracks and environments to date. Take a minute and look at them the detail in it is just amazing. Looking at other racers the car selection could have been a bit bigger but this game is 4 years old. Project Gotham T.V has been improved as well as online. Going on to weather affects this game excels in this aspect. It translates to the tracks perfectly as well having big puddles of water in the middle of the track. Also the tracks change when racing in the snow such as the tree not having leaves and snow actually covering the road and the car. All of this isn't just for show it's actually a gameplay mechanic. Meaning you can actually feel the difference when racing in weather. The Kudos system is considerably worse though. You don't get Kudos bonuses for stringing combos together and you can only earn a certain amount of Kudos each race. Although it's still the best point system in any racing game it just isn't as good as the former system and doesn't feel the same. Now on to damage. There is virtually no damage in the game while former Project Gotham games did in fact have damage. This was a let down.. But I am still giving the game a 10/10 because it still competes both visually and gameplay wise to games in 2011. And that's an amazing accomplishment. Now it's time to see if there is going to be a Pgr5 and what it has in store for us.. I'm new to the PGR franchise, but am loving it. it's not a pure **** it's not all arcade death either. It has great graphics and excellent driver views. I love the **** angle with the full instrument panel in full-view..without it interfering with my view of the track. :) Hell, you even have bikes and cars racing against each other...another enjoyable novelty. Really, I could list tiny details all day... this is just an all around excellent game. For racers, a must-have.. New additions such as weather effects, bikes and new cities are great. Same PGR gameplay, but the only dissapointing thing is the career, which is separate to arcade mode. There's not incentive to play on a harder difficulty. So I'd do arcade events on Gold or platinum but play career on easy. You can't re-do events since there's no point. Really the old PGR 3 system was better. You also spend kudos in the item shop rather than getting money separately. Either way it's a great addition to the series. Shame about the pointless career mode.. This is one of the greatest games ever created in racing history. A huge car selection to choose from and a a great amount of tracks keeps the gamer coming back for more. Another great racing game for the entire family to enjoy, whether its everyone playing or just watch it is fun for everyone. Live long PGR4, you won't be forgotten.","the best bits of the game are brilliant, but as a whole it doesn't quite work . AI is quite frustrating (if not infuriating at times) and the learning curve for motorcycles is not optimal at all . you can't make precise turns in this game since it forces you to go all the way on the analog stick deadzone ."
"1,076.Metroid Prime: Hunters","I like this game alot, all of the new bounty hunters are great world building, also the controls are overhated, although as a left handed person I had to move samus with the face buttons so.... This game is not bad, but the controls are a nightmare, even on a New 2ds LL, maybe a New 3ds LL would have made it more playable but after finishing it on my 2ds LL i can say that I liked the game, but this game is being held back by the hardware and control limitations of the nintendo ds.. I never thought I say it, but there is a bad Metroid game; Metroid Prime Hunters is that game. It had a lot of potential to be good, with the areas it provides to explore, the lore built within the game, and the interesting new hunter characters. But it just overall fails the process with its horrid control scheme and terrible formulaic gameplay. Stay away from this game!. Another 3D version of the Metroid franchise that falls short of recreating the genius of the original 2D incarnations. It's slick, it's pretty and has a large, well designed play area but like the other reboots on the Gamecube, it loses its way when there is little to no indication as to where you must go next leaving you aimlessly wandering around, replaying old levels time after time in the vain hope of unlocking new, undiscovered areas. At least it has a reasonable number of save points - unlike the other Metroid Prime games - but a stronger narrative and more hints as how to progress could've made this a classic. As it is, it's a good - if increasingly frustrating - FPS.. While impressive for the Nintendo DS, at the end of the day it’s pretty mediocre for Metroid standards. Weird controls and some of the boss battles are tedious. One of the few Metroid titles I don’t have much desire to go back and replay through. Music is good though. Amazing, a lot of fun. One of the best DS games i have ever played, don't miss it.. you got ds that has a ton of awesome 2d games, yet no you go and do a 3d metroid. NOPE. Outstanding game. Does a great job of creating the environmental feel of a Metroid game, love the ship controls, the escape sequences, and the powerups. Some elements can get repetitive, but a solid game through and through, and surprisingly challenging at times.. I don't think making a follow up to one of the best games ever made is an easy task, not mentioning making a follow up in a very limited machine as the Nintendo DS is, but Hunters makes you miss a lot to play Metroid Prime on Game Cube. There's a lot to not like and maybe hate in hunters and so little to like, so let's start with the good; the story is cool and interesting, the thing about the hunters, hunt or be hunted is an amazing idea but it just falls so short. Instead, you have a shooting gallery with annoying and super fast targets that also have homing attacks, so you have to make predictions of their random patterns to hit them, maybe it's fun the first time but not the 10th one. Speaking of repeating things, you will do that a lot of times, the thing goes like this; you arrive into one planet, clear some gallery rooms, encounter a hunter, found 3 scattered items in the planet (this is the most annoying part, since requires bad designed backtracking), go to the boss room and kill it, finally escape the planet, not because its exploding or anything but because is some kind of protocol, so you have to rush to your ship before time expires or you have to repeat the process from the start. After that, you have to repeat the process twice on each planet (there are four of them). If the thing was fun I wouldn't have to write this but it feels more like a chore, and the fact that the controls aren't great and that even almost hurt your hands doesn't help one bit. The level design and environmental design are also awful, long gone are the great levels of Prime or Super, instead you have this gray and generic sci-levels that feels so plain, also as I mentioned, the controls are not good but that didn't stop the developers to add platforming sections, you even can insta-die if you fall, very bold of them. There are two endings in this game, but I rushed to the first one because the last boss fight is as tedious and annoying as the others (you have to kill some red targets in order to make appear the real target then shoot it and hope that you make some damage before randomly shields itself again, sometimes you can hit it like 1/4 of its HP and other times like 1/10 no kidding, its hard because is not challenging but because is so annoying), I really love Metroid but this game is not worth it, it's annoying, boring, unpolished and almost unfinished, I won't recommend it even to Metroid fans because it's just a Troy horse seriously, hopefully, a good developer takes some of the ideas used in this game and apply them to a better product.. My most played DS game of all time. It has everything a good shooter should, even though wifi was limited in some ways (such as requiring a WEP key which we don't use anymore). The action was instantaneous, well paced, and it controls superbly with the stylus. This game is played for its multiplayer.. This is my favorite game on the DS so far. I had to write a review, cuz it is so damn good. I just finished playing. The graphics are sick!!! It's not perfect (e.g. save points are a little far from each other) but it is incredibly good.. Pretty good game! This game is a bit old but well worth picking up if you like first person games. We had a lot of fun with it during the Easter holidays. It's not as good as on a TV console, but on the 3DS is plays fantastically well. If you like the series this is a must to have.. A must have if you enjoyed the prime series. The game is placed between Metroid prime and Metroid prime 2: Echoes. Prime hunters truly deserves to belong to this series, the controls are easy to learn and very intuitive and the level design is very similar to its predecessors.. Metroid Prime Hunters is the best FPS on the DS. The exploration and game world is great. The puzzles could have been better but are still good. The multiplayer is interesting with multiple characters to fit your playstyle... This game is worthless. I tried playing it because I'm a MASSIVE metroid fan, but it almost made me hate the series. It tries to focus on exploration, but they fail to make it fun EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Enemies are boring to fight and deal too much damage, yet they give plenty of health pickups meaning that you will die often from not making any mistakes at all. The controls are shyte. You NEVER get used to the controls. They are a constant burden. The level design is dull, ugly, and confusing as he11. The map is useless. It doesn't give clues as to how to access certain areas, which you're not even sure you're supposed to navigate to. At the end of every planet you have to run back to your ship. The time limit is well timed, so you always arrive with just under a minute or so to spare, but the level design is so horrid that you will probably get stuck backtracking several times due to camera confusion or repeated level patterns. The third boss I came across took 20 minutes to beat, repeating the same pattern the ENTIRE TIME. You shoot these small crystals that shoot slow moving green orbs at you, and you have to shoot all like 15 crystals when they turn blue so that the main crystal can emerge and you can shoot at it. You are FORCED to run around in circles this entire time, which requires an insane amount of ambidexterity. Then when the crystal finally pops out it only comes out for 5 seconds. Blasting it at full force with missles/charged shots or your best gun will always deal about 8 pixels worth of damage, resulting in it ducking back and all other 15 crystals regenerating, forcing you to repeat this process about 20 times before it dies. This fact, along with forced checkpoints that do not regive you max health, are proof that this game had zero playtesting at all. Imagine you have 1 health and stumble across an invisible forced checkpoint with a boss coming up. You'll have to delete your save file and start from the beginning! You rarely pick up any upgrades. It lets you start with charge shot, maru maru, bombs, and missles. Why? no other game does this! I'll tell you why. It's because this entire game wasn't developed for fun. It was developed in an attempt to show off the DS's capabilities compared to the Gamecube. They wanted people to buy the DS thinking it was going to be 'just like prime' but they didn't care about anything else. ""Just make it look like Metroid Prime and ship it"" How pathetic. I award this game ZERO points, and my god have mercy on their soul.. I have never been a big fan of Metroid 3D games. This one is OK for me as the other ones. Maybe its because Im not a big fan of first person shooters in general. The controls are good with the stylus, the visuals as well, but it feels like theres to much stuff going on at times, and sometimes its just way to much exploring that doesnt feel all to intriguing. An OK game in my mind. 5 out of 10.. Whilst the single player is very good it is multiplayer where this really shines. Grab some mates, sit down and let the carnage begin! This is the ONLY decent FPS for the DS and with a thumb tap and some decent local wireless friends makes a great afternoon!. Poor single player, but the multiplayer is excellent and very polished. A blast to play with friends especially since you only need one card. Other stand outs include the graphics and decent soundtrack. Still, it definitely doesn't have the same atmosphere as the console series. It's more like a sampler, though without the innovation or creative level design that the console games are famous for.. this game is great all around....pretty good story **** intense wi fi and download **** download play could be the best thing that came to the ds....awesome game awesome graphics theres so much to like about this game nd theres nothing to insult about this **** this game while its still not crossing over the $50 mark. Wow. I instantly played this game and thought, 'Is this really a DS'? The graphics were so clean and polished, and all flowed quite well. The story, was average for the most part, and the level did seem a tad too repetitive, but honestly, the graphics in each level really impressed me, and the gameplay just added to this. Then we have the multi-player. Upon playing it, this game just became a lot more fun. Each character have their own alt-form, as well as their weapon of choice. As such, it allows for each type of player to chose the hunter that best suits his/her strategy. So, this game is able to uphold the reputation of Metroid Prime, even on this minute console. And, apart from the rooms being a little similar, the graphics are gameplay are just amazing.. I rated this game 8 not because of it's story mode, but of it's multi-player. You can add bots if you have no people to battle! I do that all the time! Pretty much the only portable FPS I know besides MGS: portable ops (I don't have that game though). As a metroid fan I always loved the prime series, so lets start with the review. Story: The singeplayer was not what I usually would expect from a metroid serie, the mission were mostly the same (at least when fighting a boss) which could bother some people. Multiplayer: Very entertaining, you have as a player a lot of options to choose and it feel quite ballanced, sad enough no one plays it anymore and its overpopulated with hackers. Soundtracks: Fits the game really well, like I usually expect from them. Conclusion: If you want to play this game just for the story, then the objectives that you have to do may bother you since it mostly the same. If you play this game for the multiplayer, the I suggest you play it with a friend and not online due to all the hackers. If you play this because you are a fan of Metroid, then it will be a fun experience. warriorjan. I know , i know , the gameplay is painful and hard, but is too damn addicting the multiplayer. Starting with the story, is rewarding, while it lacks with almost no enemies in the adventure, there's a good time in it. The cut scene are great and looks detailed even for this little screen. A good arsenal of varied special attacks mixture the experience and add diversity. As for the multiplayer, even if it is offline is what i said in the beginning of the review. If you don't know what i meant for painful, is what Jaglur said, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is the flaw in here, ouch, i think my fingers are destroyed.. I can say this is a great game just cause I have barely played the single player and just went to multiplayer when it started to **** (immediately). Only downside is that you can only do battle mode in multiplayer there should be other modes like survival. Hey and for all you kids whining about your hands hurting, theres a simple and obvious solution. Didnt you know theres stylus left hand and stylus right hand. So when your left hand starts cramping, switch it to right hand mode!!!. This game is pretty damn awesome, and if you don't have it you should go and get it. As a FPS it works well, the stylus controls are easy to get used to, and they give you precise aiming (maybe too precise because in multiplayer with any amount of skill you can headshot everyone without having to scope with the sniper) They might break your hand if you play this game for a long time on multiplayer, on singleplayer there are enough breaks in the action for your hand to net get too worn out. Graphics are nice, everything has got pretty good textures, explosions are nice to look at, and the cutscene graphics are of almost ps2 quality (which is an achievement for a handheld such as this) Gameplay is fast paced and solid, the puzzle sections are never too tricky to figure out, and the only gripe I had with it was in some of the morphball puzzles. multiplayer GLITCHES, GLITCHES EVERYWHERE if you can get into a match where people are not just hiding inside walls then it's a lot of fun, this is the only reason i'm not giving this game a 10. The character selection is decent, with each hunter being unlocked as you play through the single player, and each of them having their own abilities. You can play against bots if you just fancy killing some time, the AI is decent enough on hardest to give you a run for your money, so even if you can't get online you can still use the hunters you unlock. Download play is pretty good as well, even if it means you stomp on your friends because they're all forced to play as Samus All in all this is a good DS title with probably the best controls for FPSs on it, the gameplay is fun, the single player is short but interesting, multiplayer is buggy but when it isn't then it's good fun, and the graphics are fantastic.. 8 This is actually very good to be a DS game, considering how all the other portable fps games have failed big time. The graphics are great, the story is thrilling as always. Also, the controls on this game are great, once you get used to controlling the screen and buttons at the same time.. Provided you use the thumb-nub accessory for the touch screen instead of a stylus to avoid cramp you will have little difficulty with the controls, free to reap the benefits of a more accurate mouse-like aiming system sorely lacking on all other portable game consoles and analog-stick shooters. Multiplayer aside (complimented enough as it is) I fee I have to defend the single-player campaign from the flak it has received. Metroid has always been about the isolation and lonely exploration of its universe, allowing its players to observe and interpret its rich background and nature in their own way. The scan visor and the innumerable scannable objects in the game provide this data in a way akin to genuine self-led discovery as opposed to that of a camera-led, cutscene rich journey, and that is part of the beauty and mystery of Metroid games (although admittedly different mixes in Fusion and Other M prove just as enjoyable). The primary issue of the single-player campaign is its repeating boss and odd climax-less countdowns. Otherwise this remains an excellent experience for those with the patience and imagination to take the game slowly, scan every creature, lore-piece and equipment. Those without the patience clearly do not appreciate what sort of game this was meant to be. [score: 8.5, rounded up]. Metroid Prime Hunters is all about multiplayers. I never been able to play in single player mode for more then twenty minutes, I always switch to the multiplayers mode. The new hunters are original and very cool to play. Each one of them as it's unique morph form that can be used for different play style. The stages are great and can be used for some strategic advantage. Even the online feels better than a lot of Wii games. The only down side of Metroid Prime Hunters is the technical limitation of the DS. This game could as been easily my best game of the year if it as been made for the Wii. A must have for all FPS and online multiplayers fans.. Metroid Prime Hunters is very impressive. The DS isn't great with graphics, but Metroid Prime Hunters, really looks amazing. The Gameplay is good as well, although it is really very tricky. If your a new gamer you might want to gain some experience before playing. But it is good, there aren't very many FPS's on DS and so if your looking for a good shooter this is a great one.","the controls are a nightmare, even on a new 2ds LL . the game is being held back by the hardware and control limitations of the nintendo ds . as it is, it's a good - if increasingly frustrating - FPS."
"1,077.Metroid: Samus Returns","this game is super good for the most part, an amazing remake, but it just doesnt control very well, it also has the ""3ds effect"" of making me feel like im in purgatory whenever I play it. Very happy with every metroid game that nintendo brings out, give me more please, this game is wonderfull.. I've been meaning to beat this game for a while now, although I have to say I stopped due a few flaws with this game. Largely this games enemies hurt way too much, and backtracking is some how more of a chore than it ever has been in a Metroid game. Thankfully a few new additions like the teleporter and Metroid scanner really help when it comes to navigating the area, although it mitigates things rather than outright solve the problem. For the most part, Samus Returns really shines when it introduces new elements into the original game like the digger or new final boss fight. Also having a melee attack and other new mechanics really helps break the monotony of facing mostly Metroid based bosses, but I don't think it's enough to really save this game from it's glaring flaws. Samus Returns is a good game, but hits a little too hard.... Feels held back by the 3DS, but has solid bones underneath. Excellent remake of Metroid 2. The official remake is pretty much just as solid as AM2R.. One of the Best Games I have ever played, Metroid: Samus Returns is a great retelling of Metroid 2: Return of Samus and it improves a lot from the original and it only makes sense to do so considering the 27 year difference between them. Yeah I just really enjoy this game.. Not a bad game, but Bosses are so repetitive, normal enemies too, same enemy, different colors. Art design and OST are regular, maybe because is a remake from a very basic game. I've seen much better Metroidvanias.. This game was a great way to bring back Metroid and to modernize it too. AM2R was amazing but was too conservative, while M:SR tries to bring new players to the franchise and i'm pretty sure it did. It's such a shame that it came out on the 3DS and no on the Nintendo Switch. Mercury Steam did a great job on Dread, but they did an amazing job on Samus Returns! The atmosphere and isolation is incredibly deep, and the metroids are actually really satisfying fights despite being repeating bosses(definitely the best implementation of repeating bosses I've ever seen in a video game). You traverse the world area by area instead of intertwining areas, but each area is incredibly open and a blast to explore, so the typical metroid exploration/adventure feel is bigger than ever before despite the area by area structure. Additionally, the option of fast travel allows for backtracking all over the older areas when you need some upgrades. I found myself going back to just grab a few missile expansions, then spending half an hour combing over each one of the old zones because there was so many and I couldn't stop. Best 2d metroid for SURE.. Good game, but quite flawed in some ways. The presentation is good, the exploration and powerup progression is fun, but the game just goes on for way too long (11-15 hours while the original Metroid II only takes approximately 5) and cannot really fill all that time with enough interesting stuff. The repetitive enemies get really annoying towards the end, ESPECIALLY the metroid boss fights, of which the later ones can become incredibly bullet-spongey; and the powerup progression slows down to a crawl in the late-game. The former factor is especially annoying since enemies respawn VERY fast, so if you find yourself hitting a dead-end or going in the wrong direction, congratulations, you get to fight all those enemies you just passed again! A special shoutout goes out to one of the most annoying foes in video game history, those little spider bots that can drain your Aeon gauge with their explosions, absolutely hate those f**kers. The controls can also be a little problematic, longer play-sessions on the 3DS tend to be quite cramp-inducing anyways, but a mechanically demanding game like this where you have total controller spaghetti going on makes it even worse. While the complicated controls aren't usually a problem, they can be during demanding situations like escape sequences or late-game boss fights. So yeah, not a bad game game and anybody who likes Metroid is probably going to enjoy it, but it's not one of the highlights of the series IMO.. Looks and plays great. The new bosses are very good but the remade (old) bosses get repetitive after a while. Also the non-linear level design of Zero Mission is absent. Which is fine since the original was on the Game Boy, but one would hope the remake would bring more to the table.. Samus Returns is a great reimagination of the original that is not afraid to diverge from the source material. The bosses are extremely challenging and it feels very rewarding to beat them, especially on the Fusion difficulty. Even the Metroid bosses feel different each time you fight them. Furthermore, the new Aion abilities add an extra layer of depth to the combat. However, the regular enemies deal a bit too much damage on Fusion difficulty, which can make the gameplay a bit frustrating at times. The map layout and area themes are well done, but I personally think that AM2R did it better. Additionally, on the original 3DS, the game can run a bit slow at times, especially with the 3D on.. This game is an absolute masterpiece. i simply have never played a better game than this. 10's across the board.. Awesome remake of the Game Boy classic, but the difficulty curve is a bit unforgivable.. Suitably challenging, intense and visually snappy for a Metroid title, Samus Returns is an essential entry, if not as people's first time in a Metroid game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfect game The gameplay is so smooth And samus zero suit is so beautiful I love it. Very good Game, especially the new ways of combat, love the story, a good work for a remake **** saga like Metroid.. Master piece. Just one of the best Metroid game series. Congratulations Mercurysteam did a fantastic job. My Score: (9) - Great! -------------------------------------------------------------------------. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Metroid Dread is a perfect 10. This is a 9. That’s your reference. It’s a really good game. Just keep in mind it is structured like a Gameboy game. Because that’s what it’s a remake of.. Doesn't hold up to the classics like Super Metroid, Fusion or Zero Mission. The artstyle doesn't fit and lacks the atmosphere previous titles had. As a remake of Metroid 2 I expected much more, nowhere near as good a remake as Zero Mission was.. Pros: + runs well + environment scanner + inventive boss fight + counter-attack + lore Cons: - repetitive bosses - repetitive scenarios at the beginning - bland visuals. Sometimes gets frustrating plus the locations are kinda the same. Game play was somewhat satisfying to me at least.. Loved Sero and Fusion so much. Agreed with the other reviews about the repetitive mini-bosses and lack of variety. And it's true that it's an easier game, but that was fine by me. Wonderful attention to detail, especially sound, which needs to be listened to on good headphones to be appreciated. And lots of it is just plain fun, especially the usual Metroid progression in abilities as you move through the game.. the best game of nintendo 3ds system , great job mercury steam , congratulations. In light of the new Metroid 5 being announced, I felt the need to revisit this trainwreck falling off the Hindenburg. I was not disappointed, it was as aggravating as I remember. Now, before the calls of, ""git gud"", or ""this is how old school Metroid used to be!"", I'd like to say I was playing Metroid when there was only one game; it had yet to be a franchise. I could avoid going in depth by saying just one thing: the game has a very, very generous continue system for when you die. The programmers knew you'd be dying a lot, and rather than do their jobs and balance, they decided smoking crack was a reasonable substitute. There's a chase scene that has multiple continue points inside it. So, if they were going for old school Metroid feel, they wouldn't have a continue system. It's a catch all for their lazy programming. Speaking of which! Samus apparently attended that crack party with the programmers, bc she now controls and aims like a refrigerator full of Mogwai that just devoured all the food half past midnight. Her aiming is *abysmal*. I actually took a photo of my thumb holding the direction I wished to aim, with her laser pointer in full view. They were not pointing even at an attempt in the same direction. I'd say a ten to fifteen degree difference at minimum. Now, this problem is negligible if you're taking a nice, peaceful interplanetary stroll. The game, however, forces you to utilize aiming, quickly and precisely, several times. Sev. Er. Al. The previously mentioned (instant death) chase scene comes back to mind here, though it's far from the only one. Finally there's the counterattack function. Dear gods somebody had some unearned pride over this, bc they shoehorn it in EVERYWHERE. Gone are the days of running and blasting through filler tunnels. Now you're stopping every five seconds, waiting for the counterattack signal. In closing, anyone who gave Other M crap, but fluffed this **** probably the same people who liked Daikatana; it just feels like the Venn diagram between those two is a giant circle; this game is very lazily programmed, but with just enough fluff and filler to try to distract you from it. Insult to injury? You unlock a hard mode upon completion. No thanks, I have teabagging a hungry crocodile JUST above playing Samus Returns ever again. Once I cross that off the list, we'll see.. Metroidvanias are not really my type of genre, but there was something that clicked with me in this game that made it amazing. The graphic style was really captivating. Having a dark moody atmosphere but also had a variety of colours and differing environments made the the game so engaging. I loved, loved, loved the combat! You basically can take a parry melee hit when an enemy is attacking and can blast them when they are stunned. It never got old. The metroids vary in size and skills and have a decent variety of attack pattern. My favorate part is when you parry, climb on top of them and give a metroid a good dose of missiles down their throat, gives that, 'take this!' feeling when you fist pump. The levels are well made and the upgrades are relevant and honestly, pretty cool. The main issues I have (although minor) is the levels can be long and doesn't it make it clear if you need to break a block to progress. I don't want a huge display, but a signal on what is destructible and what is not as I did get lost or spend awhile stuck looking for one block to progress which can be frustrating, a slightly different colour of texture is all. The story is kinda paper thin, if there was more to explain the purpose of the mission would give a higher motivation t the cause of the game. Another issue I had was it can be a difficult game. The challenge for me was kinda tough but rewarding. This if Shovel Knight difficulty. I bought this for my 10 year old son and he struggled past Zone 3. If there was a more accessible mode it would be great. Otherwise i can see how this was the best game for 2017 on the 3DS that pays respects to the classic Metroid games in the past. I got lost a couple of times and therefore took me about 13 hours to finish due to being not the most hardened veterians of the genre. if you like a challenge and the genre you must go and scout this game out.. linear design and a mediocre game, AM2R was way better and was done with 1/128 of the money used for this one. Why go 3d when you can make a true gem with 2d graphics?. This is a horrible excuse for a Metroid game and I don't understand why people like it so much. It looks pretty, but it plays horribly. I absolutely hated it from about 10 minutes into it, till the time I took it out of my 3DS a few hours later. I only made it to the third area, and found the difficulty of the game to be purely masochistic. It doesn't feel like a proper 2D Metroid game. The game is actually WORSE than the original Game Boy game they tried to remake. Things I liked: -Graphics. The game does look pretty. -Sound. The game does sound pretty. Things I hated: -Melee Counter: does not belong in a Metroid game. Whoever greenlighted this idea needs fired. -Aeion abilites: These comes off as more annoying than useful to me. Especially when you get to the third area that many monsters require the use of the rapid fire one. Oh yeah, it drains the aeion gauge in seconds. Garbage. -Level design: I expect a decent amount of mazes in a metroid game, but when EVERYTHING is a maze, it's not fun. It's way more complicated than the original for no reason whatsoever. -Overaggresive enemies: Pretty self explanatory. Enemies are overly aggressive for no reason, other than to shoe-horn in the previously mentioned garbage melee counter system. -Difficulty level: I can enjoy a hard game, but this goes way past hard into pure masochistic territory on the NORMAL DIFFICULTY. I'm a fairly seasoned Metroid player. I've beaten Super Metroid, Fusion, and Zero Mission multiple times, and the game boy game this was based on. This game gets the balance way too screwed up. Normal monsters do 1/3rd an energy tank of damage per hit AFTER THE VARIA SUIT. Metroids can take a whole tank at once. It's not fun, it's unfair and makes this game frustrating. TL;DR: Metroid Samus Returns is a game that looks pretty on the surface, and people raved over it because they thought it was a ""return to form"", but when you actually play it, the game is frustrating and a massive disappointment. Both the original and the fan remake AM2R(A PROPERLY REMADE METROID GAME THAT PLAYS LIKE A METROID GAME!) are infinitely better games than this officially released turd.. Last version of my review. I've just played through the game in under 4 hours on hard mode (to unlock one of the endings). The game is very solid mechanically, the shooting is on point, and each aeon ability is useful depending on the situation you're in. The game's vast array of corridors is interesting to explore and there is no shortage of action. Ennemies are powerful, but can be killed off very swiftly by a skilled player. The counter ability doesn't fit this game well, but it's optional to use it, though some ennemies were obviously designed to be a pain in the ass to defeat without it. I made the last playthrough without using it at all, and I was much better off. Certainly one of the best games on 3ds.. Busted out the 3ds over quarantine and finally playing this gem. It's a truly great game, plays like the OG Metroid games but deep as hell and fantastic controls and animations. Late to the party on this one but so glad I eventually showed up.. Metroid is back this game expands on Metroid exploration and atmosphere with great visuals be combat mechanic and action sequences new insightful lore and fun remixes 10/10. A perfect game, has the best gameplay of all metroid 2D. The exploration is fun, and the difficulty is complete perfect to begin in this franquice,The songs are very good.. Fun to start with but the difficulty ramps up to insane levels. So sad I was really enjoying this but now I am stuck and can’t get any further, it’s not fun dying endlessly on the same bit over and over again. Won’t be buying any Metroid games ever again, staying clear of this bait and switch.. After Federation Force left many Metroid fans feeling cold, Metroid: Samus Returns was a return to form. A remake of the 2-D gameboy classic Metroid: Return of Samus it lifts the familiar maps/locations but adds some new bells and whistles. Most evident is the greater detail in each area. This is further highlighted by the addition of a map and other things like a bomb pulse to find hidden areas which makes navigating SR-388 much easier than it was in the original. Samus has also received combat enhancements over the original. There is a counter mechanic as well as a laser aim mechanic that make combat feel rewarding when you time a counter well or precisely line up a shot. The only downside is that it is limited by the native resolution of the 3DS screen. Not that it looks bad, the 3D effect makes it look like a mini shadowbox of sorts. However I do think it would have benefited from the HD screen of the Switch. The special edition also comes with the Samus archives soundtrack which is a must for any Metroid fan.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. First time I decided to actually play a Metroid, my usual kind of games are actually RPGs... And boy! How did I not decided before?? What a foolish mistake! This game is reaĺly fun! I'm glad that I added it to my collection!. Don’t be fooled by the connection to Metroid II: this game has been revamped, redesigned and rejuvenated to such an extreme degree that to all intents and purposes it’s a brand new adventure. This is far and away one of the best Metroid games ever made, and one of the best examples of the entire Metroidvania genre as a result. Melee counters and free aiming have made combat feel fresh and exciting again, while the environments are incredible – especially when viewed in auto-stereoscopic 3D. It’s a given that this is a must-buy for Metroid fans, but it’s also essential for those who’ve never played a 2D Metroid and want to see what the fuss is all about. This is what the fuss is all about, and the wait was so, so worth it.. This game is challenging,fun, and pretty cheap it’s pretty sad that pretty much everyone doesn’t know about Metroid in Europe or Japan. Underrated series.. Metroid: Samus Returns game hearkens back to the style of the Metroid games on the Gameboy Advance (Fusion and Zero Mission) and does not disappoint. This side scrolling platform adventure has you exploring the planet SR388 and takes place after the original Metroid game. Samus is tasked with wiping out all of the Metroids on the planet. Typically, you start ultra low powered and explore the planet and gain power-ups, take on more powerful bosses, unlock secrets and progress through the adventure. The introduction of the free aiming and melee parry mechanics add another dimension to the combat and is a real nice touch. Some of the bosses can be a little tough and thanks to the console's size, hand cramp can ensue due to the intensity of some of the boss battles. The visual are great for the 3DS, adding a good sense of scenery change throughout the levels and a very cool depth of field effect for quite of the areas - good job! To make the final boss more manageable, you'll want to backtrack and get all the hidden power-ups, which can be quite a grind, but you are rewarded for your effort. Overall, this is a masterpiece **** and the very few drawbacks it has are far overshadowed by the excellent game play, enjoyable exploration and engaging combat mechanics. This is up there with the very best games on the Nintendo 3DS games. Game Journey gives this a score of 95 out of 100. Masterpiece.. While it’s been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, Metroid: Samus Returns is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. It’s a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, it’s nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids.. The game itself is top notch. The controls are spot on and it's not a joke to beat like I thought it would. It's not as good as Super Metroid, but that game was a masterpiece and would be nearly impossible to outdo it. The reason it's not a 10 is because they did something on the level of EA by locking the hardest difficulty behind a $30 amiibo paywall. You also get to play in the fusion suit on that difficulty, but why would you charge $30 to allow people to get 2 shot by bosses in the Fusion Suit? Just play Hard Mode while killing yourself if you get to half health or below and save $30. Buy the game, but do NOT buy the amiibo.. A confession -- Metroid II: Return of Samus was one of my favorite Game Boy games. I replayed it a few years ago when it hit the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and I still loved it. Most Metroid fans disagree and consider Metroid II to be among the worst in the series (buoyed somewhat, perhaps, by Other M and Federation Force). Metroid: Samus Returns is the best kind of remake, in that it captures the spirit of the original while greatly improving upon it, correcting virtually all of its flaws and adding a tremendous amount of new content. The best new feature is the melee combat system, which adds a new dynamic to gameplay and keeps players on their toes. From the excellent visuals to the superb soundtrack, MSR is among the best games in the series and one of my favorite Nintendo 3DS titles.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 8.5 Sound/Music: 9.5 Graphics/Art: 8 Story/Atmosphere: 9 OVERALL: 8.8/10. This is sadly my 1st Metroid and am in love, it's a must have game worth every $. Return of Samus is a great game, it has everything that a metroid game should have: exploration, upgrades, oppressive atmosphere, isolation, etc. Gameplay: Samus feels nice and responsive while you are playing and the use of the morphospere and the other skills is really nice. They added a counter attack which is something that has too much impact on the gameplay (sometimes you just want to counter the enemies because is faster than shooting them to death) They also add a set of four new skills that use an energy bar (in the end you just use one of them, the others are just to get some upgrades and so on). We have to kill 40 metroids and they are really similar between them so it ended up being a bit repetitive (except the last fight, the last fight is awesome). So overall, despite being really nice, sometimes the gameplay design feels a bit lazy. Graphics: the graphics are awesome! It feels like a classic metroid but with a new whole design ( the gravity suit looks great!) Nothing more to say! Music: it has some memorable pieces, but overall it is maybe too ambiental for a metroid ost. We miss some epic zone song like sector 1 from fusion or the masterpieces from super metroid. Overall: a great game and a really good metroid, but it lacks the perfection and rhythm that super metroid, zero mission and fusion have.. Distinctly inferior to the fan-created AM2R, this is a decent effort but the weakest entry to the 2D Metroid series since the original Metroid 2. The linear design stifles exploration, and the early Scan Pulse ability relegates item collection to backtracking busywork and puzzle-solving. The limited enemy set quickly grows repetitive (palette-swapped stronger versions of early enemies in 2017?). Many items are locked behind secret game mechanics, and in this game there are no Etecoons or Dachoras to teach you the ropes. Bosses will take several tries to beat; they aren't hard after you've learned how to fight them, but they'll kill you in just a few hits, and you need to learn how to telegraph their attacks the hard way. ""Fortunately,"" you can look forward to fighting most of the bosses several times, so those skills you've learned won't go to waste, but these fights are long and get monotonous by the third or fourth time. There's some effort with the early Metroids, especially Beta and Gamma, to at least vary the rooms you fight them in, but the Zetas are basically all the same and the Omega battles are identical. If you adore 2D Metroid games and eagerly snatch up anything with the name, you won't have a bad time here. If you really just want to experience a modern presentation of Metroid 2, hunt down AM2R, which is better in basically every way--better exploration, more fun (but still difficult) bosses, less repetition, even better music. Nintendo should be embarrassed that with all their resources, they couldn't do better than this.. Huge Metroid Prime fan (3D entries for GC/Wii) and I grew up with the SNES so inherently loved Super Metroid. This is by far the best of all 5 of those games and in my opinion it is not even close. Back tracking is a huge element of these games and it never felt cumbersome or annoying. It is fast paced, difficult and most importantly beautiful. This thing is not short on Nintendo polish to say the least. Never got to play the 'original' gameboy version of this game; however it is hard to believe it was even close to this game. 10/10 game and top 5 for the entire system.. The game is awesome but it has some little flaws that in my eyes prevent it from being a masterpiece. Overall, the gameplay is great, level design is top notch, presentation is great. This is a solid entry in the Metroid series. If you want to know if you should buy this game: buy it. It's worth every cent. Now, the nitpicky cons: - Movement is mapped to the circle pad and while Samus is responsive, this can sometimes create problems, since the circle pad doesn't have the accuracy of a d-pad. The option to choose between the circle and d-pad would have been appreciated (you could always use the circle pad for the 360 aiming, even using the d-pad to move). - Some of the controls are on the touch screen and while this isn't a problem during most of the game, executing some of the manouvers (i.e. sometimes during the extra items hunt) can be a problem when you're required to act fast. I've died multiple times on a certain boss only because I couldn't switch my beams quick enough. I've played the game on a New 3DS XL and it doesn't even take advantage of the extra shoulder buttons. - The counter mechanic crushes the pace in the beginning of the game. This is certainly a design decision to make you feel stronger in the latter half (spoiler: it does), but the mechanic itself forces you to stop every movement to counter an attack (well, you can move and counter, but I don't have this kind of reflexes, since the enemies rush you the moment they see you), if you don't have a powerful enough beam to plow through any enemy. It looks cool though. Also, the mechanic never feels like a QTE (you have to actually shoot after performing the counter and you can choose your ammunition). In the end, I wouldn't remove it from the game, but I wouldn't make the enemies react so fast to your presence, rushing you the moment they see you every single time (sometimes even from off screen). - Gone are all the skill based moves like they were in the old 2D games. The wall-jump is a joke to pull off, there's no shinespark and bomb jumping feels much, MUCH easier too. - While the aeon pulse is optional, it seriously destroys any sense of discovery and a-ah moment. Sure, you could NOT use it, but I would have preferred the option to turn this particular feature off. It doesn't serve any gameplay reason and it's there only to ease your journey. Also, the aeon bar recharges way too easily and this encourages the player to spam the ability and the pulse shows way too much of the map. Bringing up AM2R (excellent fan remake of Metroid 2), in that the game signalled extremely well hidden passages and other hidden alcoves, much better than in any other 2D Metroid game, without any need for a feature like the aeon pulse. Inthis remake, without the pulse it's go bomb everything, because rarely the bombable stuff is signaled in any meaningful, unintrusive way. In short: I want Metroid to subtly catch my eye and to make me wonder if something might be behind that slightly weird block. I don't want it to go: EHY BOMB THERE YOU DUMB DUMB. - Stuff locked behind amiibos: most of it is totally optional, but locking the Fusion Difficulty behing a plastic, day-one DLC was a d-ick move by Nintendo. - Warning: serious nitpicking! The Lower Brinstar music... why? Lower Brinstar is on a whole other planet! It's fanservice and I didn't like it (the fanservice, not the music). And that's it. Fix this stuff in the next game (because there will be another 2D Metroid game during my lifetime, right NINTENDO?!) and you'll have a masterpiece deserving a 9 or even a 10. This time, I'd give the game a 8,5, but Metacritic doesn't like half marks, so it's an 8.. Metroid: Samus Returns is really just a straight-up 2D Metroid game. And like all 2D Metroid games I've played, it's quite good. I still own my GameBoy copy of the original Return of Samus, and though I really enjoyed it as a kid, let's face it, most GameBoy games have aged terribly. The graphics were hard on the eyes, Samus took up 30% of the screen, you couldn't really see where you were going, and my recollection of metroid battles, especially with zetas and omegas, was basically a crapshoot of getting in that first missile and then looping them to death. Samus Returns (why such confusing naming?) does everything better, and even with nostalgia goggles it's hard to see things otherwise. The game has new skills, new enemy behaviour, new mechanics, and to be honest, they all work. The Metroid fights, even if the enemies themselves have fairly repetitive behaviour, are made novell by adding new behaviour and enemy skills. And to keep each battle fresh, the metroids get small behavioural changes and changing environmental dangers keep increasing the difficulty. The added fast-travel points is a great addition, as is the map. Each area is big, yet not overwhelgmingly so, making backtracking for secrets less tedious than in many other games of the genre. There are a few things that nag me. I don't find the controls as tight as they were with previous entries (I blame the C-Pad), the swipping attack is a bit unbalanced, I can't decide if it's garbage or overpowered. It seems that a lot of mechanics were based on the swipping attack, because a lot of enemies take a large amount of hits if they're not countered first. In large groups, the swipe is not as useful, and killing a bunch of enemies with the gun is kinda weak by itself. Maybe I've just lost the touch, but I used to enjoy bomb jumping and can't seem to do it at all here because the timing is so strict. Anywho, is it the best 2D Metroid game ever? No, Super Metroid is better and Metroid Fusion, too - I don't remember playing Metroid Zero Mission for what it's worth - but these are also some of the best games in the style ever made. Saying it's not as good as Super Metroid is disingenuous. Let's just repeat that, for impact: SAYING IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS SUPER METROID IS DISINGENUOUS. If you're anything of a Metroid fan, it's a must-have. If you're interested in Metroidvanias, it's a pretty good place to start.. The game has got many, many flaws, but as I was getting deeper and deeper into SR388's caves i found myself loving it more and more. The most glaring issue is the linearity, which is admittedly not as bad as it could be, since the players have the illusion of dealing with the metroids in whichever order within the area they currently are in. The game takes the player on a rollercoaster ride with faux set pieces which kinda detracts from the experience. Another thing that I didn't really like is the lack of memorable stuff. Don't get me wrong, the ""real"" bosses are great, but a lot of earlier encounters kinda blend together. There aren't also many memorable places on the map, like some rooms in Prime or Fusion that you would know by heart even after one playthrough (Phendrana Shorelines, Hall of the Elders). The music also **** - I get the ambience is essential for the atmosphere, but again, Prime and Fusion tackled that much better. The few real tracks that are there - remixes of Lower Brinstar, Lower Norfair and the new Chozo Research Laboratory only accentuate this, as they seem really out of place. There is also a problem with the enemy variety -","this game is super good for the most part, but it just doesnt control very well . largely this games enemies hurt way too much, and backtracking is some how more of a chore than it ever has been in a Metroid game . for the most part, Samus Returns really shines when it introduces new elements into the original game ."
"1,078.World of Warcraft: The War Within","It's been a long time since I've seen a publisher act as impudently and brazenly as **** the game you have to let this publisher annoy you over and over again with explanations, info boxes etc. After 20 years of playing. There is no option to switch this crap off. ‘You have to focus on a quest task’ is constantly written on the quest tracker. And you do that, if you don't this **** info box pops up over and over again! Ad nauseam!PvP: Premade groups that actually violate the TOS. Tons of complaints from users, Blizzard does NOT give a damn. NOTHING is done about these cheaters. Absolutely nothing! And they are cheaters because of this ADDON which circumvents the use mechanics of Blizzard to bypass restrictions on random bgs and to be able to join with 25 men premade!Not to mention all the bugs that I reported at the beginning of Dragonflight, which are still active today (almost three years now) and have not been **** club is finished. Whether D4 or WoW, only dollar signs, no quality, no more service.Translated with **** (free version). I'm writing this review after 19 years of playing World of Warcraft, to give my honest thoughts about the expansion after playing all the preceding expansions and vanilla. I have through the years of World of Warcraft learned to never take reviews of expansions seriously when they are published at the time of the expansion's release. This is because Blizzard's strategy when they develop an expansion is to make it look appealing at first glance for professional reviewers from gaming sites and on YouTube, mostly when leveling up to max level through the various new zones because that's what the reviewers are going to experience at launch. You'd think that an honest professional review would be one that was published some time after the release, to give a realistic and summarized picture of how the expansion actually turned out: Such as the quality and state of max level content, both for PvE and PvP- where the expansion's real content is. To start with the expansion had a preorder strategy with different editions like many other game publishers do, which is never a good idea for us who are enjoying the game. That's because many people will buy the expansion in advance without knowing how it will turn out, which go hand in hand with that ActivisionBlizzard already have the money for the new expansion and thus can develop it however they like. But for this expansion the most expensive edition was a giant step too far by giving those who bought it several days of early access- in short nothing less than a forced cash grab for people who play World of Warcraft competitively. This meant that they could ""develop"" an expansion that turns out to be in fact underdeveloped with recycled ideas from previous expansions such as mostly Dragonflight. What a shocker. As of writing this review I have played the new expansion almost every day of the week since the official launch, and the most obvious issue with the expansion is simply the recycled general content that has turned out to be severely lacking in terms of gameplay design. In other words people don't want to do the previous expansion again. This has led to a noticeable decline in the amount of active players, something which is very obvious if you do any max level content: Queue times are extremely long for any activity, and attempting to list a group in search for more players for any content usually takes anywhere from 30 minutes up to an hour in average to find good players- even during the hours which is popular for people to play. In comparison most previous expansions there have usually always been an abundance of players. Summarized this expansion is not worthy to play with its underdeveloped core game design and reused ideas. My advice is not to get engaged in this expansion, because you will most likely be very disappointed.. It's hard to reconcile professional reviews of this game with the actual experience playing it. Other than Hallowfall, the zones are visually a big step down from expansions like BFA. The graphical fidelity is really starting to look stuck in the early 2010s and unacceptable for a 2024 release. Zones like Isle of Dorn look straight up unfinished outside the city and points of interest. The story is deeply uninteresting, truly even more forgettable and bland than Dragonflight, which was already not great. The length of the campaign is barely 6 hours and the shortest and laziest ever released with an expansion. The social aspect of the game is deader than ever and retail has fully transitioned into a 'dead mall' feeling. M+ group finder is still profoundly broken for damage players and requires half an hour just to find a group. Hero talents are one of the major selling points of the expansion but unfortunately are almost all passives and have virtually no impact on gameplay, at least for the classes I played. I would have preferred the 'borrowed power' of Shadowlands over this, at least those abilities were significantly gameplay altering and very visually creative. The new race Earthen Dwarves are a disgracefully lazy effort and look like they were thrown together by interns in a couple of afternoons. The extreme low effort of Earthen are a microcosm of the developer's approach to everything in the expansion. There are a few bright spots - Delves are single-player endgame content which fills the niche of endgame activities for non-raiders and those that don't like M+. However, it is noticeably less fun and engaging than Torghast from Shadowlands and makes you wonder why that feature was not built upon instead of re-inventing the wheel with Delves. Rated solo queue for battlegrounds is also a good addition, though added half a decade too late. Overall though, this is the lowest quality expansion released in memory. The cherry on top was paid early access, which split the launch playerbase and almost entirely killed the hype for the expansion release. The disrespect for long-term players from Blizzard is hard to fathom. I highly recommend just playing classic anniversary realms, which are alive, highly social and hark back to the a long-lost time when this company had creative integrity and cared about the quality of their work instead of maximizing how much money can be wrung out of each player and continuing to try to convert this game into speedrunning esports lobby game with M+, instead of the MMORPG it was meant to be. I recognize that game development is extraordinarily hard, but this is simply not good enough for a game with a box price, monthly subscription and very expensive microtransactions. I would seek a refund for this expansion if I were eligible.. At the start feels fresh, thanks to the narrative, but in the end it's the same old system to **** our money with the content being released in smaaaal portions.. Can someone finally delete all the fake AI reviews as well as the copy-paste one to two-liner 10/10 reviews? The site is practically spammed with them, and it’s beyond embarrassing. I’d probably give the game a 3 or 4 out of 10 in it's current state, but considering that fake reviews are tolerated here to manipulate the score, I’m forced to reduce it to 0 just to balance it out somewhat. Like its predecessors, this expansion is an absolute disaster. As a so-called new race, players get slapped with a third, cheap dwarf recolor. Seriously, what are we even paying the monthly subscription fees and the ridiculously overpriced expansion costs for? Not to mention all the microtransactions and the predatory FOMO tactics in this game. The story is atrociously bad once again, but that’s been the case since the end of Legion. As others have pointed out, you’re still strictly assigned to a faction based on race instead of values. At the same time, the devs want to preach about how wonderful the rainbow is ever since Blizzard’s scandals. Yet they stick to their racial segregation. It doesn’t get more hypocritical than this. Professions and class balance have, as always, been completely botched, and apart from that, it’s the same outdated, bland content as usual.. World of Warcraft: War Within has truly exceeded my expectations and reignited my passion for this legendary franchise. From its gripping storyline to the immersive world design, everything feels grand, polished, and carefully crafted to keep players engaged for hours on end. The new zones are brimming with fascinating lore, enriched by breathtaking landscapes and challenging dungeons that reward teamwork, strategy, and **** of the key highlights for me has been the refined combat mechanics and the wide range of character progression options. Whether you’re a veteran or a newcomer, the game provides a satisfying balance between accessibility and depth. At no point did I feel overwhelmed by the choices available: instead, they made my adventure feel more personal and rewarding. Combined with a strong in-game community, War Within fosters an environment where it’s easy to make friends, join guilds, and embark on epic raids together.A resource that made my progression through War Within especially smooth was ExpCarry (****). Their professional services and expert advice helped me sharpen my gaming skills and gain power much faster than I could have on my own. I was initially skeptical about seeking outside help, but ExpCarry delivered outstanding results at a surprisingly affordable price. Through personalized coaching sessions and tailored boosting services, I managed to improve my character’s gear and combat prowess in a fraction of the usual time. It was exciting to see myself transition from struggling through tough raids to comfortably holding my own in high-level encounters.Overall, WoW: War Within encapsulates the spirit of exploration, heroism, and camaraderie that has defined the series for years, while adding refreshing layers of complexity and excitement. If you’re craving a new gaming adventure with a vibrant community and endless opportunities for growth, this expansion is worth every minute you invest. And if, like me, you need a bit of a helping hand along the way, ExpCarry is a fantastic resource to guide you toward becoming the formidable hero you’ve always wanted to be.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just another fail. Just like Dragonflight, Shadowlands, bfa and wod. So yeah, here we go again with a story for the ""modern audience"", filled with tons of retcons and the most cringeworthy moments one could think of. On top of that the same outdated graphics and limitations. Not to mention, that the devs still keep racial segregation between Horde and Alliance as theirvery foundation and with this forcing their players into a faction they don't like because of the playable race they want to play. Yikes. Tried it for a month, but just like the other expansions, I had to quit. There is absolutly nothing new in TWW. And the biggest joke of all... a ""brand new race""... in form of a THIRD dwarf recolor. Guess I'm gonna quit Blizzard for good this time. This is just embarrassing at this point.. I have never been as uninterested, or as bored with an expansion, as I am with the war **** I survived Shadowlands. The story just doesn't work for me, I don't care about the Earthen (much like I didn't care about the Dragons in Dragonflop)...like the story isn't even presented in a good way. I do believe the lack of interest for neckbeard female dwarves and the rest of their ilk has ruined the entire expansion.. This game has become like Call of Duty, FIFA etc. Constantly releasing the same stuff, milking players for years and years. The current Blizzard hasn't released a good game since Overwatch 1 and this won't change because they are terrible.They will keep adding expansions and people will happily buy **** old GOATed Blizzard would have released a sequel for Wow already which i believe would be amazing. But this Blizzard is so bad that they can't . It would fail so much and they have kept the amazing foundations of WOW that classic Blizzard built and making money from it by releasing bad stuff. They found so many ways to milk everything from you. Wow classic and all this stuff. Don't get me wrong Wow classic was very nice, but they keep re-releasing all the expansions till you will have War Within classic as well. They are so lucky that there is no competition in the mmo scene, because MMOs in my opinion are the hardest games to make and there is no real competitor.. It's Dragonflight 2. Even though I heavily favored Dragonflight as an expansion, after 2 years of the same stuff it gets old. The new race that launched with the expansion is a third flavor of dwarves (why?). The first update coming around after 4 months is a re-used island expedition with the Azerite still laying around. PvP is entirely dead (I'm sitting in queue for 15+ minutes for a random bg and then gave up, arena queues take 20 minutes or longer for 1 game that lasts maybe 1 minute). I can't say much about the story or lore since I don't care for underground stuff or stone dwarves. Tanks were ultra nerfed, putting all the responsibilities on the healers. They last did this in Shadowlands season 1 where a tank and healer exodus happened. Over all I see more and more bad decisions that remind me of Shadowlands in War Within. Not a good sign. There have been no new customizations added for any races. Troll beards? Goblin beards? What really killed my will to play was that they added pointy ears for humans (that already have the largest amount of customizations available) and kul tirans (nobody plays those). Blizzard continues to treat their flagship title that isn't a failure (Such as HotS, Diablo, Overwatch and every other title they put out) like trash. Bonus points for every time you encounter a bug that is in the game since the launch. It took them 4+ months to fix the Shadowlands intro quest bug. There are still (endless title spaming when logging in comes to mind) countless bugs in the game that aren't being fixed. Instead development time is being spent on making a $90 store mount. Customer service is non existant as well as it's useless or replaced by AI. Where does all their money go? Much like the ingame world that remains in the state of the cataclysm, WoW has grown incredibly stagnant.. balanced pvp finally, idk about rest ------------------------------------------. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a 15-year veteran of World of Warcraft, it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore how much the game has lost its essence over the years. The latest updates feel both uninspired and shallow, with reused assets and content that only serves to remind you of how little effort the developers are putting in. It's honestly insulting that Blizzard has resorted to recycling old content while charging players a monthly subscription fee of $15. The lack of innovation and the glaring absence of true Player vs. Player (PvP) improvements are especially disappointing. PvP used to be a core pillar of WoW, but it now feels like an afterthought, with little to no significant updates that improve the experience for competitive players. Beyond the gameplay itself, the game feels completely disconnected from its original identity. The main characters who once defined the narrative are nowhere to be found, leaving the world feeling hollow and uninspired. It's as if the game's soul has been drained. The developers have failed to provide polished, meaningful content, making the game feel more like a beta than a fully realized, live product. As someone who has invested so much time and emotion into this world, it’s painful to watch WoW descend into mediocrity. I truly hope Blizzard either pulls itself together or that this iconic franchise finds a new owner who can restore it to its former glory, because right now, World of Warcraft is a shadow of what it once was.. Wow continues to build on the good progress they made with Dragonflight. TWW is basically a carbon copy of DF with a couple slight tweaks. Delves are a good solo option but lost their intrigue and replayability in only a couple weeks. M+ (never my favorite part of the game) was tuned too highly and punished the casual players. Raid and dungeon design is still awesome and consistently the best part of the current era of design. The story is a ?? as they struggle to establish new memorable characters and storylines. The 20th Anniversary event was a lot of fun and they have gotten a lot better with the flow of content and news. I continue to and always look forward to what they will do next.. Once again, a complete disgrace, though after the latest expansions, this should hardly come as a surprise. On a sidenote... I wish this platform would remove blatant fake reviews like those clearly made by ai, along with the one- or two-sentence nonsense that says nothing. But back to the point: more of the same old stuff, and that’s anything but good. A new race was promised, and no new race was delivered. Instead, we get a literal fourth cheap dwarf copy, lazily repainted and passed off as something new. It couldn't get more embarrassing. The story is yet another mishmash of cringeworthy moments, still desperately trying to push a certain political message ever since the dev scandals came to light, as if anyone would fall for that distraction. The graphics remain completely neglected, stuck somewhere in the early 2000s. The same goes for the barely existent character customization, the outdated and still highly restrictive race division between Horde and Alliance (gotta talk nonstop about rainbows, but still promote racial segregation as the game's foundation, eh Blizzard?- not hypocritical at all!), and general features that have been standard in other games for over a decade, like dyeable armor are still not there in WoW. Instead, they keep throwing store mounts and other items at us for a hefty $90 or more. This game is truly forgettable. I’m annoyed with myself for even giving it another shot.. World of Warcraft: The War Within offers a fresh, character-driven expansion with a focus on more intimate stories rather than large cosmic threats. The expansion introduces beautifully detailed zones like the Ringing Deeps and Hallowfall, adding depth to the world of Azeroth. While some players appreciate the new solo-friendly content, including ""Delves,"" others find them tedious compared to traditional dungeons. Despite this, the shift toward narrative and smaller-scale quests has revitalized the game, making it appealing to both new and returning players. Worst expansion with completely trash PvP balance with zero feedback from devs and zero reviews from them on arena games , rogue + mage + priest comp that keeps being tier 1 setup for 20 years with no changes ,evocators with 2 abilities (one of them is a damage over time lol) to make damage / healing , black arrow (another damage over time ability) which does x1.5 damage compared to summary of all other hunter abilities, all 3 warlock spec is playable and all 3 does damage mostly by damage over time (again xdxdxdxd) , hunter pets are basically immortal since Battle For Azeroth expansion and does more damage than hunter itself and still not a single balance change in that way , warriors since Battle For Azeroth is just a damage dealing class and all balance changes are just + or - damage from one or another ability, while every other class have about 5 movement cd's warriors are still enjoying 2 abilities with 20 and 45 cd each (xd) , which basically makes every damage balance changes that dev's does to them completely useless since no any chance to even reach any meta class in this expansion to make any damage , rogues tanking warriors on arena face to face , warlocks are invincible in any caster comp , priests are doing damage on arena in healer specializations to heal (biggest lol yet) and they are literally doing healing better than any other healer excluding monks maybe , and I can continue this list of worst PvP balance decisions for entire WoW existance more and more .Basically PvE expansion (which also poorely balanced sadly , but at least its playable , unlike PvP content) and worst waste of 70 dollars in my entire life.. I enjoyed my first play-through on all the quest-lines but the story was a bit underwhelming to be honest. You get the “new content” buzz on a new release but it definitely fades fast on some expansions and this for me is one of those expansions. Once I finished the quest-lines I stopped being interested. Definitely had more fun in Dragonflight. This expansion has plenty of content and things to do so definitely worth it if you like WoW and want to waste a few hours here and there.. So far so good. M+ Season a bit to hard for my taste but overall still a enjoyable experience with lots of content, including some new and fresh. i am done, my subs canceled. this morons developers team creat all pve encounters for BM hunters and melee specs, and burst aoe damage of these specs is many times higher than **** flight time of my pitlord animation is 3 times longer than any thrash in this game lives, the strongest button does ZERO damage, and the most **** thing is that I can't even press it when I want to I have to catch this proc.. Whenever you think they couldn’t sink any lower, the devs still manage to do it. New race? Nope, they throw a lazy third dwarf recolor at us. Honestly, I’ve reached the point where I also believe it’s long overdue to get rid of the outdated racial segregation altogether, especially since it’s always been dumb and just make the races neutral. At least that would spare us all these cheap clones and finally let us play in the faction we actually like. Imagine dividing your playerbase by race. Delves? An annoying Torghast clone, and Torghast was already hated. Warbands? Just a way to completely mess up the character select screen, making it incredibly chaotic and hard to navigate. New zones? More like old zones slightly redesigned. Story? I better not even start on that. Anything else? Nope. And the roadmap for next year looks pretty miserable as well.. As a player that came back after 5 years, WoW has shown that after 20 years, they have been continuously changing and adding new things into the game. Yes, there are still many areas lacking like how they tell the story or how engaging is their group content as compared to many games. However, in a whole, as an MMORPG, WoW is still one of top few choices for me. It is not easy to find a game of such caliber with that many players in the community. As for TWW expansion, the overall campaign/dungeons/raids experiences were nice, but also there is not much to feel amazed by. The newly added delves feature feels similar to a mini dungeon which doesn't feel very unique, but it does create a good activity among small group of friends as it does not restrict to a 5-men party and roles restriction. Professions are also made with more complexity to feel less linear on the way you want to work on it. As for the cons, the last chapter of the current patch does not feel that engaging and I kind of drift off quite often during the campaign and quests. Since it is the last chapter, I feel it should have been made more epic and engaging to end things off. Hope that aspect will get better in the next few patches ahead. I would strongly recommend to any MMORPG lovers to at least try this game once in your life.. It's bad.. like... really, really bad. I wish I had stopped playing this game in Legion, the last solid expansion. Everything after that is just really, really bad. And I mean, yeah, dwarves 3.0 as so called brand new race is just embarrassing, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. There is just so much wrong with this game... Maybe I give WoW another chance once they abandon their racial segregation foundation and make all races neutral, instead of all the copy&paste recolors, update the overall graphics, add modern customizations, fix the bugs, improve crafting, class blanancing and in general listen to feedback, but until then... I just can't with these devs anymore.. This is not a great expansion, the gameplay itself is mostly fine except for scuffed talent trees and constant reworks, lacklustre quest design(especially world quests) and of course the absurd amount of bugs present in the game now that don't get fixed at all. The story for The War Within is except for Shadowlands, which ruined almost all previous lore, the worst WoW has ever had, the characters are whiny, annoying, generally unlikable and uninteresting with the single exception being Dagran, he is honestly pretty neat but he needs to grow a beard! Anduin is a whiny idiot, Fearin is an annoying ""can't do wrong, everything she does is amazing"" type of character, and I find it frustrating how dumb her ""prosthetic shield"" looks, she was given the opportunity for a genuine prosthetic arm and was like ""nah fam, having only one arm is amazing to me"". Instead of making an amazingly cool and badass disabled character that also struggles with their disability(like many real people do) as an example for a badass disabled character i'll mention Adam Jensen from Deus Ex, No blizzard wanted to make almost a text book mary sue character out of her, same **** they did with Thrall during Cataclysm where he became the annoying Green Jesus. I would not recommend this expansion at current time. The gameplay is flawed by dumb designs and horrendous bugs while the story and lore are quite frankly ****.. Dwarves... of all the lazy copy&paste races instead of new races they just had to give us recolor dwarves... for a third time, lol. Like... how disconnected to your playerbase can you be? Instead of giving us a lazy af recolor of one of the most unpopular races they could have at least given us a recolor of a race, that is popular like Vulpera for example and Vulpera are ony there once, so it would at least be not a third copy of the exact same race. But nope, dwarves for the third time it is... Story is cringe like always, delves are Thorgast 2.0, character select screen is a mess, same old racial segregation for Horde and Alliance for whatever reason, can't allow your players to choose their faction freely, I guess, everything has to be based on race... some weird mindset, but hey, it's Blizzard, still no update regarding the very dated avatar models and the almost non existing customization options... like... they don't even have height sliders or palettes in that game, lol and yeah... if you didn't like wod, bfa, shadowlands and dragonflight... it's more of that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Another meh expansion, just like the last three. They promise a new playable race, yet all they did was giving dwarves a new color... for the third time and that is what they are selling as new race. Just wow... It's really sad how they treat their players. Like seriously, just make all races neutral already, so that both sides can finally have all races instead of keeping their questionable racial segregation as the very foundation and keep releasing these cheap copy&paste recolors. It's embarrassing.Honestly, there isn't much else to talk about because they didn't gave us any new features with this expansion. Df at least took GW2's dragon riding system, this time... nothing. Some long overdue qol changes and that's it. Yet they are pumping out one store item after the other. Guess WoW is only for the whales these days. Nothing really noteworthy in TWW.. I wanted to check in after a few weeks to see how the user score has evolved, only to find out that once again, the site has deleted dozens of comments, leaving mostly the positive ones. It's just so frustrating how blatantly they're trying to push a false score. Not to mention the official critics, who leave their generic copy-paste reviews, but that's no secret anymore. That's why I decided to write a comment myself, even though it will probably disappear like so many others over time. I would give it a 3/10, but because of the misleading ratings, I'm giving it a 0. The entire expansion consists of nothing but recycled old content, along with the typical cringe-worthy story that comes with it. There's no new race, just dwarves for the third time, with slightly different textures, but otherwise indistinguishable from regular dwarves. Now there are already three Alliance races on the Horde side, while only one Horde race is on the Alliance side. Together with multiple neutral Alliance cities, iconic Alliance mounts and transmogs, while almost everything Horde-related remains exclusive, the devs continue to show their toxic attitude towards a portion of their player base. But of course, that's nothing new either. Just think back to Vulpera vs Diaper Gnomes and similar incidents. Aside from that, the game still has the usual flaws: countless bugs, class imbalance, the terribly outdated graphics in most of the world, the barely existent customization options, the FOMO, and the almost predatory approach to all the store items. So yeah, more of the same once again.. Long time player; 45k achie points and prob over 2 years of game time; i would give it a 6, maybe 7at launch but after the whole early access and then the store AH mount, wich has unique QoL feature for 78euro i have to personally downgrade. This game has little left to offer me as an average skilled **** hardest content is too hard, tedious to form groups, and playing anything lower feels bas cause it doesnt feel like you finish the game. At a more casual level the world feels a useless husk due to Skyflying and instanced content. This game is NOT an MMORPG but multiplayer ARPG with soft mmo-features, if that makes any sense. Dont get me wrong, WoW combat is snappy and engaging, raids and dungeons (some of them) are fun to play and delves had me interested for awhile. Sadly for me, thats about it. Gear system is ok, but there is too many different kind of game modes trying to fight for gear upgrades. It is just a mess. To finish your heroic gear upgrade track, you haveto do ... mythic. Crafting has also become a bloat of items and recipes and systems and stats, i hate it.) The anniversary event that came out also shows the lack of quality blizzard can push out nowadays. Bugs, a raid(pretty fun one!)that doesnt award better loot then old raid and is tuned very hard so no one does it and selling the most expensive store mount ever. A better looking bruto then the one i spend 5mil one. So now they are selling convenience on the store on a game we pay sub and base game for, you cant experience the magical launch if you dont pay extra. And people seem rather ok with it. I will not resub for awhile. I will most likely come back tho, ive been playing wow since forever, but more and more this game makes me feel like i waste my time, and not like i want to waste my time over it.. I'm here since the start. Sometimes with breakes made by boring or bad expansions in my opinion. ""The War Within"" sounds a bit hard for this expansion. So many drama and boring content. I mostly played all quests to enjoy the new stories the game has to tell me, but this time there are not many hero stories. More and more ""woke"" stuff. Giving as another dwarf race with new paint. Making a new gold driven economy next to boostservice. You can buy high quality gear without doing much. Bots, Goldseller, Boostservice.... nothing banable because thats how many of the supportteam earn some money next to their job. Another mount in the shop for 80€~. Greed is on their biggest trait. No more passion, no more proud developer. Only one greedy guy who runs a suite and every bad influence on his collegues to get rid of them. Many good developer left this company for a reason and with them the love for this game. New people coming to this company and have no idea or infos about the previous ingame history.

"1,079.Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix","In all, the new stuff adds more than 30 percent to the top of the already full-featured title. [May 2006, p.97]. If you've never play MC3 before, or if you're the best MC3 player in the world, you owe it to yourself to snag Remix, pimp out some rides, earn some phat cash and experience one of the best racers for the PlayStation 2. It's really that simple.. Best racing game ever made good graphics good songs a lot of content and lots of cars and still hold up to this day. Twenty quid for dozens of modifiable cars, 4 well realised cities and plenty of online and offline races is a good deal in anyone’s book, and especially ours.. Brimming with things that will irritate the hell out of you... Better than the first version, and at half the price. [Issue#139, p.72]. The slight frame rate issues do grate, but Midnight Club 3 is so un-ashamedly arcade like - and refuses to even attempt to act like anything more – that it stands out as a true racing gem.. Still lagging far behind ""Need for Speed,"" for modding and a fair stretch behind ""Burnout"" for sheer speed and crashiness, but for 20 quid you can't really go wrong. [May 2006, p.48]. Unless you're a seriously hardcore Midnight Club fan, the Remix isn't really worth buying if you've already got MC3.. This is honestly my favourite tuner-focused racing game, and it's way better than NFS Underground 2. Career mode was on point, maps were on point, car list was on point, and the driving is evil as hell!! The garage menu music was the reason for me customising every car I'd love to drive!!! AWESOME RACING GAME!!!. This game generally had some problems. To start off, optional races in the game have ridiculously easy opponents that drive at 75 mph! Also, the games traffic is limited and the cops chase you for 5 seconds before they give up. Graphics and damage is sloppy, but I liked some parts despite the flaws. The handling is easy to maneuver, if too fast paced with faster cars. There are abundant vehicle and customization options, and four cities, San Diego, Detroit, Atlanta, and now Tokyo. Sandbox is small but the ultimate playground. I also liked the sound effects and the cutscene dialogue and graphics. Also, I pretty much turned addicted to this somehow. However, I gave this a six because of several bad design choices.. This game is absolute nightmare in case of game-play and absolute masterpiece at car customization. After at least 15 retries all the wonderful music and amazing cars will annoys you so strong that you never ever notice how good they are. AI is nightmare. Classic Rockstar Games insane cops. But instead of cops they are racers! What about cops? Just double berserk behavior of racers and you got cops. Awful progress barriers on top of that. Frustration simulator '06.","if you've never played MC3 before, you owe it to yourself to snag Remix . twenty quid for dozens of modifiable cars, 4 well realised cities and plenty of online and offline races is a good deal in anyone’s book, and especially ours . the slight frame rate issues do grate, but Midnight Club 3 stands out as a true racing gem ."
"1,081.Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch","Ni No Kuni is such a fantastic game! Great story, great characters, great gameplay, great graphics, great soundtrack, great art style (thx Ghibli!). I couldn‘t put it down back in the days on my PS3 and bought it for my Switch recently to play it once again. This time on the go. Port is fantastic! I love the world building! One of my favorite games of all time.. It's Steam version, but it does not matter. Major disappointment from Battle System, especially after 2nd character joining the party. It could be a real nice game, but AI attempting suicide made me quit after 10 hours of gameplay.. Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch has some eye-catching cutscenes and atmospheres that really help set the mood for a ghibli style of adventure, but ultimately becomes a rather average one in the end. The combat also provides for some neat mechanics that I wish the pokemon company would look into, but still feels rather limiting despite it's promises. Aside from some backtracking and padding issues, Ni No Kuni still proved plenty of fun moments and captivated my imagination, if only for a little more than usual.. Amazing story! Is full of emotional moments. But the game is way toooo looong. It became a chore to get to the end. The graphics are very beautiful and the music exceptional. This is definitely a master piece.. I'm giving it 3 just for some difficulty with the final boss. Apart from that, one of the worst hyped game of all time.. This is the perfect JRPG. It combines elements of Pokémon and an interactive story. The game is close to 80 hours. The tutorial is long, but the time spent is worth it. The graphics are great for the style and time. Cut scenes are well made and voiced beautifully. It isn't a good game to introduce to a new player. The target audience is clearly experienced RPG enjoyers with ouds to classic RPGs.. This game has a wonderful design and presentation, so it's easy to WANT to overlook its flaws. However, the sad truth is that those flaws do add up to an unbearable weight and all but the most patient of players will likely make it to the end credits. The problem has to do with a shifting tone between a simplistic story and a quite high difficulty early on, as well as a prolongued ""tutorial"" opening that will make the first dozen or so hours a bit awful to climb. It might be wise to search out a beginner's guide that leaves out story spoilers, that could be a smart way to get the most out of this game.. If you like My Neighbour Totoro, Genshin Impact, Ni No Kuni (the studio Ghibi film), Harry Potter, then you will love this. It has wizards, witches, good, evil, strange creatures, (in a way it’s similar to Pokemon lol) and has a wide range of places. You can cast spells, tame creatures, battle enemies, and it’s just so fun. Definitely in my top 5 fav games. The world this game creates makes you feel like you might just be on the adventure of a lifetime, and then it tears that all apart every way it can! I warn you about this game, and am amaze and appalled at the high ratings it keeps getting. The only way this can get high ratings is from underdog-identifying jrpg obsessed fans that refuse to see flaws because they use a mindless grind to cope with reality. First of all, that beautiful, unique, aesthetic world is constantly ruined with puns. The spell to open doors is Open-says-a-me! HAHHAHAHAHAHA. WOW SO FUNNY! Imagine if Bloodborne or Skyrim ruined it's aesthetic like this. Wow this cave is called ""Bandits think they aren't about to get killed Cave!"" HAHAHAHAHA. The only reason this isn't brought up is because the large majority of jrpg fans are extremely trashy. Skip this Game Oh before I started writing this, when I was giving the game a final chance, the game crashed when I was saving, loosing loads of mindless-grindy progress. Just putting this here in case you were thinking this was too negative and wouldn't read all this. Skip this Game. You are from the normal Earth world and go to a fantasy style world. You meet a cute companion and bring her back to your world. How does she react???? SHE DOESN'T REACT AT ALL. Skip this Game. You have to collect milk from the milk fountains in town. You go to one only to find it isn't the one the game decided you should go to, the prompt just doesn't show up at all, you had to somehow predict that the developers wanted you to only collect milk from a certain fountain even though that isn't part of the story or quest at all. Skip this Game. How is the grind? If you have the Remastered or preordered the original, then you have Griffy and the grind is grindy. If not, then you have to constantly consume expensive health and mana potions all the time. Most of the Pokémon are completely weak and useless. [oh, and this is true on Easy difficulty] Skip this Game. Did a quest, it isn't completed because it's glitched. Skip this Game! You thought the art style was good? Wait until you see the most appallingly ugly talking tree design you have ever seen or imagined. Skip this Game! What a severe disappointment.. The game is BEAUTIFUL. The music is AMAZING and the plot is quite interesting. The game sounds like 10/10 until you enter some combat. This is where it all goes to the sewer. For some reason completely beyond me the developers decided to make this real time action battles. In consequence you have to frantically give commands, use items , control the movement of the characters and so on. Was that all turn based it would be a gem. Why have you done it dev ?!?! Everything in this game is perfect. Except for battles. They are absolutely horrible. And unfortunately 80 % of this game is battles.. This game could have been great. The art style is cute, the music is great, and the characters are memorable. This entire game is ruined by the horrid combat system. ARPGs really need good mechanics to stick out, and this game does not have them. Your companions are controlled by one of the dumbest AIs in video game history, and do almost nothing to help you in battle. The normal encounters are really nothing special; just spam attack and win. The boss fights are when things go down the drain. Many boss fights you are forced to run in circles while your AI hopefully does something to help you. That is, of course, if they don't die early in the fight because they never defend or evade. Sometimes the games with the most potential are ruined by one or two glaring flaws, and this is one of those games. I'd really like to give it a better score, but I can't justify it purely because of the combat. You wouldn't give a meatball sub a very high score if the meatballs were replaced with horse turds, regardless of how good the sauce or the bread was. Ni No Kuni is a meatball sub with horse turds for meatballs.. Beautiful, great music and art, interesting story, but dull, repetitive and challenging combat mar it for me. Such a shame.. A JRPG straight out of a fairy tale book, Ni No Kuni impresses with its scope and characters. There are dull moments in between but they don't detract too much from this charming and whimsical adventure.. Weird battle system : you choose action and let the character play... well, turn by turn will be more appropriate. Not a game for me after 15h finaly.. This game is amazing with immersed game play. It is generally easy to get the hang of. Even the grinding feels good. I feel like this should be played by a lot of people. The best part is the battle system which is also easy to handle and play with. You can select every party member's action to either attack and defend. it is really engaging.. Ni No Kuni its a perfect game for me. This game has so much polishing, so much content, so much love involved. Its a masterpiece of our age. NNK does not make anything new, but instead it collects many elements of classic JRPGs and use them in the rightest way possible. At the same time, NNK use all the modern resources it could to make the best experience possible, without fall into the same old tropes of the genre. And, besides being a perfect blend of old and new, NNK excels well in his narrative, using the Studio Ghibli factor by his side. And to complement all of that, NNK have a fun and polished game play, in which we can be stuck by hours and hours. In fact, NNK is my most beloved game ever. And the only one i can easy give a 10 out of 10... It does everything i like in a RPG right, and i cant recommend it enough.. I know this game has been out for a long time, but I see it's being re-released, so I want to warn people about the frustrations that I've experienced that didn't seem to bother people with positive reviews. The ally AI. I'm not even talking Persona 3 AI, I'm talking may have as well given the controller to a 2 year-old bad AI. Your AI partners are so dumb, they cannot make a single reasonable in-battle decision. They cannot defend properly. They cannot chose spells properly. They cannot use their SP properly. They won't use items. What they will do, is stand in the way of enemy attacks, burn through all their SP pointlessly, use inefficient attacks and spells, and make sure to die at every single random battle, unless you are over-leveled. A lot of times, I just let my partners die so I could focus on winning battles with just one character, because that was just as efficient anyway. Obviously, the game is not without some merit: the graphics look good; the music is fun; the locations are cool. But if you want to ""experience"" this game, you may as well skip all the fighting and watch the cutscenes on Youtube.. Not many games like it. The combat system feels unique. Even tho it borrows monster collecting and training from series like Pokemon, the combat is real time and more action based. The art style, animations and soundtrack are also all amazing.. I absolutely loved the way that Ni No Kuni combines the collection of Pokemon from Pokemon and the semi-realtime combat system from a few JPRGs. It led to really fun and unique gameplay.. I've just beaten the game so here goes my impressions: my first 6 hours were really great because everything was new. Graphics are really great, it's like an anime. It reminds me a bit Dragon Quest VIII. Soundtrack is really good as well, although the music in the battles can be repetitive as it can be these battles. About gameplay, is a mix of both turn based and real time based and reminds the Pokemon games. About plot is interesting at first. I think this game would have been better if it was shorter and with a more entertaining battle system. I think this is a really good game for children and young people but even if you're an adult and you are not only focused in bloody games with insults you're gonna enjoy this game. About difficulty, I didn't have much problems in easy mode until the end. Just make sure to save this game from time to time an especially when you are close to the ""star"" in the map (which is the main mission) because sometimes you can find a boss without having saved your game and save when you are a little far from the star cause sometimes you don't even reach the star and a scene triggers and sometimes is a boss. About bosses, if you have problems don't bother in leveling up your team. You only need to change your strategy, use the right attacks and have some potions in your bag. Doing this will be enough until you are finishing the game were enemies will be hard. My advice: do all the Horace riddles when you are close to the end. He will give you very good spells such Veil (with this you can avoid battles) and other strong spells. That's all. So yes, this is a good game. There should be more anime games like this in ps3 and ps4. It took me 39 hours to beat the game and a total of 44 hours and half to reach the real final. I beat the real final bosses at level 50 but with many PM potions (more than 20 and I used them all but 1). The worst of the final enemies is that your strongest spells are very slow to shoot and you can't cancel them to protect yourself when they send you a strong spell. This is the main gap I think.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. I Love Ni No Kuni!I Love The Challenges And Art Style,Ooh!And Even The Amount Of Strategies You Can Use,I Know This Is My Opinion But, Ni No Kuni Is Great! 10 out of 10!. Ni No Kuni is a fun and charming game filled with endearing characters and an enchanting world. Although the story may not be incredibly deep or complex, it’s well-executed and keeps things interesting. However, the battle system can be frustrating as you are constantly questioning your AI party members' intelligence and decision-making skills. The ""familiars"" bring a unique angle to the battles though and I find myself looking forward to exploring new areas specifically to find new creatures to add to my team. The animations created by Studio Ghibli also make the game a wonder to look at. Overall, a great game that is definitely worth jumping into.. An amazing light hearted game with a great storyline and lovable characters. The battle system was OK, got a bit repetitive after a while mind (and not for the best). Loved the side quest system and bounty hunts, all in all it was a very solid game. Could have had some more traditional Studio Ghibli cut scenes however... and all in all, the thing that REALLY, REALLY let it down was it's abysmal ending. Extremely anti-climatic and very disappointing. After putting 100+ hours into this game, I was hoping for a heartfelt, wonderful ending to this fantastic story but it seemed to end without finishing fully. I would have gladly given this game a solid 9/10 but the ending really was pathetic.. I have started the game expecting 9/10 but it is actually 6/10 game AT BEST. **** and shallow battle system, **** of boring copypasted side quests, time wasting slow animations, story for kids 5+ and no character development. I am incredibly disappointed in this turd.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Playstation pokemon Ni No Kuni Wrath of The white witch is a pokemon like action jrpg where you play as a boy named oliver who sets out to save his mom. This is a really heart breaking and heart fixing story and adventure.. The game opens in a 1950s and 60s feeling town known as motoville.. there are tons of cutscenes and voice acting here.. though sadly this gets rarer the deeper you get into this game.. its mostly reading which holds this game back a bit, but youre just s typical school boy getting into all kinds of shenanigans with your best friends.. and then things happen.. you cry, and your tears free a fairy that’s been trapped in your world and takes you to his world to help you save your mom.. Cause this game is all about soulmates.. there are 2 versions of everyone.. Characters that live in motorville live in this other world as other characters and youll be going back and forth occasionally to take care of their issues to help them in the other world and get one step closer to saving your mom To do this youll be mending the broken hearts of this worlds characters.. youll have to borrow love and enthusiasm, and belief from characters that have plenty and give it to people with broken hearts using your spell book.. Did I forget to mention youre a wizard, cause youre a wizard.. youre the hero this world has been waiting on to save them.. as you progress the game youll learn new spells to cast in world as well as in combat.. The meat of this game.. This is a very pokemon heavy styled game.. At least for the majority.. you have to get a few hours in until a character joins you that allows you to capture familiars throughout the world.. To capture them you have to impress them by weakening them in battle, and esther can then serenade them to make them your own.. you then throw them in your party or store them.. Your party will eventuially have 3 main characters, and each can hold 3 familairs at a time, all equally gaining xp from battles.. once leveled up high enough you can evolve them into their next form which starts them back to level 1, but their stats will greatly improve throughout their 3 different forms.. Characters do have weaknesses, and will learn new elemental moves, and they all have different sub classes like fighter, tank, caster, healer… all of which are important to have in your party.. at least for the members you don’t use that often.. I was very olivery heavy and I stuck with my beginning familiar throughout.. But I made sure to give the rest of my party tanks so they wouldn’t die as quickly as well as healers to make sure the team stayed healthy, and fighters to do a bit of damage And both of my party members did a great job of doing damage using magic and healing Though youre able to freely switch through all 12 characters at any time during a battle as its all happening real time with a mix of turn based timers going on.. attacking and defending has to cool down and your special attacks are tied to magic points The combat here can really get intense.. i was active in most battles, even simple encounters with regular enemies… I feel like this is mostly thanks to how much magic points moves take.. I hardly ever did any special moves because of how costly they were,, I would save my magic to heal my part to make sure I wasn’t sent back to the start of an area at a save point, which will refull your health and magic.. I do feel that these moves are just a little too expensive though.. It feels like a waste to have them there and again.. never really get to use them Though this isn’t the case during boss battles.. Easily the highlight moments of this game.. where all of your grinding and leveling and party building with different weapons and armours pay off… Youll be timing attacks and defenses to get the poss to drop health and magic so you can pull off awesome moves and towards the end of the game youll even get to call in the bosses you’ve defeated as champions to pull off element based moves for massive damage… And occasionally bosses will drop a gold orb for you to do a super move and fill up your health.. Every boss battle felt just the right amount of challenging, excluding a certain moment in the game where you get to choose the order you take down these 3 different bosses.. for obvious reasons after you defeat one of the 3, the other 2 are a breaze.. but the rest of this games bosses are insane and are such a great pay off for crawling through the maze like dungeons.. Ni NO Kuni is a really special game.. its addictive with a heart warming story.. the grinding never feels like a grind.. the 30 hours fly by and its just the right amount of challenging the whole way through It would be great to see it come to ps4, but its worth dusting off the ps3 for I give Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch an 8.5/10. Excellent story, music, art. Only setback the unending battles with a tiresome real-time battle system. Abandoned it at 60%, not bearing more and more required battles... Worth trying it anyway.. To begin with the game had an appealing cartoony feel to it with warm characters and a good story. It however gets quite slow and uninteresting after awhile - not to mention the combat mechanics which gave me a headache.. After more than a hundred hours to get my platinum trophy, I must say this is a «Masterpiece». It is like playing in a Studio Ghibli movie with a fun fighting system. It is like Pokemon and Tales of had a baby. The story is well written and all the characters are fun to discover. The soundtracks are feeling just like a Studio Ghibli movie. Seriously, this game has nothing missing for a Single player JRPG. A must for JRPG and Studio Ghibli fans.. This is another on the list of masterpiece RPGs you must play in your lifetime. The plot from beginning to end will keep your pressing through each save unto the early hours of the morning. Not many RPGs in recent years have struck me the way Ni No Kuni has. My first qualification for such a positive rating is the holy trinity: challenging, rewarding, and emotionally impacting. In RPGs which tell a linear story it MUST be compelling. Trust me when I say, this game will pull at you emotionally. The combat system is unique and impressively intense at times. The final showdown in the game will have you enjoying every aspect of the combat you experience throughout. A perfect climax in terms of the system they used. All other bells and whistles of the game were otherwise perfect. If it didn't have so digital downloads, copies of this game would be worth 80-100 dollars in appreciation, years from now. Go play this game!. This game is as close to perfect as any game I have played. Full of charm and humour, with graphics which put most current gen titles to shame and with surprisingly deep gameplay too. An absolute masterpiece.. This is in my TOP 5 best JRPG ever made! Best RPG on PS3.. It brought back my love for RPGs, since everything has been god awful - Skyrim, and all these other games that people are playing. This is how I broke down my rating: Story - 10 Graphics 10 Gameplay 10 Sound - 10 Overall - 10 *Absolute masterpiece! Ni No Kuni 2 is coming out next year and looking forward to it! This is absolutely amazing and is a must play for PS3 owners!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ni no Kuni is an amazing game. I am not into JRPG at all, in fact the only JRPG I played is dark souls which is not a traditional slow-paced, turn-based and lengthy JRPG. At the beginning I find the game is kinda of boring, i.e, every encounter is just to spam attack button.. but maybe 10 hours into the game, I realized that the fighting system is rather complicated and elegant. You have minions with one of star, moon, and sun elements, they have pros and cons against each other, e.g, sun element deals more damage to moon, but less damage to star, etc. I maxed level dozens of minions, they are all fun to use and feels different. The story is quite enjoyable and cheering. Everyone has a heart even the bad guys. In the end, I just love every parts of the game. I cannot wait for ni no kuni 2.. My Review of Ni No Kuni Remake PS3 Gameplay: 2/10 Fun: 0/10 Difficulty: BS XP: Takes Forever Forever Forced Level: 100 Beat Games on Easy Difficulty Setting Difficulty Setting: Are not Truthful Easy is Hard, Normal is Very Hard Review: 2/10 Grade: F Worst JRPG Ever of all Time. A truly fantastic journey and narrative with a new take on JRPG elements. Ni No Kuni takes the key fun and impactful elements of games like Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Dragon Quest etc and pours them into a game that is simply stunning. Buy this if you can and experience what more JRPGs should be like in this day and age. I'll be picking this up the moment it comes to PS4 if it ever does. A superb game that;s reminded me why I loved games in the first place. Genuinely wonderful JRPG that I borrowed a PS3 to play - and I was not disappointed :). I bought this game and only because I had to see what all the hype was about. It litterally blew my mind. There could be 10 in the series and it would still be a gem. Best part? Litterally everything! Just make sure to check that you still have a life once in a while because you might get deep into it.. Best RPG i played on PS3. Really good story and studio Ghibli is great as usual. Great music, soundtrack and voice acting. I was afraid it would be too childish for me but I really enjoyed it. I hope they make a sequel.. I hated the random encounters and clunky combat system so much that I found this game unplayable. I'm not willing to spend 40+ hours of my life needlessly grinding just to advance the plot and see the next location. Even as a Ghibli fan I couldn't get on with this game. Maybe JRPGs just aren't for me.... Amazing game, easily in my top 10 games of last gen. It's basically a hybrid Pokemon game, and a pretty good one at that. The grinding/looting/ capturing was crazy addicting and also crazy rewarding. When you go the extra mile in this game you know you'll be rewarded, (which some games don't). The overall gameplay was fun, challenging, and refreshing. The hybrid real time battle system is perfect in this game imo, it is strategic and feels awesome when you finally beat a boss or a bounty hunt. The story was good and i enjoyed the characters and story missions, but must say i wasn't wowed by the ending. The open world element of this game was a cherry on top, looting for ingredients , grinding and trying to find strong familiars, etc. all added to the adventure and amazing variety of this game. The only negatives were the annoying reappearing monsters during story missions and the lack of feel of whether or not a familiar is any good when you start, the revelation in the story was kind of meh to me, but thats imo. To end, this is basically Pokemon for ps3, whaddya waiting for!. Nowhere near as great as it's made out to be- and far from perfect. It's a good game but has severe flaws and the story can be quite dull at times and nonsensical at others. It personally took me a loooong time to get into the story; the intro was rather bland and aside from the legendary Mr. Drippy, the characters in the beginning aren't especially exciting. Oliver is your typical do-gooder-no-personality-whatsoever hero, and remains uninspiring throughout the game. Graphics-wise, the game is gorgeous, and I often found myself taking time out to simply look around. The cut scenes by Studio Ghibli are the typical fare you'd expect from them. The soundtrack is brilliant, not much else to say on that point! Apart from the story, the biggest flaw is the AI of your comrades. This makes later battles incredibly annoying at times- for example, I've set them to heal before and they do anything but that- and the game could've benefited greatly from a FF12 style gambit system or something similar, giving greater control over the party members. The familiars are a fun aspect of the game and will appeal to most Pokemon fans. The Wizard's Companion is actually one of my favourite aspects of the game, but for anyone who hates large amounts of reading it may seem choresome trawling through it for certain side quests- thankfully there is always Google! I think they also missed a trick by not utilising all of the spells you acquire over the game; some spells you don't have the opportunity to use at all. Many spells are just fillers and I found that disappointing. Overall this a game worth playing, but it's far from the best JRPG ever.. I'll keep this review short and straight to the point. The combat and is awesome but the team AI are brain dead, so it will be a pain in the ass later on the game. The story is the weakest feature in the game, i hated Oliver (the main protagonist) he was a whining **** ( he's basically like Shinji from Evangelion with more whining) there is nothing interesting about him and the main plot is decent but it's hard to care about the main characters because they are so predictable. The familiars are awesome and unique but it's always a pain in the ass when you want to add a new one to the team because it requires a lot and i mean A LOT of grinding that i ended up editing my save file to the max level so i can actually progress in the plot. The lore is interesting and the world is so gorgeous there are a lot of fun side quests that are actually rewarding, completing side quest will add a new mechanic every time like jumping for example. The soundtrack is simply flawless. Overall this is one of the best JRPGs to date but it has a lot of issues that held it back from being in my top 10. This game is on sale most of the time in the PSN, for the price of $9 it's a steal.. Im biased because this game represents something i always wanted in my life, an RPG that strongly resembled a cartoon! The artstyle this game deliver has to be yet surpassed is simply a joy to watch everything and wander around, through the whole game the visual quality never lets down. Also is not completely linear and encourages exploration, lots of monsters to aid you in your quest, nice orchestral soundtrack and a nice story makes this a must have and probably future classic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved this game so much! It still reminiscing very lively in my heart and I will never forget how its story, gameplay, and characters touched me heart. This RPG deserves to be experienced by every fan and it will have enough memorable content in it to last a lifetime.. Absolutely gorgeous game from one of the best animation studios int he world. Story is long and great in true JRPG fashion. You won't ever forget this game. RPG at its finest!. The typical Miyazaki experience: Beautiful artwork, accompanied with the most annoying and bland characters, which pair with the story perfectly. I persisted through this game simply to watch more of the beautiful cut-scenes, but eventually I was simply unable to progress. You see, the combat system in this game is a lot like Pokemon. You summon a team of monsters, and choose from a list of different elemental and physical moves. But that's where the compliments end. Unlike Pokemon, you can only control one out of the three team members. Which means that the others will either waste their mp on magic attacks immediately, or charge in blindly to their death if you tell them not to use magic. This makes the combat COMPLETELY broken, since you're out of mp in 2-3 fights in the wild, or halfway through a boss fight. I actually quit on a boss fight that is simply unbeatable, and came to Metacritic to find that someone probably quit on the same boss. Here's an excerpt they wrote that sums it up perfectly: ""The final straw came was whilst fighting a certain boss. And the things which really drive me crazy is when a Boss does a special move you HAVE to defend or evade otherwise you take massive damage, its just how the game is, the tutorial teaches you all about defending and it is vital to all boss battles. So image my joy when I defend the bosses special attacks to find that the other 2 computer controlled players NEVER defend or evade."" Being a mainly RPG player, I never thought that I'd see the day when I quit an rpg. But Ni No Kuni made sure that there's a first time for everything.. Ni No Kuni is one of my all time favorite games. It has great battle system. Great story, and you always have something to do from side quests casino or the story. The graphics are great. This is a game you can easily get into.. one of the BEST games I have ever played! if you are a pokemon lover you will love it! if you are a fantasy lover you will love it! it will drive you through amazing places you will enjoy it for sure! grab it though is over 70 hourse gameplay!. good story line i guess. battle mechanics took me out of the game. i just couldn't get into the combat system. good combat is essential for any rpg, and i didn't have any desire to level up since the combat system was uninteresting. do your research before buying a game. i could see how this game might appeal to people just starting to get into rpgs.. It's not the best game that I've ever played, but it's possibly the most beautiful and engaging. The battles get pretty tedious after a while, but it was a nice touch that ""low level"" enemies tried to avoid encountering you. You're basically playing a Ghibli film, so as you'd expect, the story is great and the visuals are stunning.. I have finished the game and I somehow do not get the hype of this game, I think this game is really mediocre. The story is boring for me, cliche. The battle system is boring, you just keep leveling up and then keep smashing the attack button. Uninteresting characters, except for Mr. Drippy, that is the only one I liked in the game. The game has its upside though, beautiful and peaceful world, great soundtrack, alot of exploration and that is a must for","Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is one of my favorite games of all time . aside from some backtracking and padding issues, it still proved plenty of fun moments and captivated my imagination, if only for a little more than usual . the tutorial is long, but the time spent is worth it . it isn't a good game to introduce to a new player ."
"1,082.Buckshot Roulette","A brilliant turn-based game, that seems complex on first glance but is actually pretty straight-forward. You are presented with a shotgun which contains a mix of shells and blanks. It is up to you to decide if you want to shoot yourself or the other player. By shooting the other player, if the chamber has a shell loaded, the player takes damage and it becomes there turn, if the chamber contains a blank, they take no damage and it becomes there turn. However, if you shoot yourself with a blank it continues to be your turn, with the obvious implication that the longer you control possession of the shotgun the less the other player has a chance of shooting you. There are many different items presented to you randomly on each round which can affect gameplay. From items to restore health, to skip other players' turns, double the damage of the next shell, to reveal whether the chamber contains a real shell or a blank, as well as other interesting items. The game was initally released as a single player and gained ground for how fun it was, but now with multiplayer the game is even more addictive.. Crazy enough , I like it . The rule is unfair , player got advantage . but the game is too short , second round 20minute clear ,I was expecting easter egg. it is good i have never played i watched youtubers play it but i know i will like it. A fun time and unique concept, it is eerie to just shoot yourself in the head over and over.. An indie horror psychological thriller that has done its job very well. Its simplicity yet complex mind game surprises us as players. The game does a very great job at making this gambling game because of its menacing atmosphere and suspense throughout the rounds. Shout out to my man Mike Klubnika. best game of the year i have been addicted to this game and i love the style of the game. it is a very good game, it's very funny but I feel that is very short and don't have so much content but if they fixed that with some goods updates it canbe a 9 or a 10. Very good game for the price, the addition of the game mode Double or Nothing makes the game have more replayabilty.. a fascinating 20 minutes long game. I think all games should be criticised on the game's promises. In that case, game offers players to a short russian roulette experience with some basic but not complicateted game design elements. Art design is cool and interesting. Sounds and music are basic and fine. Overrall it is a good experience.","a brilliant turn-based game that seems complex on first glance but is actually pretty straight-forward . you are presented with a shotgun which contains a mix of shells and blanks . by shooting the other player, if the chamber has a shell loaded, the player takes damage and becomes there turn ."
"1,083.Kingdom Two Crowns","Very good for one playthrough. The graphics are great and no HUD clutter. The game is quite complex for the simple controls, works very well on Android/IOS.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Beautiful but boring game. It would be possible to fall in love with it, but it didn't suit me I think. This game needs to be more recognized, my wife and I have been playing it for a few hours. Beautiful pixel art, fantastic soundtrack and simple, very fun gameplay. Thank you developers for creating this game.. Starting this game was very confusing. You get no explanation on how the game mechanics work or how to progress. I started to have fun with this game when I managed to progress on level 1. Built my base and made a lot of money. Felt great. Then I got to island 2 and 3 and realized that you do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Slow, tedious and repetitive. This game however has something to it. The concept is very interesting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game will be perfect if contain something more... It’s perfect for two players, but why challenge islands are unplayable with that mode? Whyyy??? No multiplayer challenge islands is one of two flaws of this game. Second is performance on switch on later parts of this game.. This is one of my favorite games on the Switch, though I concede that it's not going to be everybody's kind of game. Strategy games don't get much simpler than this, yet I've found myself pouring dozens of hours into both the classic and Shogun campaigns. Perhaps it's because of this simplicity that the game has such long legs. There is a certain satisfaction to beating back the hordes of greed each night while methodically pushing your kingdom's borders a bit further each day. If I had any complaints, it's that the Skull Island and other individual campaigns are painfully difficult, while I find the main game more zen and relaxing. However, they at least give you something else to do. I also really prefer riding the gryphon over every other mount, so I guess I wish there was more of an incentive to use other mounts, but that's no big deal. I found the controls and gameplay to be easy to learn and never clunky or frustrating. Everything generally makes sense, though searching for some basic tips might improve your overall enjoyment of the game. It's something I enjoy returning to play now and then.. It's not an awful game, but honestly it just isn't very fun. The pace is infuriatingly slow (it takes forever just for you to move around) and you spend the majority of your time just waiting for money to come in so you can actually do something. Or you wait forever for things to build. It's like Clash of Clans or something. Many elements of the game are extremely frustrating. For example, once you build a guard tower or a ship, your archers are stuck inside that for the rest of the game, so too bad if you need them to defend your borders from enemy attacks later. The game also does next to nothing to explain to you what everything does. Some things are self-explanatory or can be inferred, but not everything. I spent a gem to unlock this hermit girl who was immediately attacked and kidnapped. Would've been good if the game could let me know spending that gem would release a kidnappable human BEFORE I wasted it. Learning the hard way is great IRL but this is a GAME, isn't it supposed to be fun? The pace gets even slower as you get close to conquering an island as people seem to stop spawning entirely, making it impossible to continue doing anything, especially if you have died and respawned with few workers already, basically breaking your game. (Unless I've missed something, once you expand past the spawn points for recruits, you can't get any more so if you have no builders at that point you can never build again.) It's a catch 22 because you need to expand out to win, but expanding out eliminates the resources you need to be able to win. Incredibly frustrating that this game feels so broken in its mechanics and there are so many ways you can get yourself in a situation where it's impossible to progress, or you spend 90% of your time waiting around for something to happen. Graphics are also quite lacking in my opinion. I grow very weary of this modern fad for everything to look like a SNES game. It's 2018 for goodness sake, can't developers make games that actually look nice? Finally, it's still early days for this game, but there are few bugs and glitches so even if you're interested might be worth waiting until the patch comes out in early 2019. I got **** into buying this by all the extremely positive reviews here on Metacritic so I guess this review is a counterpoint to that. I'm sure it's great for some people but if you don't like slow-paced, frustrating strategy games that feel like mobile base-building games but with worse graphics, don't buy this. I feel like it has the potential to be something awesome (the fundamental concepts of resource management, defense and expansion, and simplicity of it are great) but somehow it just does't actually work together into a satisfying experience due to how easy it is for your progress to be blocked.. Kingdom Two Crowns in a nutshell: minimalistic 2-player kingdom development/exploration/survival game with beautiful music and graphics that will keep you hooked playing for many many hours. In this game you can become a monarch and build a kingdom up from its ruins. The controls are very simple: you can trot/gallop with your horse left and right, and you can drop coins/gems to interact with the world. For example, turning a beggar into a peasant requires you to give him a gold coin. Cutting a tree requires allocating a gold coin on it, and so on. You can upgrade your camp and buy weapons/tools for your peasants to have jobs. You cannot control your followers, they will do as they think best to accomplish the tasks you request (via investing gold coins on stuff), and sometimes they'll be dumb and not do exactly what you want, but I guess that's just a bit of realism right there. There is no undo button (or any buttons for that matter), so you must be strategic and think carefully before you build stuff around. Yes, the game is very similar to the previous version(s), Kingdom New Lands. But when something is working amazingly, why fix it? Same graphics, mostly same sounds, new music and objects in the world, more upgrades, a new variant (Shogun kingdom - mostly skin, but also some character roles) and a new playstyle, but above all, the most wonderful addition to the game is the capability for 2 players to rule the kingdom with a split screen! Now my wife and I don't have to take turns, we just play together and that is as awesome as anything can get. I am impressed by how smoothly the game runs on split screen. There are slight frame rate drops when you build really large armies, just as there were in the previous version of the game, but this hasn't hindered play for us at all. There are also a couple of bugs as I could expect from any recent release. The most notable one is the ""hermit bug"", where some key characters will wander off the camp when they shouldn't, or simply disappear right in front of your eyes. That can be frustrating, but we've only experienced it once, then read that others experienced it too. I'm assuming devs are aware of this and will fix this in a future update. I'm not saying anything else as to not spoil the fun of the game. If you haven't played this game and it piques your curiosity, I'd advice you to give it a shot and not look for much information online; figuring out what things do on your own will is so much more fun than reading about it on a wiki. That's how we've been exploring the new objects in the game and we've been having a blast. I'm sure most of you would, too.. Kingdom Two Crowns is the best game I’ve ever played in over 30 years. A genuine masterpiece of design, animation, and sound. Beating the Greed for the first time was the most memorable video game moment I’ve experienced. I love the music in this game. It’s easy to enter a zen-like meditative state while playing. So beautiful and engaging. I love the simple controls yet deep gameplay. The screen is completely uncluttered. I wish there were more games like this.. As a big fan of the first game, I recommend this version. Visually, the game looks similar than its predecessor, but there is more content added than what came with 'Kingdom New Lands' after the original 'Kingdom' game.","this is one of my favorite games on the Switch, though i concede that it's not going to be everybody's kind of game . if you had any complaints, it's that the Skull Island and other individual campaigns are painfully difficult ."
"1,084.Deep Rock Galactic","Don’t get all the good criticism about this game, as I don’tsee the point in playing it any longer. Might as well look at the white wall in front of me.. The best way to be a dwarf is to be a miner for Deep Rock Galactic! A great FPS mining game will have you shouting Rock and Stone!. Do you have crippling depression? Are you less than 5ft tall? Can you scream rock and stone at the top of your lungs? Good news In Deep Rock Galactic leave it all behind to be the BEST dwarf boi you can be. Shoot bugs, tame bugs, be killed by bugs and above all else mine that MF ROCK AND STONE.. Very fun and cool game with most fluffy community ever. But a bit hard to play after 500 hours. GhostShip deserves all of the success and fame for their triumphant accomplishment in this title.ROCK AND STONE, BROTHERS!. I like this game. The best game I ever hear. This game its like helldivers but better. ROCK AND STONE!. Awesome game. One of the best coops I've played. The different roles really add up, it's best to combine them to properly play the game and face the challenges presented. It's also highly replayable and has a remarkable procedural level generator. Levels feel unique each time and I love how you traverse the environment with the pickaxe and operator tools. I liked the mission variety.I loved the tone and fantasy of the game. You really feel like a dumb miner constantly spamming ""Rock & Stone!"" and other catchy phrases. Highly recommended if you are looking for a top-notch coop game.. Really good game where only thing you really should do is spam v and drink bear. Good God this game is good, overclocks are awesome and change the game so much, and anyone who says the game grows stale probably forgot that you can be more than one class.. This game is incredibly fun to play even with randoms. The community is extremely friendly and the amount of content and variety is amazing. There is also no predatory monetization schemes.. Very interesting game! There's a lot of content, and I cannot stop playing, only one bad thing is updates. They're too uncommon.. FOR ROCK AND STONE!!. Rock and roll with all your friends in the shoes of four unique classes this game offers. It's hard to find a co-op experience with this sense of progression and engaging, fun missions anywhere else. The only downside to this game is the Overcloak weapon upgrades, which essentially serve as end-game content. The reason why this is a drawback is that it is too tiring for a fun game that is all about having fun and playing games in your free time.. It might a bit slow at first but chaos increases rapidly which is a good thing for these kind of games. Rock and Stone if you know what I mean. All i can say is don't give up on it instantly, it takes some time to understand the game if you are new. ROCK AND STONE. rock and stone, perfect, all my friends love it, this game is very easy to learn and get into, 10/10 easy recommendation, if you dont believe me look at every video on youtube made on this game. Devs are geniuses.. Deep rock galactic it's a very cooland cooperative game ! intresting,dificult ecc... The choice to not allow Windows Store users to play with Steam users is so incompetent it ruins the entire experience of a co-op game which incessantly brags about the community attached to the game. I have played for hours and found the game almost entirely dead and not one mic in use on the Windows store making my time with the game incredibly unfun. If this is the experience people get when trying the game out, why would they go buy it on Steam? Terrible incompetent choice by a bad development team.. Good gameplay loop with great replay-ability. Certainly fun with swows swows. An interesting extraction game which is definitely meant to be played with friends. Even just playing 2 player co-op was a good time. Upgrading your character feels alright, definitely better and a lot more fun then some other games of the same ilk. You can really sink your teeth into a game like this and make is your go to game night after night, but personally I did not feel that pull.. It's amazing how such a simple and inexpensive game can give you such a big mountain of content and fun, extremely pleasant direct dialogue, as well as probably the friendliest community in the Internet world. I have always admired the principle of unity and it is the main one in this game. Rock and stone, miners. (Привет от всего русского комьюнити). The best multiplayer coop I know. Rock and stone rock and stone rock and stone rock and stone. The best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stoneThe best game ever rock and stone. this is EASILY my second favourite game of all time. so much replayability, its insane. im 200 hours in, and im not stopping anytime soon. this is a must play for anyone who even remotely likes shooters. the procedurally generated caves are done so well, i didnt even know they were generated until about 10 hours in. every mission type (except for industrial sabotage) is a blast to play. of course, this game is best played with friends, so make sure to bully them into getting it. there are 4 different classes with 3 primaries and 3 secondaries to choose from, with many different upgrades and overclocks (special perks unique to each weapon) and each class has different grenades, equipment, and movement tools. I like the scout because he has a grappling hook and can fly all over the place. if you find yourself not liking the game, that may be because you're not playing the right class for you. to summarize, buy this f*cking game bozo. ROCK AND STONE. This game is an absolute beauty **** from Glyphids to Bosco to the Dwarfs.. This is one of the most enjoying coop games you could play, and if you up the danger level, challenging if you want it.. its fun but gets tiring after a while if you dont play with friends. I HATE IT. rock and stones!. This is the best game on the internet. Play with your friends for **** and giggles. Play by yourself, with companions to replace the friends that you never made. Contingent spikes are fun to do, and DEFINITELY buy those glyphid slammers. If you want to have a fun time, you can Rock and Stone with the bois. Buy this game or else you wont get any presents for christmas. get your parents to buy this for you. For the money, this is a no brainer. There are no paywalls or dlc, just fun co-op content. Can get repetitive, but there are a few classes and different mission types to switch it up.. A really nice indie game to play with your buds. Really enjoyed this game for a while, definitly a great experience discovering all the features and mission (and yeah doing **** in your spaceship, drinking and dancing with the dwarf all night long, yeah good stuff). It gets a bit repetitiv after a while but the theme is dope, worth your time if you're in squad.. The game is really kinda slow at the start. Trust me it gets fantastically chaotic! The best coop shooter since Left 4 Dead!. Fun, addicting, panic educing, satisfying, intense, laid back, best Co-op game I have ever played.. I have never met a fellow dwarf that decided to return the favor of rock and stone. ROCK AND STONE. boring. ROCK AND STONE. Really cool game, devs listen to community, community itself is really friendly too. Very good gameplay of mining gold for 3 hours. It's a good game, it just gets old fast for me. It's more for relaxed, laid back gaming with your IRL friends or friends you've known for a long time and just want to talk while not doing too much work. There are different kind of missions and decent variety in classes and weapons, but the bosses aren't that memorable and the main mechanics are usually just mining stuff, escorting a payload and extracting. The maps are randomly generated and the voxel system works very well, you can mine in any direction seemingly infinitely and you will frequently find people just cutting through walls, floors and ceilings.. Its addictive and really fun, devs are keep giving us banger of a updates. I feel like this game is going to go far.. One of the best game I ever played guns are fun mining is fun cooperation is also fun pretty much everything is juicy and on top of that we get free DLC like every year. Deep Rock Galactic saw Left for dead 2, and wanted to make a perfect game better, and they did. Designed around re-playability and allowing new players to assimilate seamlessly, it excels at being fun for infinitely long playtimes with players new and old, with constant updates and no micro-transactions.. The game is fun but it can become a bit repetitive after some time. The procedurally generated caves help a bit with that. I quite liked the class systems, and the amount of customization available you make your own build with various weapons and mods. The amount of cosmectis available for free is amazing and their battle pass is free, quick and seasons are long enough. But even if you miss some you can still randomly get cosmectis from old passes. The issues for me is that once the novelty wears off it become quite repetitive and sometimes missions takes a while. And once you found your build, what you like most, it does not help. You can always plays the others classes but for my part I was quite attached to the driller's abilities so playing say enginneer or gunner wasn't fun to me.. Awesome game, continued development and updates are astounding. This game utilizes procedural generation nicely, a lot of content in this game. Hardcore coop with your friends does not get much better, lots to grind for and can either be casual or challenging depending on your playstyle. A very genuine game no other game like this on the market.. Boring beyond belief. I cannot even begin to fathom how people could bring themselves to play this game for ""fun"".. The best co-op game I’ve played, but dear god, light sources being so limited is not fun at all. Do yourself a favor and turn up the gamma, it’ll save you some eyestrain and prevent you from getting lost as often.. While a bit repetitve, there is a lot to enjoy in this mining simulator game with swarms of aliens trying to wipe you out. The weapons are interesting, the gameplay is smooth, and the COMMUNITY is AWESOME. Playing a game like this with up to 4 players, having the community be so solid goes a long way. I think this thing got GotY in a few categories on Steam. I've been playing it for years and I still log in for the holiday cosmetics and to check out the FREE UPDATES the devs keep pumping out.. Pros: -great replayabilty thanks to biomes and hazards -there are no useless weapons or classes and playing without them feels off which is good -devs actually give a **** about their game which is rare nowadays -easy to pick up, hard to master -welcoming community -great variety of enemies and biome exclusive enemies -battle pass done right and awards you by playing the game -not p2w -most of the skins are unlockable by playing the game -beer Cons: -janky physics engine I have 100 hours in 2 weeks and this says something. Its the best game I ever played. Easiest 10 of my life.. The scout is a trap. When I booted up deep rock for the first time I gravitated toward the most female sounding character. This was scout but as it turns out they are a trap. Until the devs add a female dwarf I am refusing to play the game. Need women. A truly amazing game by an indie studio that delivers more than all AAA studios. ROCK AND STONE, brothers!. THis game is super good, the gameplay is beautiful and the mining never gets old,; ROCK AND STONE FOREVER. If you don’t Rock and Stone you ain’t coming home! Deep Rock Galactic is a game unlike any game I’ve played. It takes elements of Minecraft, Doom, and co-op shooters like Left 4 Dead, and rolls it all into one chaotic mess. I love it.. Excellent gameplay and a very rewarding gameplay loop. You have four classes, lots of weapons and side unlocks, and a HUGE variety of missions. This to me is truly the successor to four-player co-op games like Left 4 Dead. It starts off tough and gets easier to the more you play and unlock, but the game is smart enough to add new difficulty modes but also mission modifiers to help keep the game feeling fresh. I love it, but if I had to offer a few criticisms, it would be these: 1. Make emotes and colors universal to all classes once unlocked. Seriously, there's no reason not to given how rare those items are. 2. Add more guns or variations on equipment within classes. Once you've unlocked all the guns, it kinda feels like you have nothing left to do with that class. Love this game! Keep up the great work devs!. Great gameplay loop. after 40 hours I am promoted on all classes and nothing left but fun cosmetic. I dont play much anymore but still was and is a solid play to do with friends.. Game is pretty fun to play especially if you got a group of buddies that like to mine deep in the caves and get sweaty together. There aren't that many maps, objectives or enemy varieties but as far as I can tell they keep adding new events and types every season. Only issue I have is that the terrain collision is sometimes really crappy and that there is no fail safe implanted in the game once the main hosts disconnects (which can result in losing 30+ minutes of progress and that happening a few times is really annoying). They should work on the server/host issue but overall a pretty fun although repetitive game.. I got this login just to leave a review for this game. I was so surprised by how much I liked it. It started out ""rocky"" but I went from not thinking I was too into it to surpassing 100hrs in the first month of purchase which I NEVER do. I will say I far prefer to play this with friends or even randos online as having a variety of players really helps with the missions themselves and overall replayability of the game. It was meant to enjoy with others and have a great time, and my friends and I have continued to do just that almost daily since purchase. 10/10. This is a great role based multiplayer game. It's definitely more about the mission than the combat, and I like that about it. The humor of the game is great.. The game is so good it`s hard to say all pros, but here are main one: DWARFS, BEER, ROCK AND STONE!. This is a fun and non predatory multiplayer coop game with a very friendly, non-toxic community. Very rare these days.. Deep Rock Galactic is masterpiece. No maps will feel similar, as all maps are randomly generated and can never look alike. With it's interactive gameplay, satisfying progression system and laughable voicelines, Deep Rock Galactic can always provide a enjoyable experience.. The greatest game to feature badass space dwarves that get drunk and say ""Rock! And! Stone!"". not that much to do in the game the caves looks like all the same, but there are cool upgrades and you can play it too fourth :). Very cool game with good optimization and friendly stone unity, very well done interaction with the team.. I live by the mine and I’ll die by the mine. 10/10 this game changed my life. I have so much fun playing this game it’s insane really. I didn’t expect this at all. I picked it up at a free weekend on steam, thinking it’s just another fps shooter but WOW. that’s something completely new and creative in a super good way. There are perks and many new things you can do with your weapon. It has great humor also.. Deep Rock Galactic is an immensely fun game solo or with a group of friends. The progression is interesting and fulfilling while not emptying your wallet. Ghost Ship Games does a great job of creating opportunities to support them through dev packs while not feeling forced to do so. The nice thing about Deep Rock Galactic is you can join for a quick 10-20 min game and continue doing whatever you were doing after. In addition, you always feel like you're making some sort of progression. Whether that be a new cosmetic or weapon overclock, loot is plentiful. Finally, procedural map generation allows for consistent new experiences. Some of the caves that are procedurally generated are unbelievably massive! Absolutely recommend!. So much fun. Progression is great too, you'll absolutely get your money's worth.. Awesome community, great gameplay, hilarious writing, solid servers, and loyal, active dev. What more do you want? FOR KARL!!!. This is one of the best coop shooters I have ever played. While you can play solo, the game really steps into it's element when you have a squad of 4. Really friends or randos will do. Each of the 4 classes has it's unique role that is essential to a successful mission. DRG does a good job getting beginners started without ruining some of the new moments that make each of your first dives ominous. The game still has plenty to offer as a veteran. You unlock multiple weapons, perks, and upgrades to take on end game missions such as Hazard 5 levels or the weekly Elite Deep Dive. Look around for frivolous content that adds some extra comedy and spice to the game. Slapping the dice in the drop pod, beers at the Abyssal Bar, and who can forget the barrel game. No dwarf left behind. Rock and stone!. Banging OST Fun gameplay loop Attentive devs Unique and beautiful visuals Friendly and open community Levelling can be a little slow but it makes ascending higher that much more satisfying. I don't have any negative things to say. Mostly just wish there was even more to do in the hub area.. My Score: (9) - Great! -------------------------------------------------------------------------. Deep Rock Galactic will have you occasionally scream ""Rock and Stone!"" for the rest of your life.. Pretty good but after a while you dont't have any content but for it's price it's really good. And with some friends it's alot of fun sabotaging eachother or just playing the missions normally. Also there are lots of little details and funny stuff you can do in the Main ship it's really fun.. 180 hours on steam since last year. It's simply one of my favorite 4 player co-op. The community is probably among the most friendly and least toxic you'll find in any other game. R&S brothers.. That's it lads! Rock and Stone! ,. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. In recent years left 4 dead like games have become their own genre and I unabashedly claim that Deep Rock Galactic is the indisputable pinnacle of that genre. There are so many things it does that other left 4 dead likes cannot match. Completely destructible randomly generated environments Cave systems that variate between vast caverns and oppressively claustrophobic tunnels Enemies that can accost you from all sides in a myriad of ways Extensive customization of weapons and dwarves both cosmetically and mechanically through overclocks. The atmosphere is fantastic every map you are immersed in the dark and intricate cave systems I previously mentioned cloaked in an oppressive darkness that you can only combat with the meagre beam of your flashlights or a limited amount of flares that recharge over time. Different classes that change up how you play but are not necessary. So many games require one of each class to complete content in team based games but in DRG classes are just a way to play and with enough skill you can dominate any mission type or deep dive with skill even if you are all scouts or drillers. Disclaimer: This is one of many games with what some call an ""endgame"" you will not have access to the best that this game has to offer until you promote at least one class (it does not take nearly as long as the term promote/""prestige"" makes most gamers think) Once you have promoted a class you gain access to deep dives the pinnacle of challenge in the game and you gain the ability to find overclocks that drastically change how weapons work in fun and interesting ways. Two examples of overclocks I count as one and enjoy would be special compound for the scouts shotgun secondary and the rj250 compound for the engineers grenade launcher they both convert the weapons into basically rocket jumps sending you flying through the air with ease and grace, Another fantastic assortment of overclocks do things like make the minigun of the gunner do more damage but at the cost of not being able to move while firing or one that makes it belch a wave of flame as it gets closer to overheating, a driller overclock that makes the drillers plasma pistol into an aoe delete button if you can master the art of shooting its slower moving charge shot out of the air with its uncharged shot, a scout primary overclock that reduces damage on his starting assault rifle but replaces it with perfect pinpoint accuracy and a boost to weak point damage, So in conclusion if you have never tried this game and enjoy games with variety and a lot of customization pick this one up right away and make sure that you remember the game is good from the start but once you unlock overclocks, perks and deep dives is when the game becomes truly a one of a kind experience for the ages. This really is a hidden gem. The music is cool. The caves in this game, which are randomly generated, are always fun to explore. There are a lot of game modes. Progression feels satisfying. Solid gameplay loop. Only thing I have to say is that after around 100 hours the game really becomes a bit to easy. Even the ""elite deep dives"", which is the endgame, don't feel challenging. Only times they are really challenging is when you have trash teammates, but with an average group it really isn't that hard. Still, it's a very fun game and you can just grind your prestige, cosmetics and weapon mods if you want.. Holy hell this is the best game i ever played since Left 4 Dead 2. Also the community is really good too.. This is best online, non story based co-op game I have ever played. Unlimited fun and content. Greatest developers ever and so beautifully done.. I've played this game for at least one minute and its the best game ever made. As a 38 year old with ADHD, my 800+ hours of playtime on Steam says that this game is worth playing. Best community, best devs. Just play it. More than enough people explain why it's worth it.. Looks great until you look below the surface. Why are major features missing years after release with insanely high RRP? Why are bugs not fixed for months? Why is flaming and bullying allowed on forums when it suits devs/mods personally? People really hyped this up, but it's a total mess. Avoid.. Such a fun game to play with friends. One of the best I've played in the last decade probably. I don't know if it has anything to complain about!. The game is great for multiplayer coop, had a lot of fun with it, but it too often disconnects you from host and if you’re playing with randoms there’s no way to reconnect, often that happens by the end of mission which means you lose from 10 to 40 minutes without gaining any progression. Lately that happened to me a lot, so I just stopped playing(. This is one of the best multiplayer game I played. Feeling of exploration and cooperation is highly well done Hope this game will have cross platforms some day :). Best coop-game I played since release! Teamwork is key, no mission is the same, even kind of scary sometimes. Missions never get boring, you never know what awaits you past the next corner or behind that rock. Doesn't need a mindboggling and stupidly insane rig to run, doens't need much hdd-space, and still looks breathtaking. With super-short loading-times, too! Oh, and besides collecting ressources for your weapon-upgrades, you also collect ingredients for various beers that will provide various buffs on your missions. So, drink up and ROCK and STONE!. Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player co-op FPS featuring badass space Dwarves, 100% destructible environ. One of the best game I played. The mission are a little bit boring................... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Gameplay : 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Good price compare to playtime. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game combines the best from what I remember about L4D1 & 2 and star ship troopers, it is a strictly co op PVE adventure. Danish humour and beers. so much good stuff and lovely devs working on making an awesome game.. This is an absolutely fun game. I don't normally write reviews but this game is such a blast and I wanted to share this. The game is made up of tiny missions which is very suitable for gamers who want to hop in and out. The gameplay is full of challenge, fun and last minute saves. I've been a gamer for 30 years now and I can comfortably say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. Well done Ghost Ship!. Deep Rock Galactic is a coop game, where you control one of four possible dwarf miners, and go mining on an alien planet. Firstly, this game is so unique and has so much charm to it. The lobby is gigantic and has a lot of fun things to do, such as a basket-barrel mini-game, space football and a bar with fun drinks. There is a lot of customization, from your own dwarf to changing parts on your pick-axe, the possibilities are endless. There are only two malefactors I could find, there is some visual bugs (nothing too extreme, sometimes they can be funny) and some repetitiveness. When i mention repetitiveness I talk about the missions, there could be some other objectives to complete and make it more diverse, but for now, this is the most fun I`ve had with a coop game in years.. Looking for a fun Co-op shooter? Look no further. This game offers what many AAA games fail to provide. A game with soul and character. Even after release the developers continue to add new content. I have never in my life played a Co-op shooter as fun and motivating as this one.. I'll start out by saying that I don't enjoy playing FPS games, but I LOVE Deep Rock Galactic! I'm having so much fun with this, especially as a duo party with my husband. You can play solo, but co-op is absolutely front and center. Even at low levels you're still useful to the team and I'm finding it very easy to get accustomed to the controls and gameplay loop. That being said, the gameplay doesn't feel stale, even after playing 60 hours in my first week. I foresee myself dumping a lot of time into this game, lol I really appreciate that there's no big meta-game, pvp, or any sort of pay-to-win junk here, just pure fun, seriously. The playerbase seems really friendly as does the dev team! For $30 this game is packed with content and just feels so lovingly made. Also want to point out that the sound design and soundtrack is FANTASTIC. I find myself listening to it regularly. The in-game emotes are really great, too, and help build the sense of camaraderie! ROCK. AND. STOOOONE!!!. Deep Rock Galactic is one of the best online co-op games out there. You choose your dwarf, each equipped with a different set of skills of weapons and dive into a procedurally generated cave filled with bugs and creators. Your mission could be to retrieve some monster eggs, mine minerals, protect the “drilldozer” or kill some elite enemies. The game features an incredible visual style which is dark but at the same colorful. I also loved the soundtrack which gave me Jean-Michel Jarre vibes. Deep Rock Galactic only occupies around 3 gigabytes of hard disk space and I think it’s an outstanding achievement for the developers. My experience with Deep Rock Galactic was with my favorite class “driller”. I was hooked until I promoted my dwarf and played through the “deep dives” and “breach the core” content. At that point the game started to feel a bit repetitive, but only after around 40 hours playtime. For anyone looking for a co-op multiplayer game, I wholeheartedly recommend Deep Rock Galactic. Whether you play with friends or join a random server, you will get your money’s worth.. Rock and stone brother! (Actual review time cause I can't just put in rock and stone) Deep Rock Galactic, the best indie game of 2020 (a little late to the 2020 part aren't I?). You play as a miner for the sketchy company called Deep Rock Galactic (seriously you have to PAY for your promotion isn't that sketchy?!) where you play multiple different missions encountering glyphids (and a lot of other hideous monsters for Hoxxes) who try to kill you. The guns are awesome, the feel like the hit hard, the reloads are satisfying and head-shotting an aliens face has never felt more punchy before. The main part of DRG is its best part: the dwarves you play as. The scout: The face of DRG (at least imo because he's always in the front of the menu screen, in the momorial hall there are 2 golden scout statues and some of the propaganda has him doing the Uncle Sam ""I want you"" pose), his grappling hook feels great to use, it sends you to any position within range at startling speed, but where are you gonna go if you can't see anything? Here comes the flare gun, the best weapon in the game because of one fact: you and your team can shoot whatever they see, be it an enemy or something else like minerals. His weapons are very basic, choosing between an assault rifle or a Garand like weapon and for secondaries he's got a sawed off shotgun and 2 submachine guns. I could go into the other classes, however no one would read of review this long so I'll let you find out what dwarves scratch that LFD + Minecraft itch. (One last thing when you get promoted for the first time that's when the real fun begins). For a game as simple as this, I wasn't expecting to get hooked but there is sometimes beauty in simplicity. The procedurally generated maps are amazingly detailed and add huge replayability. Each class has their own specialty and seeing how these pieces fit together made me eventually level up all the classes. With the outrageously expensive class upgrades and cosmetics, you can't help but grind until you become hopelessly addicted.. Gameplay: A+ Story: D (but who cares?) Graphics: B Audio: B Lengh: I played 200h+ New take on 4 player coop like L4D. But + Mining & building & exploring. Perfect coop with friends.. Best coop multiplayer system in place. Basic comunication and toxic players can be banned without problems by server host.. Amazing co-op game. Great missions, Fun combat, and interesting upgrades. This game is kind of a hidden gem, and more gamers need to know it exists!. This game is an absolute joy to play whether with friends or with randos. A must play.. DRG can be played in split-screen via NucleusCoop! A great game taking inspiration from the best co-op shooter in the business - Left 4 Dead 2. It improves on said classic mainly via breadth of gameplay mechanics - the players now have objectives to complete other than simply going through a level, and Ammo and health have to be actively worked for instead of being given out at the whim of a director AI. On paper, the game should also have more replayability thanks to different character builds and character progression, random level generation and variety of mission types. The reason it doesn't succeed is how much less satisfying it is to finish any given level than in Valve's magum opus. Here are a few reasons: - Character progression makes difficulty fluid, taking away from the feeling of beating a set challenge - Missions are singular levels, which doesn't feel as substantial as a full L4D campaign. Instead of something that makes you feel accomplished and quit the game for the day, DRG's missions feel bite-sized. - The former issue is exacerbated by how boring the meta progression is after promoting each dwarf (you just grind for minor cosmetics and occasionally resources necessary for obtaining and crafting weapon mods, most of which are uninteresting) - Randomly generated levels simply can't be as interesting as hand-crafted ones. They don't have any pacing or distinct sections - just rooms that don't lead into","the best way to be a dwarf is to be a miner for Deep Rock Galactic . shoot bugs, tame bugs, be killed by bugs and above all else mine that MF ROCK AND STONE!. Very fun and cool game with most fluffy community ever ."
"1,085.Closer the Distance","Ohh “Closer the Distance” you broke me into so many pieces but also got me invested in the story so much and let me fall in love with all the details the developers added.. and that all at once. This was a journey, a wonderful journey but a very sad one and I cried so many times while playing this gem ****. I have played the first Orwell game from Osmotic Studios and that one told me already that this studio is so good in telling stories. That one tells a story about the dangers of our online activities. Not everybody’s cup of tea… However, the story in Closer the Distance is one about losing a relative unexpectedly and what that does with a family, but also within a (small) community. Normally it takes me at least some time to get closer to a character to get so emotional. However, Osmotic Studios did such a great job in storytelling that when the main character dies very early on in the game, I instantly became emotional. In this game, you play as Angie, the person who has died. You are kinda the ghost of Angie that tries so hard to help her loved ones move on. Tries to fix what is broken within the small community of Yesterby, what she already tried to do so much when she was alive, but she can’t let go after she died. This is done in a sims-like gameplay. You start with only having some control over her younger sister because she is the only one who can hear Angie’s voice. You can already see some of the wishes of the other people in the small community of Yesterby and you will unravel more of their wishes and mood swings in the days/weeks/months after Angie passed away. A little into the game you’ll also get a bit of control over some of the other characters. This way you try to complete their wishes for what to do next and what is going on. I love how they choose to go with a Sims-like game style. Lately so many announced sims-likes got canceled while I desperately looking for something that plays just like The Sims, but on Steam with Steam achievements (and not 50 DLCs). This was such an awesome game, and a great way how they told such a heavy and emotional story. With so many different characters and their own life goals, dreams, and quirks. And did I already mention how much love and attention there went into all the little details?? This goes from portraits of the families hanging in their houses to the sounds of characters sounding more echoey in some locations where that makes more sense, to the beautiful music this game adds. Especially by a character who will join a little later.","the game is about losing a relative unexpectedly and what that does with a family, but also within a (small) community . you play as Angie, the ghost of Angie that tries so hard to help her loved ones move on . you will unravel more of the wishes of the other people in the small community of Yesterby ."
"1,086.Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The gameplay is very precise: difficult but fair. Smart puzzles. Incredible graphics for the time.. Oddworld Abes Oddesee is classic platformer game that immerses you in rich and dark world full of danger, hummer, and adventure. You play as Abe, a humble mudokon slave who discovers that his boss plans to turn him and his fellow workers into meat products. You must escape the factory and rescue as many mudokons as you can, while avoiding the ruthless guards, traps, and enemies in your way. The game features stunning graphics, animations and sound effects that create a unique and atmospheric experience. The game also has a clever and intrusive gameplay system that allows you to communicate with other characters, possess enemies, and solve puzzles using your wits and skills. The game is challenging and rewarding as you explore different environments, discover secrets, and unlock multiple endings depending on your actions. It was overall, it's an underrated gem on the PlayStation so I would recommend it.. Im not a fan of platformers but decided to gave this a try, after all the hassle and annoying levels that we have to finish we get a bad stupid ending because we didn't save enough slaves. solid 5/10.. One of my favorite games when i was a kid. It was hard but fair, and i had so much fun beating it!. Artistic masterpiece, each background is a picture you can hang at home, simple but fun gameplay, fantastic settings and music, sense of depth and ever-present magic, funny and charismatic protagonist. Monsters are few but the scrabania temple and paramonia are still one of the things that marks the game the most and what makes it fantastic. Rating 8.8. It's a nice old platformer. Pros.: - Nice characters. - Environment. - For that time it was a cool platformer. Cons.: - Outdated. Especially controls.. Quirky and challenging platform-based puzzler marked by its amusingly wicked sense of humour. The trial and error format and insistence on pixel and micro-second perfect jumps makes it occasionally infuriating, but it's an amusingly oddball and rather unique puzzler.. Abe's Oddysee epitomises the phrase ""every frame a painting"" and deserves a spot among the most gorgeous cinematic platforming games ever made, challenged only by its direct sequel, Abe's Exoddus. Tight controls fitted alongside unique possession and gamespeak mechanics make for an incredibly captivating gameplay experience that will have you scrupulously searching every area for the 99 Mudokons you have been tasked to save. Pairing this with a world positively dripping with grim but fantastical lore crafted as a metaphor for real-world worker exploitation cements this introduction to the appropriately-named Oddworld series as an instant classic that not only stands up today, but begs a revisit!. I want to love this game but i just don´t understand the love for this game.. This game is a pioneer and a classic. But it has severe problems that every other Oddworld game, including Munch's Oddysee, solves. The main one is the poor difficulty balance. The checkpoints are too sparse given the difficult platforming, which leads to very high iteration times. The backgrounds aren't as interesting as everything but the Xbox games; they feel too similar too each other, especially in RuptureFarms. Eventually you just get sick of ventilation pipes and barrels. The gameplay isn't as refined as the others. All I'm really saying here is that this FEELS like the first game in the series. Play New 'n' Tasty, it's better in every way except for some of the lighting.. Great game! And very unique. Oddworld is an adventure game and a puzzle game wrapped into one. Oddworld is fun, funny, and takes you to another world. This bizarre and captivating adventure plays differently than most other games. Oddworld character movement takes some practice to learn, but once you get the hang of it you'll have plenty of more game to play.. A very atmospheric and great Puzzle Plattformer with the most original ideas ever.. No spoilers, because this game is super underrated, I'll just make this quick. Abe's Oddysee is the most underrated ""made for PS"" game I have played so far. It's very challenging, but also extremely smart with its wise use of puzzles and obstacle courses, but it never drags! Abe's Oddysee is one of the greatest video games I have ever played. The puzzles can get extremely difficult at times, I did rage every now and then. The PS1 is an extremely nostalgic gaming console for me, and Abe's Oddysee is one of my favourite games for that console and that's exactly why it gets a 10/10.. One of my first game at Playstation and still one of the most favorite. Great game for all times.. This. Game. Is. So. Good. Dripping with atmosphere, artistically gorgeous, humorous and horrifying at the same time. I've seen some reviewers saying this game is too hard... look, it takes patience, and it can be frustrating, but I beat this game when I was 10. It took ages, but I did it. It definitely requires more patience than other games, and if that doesn't suit you, then fine. But I'm more than happy to sit back and let this game transport me to a different, and very ""odd"" world.. This game is a true Playstation one classic. Very fun game with a lot of trail and error. It recently received a modern reboot on the PS4 and is highly recommended.. If you are a fan of platformers, this is a must-have for your collection. its mix of dark humour and hilariously unsuited hero of the day makes for an enticing story with a meaningful adventure. With gorgeous and detailed level design.. Great game; althought i played New N tasty, but i first discovered that game by internet videos; i watched the whole 'playthrought' of Abe's Oddysee on PS1.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's one of the games I would name when asked about Sony Playstation. It was one of the first games my parents bought me with the console in 90-s in Vienna. A 100% classic for original PS. Can't forget the voice of Abe during the game. And the first cutscene - intro with words: ""This is Rapture Farm"" is the best intro I saw in video games!. What can I say? In my opinion, the greatest game ever created. The artwork is amazing, the puzzles are fantastic and the gameplay is top notch. What is most amazing about this game is how fantastically it's aged, it is in my eyes the most amazing well aged game ever made. While amazing games such as Final Fantasy VII look laughable by today's standards with blocky CGI and even blockier in-game graphics and clunky controls, everything that was impressive in Abe's oddysee in 1997 is still impressive today; the artwork is amazing, the controls and gameplay are fantastic, and the cutscenes look amazing even today, let alone by 1997 standards. One could say the game is a little too difficult for casual gamers, but challenging games are always best. A timeless classic.. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee isn't your average platformer diverging from the typical traits that cause ""gamer's thumb"" and is addictively frustrating. Challenging and well-thought out puzzles that are blended perfectly with a bit of action, a slightly darker sense of humour than you would normally find in a brightly coloured platformer giving you a good 20 hours or more worth of fun gameplay without being fast-paced or action-packed. A game in the genre which will appease those tired of platform games, but also caters for those who never really had the taste and wants fresh meat ****. Let's just hope it's not Mudokons!. I apologize, but I just don't understand how this game is dubbed a ""classic"". I was turned onto this game by a friend of mine, who referred to it as ""Nintendo Hard"". Great! I thought, because I tend to really enjoy games to challenge me. However, after playing this game for around 30 minutes, I wanted to shove my fist through my screen. Before I get to that, I just want to praise this game's presentation. It is GORGEOUS. The game is just oozing gorgeous little details, the sense of humor is dark and spot-on, and Abe, as a character, is just such a sweetie that you just want to give him a big hug. However, for me, the major breakdown is in the gameplay. First off, as mentioned before, this game is HARD, and I do not say that lightly. This game is unreasonably difficult with absolutely nothing to make it less frustrating. Abe can only take a single hit from any source before dying, checkpoints are extremely far apart at times, and there is nothing worse than dying, being impatient, then sprinting back onto the screen that killed you, only to trip and fall onto a landmine or into the path of a hungry Slog. This particular aspect is made 10 times worse by the lack of an autosave. Another aspect of this game is its abuse of secrets. Now, I love secrets, but these ones are more or less mandatory for getting the game's ""Good"" ending, and are even more difficult than the rest of the game. Once again, this problem is compounded by the irritatingly unclear checkpoint system. Also, these secret areas are not just off the beaten path and hidden just offscreen. They are hidden in places that literally nobody in their right mind would ever attempt to look, and some require extremely complex commands to access, such as killing an enemy with an object in a strange way to destroy an anti-chant device to possess another enemy to crouch behind a barrel,which opens the door somewhere else. At times, they are literally that complicated, and due to the uncontrollably awkward checkpoints, if you accidentally kill the enemy to possess, you will never get another chance, because the game has autosaved. Anyway, back to the massive difficulty. Abe's control doesn't feel tight; in fact, it feels like Abe is just a bit hungover as he walks. Bump into a wall while sprinting? Likely just caused instant death by whatever monster is chasing you. Forget to manually uncrouch before moving? Abe will roll extremely quickly, likely into the enemy you were attempting to avoid. Deaths like this account for much of my frustration with the game, because I never felt like they were my fault. I felt like Abe was ignoring what I said, or that I couldn't see the edge of a platform clearly, while I was running from instant death enemies, and had exactly 0.4 seconds of reaction time for Abe to jump. I know it sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and I really am, but this game is one of the most unreasonably frustrating games I have ever played. I adore Abe's Exodus and Munch's Oddysee, but this game is just too difficult to recommend for anything other than someone who doesn't mind grinding their teeth to splinters or just playing trial-and-error until the game is finished. Trust me, if you can help yourself, just look up the cutscenes online and go straight to Abe's Exodus, and you might save yourself a few gray hairs.. This game was pretty much the reason I bought a PS1 in the first place. Graphic were fantastic, and it is still one of my all time favorite platformers. Overall: A brilliant platformer that holds well, even 15 years after it's initial release.. It was fantastic in '97 and it's fantastic now.I've lost count the number of times I've finished it over the last 15 years.Still one of the best games ever made.. A game for the playstation that was released a couple of years ago didn't get huge media attention, but now that it can be found in bargain bins across the country, you should do yourself a favor and check it out. ""Abe's Oddworld Oddysee"" is a game of great imagination, fun, and immense challenge. In fact, some of the game may be two challenging. The basic game style is from a side view, with rooms, and in each room Abe has to figure out how to get something done. It's a puzzle game with an action twist, with a great story and a sequel hot in stores now. The main drawback is that this game may be in some ways too difficult for young children, or even for those without quick video game reflexes. But for the rest of us, check it out. Pros:Fun, challenging, great story Cons:Slightly repetitive, almost too challenging (This review originally written: Oct 01 '99). This is another PSX classic. The game mechanic forces you to explore without knowing what will come next, to save your friends without knowing if you'll die, to think about a solution of a problem without knowing exactly what's that problem. Very hard and exigent game, but also very beautifuly finished maps and history. I can't give it 10 because of the lack of saving points. Dying in the same spot again and again and repeating the same part of the game can be frustrating.. The art is amazing, the voice acting was top notch for it's time, and the creatures are genius. It's the best platform game I've ever played and it's difficulty is may put off a more casual audience but there will never be a time when it is unfair on you, when you make a mistake and die you always think to your self ""Ok, that didn't work but now i know where I went wrong"". It's a masterpiece and you should pick it up seeing it's quite cheap on certain services.. Truly stunning 2D platformer, from the game mechanics, to the graphics and of course the music/sound effects. This title even has a main potagonist you really do care about, along with his 99 workmates who you should try your best to save! Epic, beautiful, gorgeous!. Do i need to say something? its perfect, awesome, a classic.. This is one of my favorite childhood games. A bit morbid, but that isn't always a bad thing. There literally are no other games like this one, and what I mean by that is the original content is unforgettable. Definitely one of the better games of the decade, and I wish more developers were this creative and talented.. I just finished this game after downloading it on my **** it's one of the best games ever made. If you have a PS3, get this off PSN. The amount of thought that was put into this game puts modern games to shame. In an age of mindless, dumbed-down games that tell you exactly what to do, this game actually makes you think and figure things out. It will be hard to play a mindless modern game after having my brain stimulated by this brilliant game. This game was made in a time when game companies didn't dumb down their games for 11-year-olds...back then, game companies made games how they wanted to make them and they weren't afraid to make their games difficult. Sadly, no one will ever make a game like this again...game companies today cater to dumb people who want to mindlessly mash buttons without ever using a brain cell. Oh well, at least you can still get it on PSN.","classic platformer game that immerses you in rich and dark world full of danger, hummer, and adventure . you play as abe, a humble mudokon slave who discovers that his boss plans to turn him and his fellow workers into meat products . game features stunning graphics, animations and sound effects that create a unique and atmospheric experience ."
"1,087.Falcon 4.0","I was extremely young when I got this in a bundle with 3 other aviation simulators and I **** at it. This one is the only game I remember from the bundle, and was the one I played the most. It was fun when I finally took off and got to fly around before getting wrecked by ace pilots, but I am hardly qualified to review this game at all. So don't take my review as gospel.. Best relaisim ever. If you want to be a airmen. You will love it. Just incredible. Regards. -Alpiinoo. Back in the day it couldn't get any more real than this and even today it holds up exceptionally well thanks to further unofficial development. Due to the age of F4 I highly recommend BMS 4.32 as it improves graphics, gameplay, support for modern systems and has a very active community up to this day. Compared to more recent simulations like DCS the one thing making Falcon 4 stand out is it's dynamic campaign which allows strategic moves all the way through. The AI will 'frag' missions for you (depending on situation and tweak-able priorities) but you can always set up your own flight with great detail. The best thing about this: other pilots can join any time and everybody can save a copy of the current progress making cooperative campaign play very easy over a long period of time. As with every modern sim it's not necessarily easy to get into but the documentation is expansive and the community very friendly and supportive. If you played DCS and want a multi role fighter in a dynamic and often unpredictable environment with lots of things going you should love it.",if you want to be a fighter in a dynamic and often unpredictable environment with lots of things going you should love this . compared to more recent simulations like DCS the one thing making Falcon 4 stand out is its dynamic campaign which allows strategic moves all the way through . the community is very friendly and supportive .
"1,088.Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six","Why did tactical shooters have to die and be forgotten? Why did Ubisoft make Red Storm Entertainment develop Far Cry 4 when they should've made a sequel to this masterpiece. Rainbow Six 3: Gold is Raven Shield and Athena Sword. Additionally you can download Iron Wrath expansion on **** its free. Rainbow Six 3 Black Arrow is the console version but they do share attributes for sure. The best part about Rainbow Six 3 is that its still online in 2021. After almost 20 years. With updated content like maps, guns, sights and scopes, hd hit effects, models and missions. Literally there are thousands of maps. Some great brand new ones from 2017-2021 and even more coming soon. Rainbow Six 3 is known to have the best coop experience. Even compared to SWAT 4 say. Both games that were considered to be like brothers so to speak. Came out around the same time, nearly the same engine though Swat 4's version of Unreal 2 is more like 2.5. R6 3 being more deadly, more elite obviously than Swat would be. The sheer fact that you can do so many different mission objectives, so many different styles of maps and settings just really brings this came to a whole new level. We also have combined maps from original 1998 Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear and several of those expansions. Even R6 Vegas! On top of that... you have amazing options for controlling your backup AI. For some information on that you can check out the community Discord at **** if you want more detail. There are some people who just let the backup AI follow them around instead of using them to their full potential though. The enemy AI are actually quite advanced. Depending on which map and who set them up. Tangos have 5 different personality traits and a percentage given for each skill. They also have a setting for what to do when they first see you. Some will surrender, run away and bait you (run around a corner and then they will be waiting with another enemy with guns pointed at you hoping that you chase them). Aim and you and fire. Spray at you and fire wildly. They will frag you instantly sometimes as their first reaction. They can also call for backup. They can even hunt you down. They also go towards the sound of your gun if you are not using a silencer. Very cool. Changes the entire feeling of the mission! The game also has civilians in some levels that you must look out for. Different from hostages. The civilians can still be harassed by the Tangos... they will use them as human shields randomly or the civilians will run into the line of fire if you shoot near them. Its intense. With the addition of ads, iron sights... the game has the most replay value ever. Especially with the new updates. Could talk forever about this game... but you are better off joining us sometime for the best coop experience you will ever have. This game lays the foundation for skills upon which you can then take into almost any shooter, and even real life, and use them to your advantage when needed. Its as hardcore as it gets. We run a large Steam Group as well at ****/groups/tacticalgamingnetwork The Discord: **** ""You're the best of the best. Remember that."" TDLR: This game is so good that after 20 years we are making a brand new game in UE4/UE5 directly inspired by it! Lets squad up sometime!. Why did tactical shooters have to die and be forgotten? Why did Ubisoft make Red Storm Entertainment develop Far Cry 4 when they should've made a sequel to this masterpiece? This is quite literally as realistic as shooters will ever get. Commanding squads is something I just love to do.. Awesome shooter, first Rainbow Six Game and first Tom Clancy Game. Graphics in this game is not bad for 1998, gameplay is good, but in this game you must have a quick reaction, as in all Rainbow Six Game (Special in Siege). Rainbow Six is good game and one of the best games of 1998, best game of 1998 is Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast, but Rainbow Six very good too and deserve second position in top 10 games of 1998.. If you are familiar with Siege and Vegas you must know that those games are a departure from the original formula of R6. Although I do enjoy the modern R6, my favorite remains with the older ones. Rainbow Six was known for 3 core things in an open-world map. -Planning -Pacing -Executing REAL DEAL TAC-SIM The FPS mechanics are slow and tense. It's exciting because you will die in one hit. Forcing you to really emphasize upon the unpredictable enemies, and the organization of your team. Planning and teamwork are extremely crucial, but the game does not setup these assets for you. Instead you have to plan everything on your own. PLAN OR DIE 90% of the time you'll be stuck on the drawing board. You'll be switching back-and-forth between planning and action. The trial-and-error, and the random deployment of the enemies, makes it a satisfying challenge once you get everything right. You setup your team and choose their equipment based on the situation. You manage your own snipers, demolitions experts, assault teams and reconnaissance teams You manage their orders in the field through a complex waypoint system. At first glance, the whole planning phase will look like a chore. The maps look outdated and blocky, but if you give it time and patience you'll learn to appreciate it all. TRUE OPEN-WORLD GAME the non-linearity of the planning phase, gives you endless options on how you want to approach missions. The options are vast , you control when your team shoots, breach, and speed of their movement. TEAMMATES ARE LIKE DRONES, BUT THEY GET THE JOB DONE Your AI mates are drones that follow you everywhere you go. They do everything you say specifically and chronologically execute the orders based on the way-points you setup. Sometimes they'll come to an ad-hoc and that's when you know you some re-planning needs to be done. For a game that's decades old the game-play already has more ""replayability"" than Most triple-A titles these days. It takes time to appreciate a game that's not straightforward and a tad complicated, but once you do, you'll find that R6 is really something special. If you're new to the series, this will give you an original perspective on the series. You can then understand why allot of fans aren't too happy on where the series are heading.. Rainbow Six was my introduction - and pretty much anyone else's for that matter - to squad based tactical shooters - it was damned hard though, when I was 19 I could JUST get my head around the controls and the call signs and the go commands and the waypoints - it was not, was definitely not - a typical shooter. It was complex, but fun, tough, but rewarding when you actually finally got past a level you found really tough to beat, you didn't need a fancy FMV sequence, you were happy enough to move on to the next level. I remember loving this game back in the day, even though I also remember it used to do my head in!. Why did tactical shooters have to die and be forgotten? Why did Ubisoft make Red Storm Entertainment develop Far Cry 4 when they should've made a sequel to this masterpiece? This is quite literally as realistic as shooters will ever get. Commanding squads is something I just love to do.. As much as Doom was my gateway into computer games and its rich potential, Rainbow Six and its sequel Rogue Spear were my meat and potatoes. Back when I actually had a subscription to a gaming magazine (God, those were the days...) this preview for a game based on a Tom Clancy novel immediately caught my attention. I had gotten plenty bored of Quake 2 and was restless for something different and unique. The ultra-realistic gameplay of Rainbow Six fit to a T. Still, my computer at that time was unable to meet the minimum requirements for R6, so it would take a couple months before I actually got into it. But get into it I did, with a passion that now seems somewhat inhuman. I lovingly outfitted each operative with different weapons, carefully mapped out their mission routes and held my breath as they soldiered out to take down the terrorists and rescue the hapless hostages. Of course, on more then one occasion the entire operation would turn into a fiasco with multiple casualties and hostages gunned down. Alas, back to the drawing board. But multiplayer was where Rainbow Six really shined. Freed of the cumbersome AI, it was amazing to encounter a situation where you could be taken out by the opposing team in just one or two bullets. The added lethality of the weapons and the reduced margin of error made for the most amazingly tense multiplayer matches ever. Rogue Spear, the sequel which I bought on opening day was much more of the same. I have to be honest, Rogue Spear multiplayer devoured my life throughout 4 years of high school and doubtless contributed to the fact that my GPA suffered and I never had a girlfriend. Oh well, it seemed worth it, that's just how obsessed I was with the game. Even outside the game itself, I posted frequently on RSE's (the maker of R6) forums and made quite a few memorable friends, who later formed their own personal forum at ****. Rainbow Six is truly an immense chunk of my life and I have nothing but fond memories to look back on.","the best part about Rainbow Six 3 is that its still online in 2021.

"1,089.NHL 2004","Very good game with realistic movements, and a variety of game modes and features. One of my favourite NHL EA games.. The most fun arcade hockey game ever created. Ahead of its time in terms of commentary and features in dynasty mode. Controlling the ticket prices, salary caps, staff and contracts was present in this game and led the way with the improvements for future games. The soundtrack was also killer and the game was presented in a way that was easy on the eye. Of course the game has not aged particularly well, but this game is still fun to go back to and take on a friend.","the soundtrack was also killer and the game was presented in a way that was easy on the eye . of course the game has not aged particularly well, but it is still fun to go back to and take on a friend ."
"1,090.Wasteland 3","Great game!! Great gameplay, story, choices, characters. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little more to the companions, but that’s nitpicking. It’s an amazing crpg, probably in my top 3.. The best crpg I've played. Guns instead of magic is awesome, and choice and consequence is staggering. Great game.. Even not having played any of the previous instalments in the series, I can still safely say Wasteland 3 is a great game in the turn-based, cell-to-cell movement genre. The story can come off as convoluted initially, but its easy to pick up and go along. The gameplay is fun. The characters are interesting and well fleshed out. The score is out of this world. Worldbuilding is grand. Honestly, it scratched the itch X-Com had left marvellously.. The game feels pretty repetitive. The mechanics and the options are not really fun enough, though they are detailed. The story is far behind of a realistic story, though it's fun! The story and the stuff in the game are based on humour, which makes the game somehow fun.. It was good, before my controller stops working on this game. Beside that, the quality is..okay, not so fasinating as some viewers try to portrayed. this kind of so-called""turn based tactic"", well, there is turn, But no tactic. You don't need a well-functioning brain to excel this game. It just gives player the illusion of making choices and contemplating combat when in fact most of the choices doesn't matter. Engaging gameplay, immersive world, and endless fun! A must-play for all gamers seeking excitement and adventure.. After playing Baldurs Gate 3 I've been spoilt.This game is quite good and enjoyable to play. The gameplay is quite good, however the rest of it is severely lacking.I like that the party is easy to control and you don't have to keep switching characters to use their skills and that inventory is endless as their is no carry amount limit or weight limit.However there are things I hate such as respeccing is ridiculously expensive, the price increases in amount every time you want to respec even if it's a character you have not respecced yet and it goes up to a maximum of 3k and then it costs 3k anytime you want to respec It's **** story isn't interesting, not unique or creative at all and just using existing ideas from pop cultcha. It doesn't make you feel immersed or invested in anything. I just don't care about anything or anyone. Everything is too wierd but not in a good way, it's weird in a really silly cringe way.Party members are nothing special, you create most of them and those you don't you can't really interact with, they feel like souless **** world isn't very interesting or exciting to explore. The atmosphere is boring and dull just a white wasteland. I really hate traversing the world map and I don't bother trying to explore and just go where I am supposed **** graphics are just passable.I like the combat I find that the most fun and it was all that kept me wanting to play and keep **** way I'd want to play it more than once though.I mostly enjoyed playing it, but since I did not feel enthusiastic or want to explore, a lot of it is cringeworthy and I can't stand the thought of playing it again.. The Story is well told and executed fairly well, the graphics are good, and the music is great. The combat is fun but buggy at times, the world is full of fun factions and you have some varied options to deal with them that will change how the story plays out.. A very good tactical-RPG, in which we have a real tactical and a real RPG! The RPG component already: a clear story with a mission to carry out. Characters with strong character but some regrets all the same about the members of the team who are a little self-effacing and rarely intervene in the **** tactical part is effective, nothing innovative however apart from elements specific to the universe such as animal charm and hacking robots to make temporary **** passages where we wander around in the open world in the vehicle are anecdotal and have not had a huge impact on **** the end, the adventure in this ravaged world is effective and **** game ends in 40 hours, side quests included.. After completing Baldurus Great 3 This is a game. Blossomed I like the mechanics, good plot. Good game. I really like the concept of Wasteland games, but I think the series, if it continues to evolve in this direction, will worsen over time. Hence an overview of the good and bad. * Plot: I think it was well conceived although the Deth-path was not well fleshed out. Learning about the Patriarch involves secondary missions, hence I can image that people that don't explore those, don't understand well why Angela calls him a tyrant. (8/10) * Music: OST is probably the only place where the game really excels. There are a couple of really good songs such as the Jong's Down in the Valley to Pray and Barton's Monster Mash. On the other hand, these are individual performances, and their incorporation into the game is not always ideal. (10/10) * Voice acting: very good, with some memorable performances: McTavish, The Prisoner, Dorseys, Scotchmo, … It was clear that there were lots of well-chose actors. (9/10) * Design: the overly punk-style design. Car exhaust pipes on armors, oversized spikes that impede movement, constant fireworks effects on explosion-modded weapons, … all over-fantasized that even 8-year olds wouldn't buy. But at the same time the target audience is PEGI +17. W2 was better here. (4/10) Scorpions were great though! * Atmosphere: in some places there is a post-apocalyptic feel, in others (e.g. DLCs) you feel like you are in some futuristic setting having technology hardly imaginable to be possible at all. ""Post-apocalyptic"" implies some restrictions, and they should be respected. Again, I felt the old Fallout 1&2 and W2 scoring better here. (5/10) * Combat: mechanics seem to be dumbed down versus W2. Spike meter versus aimed shots? Distance-based accuracy of weapons no longer visible. And so on. The biggest issue is that the initiative has become completely obsolete and replaced by being completely determined by who starts the battle. This has a profound impact on the battle outcome since the turns are per squad, and no longer per character, hence starting second often means losing directly on Supreme Jerk. (6/10) * Character development: my occasional google almost always resulted in someone complaining about min/max-ing the rangers. In my case, all my rangers were equally exceptionally good in coordination because it directly affects AP, and were equally unlucky, because it is probably the most useless attribute. That is I think due to the broken attributes system. Why not penalize it, like the skills system? And why not make important skill checks on it during the game? We are two decades later, and I still feel that the original Fallouts (and Fallout Tactics) had the best character design. Why fix things that aren't broken? (6/10) * Companions: underdeveloped, like usual. And then you have the custom rangers that have practically no background at all. W2 forced one to have 4 custom rangers, in W3 you are forced to 2. I hope in W4 we will finally reach 1! Hence (8/10) just for being optimistic. * Difficulty: Supreme jerk was enjoyable as it made you prepare for every encounter, although I don't like it when the difficulty merely impacts the ""tankiness"" of the opponents. And the latter is unfortunately the case. (8/10) * SFX: Special effects were probably the most bothersome. Burning trashcans at 5 meter distance sound as if standing in the middle of an inferno, blasting my eardrums out. And then this click-pop sound over and over at HQ armory and many different locations is just maddening. I don't remember ever (!) experiencing SFX this disturbingly bad. I literally had to constantly adjust the SFX volume to not loose sanity. (1/10) * DLC: God I hate those, and this was again such an experience. I remember a few times were DLC felt OK: in Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age: Origins as separate (!) mini-stories with a clear beginning and end. In W3, both DLC are placed as primary quests, with no effect on the main story. What is more, they introduce new gameplay elements and design choices that are not in line with the original, hence feel as if you are playing a new game within a game, completely breaking the immersion and feeling like an endless chore just to ""check"" boxes. There were two occasions where I considered quitting the game, and both were related to the DLCs. (2/10) Hence although some elements were good, like the music, voice-acting and even the story, some aspects seem as if directed by some young grads, as if the old veterans weren't involved at all. So overall, 6/10, and without the DLCs it would have been 7/10.. This game provides a very unique, and interesting experience, compared to Pillars of Ethernity or Kingmaker, it has an interesting world where your decision feels impactful. The only issues this game has are the size of the game and some technical issues.. In a post-apocalyptic world, the Desert Rangers try to rebuild society from the ashes, but they’re fighting a losing. Despite enjoying this type of RPG in the past, Wasteland never quite clicked with me. This was partly due to the fairly regular disconnections when trying to play online multiplayer, but also because the storylines weren’t as interesting as games like Divinity. That being said, the level of freedom is impressive, and the combat fairly deep, so fans of the genre should still check it out for themselves.. Much better than the predessesor. No bugs at all in 2023. If you enjoyed games like Fallout 2 or Baldurs Gate 2 you can't go wrong with this one.. this game is just tedious. The good parts are too short make up the long winding boring dialogue scenes and the slugish movement sections. Uninstalled after couple of hours.. it is a fine and balanced rpg game. It could have been better if they spend more time depicting main characters around the player. A good game, if not excellent. The gameplay is still nice and will remind the fans of the first fallout games, the style of these games but there are some design choices that annoyed me. The fights that start automatically when you haven't moved your characters yet. The thing is that depending on the characteristics of this or that character, if they are uncovered they will get their races smoked. Because obviously in these cases, the enemy group has the advantage of the turn even if you have a high initiative. It's quite annoying since the characters get smoked and you can't do anything at all. Just pray they don't all die. The level design of the battle arenas is often bad, especially indoors. The layout of the different covers is bad. The best way to play indoors is to stay out of the rooms where the enemies are concentrated, wait for them and beat them with overwatch (Activating overwatch during your turn allows you to automatically attack the enemy when he comes in range during his turn). The scenario is far from being exceptional, it is nicely written but the story itself is basic. Excellent dubbing though. And don't take the DLC, they are lousy, they add game mechanics that look good on paper but are badly executed. I don't want to elaborate, look at the reviews on the page of the said DLC. Optimized with the . I had crazy framerate drops, I was going from 120fps to . 30 fps in a totally random way. (I7, 16go, RTX 3070 laptop version) It can happen anytime, anywhere without any logic. I went to see on the internet and I'm not the only one in this case. Bard Tales 4 was also badly optimized, a constant with this studio. I only broke the game but I still had fun in the end, that's why I gave it a blue thumb. The exploration is rewarding and the combat gameplay is fun once you know the game systems and how to operate it but Wasteland 3 lacks elegance in its design choices in general. I'm still curious to see what inXile will do next. After all, Wasteland 3 was a game paid for by crowdfunding and it's not doing too bad under those conditions. Now, with Microsoft's billionaires, it's time to turn the tables. Brian Fargo and Chad Moore, I count on you.. If you like x-com style combat combined with the crpg genre, then it fits like a fist in the eye. One of the few games that I wanted to play again after playthrough.. A very good following of Wasteland 2. Hope we will see Wasteland 4 one day.. Big fan of this franchise after starting 20+ hours in this game. I like the combination of open world and turn-based encounters. The way that you interact with the world can change the outcome of your party and the story. Something I've rarely seen in other titles. A crowded nightclub can be a friendly HQ or turn into a shoot out zone in an instant, depending on how you play your cards. Getting the proper flow of party members and classes is a great dynamic for how you handle encounters, and rewards smart play styles and foresight. It's truly an 'indie' gem that I constantly find myself wanting to revisit to try different loadouts and play styles.. Best game in a genre IMHO, variability and solid quality, when I finished it first time, started from the begging same day on harder difficulty. Great graphics, characters, sound, enemy variation, story. Go into the game knowing you have to basically have beaten it already/ use exploits to progress through it's god-awful early game balancing issues. Awesome. Just awesome) One of the best RPG ever. There is such a amazing fighting system, beautiful music). Super relaxing game with great dialogs, fast pacing turn based action and good graphic. I was stunned by how fun this game is. When i finished the game Wasteland 2 is next. I gave 1 point less because some things could have explained beter. I missed some things. Even when its turn based, it plays pretty Quick. No long battles. Look past some of the bugs, the game is absolutely amazing and really may be the best game of this genre ever made. Cant say enough good things about it! Will remember it for a long time :). The only good thing about this game is that it makes you appreciate how good XCOM is. Wasteland literally copy pastes XCOM but it doesn't work - why? Because in XCOM your goal is not only to win the mission, your goal is to keep all your soldiers alive. But in Wasteland you don't care about that because all units come back to life at the end of the battle. So whereas in XCOM you can sit there for 5 minutes debating whether or not to run that overwatch, in Wasteland you don't give a damn. And without all that tension, the game isn't fun. Do yourself a favour and just play Long War again.. One of the best turn/team based games. - much better than Wasteland 2 (7/10) - main story and side quest very entertaining - not too much talking or just interesting dialogues - good situation and uniwersum design, music, art, situations locations, characters - lot of interesting things - rebuilding HQ - good elastic loot/team customization - nice fight system, and defense/damage maths, entertaining Small problems: - weapon level system - stupid, also hp level up system and linear progress with it. Fallout logic is better - performance leaks. Game constantly loose FPS. Sometimes its just after some fight from 144 to 15fps instantly. Maybe it happened twice. Only restart game helps. Usually slowing down is less visible. After 3h from 144fps it could slow down to 80fps. There is also no manual frame limit only v-sync - unity engine (this version at least) - like many other unity games one of the ugliest same way. Poor performance/details ratio. - not greatest graphic details. - there should be maybe info - how much time i have to solve the quest or where is possibility to get quest. One of the first characters you meet is a female leader of your military unit. She's bestest at everything and everyone loves her, and the only reason she looses is because 1-dimensional male villains who lick knives while talking to you jumped her with overwhelming numbers and superior weapons, and she still managed to kill like half of them. The first male leader you meet is called The Patriarch. He of course turns out to be a loser with big ego who needs to be taken down and substituted with a woman. That's basically the theme of the game. Men are patheric loser and whiners who only get ahead by doing evil things, while women are the bestest, and if they fail at something, it's because they were put in an impossible situation.. First things first: My score is strictly for the game, but honestly with the amount of issues I had with Wasteland 3 it should be lower. However, most of these issues simply stem from the bad Microsoft Store and Universal Windows Platform. Because every time I tried the game with steam everything worked fine and every time I played the game on game pass, everything was **** again. The worst issues were the ones that broke even my save games. That's why I simply can't give a lower score, because it's obviously not the developers or games fault. A lot of games I played on game pass had most of these issues. Wasteland 3 is pretty much everything I hoped for after I was done with the prequel. These games don't have the best story, but it's still servicable. However, as it is with Fallout (at least before it was handed to Bethesda), the reason why I love these kind of games isn't the story but rather the characters, exploration and settings. Aspects that are definitely great in Wasteland 3!. Weak story based on ""humor"" (which is not funny) and forgettable characters after 8 hours of playing i just got bored and can't persuade myself to continue playing. Gameplay is OK but gets repetitive fast as for stealth there is none you just have to avoid getting close to enemies in some room or else the combat starts. The main problem is that the game feels so stupid and most characters talk like idiots or mentally disturbed feels like watching a silly comedy show. Also from the technical perspective has many bugs which is inexcusable for a $60 game tile. I am so disappointred Fallout series were way better that this. Sure it's not Fallout 3 Van Buren, but it's the best Wasteland so far. Choices and consequences are all over the game. And it really is a fun to play, with good humor, fantastic soundtrack and even good visuals this time.. I really enjoyed playing it. I liked it and played till the end. It still has some improvements and I was debating between 8 or 9 but I gave it 9 because I would definately buy wasteland 4 if they do it. I just enjoying playing this game. The thing I don't like is sometimes the jokes are really bad and the dialogue goes on a bit too long and it feels a bit off.. The ambiance is something to enjoy. Partly because of music, which I found to be outstanding. The story is good. The loading times may be bit of a pain. But overall this was a good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the best rpgs ever made , has alot of choice and consequence ( not just illusion of choice , ur action really matter ) , lets u do the missions the way you want. The previous Wasteland was a pretty good tactical rpg. It was a bit like playing the classic Fallout games again. Wasteland 3 however is a very poor example of how to make a sequel to a good game. Terrible starting character and very poor writing make this one for the bargain bin. The graphics are decent and the sound is fine but the numerous bugs and bland story just make this a frustrating experience.. A great turn-based RPG that seems to improve on its predecessor in almost every way. I liked the dessert environment of W2, but the quality of life improvements in W3 made for a more enjoyable experience. The music and general audio needs special mention as it’s great for building tension and atmosphere.. (For people that have played the game) Close but no Brygo's cigar. CONS: - What is with this UI? I don't understand how you make a ""loot-galore"" game and have this counter intuitive inventory? No way of telling your gear apart, just a complete mess. - Grouping and un-grouping your squad is confusing. One moment I am looting, talking to an npc etc. and somehow I am now ungrouped and running solo with my main character so now I have to wait until the rest of the squad catches up. This is not terribly annoying early on but 30 hours later it gets tedious. -Mods and armor: Why on earth isn't there a perk that lets you exchange your mods without breaking them. Some areas require fire dmg, some energy dmg. Let people play around and be strategic and don't punish players. And the fact you can field strip guns but not armor is bs. -Weapons: Whats with the gigantic penalties on mods? +12 dmg -12 dmg? +10% Evasion but -2 Armor? Ok let me just grab my calculator and do the positives contra negatives on that one real quick. Just mind-boggling. -Companions/pets: A neat feature that feels upgraded from W2 but why can't you heal or cure your followers? Right after a fight, I manage to walk over a gas mine and now my whole team is poisoned and I can't heal or cure my companions so they just have to die cause of low health and slow hp regen. So stupid. -Missions: Main missions and side missions feels too similar and ultimately like a choir. I never understood why you cant just make a game with a solid story and then after you have finished said story you can continue playing the game and THEN play side-missions. You rush thru dialogue as a result. +/-Crafting: Great addition and a great function but another UI mess where you can't even read what ur chosen item will even do? Even if you have previously made it. Confusing. Why would I sacrifice an item/mod for something unknown? Just let me see what exactly I'm investing in before I spend precious resources. -Bugs: And plenty of them but one that stands out is when in combat, if you attack your next target ""too fast"" before your character has finished its animation he/she just randomly shoots any target or just right in to the wall. That is insanely game-breaking as you have now wasted AP/Ammo doing NOTHING. -Environment: Feels even more dead than the deserts of W2. Just like a re-skin with a snow mod on top. -Radiation is back! Maybe that's just me but just put up roadblocks instead of injuring my team for trying to drive thru the wrong snowy valley. So much for exploration. PROS: +Talents/perks feels more compact and streamlined. +Skills usage also is now much faster and no need to micro manage anymore.Just click on door/safe/alarm and it happends automatically. +/- Cutscenes! Even tho they are few and far between, still a welcomed addition. +Vehicle customization +/-Story: Feels same old same old. Nothing new and nothing special. +Load times: They seem to have fixed the load times cause I remember it being slow as hell a couple of updates ago but now runs pretty good on a SSD. There are more positives but ultimately gets overshadowed by the negatives. Feels too much in the middle, which is a shame cause I remember Wasteland 2 feeling fun and fresh but this just seems uninspired. I also remember seeing early ""gameplay"" videos pre-release and that looked like a completely different game all together. I guess we can thank the pre-purchase people for another failed franchise. Overall I wouldn't recommend unless its on sale 80% off.. When I started playing Wasteland 3, I was pretty intimidated by all the options at character creation, and I didn't feel like the premade characters were well-optimized. There are so many skills in this game, and at the beginning, you can only create two characters - you can't have everything. This gave me a ton of decision paralysis. After you get out of the tutorial area, you are allowed to pick or create 2 more characters to add more skills you missed out on, and are allowed to take 2 special companions as well to further flesh out your skill variance. I feel like knowing what those 2 initial companions are in advance can help you optimize which skills you should pick on the remaining 4 created characters. This is one of my big initial criticisms of the game - you can find yourself in a situation where you picked many of the same skills across multiple companions, and this will make skill checks a lot more frustrating in the beginning since you need less overlap. To compound to this skill metagaming problem, respecs are not free - they cost money. So if you realize that you made a mistake, it will first cost you $200 to respec and I heard it costs more in the future. At the beginning of the game, this is a big punish - you only have $400-500 tops for quite a while so the respec is asking almost half of your entire treasury. I believe this was too much of an ask for players not playing on a harder difficulty and are still trying to learn the game. Each of the 4 customized rangers should have been given a free respec on Normal difficulty or lower. It would have made character creation less stressful and less time-consuming because I honestly felt like I just needed to start over to optimize my money situation at the beginning of the game. I did not want to just burn $200 because I was learning. Beyond these problems though, the game is excellent. Once you have a party of 6 characters you are happy with, meeting the various skill checks feels pretty chill and you can just play the game. That is when the game is at its best. There's a really good balance of exploration, dialog, and combat, and nothing outstays it's welcome. Everything is very high quality for this style of game. I also really appreciate the large font sizes and the game's complexity is ""just right"". If you think games like Pathfinder are too complicated, then Wasteland 3 is a good place to start because its rules are very accessible - it's pretty similar to Fallout 3 in terms of complexity, but your skills and perks are distributed across 6 characters instead of 1. So, I give this game 4 stars out of 5. If Wasteland 3 had been less punishing towards new players and allowed for more free respecs to prevent new players from having to start all over, I honestly would have given Wasteland 3 a 5. Hopefully, inXile will learn from this mistake and make their next game just a little more accessible for new players.. This game should be an RPG. As that genre it fails miserably. Look I can forgive buggy gameplay, I can forgive unbalanced game technicities. I can forgive poor music or even poor design. What I cannot forgive is a bad story and a railroad storytelling in what's supposed to be an RPG. The game is so railroaded that's ridiculous and it impacts the storytelling making it seem bland, silly and unrelatable. Spoilers Ahead. For example In the first part of the game, you are facing the Dorseys who attacked the Convoy, I try to follow along his psychopath act and extract info from them , then the ''badass'' ranger who was bleeding to death decided to step in and kill them before I could get any valuable info from these guys. Way to go genius ! Couldn't you just die quietly in your corner ? Another good example is the child robot. it's obviously infantile and confused, but there is no way to negotiate with him, you can either kill a literal child uploaded in a robot's brain ( btw there is no in game way to know that this is an actual child rather than just an android ), or you can let it go, with no way of convincing him to stop killing humans. It's ridiculous. And that's just the tip of the Iceberg NEVER before I have found an RPG that punishes for your actions in a way you cannot complete the story, or you loose gaming mechanics for it. In one of the primary missions, PRIMARY, you have to find staff for your base, one of the required staff members is a mechanic. The ONLY way to get said mechanic, is by being an vainglorious good guy and choose a dumb side of helping refugees. The situation is that the city is facing short supplies and they cannot support all the refugees , so, instead of making everyone starve , I decided to help the last batch to reach the city, and then take down the ones who helped smuggle them. Turns out the game is so hellbent on making you choose something that the developer team consider ''morally right'', that they punish you for choosing the sensible middle ground, not all refugees, but a few of them, help the ones you can. Whelp, turns out that makes it impossible to complete one of the primary missions in the game, and locks you out of ever having a mechanic to mod your primary mean of transport and accessing radioactive sites. Good job !. They even give you a joke political advisor instead of the mechanic, who is basically going to cry and not advise anything the moment you suggest something he doesn't like, just like the game creators !. The game is so railroaded that you cannot even refuse rewards. I'm serious. When you have to choose between siding with Brygo and the Marshalls, if you choose Brygo and tell him you don't want his reward for being ''reasonable'', aka a team of criminals that will sell you guns, he puts his life in the line to tell you that you either accept or join the Marshalls. How ? Why ? We literally reach an agreement in which I let you go , you tried to stop your underling from helping traitors, you were an ally of the old ranger team, I wanted a bloodless solution to all this, and I don't like the corrupt Marshalls, why are you risking your life in a gun fight because I rejected your reward ???? As a last note, the game is overly political in a wrong sense and punishes those who don't follow the game creators moral compass. I'm a immigrant, I don't need anyone to tell me how hard is to immigrate to a better country, I know that well enough, but are you saying that the reality that you cannot help all immigrant in the world is ''evil'' ? No country can solve the entire world's poverty and war refugees. That's a reality you have to deal with. But in this game there is no place for negotiations, you cannot tell them to go to another place, you cannot help the ones there and make sure the next waves goes to somewhere else, you cannot even help them build a better place. You are either ''evil'' or ''good''. And that's the entirety of the game, you can choose being ''evil'' and be punished by the game, or be ''good'' and follow a very poor storytelling. Also, as sidenote, for being so overly political, they sure have no quarrels in doing harmful stereotypes, like the inbred hillbilly rednecks who are hyper aggressive and pick up a fight with you for the lols. Ah but we all know stereotyping one side of the political spectrum is good so long is ''that'' side right ? right. The entire game follows a poor and bad railroaded story. The game is terrible for that, it's like I made a strategy game, and instead of strategy I make it a first person action shooter. This is not how RPGs work.. when stupid an Dummy makes a game you get this. they obviously know nothing of weapons. I mean how does a shotgun at point blank range miss? that is the whole point of a shotgun. it sprays so it has a high chance of hitting the target. not to mention the missions arent interesting, and the characters arent interesting. so much more but if you decided to play you will see what i mean.. I just really enjoyed it. The music, the setting, the combat, the writing, story ..all of it was top notch. The general polish and presentation has been improved ten-fold in comparison to wasteland 2 and it's now really easy to get into even as a newcomer to the series. If you like RPGs, especially the original Fallouts or even New Vegas, then this should be right up your alley.. This one is a toughie, so first things first - this game is a definite must-play if you are a fan of one or more of the following: cRPGs, post-apo, Fallout, choice and narrative-driven games and Wasteland series (duh ;)). That being said... ...the game has its flaws, the biggest of which for me are be","wasteland 3 is a great game in the turn-based, cell-to-cell movement genre . the story is convoluted initially, but its easy to pick up and go along . the mechanics and the options are not really fun enough, though they are detailed . the quality is..okay, not so fasinating as some viewers try to portrayed ."
"1,091.Legend of Grimrock II","This was a nearly perfect dungeon crawling experience (with tons of content outside dungeons)! The game oozes with style, and the environments are awesome in their square-paper format. Combat is hard but manageable with patience -- movement is essential in its (nearly) turn-based battles. Character progression is slow but perceptible, especially when you have the opportunity to fight again some opponents from the beginning of the game, and there is very little filler -- you are always fighting some monsters, trying to figure out the puzzles, or hunting for better equipment. There is tons of backtracking, but the game presents many shortcuts to accelerate your trips around the island. Exploration is nice, but the puzzles and riddles are the stars of the game. All of them are logic, though you might want to explore the world to find hints, and often a hint is quite far from the puzzle itself. I actually found myself stuck very often, but coming back to a puzzle on another day gave me new ideas; there was only one ""main"" puzzle that was too obscure for me (the combination to the cemetery door -- I found its hints and nearly solved it, but I would never guess the one extra bit at the end of the sequence). Moreover, you can actually finish the game skipping one (maybe two?) of the big areas; you would miss on a lot of content, but this means you do not have to solve everything, unless you want to get to the ""true ending"". There are also many optional riddles and secrets which just provide you with extra equipment and are entirely skippable, some of them very clever -- there were quite a few ""a-ha!"" moments for me. Now, do not expect too much story or lore -- though there are a few bits here and there, they are just an excuse for all the dungeon (and exterior) crawling. Score: 87/100.. This game is total garbage! Twice I played this game for about ten hours and quit!! I played and liked the first one. I’m good at this game. I spent hours playing the first one. Yet, this sequel totally ****. First of all, needlessly difficult enemies at certain points, clearly inserted for no other reason than to make the game “difficult” completely RUIN this game. The first version took into account the fact that the game is played in the old “four-directional” (north, south, east, west) style. You’re playing with a key board ok ... not a joystick. The enemies were difficult, but moved appropriately- and kept things fair. These ###king enemies, like the wolves, for example, they magically Fu##king move lightning fast, and ALWAYS magically appear in twos, ALWAYS on both sides, and BOOM YOU ARE F U C #ing dead, fighting a fa&&ot as$ fa&&ot character that is supposed to be there as a food source. Meanwhile, there is absolutely ZERO progression control, so - the next thing you know - even an expert at the original can find himself fighting a character that you are drastically under powered to face. The games **** advice? “If you get stuck go somewhere else for a while.” Wow, that is just mother fuc$king genius dude. Brilliant! Just wander around and figure out when you’re at the proper strength to handle the proper level. Again, zero progression control. It’s just an all open mess, that - unless you follow a walkthrough step for step - is going to over and over again leave you completely frustrated. It’s total garbage. Don’t believe me? Go to the cemetary A-hole, and then tell me how this idiot didn’t make this game needlessly difficult. Surrounded by enemies that take forever to kill, in front of you and behind you, on paths ONE SPACE WIDE , where you cannot employ any defensive strategy even if you want to. Again - FU@KING GENIUS DUDE!! This is on the normal difficulty setting!!?!?!??!?? You, whoever made this game, are a total FU@King as$hole! You’ve been warned. Play something else!. I give this game 9. This game is truly amazing, impossible to stop playing. I reduce 1 point because, guys, really, come puzzles are just impossible to solve. I have no Idea how others managed to solve NEX roof exit puzzle for instance.. Very fun. If you liked the first game, you will love this one hands down. One of the best dungeon crawlers period. That being said, it's by no means a perfect game. The puzzles are (usually) solvable, however they're will be times where the solution is random and badly hinted at. Combat and character customization has been overhauled since the last game, but it's still the same engine more or less so expect to be trapped by monsters repeatably until death. Auto-saving is a absolute necessity. The game is not ""hard"". It is very challenging, even on normal, which is an immediate hit or miss for some. Overall a great sequel to a good game and a great installment into the dungeon crawling genre.. Disappointing. As a fan of the original Dungeon Master (from 1987), this had some of what I had hoped for, especially visually, like real 3D graphics, animation, and lighting. But things like combat, spells, leveling, and story are weak. The big (ish) world makes for some running around doing nothing (except running low on food). Some of the puzzles are a pain the first time through but exactly the same when you play again, so replayability suffers. The official forum seems to be dead - I can't even make an account. I had hoped to be able to create my own dungeons. The tutorials and manual are not enough help - being able to ask questions on the forums would help, but as I said I can't get onto the forums.. Probly the best explorer game I played. I want to solve all the puzzles, find all the secrets! I get a strong sense of tabletop role playing when I play grimrock 2. Amazing atmosphere that gives goosebumps!. Really awesome dungeon crawler - I've played a couple other similar games, and this game is far beyond any of them. It's easy to underestimate how much work is required to make this type of game fun and engaging, but the grimrock developers did a great job with it.. Legend of Grimrock 2 is bigger than its predecessor, but it doesn't feel better in any way. Still a good game though.. Bigger isn't always better. But in Legend of Grimrock 2, it's better most of the time. They've kept what made Legend of Grimrock great, rectified some of its failings and generally expanded much on variety and content. The latter brings a failing new to Grimrock. Some of the puzzles and their clues span the game world and can require quite a bit of backtracking if you missed some clue along the way, or didn't bother writing it down. But these incidents are few and far between compared to all the goodness this game has to offer. New dangerous-looking enemies make it harder to dance around the less-than-up-to-it AI of the first game. I won't spoil it for you, but some enemies were just genious. The new environments, including outdoor ones, are varied and beautiful. New puzzle elements bring spice to the old formula, allowing you to feel different kinds of clever upon solving them. (Or different kinds of stupid!) Class and skill systems have been revised, with additional classes and a new race - the ratlings. In short, if you liked the first one, you're gonna love this one. One of the smartest games in existence. And it's nice enough to hope you're smart as well.. This one is much better than the last one. It still has the same tile moving but it feels much more organic than before and you can go outside. Also the best point is that the game focuses less on super hard puzzles and makes smaller more pleasant ones and also adds more action and boss fights. This time I actually hope they make a sequel.. It's a brilliant, hard and long game, very well designed, with a great athmosphere, tough to master, but makes you keep going and going. The puzzles and secrets are awesome. I didn't play Legend of Grimrock I, but I'm still playing LoG II right now, December 2016. I hope I could finish the game, but it's very hard. Love it! Will be playing LoG III if it's made.. Good game overall, but too many annoyances to really recommend. Pros: -Music and sound (my cat thinks the birds are real) -Graphics -Nostalgia factor -Party creation -Combat, minus potions Cons: -It should be called ""Legend of Pressure Plates"" because almost EVERY ""puzzle"" involves pressure plates. It gets old. -Weird races and ugly portraits. -Some switches would be almost impossible to see if you didn't know where to look. -Fumbling around to switch weapons or use potions in combat is extremely awkward and time-consuming. -Needing lockpicks and gold keys to open chests is silly and time-consuming when you have to backtrack to open chests you've already found. I can shoot meteor storms but a small lock stops me? *Rolls eyes* -Magic runes system of casting is awkward and time-consuming. -Dancing around enemies in combat feels silly. Why are there tanky characters if even they can barely take hits?. Respect to the programming team, for taking big steps from the previous (also great) Grimrock. I can't give enough praise to this old-school RPG, playability, graphics, sound, story, everything is refined. Eye of the Beholder has a contender for the 1st place !!. Unforgiving - sure, frustrating - sometimes but always lovable. The old tabletop roleplayer in me gets his nostalgia medicine with this game: nothing is left to random dungeon generation but instead every item and location is scripted with painstaking attention to detail.. Could you ask for more from the game? No. Epic loot, involved character building in the context of meaningful team/party development, interconnected level design, unique enemies and challenges, intense dungeons, excellent graphics and ambiance. As a negative, some puzzles are obscure and paths/treasures hidden by unclear means; but, overall, I highly recommend.. A huge, epic adventure that fans of first-person dungeon crawlers will devour. Designed with nostalgia in mind, but also sleek and shiny with modern graphics and great sound design. Better than the first game in every way, and worth it if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game. Play the first game before this one to help you ease into the mechanics and appreciate the improvements. The challenge level is steep but fair, and difficult enemies can be taken down through tactics and manuvering rather than brute force. There are tons of secrets to find and an overall sense of mystery and wonder in every dungeon and area. Atmosphere is thick and the sound really makes the world feel alive, and threats ahead can be anticipated with keen ears. Overall the presentation makes for a immersive experience coupled with solid gameplay and combat. The puzzles are mostly logical and can be figured out with a little thought and experimentation, though a few are so unclear that guesswork is almost neccessary. I'll fully admit I had to consult a guide for a few spots, and while some solutions made me feel stupid, a few just made me go ""really?"". It's much more satisfying to work through the puzzles yourself, but some of the nastier ones can get frustrating enough to encourage cheating. A few minor balance issues made me rethink my initial party and start over after a while, but I'm terrible for that in any game like this. Almost any party combination can work, but some weapons are simply found more often and in better quality than others. Consulting a guide or a friend before setting out with your party can help a lot, especially since a few of the classes don't necessarily work the way you might expect them to. Being out in a bright, open world makes the grid-based movement seem a bit strange, where it mostly made sense in the confined halls of the first game. It's not just there for nostalgia though - the movement system and the logic that governs it is central to the combat and puzzle-solving systems and removing it would have required a complete overhaul in design. The game wouldn't work otherwise. The more open-ended design makes for a lot more exploration, but it can be overwhelming. Puzzles that need keys or information from elsewhere to solve don't always indicate that clearly, and if you leave the game for too long and come back to it, you'll likely be hopelessly lost. The progression path isn't clear, but that could be said to just be part of the game's philosophy. Here's an island full of monsters and traps and secrets, good luck. Nostalgic, polished, immersive, and challenging enough to deter some players, this is almost everything you could possibly want in a dungeon crawl and one of the only modern examples of the genre. Worth the purchase, and then some.. Saying it is ""old school"" RPG is a lie. The only thing old school about it is the navigation. Everything else screams modern real time combat with horrifically unbalanced gameplay. Did anybody even bother play testing this thing? It does make me miss the old school RPGs though. I wanted to play them instead of this bad game. Advancement is useless, skills are pointless and the enemies always overpower you. With the constant cooldowns and micro management needed the enemies quickly overwhelm you every time. In these types of situations you'd retreat but you can't in this game because enemies tend to spawn around you, there is no place to corner and you're injuried. At the end of the game I felt just as powerless as the start. The game should have been called Legend of Micromanagement because that is what you do the entire game. From the continual need to eat to the continual conservation of ammo and energy you are constantly drinking potions during combat. On top of that most enemies do crippling damage making you unable to attack. You end up sitting there watching enemies take you apart in a couple of hits while you wait on some cooldown or fumble with the horrific inventory system to find a potion. The only thing this game got right is the map. It is probably the best map implementation I've seen. But everything else is simply poor game design. As such I will not be playing any more of the Grimrock games.. For every step forward it really feels like this game should have instead fixed a problem with the original. Interface is still clunky. Bad design choices such as permanent debilitating status effects (unless you make it to a save point) and extremely difficult to find hidden wall buttons. Also the game is more punishing than enjoyable with traps that are aimed at killing you instead of creating an enjoyable experience. Problems stated, this is still a great game. Just not quite the advancement in the franchise I was hoping for.. I'm rather hard giving notations, but this game really deserves a 10, the only negative would be that a bit more social interaction between the players or with NPC could be cool. Rest is excellent.. After being disappointed by the first Legend of Grimrock I still bought this second installment based on the initially mostly positive reviews. In the first few chapters, I really believe they were right. The graphics were much better and the puzzles much more logical although the ""move and fight as a group only"" frustrating interface remained. But soon, the authors reverted to their first love of inane, clueless and totally obtuse puzzles with a ""you better be quick on the keyboard or else you fail"" gameplay. Your foes also get more accurate, stronger and so powerful that the only way to defeat them (And they come in multitude) is to use a glitch where they get caught somewhere on the map and can't fight you. Otherwise, a shot or two and it's ""game over"". A total waste unless you're ready to follow a step by step guide and use cheats to survive.. This game is so cute. Very interesting mechanics and tone of puzzles. Level are huge, compared to Grimrock 1. Had fun with this one. Good work, can't wait for next one.. SCORE: 6.4/10 It looks like a pretty good game, and it is for the most part, but I think the puzzles are worse than the first one and too irrational/nonsensical and kind of reminded me of Broken Age. Maybe I just don't like RPGs like this anymore. I'm finding it more and more that I think I will like a game based on way-in-the-past preferences that just don't hold anymore. I used to love Might and Magic but I don't like this. I used to love RTS like Warcraft and Age of Empires, but I don't like them anymore either. Hell, I think I used to like Grim Fandango, but when I replayed it, it was very poorly designed actual game around a quirky and interesting story. I think I want my RPGs to be far more Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Skyrim, Mass Effect, and Shadowrun. Not this. This was slow, boring, and tedious. I know others disagree, but such is an opinion. I'm avoiding games I thought I would like such as Legend of Grimrock and Pillars of Eternity.. Oh, like it so much. Good Grafik for Oldschool Gamer. The Game has no Problems with Win 8.1. Should thought to play Wizardry 8,2. But this is better. The Riddles are a littke hard.. Absolutely a worthy follow-up to the amazing reboot of the old style dungeon crawler that was Grimrock I. A few new elements, some new functions with alchemy and optional use of guns. They've made it work both in dungeons and outside which is really cool. The square-walking fighting system has been enhanced a bit so that it isn't just enough to sidestep and hit over and over anymore. Some monsters will jump behind you, some will hit to the side if you sidestep them to their sword-arm side. Little things like that. Still, the main objective remains the same: don't ever get surrounded. Only negative point at all is that a few of the puzzles sometimes seem a bit too far out, so to speak. And they can be a bit annoying more than clever but it's very rare. Usually, you can work the solution out from clues and all together the balance between too difficult and difficult enough is accurately struck. The game ending seems to lead to the next game in the series and so it can feel a bit unfinished, perhaps. The final boss fight comes a bit out of nowhere, it feels, but it's actually a good boss fight. It's tough, sure, but it's not just about learning all the mechanics from replaying it 100 times, it's actually just about fighting well. So all in all, a very nice game. Into RPG? Buy it, simple as that.. Plays a lot like an old dungeon crawler, with many hard puzzles and nice graphics. Rather long and difficult, especially finding all the secrets. Doesn't have that much of a story, but it's ok and the story isn't the main drive of the game anyway. Class balancing, character progression and variance could have been a bit better, but I liked playing it to the end. It even has a dungeon editor and quite a few mods ... personally, I have had enough now. Until next time. :). Found the first one absolutely brilliant, and this has improved on that. Didn't try and do what many sequels do, it stayed true to what made it so popular the first time and enhanced and tweaked it. Fans of the first MUST play this and anyone looking for a dungeon crawler with RPG elements should give this a go.. I'm an old school gamer, but even nostalgia cannot save this from mediocrity. This is essentially a first person puzzle game, with garbage combat mixed in. The puzzles are decent, but the combat is atrocious and focused primarily on abusing mechanics that have nothing to do with traditional role playing mechanics. I cannot repeat enough that the combat is trivial and a complete waste of time. They should have just made this Myst-style and avoided combat altogether. It added nothing and in fact detracted from this. As a puzzle game it is more of an 8 and as an RPG it is a 1.. How can anyone score this under 9? I mean, it deserves 10 but maybe some people just don't get the old-style dungeon crawler movement. That people will be stunned by the music, graphics and atmosphere. I played LoG 1 and it was an excellent game. When I bought the second I thought I was too prepared to be challenged. I was wrong. This one improves everything in the franchise (I hope it will be a long franchise), even the puzzles. Yeah, this is mostly a first person puzzle game with RPG features and it excels in every aspect you can think of. Just stay away if you want an easy game, in LoG2, you must think in and out of the box. Otherwise, go buy it now. Thank me later. Note: I strongly recommend the use of the map (Dont check old-style mode), I did not use one in LoG1 but in this one I'm lost the whole time).. The creation of this game was a glorious accomplishment. The combat (though not perfect) is a massive improvement over the previous game, the puzzles are challenging and layered, and, as in the first game, the level design is phenomenal. Big, detailed, and gorgeous, the non-linear environments of the island are masterfully designed. This game excels at everything it attempts to be. Simply incredible.. Nice battle system, good puzzles, interesting world. If you like old-school RPG it is game for you. If you like challenge - try to do it in Insane Ironmode. It is worth it. ). I wanted to give it a 10, for this great sequel **** game but it has some issues : -Although combat has been improved so much, I found it annoying that unarmed combat doesn't exist anymore. -Some traits are wasted opportunities to make a good party, are they traps? (for example: Rage sounds good for a barbarian trait, but 4 dmg more or less doesn't give you any gameplay change). -Why can't I use a light weapon and a shield and have masteries to unlock on this type of combat ??? (you either go for heavy weapon and shield, dualwielding light weapons or heavy weapon + staff/orb) -I must agree that some puzzles and secrets are clueless-ly hard to find (use the net to solve them), but that doesn't change the fact that you are rewarded possitively when you go on a treasure hunt exploration. -Was interesting in Grimrock 1 to receive stats (dexterity, will power etc) in order to unlock abilities. Anyway Grimrock 1 was and still is a great game, Grimrock 2 is even better at everythig that was good with the first **** some developer choices are stupid.. Legend of Grimrock (short: LoG) is a fantasy themed action role-playing game from Finnish indie video game developer ""Almost Human"". The video game is a 3D grid-based, real-time dungeon crawler inspired by classic 1980s and 1990s action role-playing games Dungeon Master,[2] Eye of the Beholder and Ultima Underworld.[3] It was released on 11 April 2012 for Microsoft Windows, and later for Mac and Linux in December.. In short - Really enjoyed this game. I hope the next instalment (I really want there to be one) includes NPC, and friendlies. At times I had to sit and think of what some of the writings and signs meant but that says more of me than the game. I enjoyed seeing something I could not get but had to work out a way to get it, not so keen on backtracking. Extended views: It attempts to bring the Eye of the Beholder (EOB) series into modern day. However the EOB series had some additions that I was hoping LoG 2 would include. In LoG 1 we brought back to life Toorum, but in LoG2 we can not play as him or can we have chance encounters with any other NPC's. I recall during the EOB series that you at times may have found other adventurers and then you decided if they were to join or not. This was a great facet as you could alter your party during game play if you thought you made an error from the start. I like the many of disgruntles found this game really challenging, but that is exactly what I want. Leave the mindlessness to the DA series. If anything I would like more of an emphasis on the value of living rather than resurrecting. This game has too many resurrecting points and healing methods. The combat and spell casting took me a bit of getting use to but I beat those 'special attack' demons. The spell casting is unforgiving. I like the rune concept but I am so slow with my intricate mouse movements that I struggled to cast numerous spells with 2 magic users. Made me wish I had another fighter/missile-refer above about NPC. The skill points and ability trees seem a bit limiting compared to LOG1. With spell casters I found you had to bank some skills and wait till you found spell scrolls to know which branch to follow, and then not all spells were known until much later. Having to work out how to get to certain places and find hidden buttons, with the aid of clues added to the uniqueness. I tired easily of back tracking to find puzzles I didn't conquer, then I realised I could mark maps and alike and so partly my fault for not exploring my 'tools' properly. I wished I had used the interactive map from the beginning. The best magic users weapon is only available once the game has been completed.?. Not only does this game offer a good challenge with difficult puzzles and dangerous enemies, but it is also incredibly rewarding. This is the kind of game that is very possible to beat without looking up a walk-through. If you want it to be harder though, the game gives you that opportunity in many places. This is most certainly the best game that came out in 2014.. Avoid unless you suffer from 'old school dungeon crawler' nostalgia. Really wanted to like this. Spent 15 hours - including 3 restarts - before giving up. Time saving protip: the first plant boss fight is a good test. If that seems unreasonably difficult or frustrating, just give up. It doesn't get any better. If you love that and breeze through it, this is your type of game, go forth and conquer! Movement: ancient, clunky, limiting. Tap-tap-tap for hours on end. Combat: Clunky, unintuitive DOS keyboard style, yet no keybinds for attacks (right-click for your life on little squares in the bottom corner of the screen), long cooldowns even on basic attacks, challenging enemies, some enemies are very fast, all in real time; no pause function. ""2x2 step"" block based combat seems silly and old after a while. Puzzles: Unreasonably time consuming, good chance of getting stuck for hours retracing your steps all over the map with no discernible way forward. Starvation mechanic: irritating nuisance factor. You can of course mitigate all this with console cheats and internet walkthroughs, as I started doing near the end. But then, what's the point? Where’s the fun? The high aggregate review rating seems to reflect 1) nostalgia and 2) special allowance since it's an indy game, small dedicated dev team etc. Beautifully made game and a respectable achievement, absolutely. But time is precious and I wish I'd listened to the few negative reviews as well as the warnings in some of the more objective positive reviews.. Which of the following describe the best kind if RPG? 1) A game with a deep, immersive plot, filled with memorable and engaging NPCs to interact with, where your choices really matter and drive the story. Or.... 2) A game with no NPCs to interact with, a game with zero meaningful choices, and a game whose plot is told through abandoned journals...because there is no real **** tons and tons of puzzles. If #1 is your idea **** RPG, stay far away from this game (Go buy Wizardry 8). If the idea of having no choices, no other characters except the player's party who don't matter, and no plot at all (solve puzzles on a mostly-empty island), then Legend of Grimrock II is game of the year. Sad, really, since the game engine is great, and could be used as a vehicle for great story telling. Wait for bargain-bin sale ($5 maximum)...this is a puzzler, not an RPG.. Absolutely amazing game from the guys who brought you Legend of Grimrock. Although I thought there wouldn't be a sequel they managed to top themselves and bring out this jewel of an indie game. The puzzles are great, the combat has depth and is very dynamic, and overall clearing an area full of monsters and mysteries feels really rewarding. Easily worth sinking tens of hours into.. Brings back memories of the good old Eye of the Beholder series, which were one of my favorites back in the 1990s. If you played the old classics, this sure is something for you. Remember drawing maps on checkered paper to navigate the game, this part is now automated in game but it still brings back all the good memories. I also enjoyed playing Legend of Grimrock 1, this is the same just with more content. There is tons of stuff to explore and puzzles to solve and they are all really rewarding! This genre has its full support from me and I guess any OldSchool gamer out there. ;o). Let me start off by saying I've never played a tile-based, classic dungeon crawler such as this before. I do like some older games such as Baldur's Gate but have not played Wizardry or the like. I wasn't sure what to expect but I am blown away. I can't believe how good the game is. The puzzles are fun and mostly make sense (a few exceptions where I thought they were poorly done and too convoluted). The combat is challenging but not that hard on easy as long as you read about the classes before making your party (taking an alchemist makes the game much easier). The boss fights are so much fun, probably my favorite part of the game. The environments and atmosphere are impressive. The music is unbelievable, frankly couldn't believe how amazing the music was in this game (especially the last 2 boss fights and credits music). It sounds like Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars meets Pirates of the Caribbean. The character creation and customization is great. I can't WAIT to see what they have in store for Grimrock 3 (I'm assuming they'll make one!!) I'm hoping for even better environments, more balanced combat, and more classes.. I'll open by saying the first game, The Legend of Grimrock, was the surprise hit of 2012 for me. From that opening moment of taking my first steps in the dungeon that reminded me instantly of old school dungeon rpg's like 'Eye of the Beholder' and 'Lands of Lore', to working my way to 'discover' what was lurking at the bottom of the dungeon and thus unraveling the story, the game was enjoyable from start to finish. Unfortunately I can't say the same for The Legend of Grimrock II. Yes it is certainly a polished and improved version of the 1st game, and I did like the outdoor environments and greater diversity of locations and areas to explore, but the game was a letdown in so many ways. The story was pretty much non-existent. You only clue up to what is going on right at the end, there is very little early or mid-game to keep you moving. While I did enjoy solving 'some' of the puzzles, there were just too many. For me it got to the point that by the late 3rd of the game I was simply using Google to figure out how to solve the puzzles or complete an area to move forward in the game versus enjoying exploring and figuring it out all bit by bit. The final kicker for me was the end boss fight, the 'real' end, not the alternate end fight. I couldn't beat the main dude as I got to the point in the game where I did not have enough healing resources to complete the battle. I attempted it time and time again and used different tactics, in the end, and I'm a bit ashamed to say this, I had to use the console cheat to generate some healing crystals, enough to survive the battle and win. So it was not a good game ending experience for me. That said, I'm glad I played the game and cudos to the indie development team for a doing a great job. If you are curious about the Legend of Grimrock games and you have not played either of them, I’d definitely recommend playing the 1st game versus this one.. I love this game It's hard to believe you could improve in anyway on the first, but they did! the combat is so strategic and polished,now i'm just waiting for the third game. If you've just abandoned Dragon Age Inquisition and are feeling a bit sad that the age of PC based RPGs with all it's glorious subtlety appears to have passed and been replaced by mindless console based hack'n'slash games look no further. I couldn't believe how good this game was, it combines a","the game oozes with style, and the environments are awesome in their square-paper format . combat is hard but manageable with patience -- movement is essential in its (nearly) turn-based battles . exploration is nice, but the puzzles and riddles are the stars of the game ."
"1,092.Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","Pretty much the same fantastic experience as the previous title. The boss battle gimmick was fun and the new songs are still awesome.. Fun aesthetic as far as art, music, characters and cutscene choices, tells a coherent story that's great to play through again and again.. I honestly believe that Guitar Hero III was one of those few you had to be there to experience it moments when it comes to gaming in Xbox 360 days. Before Minecraft or Fortnite the two games you could pretty much expect to see when you went over to someones house during the 2007s was Wii sports or Guitar Hero 3. Of the games Guitar Hero 3 has the strongest set lists of any game in the franchise. Through the Fire and the Flames really did feel like the first impossible song that a bunch of people lied about beating on expert.. Perfect soundtrack, good graphics, awesome gameplay, a lot of content, goodcampaing and not to many bugs. Can we just talk about how **** cool guitar hero 3 is? Like you’re a musician in a cover band becoming so popular for covering peoples songs that eventually “real” artists start challenging you to guitar battles. And when you kick their butts they **** play an encore with you since you gained their respect. Then this eventually culminates with a **** guitar battle with the actual devil for clout. And what song do you play against the devil? None other than The Devil Went Down to Georgia. I don’t even think you were in Georgia at the time. And when you kick his ass, because you’re the best that’s ever been, you’re rewarded with an encore playing the most ridiculously impossible song to play properly with **** bowling gutters up so you can’t possibly fail. Might be the best game ever made tbh.. great game ! awesome soundtrack ! ive played this and the pc vers i think theyre basically the same. and also havent played many other gh games. but i think this one might be the best and also think im not alone it that statement. A very fun game, despite not being easy to master. In his time he was an excellent popularizer of rock / metal in the gaming world.. Its the best version running at 60 fps and having more songs the xbox 360 version it's the best ImI. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Guitar Hero 3 is an incredible game with thrilling songs that surely marked an entire generation.. GH3 unfortunately hasn't the same magical as previously two games, but it's still a fantastic game, defeating its predecessors bringing legends of guitar, new modes-of-game as battles and a more challenging difficulty. X360 for PS2 changes only graphics (the first being far better than the second).. This game wasn't even something now that seems so special but for me as a kid, it was more than that. It made me feel like someone that was an actual rockstar. I felt like I was actually the one playing those songs on a stage, I love that feeling of dreaming. Nothing can replace those memories of playing this game with my friends. Back when I was a kid, everyone was talking about this game and their scores on it. It was something that really brought people together and while I was never really good at it, I could at least have those memories with people. I've been playing this game since it came out and it's still my favourite Guitar Hero game, this game has the best playlist of any Guitar Hero game I've played.. Yes. this game is yes. much yes. very yes. i couldn't say yes more. yes yes yes. GUITAR HERO III is a bludgeon to the face with awesomeness. Grease up that fret board and sliding your fat fingers up and down that **** until they internally combust into flames. But in all seriousness, this game was a massive pinnacle to the guitar hero franchise with a major improved timing system and increased difficulty. if you're reading this review, you have probably hard of Raining Blood, One, Through the Fire and Flames... etc. After this game, the franchise plataeus with many other great games, but none compare to the one that defined the decade for rhythm gaming. I salute you Guitar Hero. One of the best rhythm games ever created. Extremely fun with an amazing setlist and some really cool cameos from Tom Morello and Slash. Also the first Guitar Hero game to have a setlist of fully licensed music, as opposed to the covers they used for Guitar Hero I and II.. The best rhythm game I have ever played. It has an awesome soundtrack, great Xbox360 graphics and awesome gameplay too. The challenge factor is fairly small for a rythm game, even on Expert, and, unless you're a beginner to the genre, you shouldn't have too much trouble, only with the very hardest songs. Really great game. I REALLY LOVE YOU, Activision, ANOTHER AWESOME TITLE!. My favorite game! Actually i've played so many times that now im really good at it, Fced 17 songs, The new engine is awesome and much easier then Guitar Hero 2 or bugged Guitar hero 1. The hyperspeed mode it's just awesome also, the songs in the game are very cool, Im doing videos on youtube about this game also, I love the game.. This game is just pure genius and brilliant at the same time. you can only really play the game once throught as nothing different happens besides then you can pick which songs you want to play. The game is awesome and really enjoyable but does get boring after a period of time. Dont play for hours constantly as it makes your eyes go strange and everything seems like its moving. Which to be honest i dont think is a good thing.. Story: 4 Characters: 7 Graphics: 7 Setting: 4 Multiplayer: 8 Soundtrack: 10 Audio: 10 Gameplay: 8 Re-Playability Value: 9 Fun Factor: 8 Score: 7.5/10 = B. Best Guitar Hero game ever period. This game has an unbelievable setlist that can satisfy anyone regardless of the type of music they listen to. When this game came out, I played for hours on end and not wanting to put the guitar controller down once. I beat the entire game on Easy and Medium in under a week. Amazing game.. A pretty good start to the Wii versions of the game. Not impressive or fantastic, but it's worth playing most definitely. This was slightly before the very first ROCK BAND was released and Guitar Hero started copying off all their ideas like crazy, so GUITAR HERO is most original at this point.. I do not know what to say, Its good but not quite what I hoped. Basically Guitar Hero doesn't live the hype as Rock Band . The game is great for people that are new to the music genre but wont you play something more creative . GH and GH2 were awesome good music, fun co-op , but this installment isn't the right one.. I've played this game from 2008 onwards, and have never looked back. The game is addictive to people like me who haven't played a real guitar and the song list for me is the best of the whole series. 10/10.. The feeling guitar hero gives after the first month or two is... disappointing! The amount of effort put into making this bunch of games is quite amazing and inspiring to musicians and electricians alike... but unfortunately.... the slang for this game would usually be, ""It's ok, i guess"" NO! it's dismal after 2 months so it's 4!","guitar hero 3 has the strongest set lists of any game in the franchise . through the fire and the flames really did feel like the first impossible song that a bunch of people lied about beating on expert . perfect soundtrack, good graphics, awesome gameplay, goodcampaing and not to many bugs ."
"1,093.Sly Cooper Collection","I’m sooooooooo happy for love playing sly cooper video game anything is a good long time I’ll give a review 10/10 and 4.89/5 we so far an hour long every night Maybe a new Sly remake. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus: 10/10 A very fun game. Good graphics for PS2 and attractive aesthetics. The gameplay is very good, it's simple, you only use three buttons and always the same ones, it's very addictive. It has a huge variety of missions, where it introduces arcade and shooter type mini-games, among others, which make the game very varied. Sly 2 Band of Thieves: 6/10 It is a good adventure and platform game, but much worse than the first in the series. It is a much longer game, but also much more repetitive. Missions are repeated over and over, items are collected over and over again. It has more main stages than Sly 1, but no stages, the missions consist of tasks you have to do in the same stage, so the stages end up boring you completely. It's a way for the people at Sony who made this game to save themselves level design work and bad side quests. Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves: 7/10 Sly 3 makes some improvements and fixes from the second game, but it also becomes bloated with an excessive number of characters and gameplay options that go along with them. Although this game offers many innovative ideas, not all of them are executed properly.. 3 of the best the best 3D Platformers the PS2 had to offer improved for the PS3 and a must own for any PS3 collection IMO. An excellent example of re-releasing PS2 classics for PS3. I played and loved every minute of it. Newbies will enjoy this while fans of the trilogy will love it even more. Hopefully Sony will re-release other PS2 classics in the future. The is a great game to play gravit are great for the time the gameplay is fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A decent PS2 remaster collection, this has 3 pretty good PS2 games in it. The only real issue is that these games were not made for Widescreen, or at least not how they handled it here and the first game's Mz. Ruby fight is very butchered, which is a real shame, but other than that, it's a fine collection overall. Plus it actually has some bonus features. Nothing too special, but still decent.. Fun game with good graphics. Need to be brought back to life on modern consoles and PC.. The only good Sly based game that Sanzaru worked on updated with better graphics and more responsive controls. Trophies are a nice addition. Hoping we’ll get a proper sequel to these games and that TIT is made non canon and that Sanzaru is never allowed to work on this series agajn after the disguise TIT was.. Game: The Sly Collection Genre: Adventure Platformer Developer: **** Punch Productions Publisher: Sony System: Playstation 3 (PS3) Year of Release: 2010 Length of Playthrough: 51 hours Total Score: 93/100 Value Score: 9.3/10 • Story: 10/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay:8/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 9/10 • Length: 10/10 • Replay Value: 9/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Comes packed with Sly 1, Sly 2 and Sly 3 per the Sly Cooper Collection or you can buy it separately +720p Resolution with 60 FPS Support +Trophy Support added Cons -Annoying mini games -3D Mode is available but makes the games run in 30 FPS -Can be frustrating at times such as some boss battles -Instructions on how to play certain aspects of game is not well told -Voiceovers sometimes hard to hear due to music. -Sly Racoon Unfortunately, the first game didn't age well enough: while the platforming is solid - but more linear - and overall the game plays very well, the large amount of minigames is kind of annoying as they are more than half of the game's length and they don't really last much to make it worth playing twice - heck the final stage is basically minigames. Most of the powerups are useless and you'll most likely use one or two like the time slow or the running ball. This is also the shortest of the 3 games, barely lasting 10 hours - I finished it in 6 - and with some hardcore time trials that will test your speed running skills. On top of that, some issues I had were some skills not performing right and one of my least favorite of all: Ms. Ruby fight is a total mess, as it removes the rhythmn and makes the music unreliable. And also makes it even harder. Definitely the least good of the trilogy: worth a shot if you're curious about the beginning and nothing else. Vote:6 -Sly 2 Band of Thieves The most beloved of the trilogy, this game is an objective improvement over the first game: better hub world with more exploration, more variation thanks to 3 characters to choose from, a better plot with some nice twists and overall, a great sequel to a legitimate good **** yet I hated this game the most. That's right, I'm the other kind of sly fan: while many love the second most due to its innovation and gameplay improvements, I couldn't stand it because it's filled with annoying missions that take too long, are often hard for the wrong reasons, and just don't feel fun to play. The writing is also terrible and that's something considering the first game was a simple revenge story: the trio seems to talk like they're not even friends, their speeches are distant and cold and even after chapter 3 - which I won't spoil, but something BIG happens to the team - it's still not enough to make them change. And the characters themselves...Urgh, how do I start? Sly is still the best of the trio in terms of movement, but he's so weak now as he needs 4 hits to defeat any enemy, while Murray can kill anyone in 2 hits but he obviously can't climb or pickpocket but he's still a good character. Bentley, on the other hand, **** major balls: his attack is even weaker, he can sleep with darts but requires aiming - which means standing still - and like Murray he can't pickpocket or **** what's he good for? Just to annoy you really and sadly he's the second most picked character in the game - especially in chapter 4. And the levels are totally hit and miss too: the major hub zones are good but some are complete garbage, like Prague 1 and the flying fortress, and mostly because of the high amount of enemies you can find and lack of hiding spots for stealth, making some zone a chore to deal with. The game also is very padded, with 8 chapters that really do drag a while considering you'll be facing the same boss twice (except for the first and last) and just makes it feel like a drag. Let me rephrase this: this is a good game, a great improvement over the first game, and definitely the game worth starting if you're curious about the trilogy. But to me this game is just unpolished and required more attention, as I couldn't enjoy it fully and once finished I was glad to, because I'll never -EVER- play this again. Great game, but definitely unpolished but for its time I think it was great so I'm probably being harsh on it. I'd say start with this game first. Vote: 8.5 -Sly 3 Honour among thieves The ""least"" loved of the trilogy for some reason, this game was a blast for me: not only the nitpicks and issues I had are gone, but the game overall is improved even further and just felt more smooth and fun to play! For instance, Sly gets his best upgrades rather quickly (by chapter 2 I believe) and by then he'll be a much more mobile character than before; Murray is nerfed but he can pickpocket too and much quicker too; Bentley is now a lot of fun, with triple jumps and all sorts of useful gadgets that makes him WAY better than in sly 2: i always looked forward to use him here, he's that much better. Levels are still varied and even the most annoying didn't cause me much cringe, mainly because they didn't take too long to finish and some of them were ACTUALLY fun to play! Not only that but the hub worlds are better laid out and overall better to explore - and no more bottle collecting either. Plus you can choose your levels now and you can even do challenges for more gameplay value, especially if you want to 100% it. The plot itself IS weaker than the second game BUT the dialogue is much better and I felt them be more relatable here: they actually talk like friends, they make jokes, they tease each other, and the ending is quite heartbreaking too...especially if you play the fourth game. IMO, this is the best of the three, but many might disagree. Vote:9.5 Total:8. (NOTE: This review will focus on ""The Sly Collection"" as a set and not on the overall quality of the games. If you would like to see my individual reviews of each game, head to my profile. Otherwise, enjoy the review!) After five years of dormancy, the ""Sly Cooper"" series returned in 2010 with an HD remaster collection handled by Sanzaru Games. Being that the ""Sly Cooper"" series is one of my personal favorites, I walked into this collection with high expectations. How did Sanzaru handle the porting? Pretty well I'd say! Off the bat, the ""Sly Cooper"" games still play fantastically, and the visual facelift really helps in bringing out the colorfulness of each game. Each title also runs at a smooth 60fps (unless you're one of the two people in the universe playing in 3D, in which case it's 30fps), and the game still runs ever so smoothly, never really noticeably dropping frames. And, as I mentioned, you can play the games in 3D which, as someone that owns a 3D TV, I can say looks pretty solid, even if it doesn't really add much to the overall experience other than some cool depth. Sure, the Move minigames are useless after one play and the games do have some bugs here and there, but all in all, ""The Sly Collection"" is a must-have regardless of whether or not you played it in the PS2 days. Go buy ""The Sly Collection,"" now. Final rating: 9 out of 10 ""Awesome"". The Sly Collection contains the 3 main games of the Sly Cooper series, originally released on PS2. Sly Cooper games are pure 3D platformers with stealth elements. You play as a master thief raccoon named Sly, who is aided by his gangmates Bentley the turtle and Murray the hippo, who provide the brains and brawn of the gang respectively, whereas Sly is the master of acrobatics and thievery. Obviously it's a comical take on old '60s heist movies, and even the games' music reflects that. Sly games began as more of a pure 3D platformer, and by the 2nd game evolved into a mission-based precursor to Assassin's Creed, so to speak, and there are even some Metal Gear Solid inspirations (for example the enemy patrols have cones of vision). Every level is wide open, populated by patroling guards, and loot is plentiful. You can either pickpocket enemies or steal precious treasure and bring it back in your hideout. From the 2nd game on you can also play as Bentley and Murray, which breaks the monotony of playing as just Sly. In the 3rd game you could even play as a guest star for one mission in each chapter, but the core gameplay didn't progress after the 2nd game. This stagnation later led to the series' demise, even if all 3 games are great. Or you could say that **** Punch perfected the gameplay from the 2nd game and had little room for improvements. The art style is awesome, because it is cel shaded, like the anime cartoons. On PS3 the games run at 60 fps and 720p resolution. You couldn't ask for more. Sadly Sly Cooper is regarded as a lesser series than its PS2 peers Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank, but I think Sly is the better of them all. It has a cute and great story, the music is perfect, gameplay is solid, and it has aged well. In comparison Ratchet and Clank games today look like archaic shooters, and Jak and Daxter games have bad controls. If you like 3D platformers, The Sly Collection is for you.. The Sly Collection is a remastered collection of the Sly Cooper series. The game was ported by Sanzaru Games, in collaboration with **** Punch and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game includes all three original games remastered in high definition as well as support for 3D and trophies. + One of the Best 3D Plataforms Game Series. This brought back so much nostalgia. The HD graphics make these games look better than ever. However I did see some minor issues such as aspect ratio in the binucucom and a lot more glitches than I remembered, but nothing that hinders the Gameplay. This is probably due to the fact that its imported into the PS3's Hardware, but like I said, Still enjoyed these wonderful Classics and the fact that there is only 1 disc.. The Sly Collection is really fun. The first game looks a bit old and the game-play isn't the best, but the other two games are simply AMAZING! I recommend this to everyone :). Sly 2 is the best out of the 3 in the trilogy so I recommend playing the 2nd one first, and then the 3rd one, and the first one. First one was boring and the worlds were fairly small and linear. The only thing that brought me back to the first one was the clue bottles to get platinum. But other than that the other 2 are great!. I absolutely love these games in every essence of the word. If you are looking for an all around great game experience, you have come to the right place. I have beaten the entire series around 8 times over and is THE game of my childhood. Become stealthy Sly Cooper, who ventures his way through the world looking for the missing pieces of his family's thieving instruction manual. Unlocking countless new moves, foiling the enemy's plans, I can never run out of my eternal love for this game.. During the PS2 era, I had played heavyweights like Jak and Ratchet & Clank whereas I had never heard much about Sly Cooper. I don’t know why because Sly Cooper is just as good if not better than those. This game shows exactly what many games today are missing today, just simple fun. First, the games only fatal flaw are the numerous bugs and glitches in the game are unforgivable and can make the game very frustrating. It kills me to do it, but they are so unforgivable that I had to take off a point. These games don't feel aged at all. The writing can be downright hilarious (although sometimes cheesy), but it all adds to the light-hearted Saturday morning cartoon feel the series has. The environments are fantastic. The games are just fun. I agree with the sentiment that the second was far superior. It was laid back, more of a sandbox play style, had by far the best dialogue, and wasn't nearly as frustrating. The third is significantly more varied, but was often frustrating because of the bugs and found the difficulty much harder than it should have been. Overall, the value is absolutely superb and I recommend this game to everyone.. I never got around to picking up a sly game on PS2 so I decided to give it a try with this collection. The games surprised me with how much fun they were. Sly 1 starts it all when the thevious racconis is stolen sly and his gang must retrieve its pages. In this you only really play as sly (the murray and bentley minigames don't count) and it is very repetitive, (think assassin's creed 1 repetitive). It's you move to an area do some challenges defeat the boss and move on so its kind of boring like that. Sly 2 is much more interesting with a better story and the ability to play as murray and bentley properly, of course sly still has the lion's share of play time but that's fine because he's fun to use and a pretty cool character. Sly 3 is definately the best with more playable characters and a new story which questions the friendship of sly's gang as well as going into a bit of sly's family history. The gameplay is good in all 3 games and you can definately have some fun here.. all i can say is amazing i loved these 3 games on the PS2 and now i can play them on the PS3 these 3 games are by far my favorite games of all time and i think that anyone who has never played these games should go pick it up. A very nice collection of platformers I missed out on during the PS2 era. You're getting hours and hours of fantastic stealth- platformer hybrid. Only real problem I cna see with this game is that sly 2 drags on a little bit too long and then tackling sly 3, which is even longer is kinda overload. But if you play the games taking breaks in between each of the installments you will find some of the most underrated games ever!. Im so glad that they brought the cooper series to the PS3. it was the best descion that i made to get it play it and really enjoyed it and i think a person will enjoy it. i promise you that. One of ps2's greatest platformers in glorious HD! What more could you ask for?. This is one of the best HD trilogies i'd ever bought on the PS3 the graphics are better and less blurry sometimes although there are some bugs and glicthes but still the best.. All three games look beautiful in 720p. Anyone who owns a PS3 and loves platformers should pick this up. The only real negative thing is that all the games are way too easy,especially the first game beat the first day I bought it. Nevertheless you should buy this collection.. Nostalgia rush! everything is perfect except 2 things which is why I give it a 8/10. 1. The trophies are way too easy it took me less than a week to unlock every single trophy for sly 1,2,3 and the minigames. 2. In one boss battle in sly 1 the music wasn't synced and the music is a big part since that battle is all about freaking rythm so I had to turn off the music to not get distracted. Otherwise great! everything is in place and like on ps2 but with a higher resolution.. All 3 Sly Games. This is about 30 hours of gameplay and one of the best series's ever in gaming. Characters and stunning, gameplay is stunning. What more could you want? That's 3 retro and awesome games for the price of one. You'd be mad not to buy this!. best series ever. Hands down. Very fun gameplay, likeable characters, etc. Whats not to love? Good graphics too. The people who rated it bad, cant get past the boss fights LOL!!!!. The Sly Trilogy This game is a true classic from back in the days. This re-release in HD is fun, you get three games for the price of one so it is good value for money. The graphics is okay and the game play is decent. It is in a comic book style and it is working for this game. You get Sly one, two and three in this hd collection and when you play the games from 1-3 its really fun to see how the game play mechanics, graphics and the overall package get better and better. This game is a fun trip back in time to when hd televisions were unheard of. This collection is worth your money if you want a fun, comic book styled adventure sneak fight game. Two thumbs up for this HD classic collection.. the first game 6/10 the second game 3/10 the third i did not play this game i found just to be one big annoyance the first one was alright but you die with one hit so you have to go through each place perfectly and the boss battles dont really require skill it just takes a couple tries before you memorize the pattern they attack in and exploit it as well the button response in the 1st game is terrible i found myself dying way too often because sly did not want to grab onto a hook or land on the tip of an icicle when i push the circle button. the 1st game is also pretty easy to get 100% in it just takes time to collect all the clue bottles. now for the second game they give you an actual health bar instead of dying and having to start over when you get hit which was a plus but the level design was so bad that i just gave up half way through because it was justway too hard to find way around to my mission objectives as well. the 3rd game i did not even attempt at because of how bad the 2nd one was so stay away from this game you can thank me for all the frustration im saving you from and possibly saving your controllers as well. If you played the Sly Cooper trilogy games too late on the PS2 (or haven't played the games at all), then think again when you can purchase all three Sly Cooper games in one HD bundle. This is a platforming trilogy providing with a unique art direction, charming characters and the use of stealth and shimmies in your gameplay. Sly 1 contains an old-school platform appeal if you're into that kind of style, but Sly 2 and Sly 3 improves the game with open world levels, compelling storytelling and more replay value to the gameplay. The Sly Collection would have reached a perfect 10 if it weren't for those silly PS Move mini-games and some of the non responsive controls in Sly 1. Other than those nitpicks, it is a worthy collection for the PS3. Kids who aren't allowed to play the Mature stealth games yet like Metal Gear Solid for example, Sly Cooper is one series they can start off with.. I was hugely excited about this game until I played for about 10 minutes and after that it was just a chore. Sly shouldn't even be me mentioned in the same sentence as ratchet or jax-it's just not a fun game to play.. Easily a must-own. Ignore the trolls, my game has not frozen. HD makes the games look a lot better, it is especially noticable in Sly 3. Unfortunately, the Sly 1 character models are still not up to date. The mini-games can be fun, but we didn't get this to play the minigames, did we? We got it to play the actual games. A charming storyline, fantastic dialogue, memerable character, lovely cel-shaded graphics and, ofcourse, the gameplay to match. A must-own.. Great series that I loved from the PS2 days as a kid. I loved picking these games back up again after a few years and with three great games together, it's a definite try for anyone.. This collection of games is incredibly over-rated, aggravating, and a chore to play though. I played and completed all 3 games and discovered that more often than not I was simply playing them just to get through them. Each game starts off strong, but progressively gets more and more frustrating as it throws cheap and repetitive gameplay elements at you. In the first game the main frustration came in the form of dying from only one hit, and having nearly everything be able to kill you (falling, water, enemies). There's also the issue of one of the bosses (Ruby) being a bit glitched and more difficult to kill than she should be. The second game starts out strong, but quickly suffers from each new area being essentially exactly like the previous area with similar goals. It gets old and boring rather quickly. A glitch also exists which makes jumping to hooks extremely difficult (at least it did in my version -- Sly very rarely would ever attach to hooks, which often resulted in frustrating deaths). The third game is basically 60% mini-games, most of which are bland and will have you restarting them repeatedly. It is also the most glitchy of the games. During my play-through it froze at least 5-7 times, requiring a restart. Overall, I found all the games to be a test of patience. Aside from nostalgia, I don't really understand why anyone would really enjoy these games.. Brought back the series that i loved with all the fun and freedom that could be desired. The graphic improvement was hard to see at first, but you can tell that there is a difference. Worth the purchase, tons of fun, 3 total games, and short look at things to come.. Having never played a Sly game before I was thoroughly impressed. A great story throughout the trilogy, and although the gameplay varies little game to game it never feels boring. You get a good amount of gameplay time for the cheap asking price and is easy for me to recommend. The playstation move mini-games however are a stupid gimmick that will last about 45 second and plague your trophy list forever, but its still not enough to damage my opinion of these 3 great games. I had never played any of the sly games until I was able to get my hands on the sly collection and I can say aside from sly mini games which seem like were strung together within minutes, the sly collection is very solid and fun platforming title. Sly collection is definitely one to own or at least try.. The Sly Cooper games are great, even if the ending to Sly 3 is cliche. However, at least Sly 4 will show why this ending is good. As for the rest of the game, the visuals have been noticeable upgraded, the charm of the series is still here and added trophy support is nice. Overall, if you like Sly Cooper but don't have all of the games or you missed the thief the first time around, this package is a must own.. One of the most underrated series on the ps2 belongs to sly and his buddies murray and bentley. While most gamers praised and hyped ratchet and clank and jak series( which are great series), they forgot about sly. The truth is that the sly games are some of the best platforming games of the generation, if not of all time. The concept is unique enough to make this series alot more special and intriguing then others and stand on it's own. Playing as a thief is always fun, the gameplay is more about stealth then action, although there are some intense action sequences later on as the story progresses. The plot and dialog are abit immature and ridiculous but the characters personality( especially the voice acting) and the terrific gameplay make up for that. The graphics are fantastic, even to this day, and they fit perfectly to the game's atmosphere. The music style in the game is also worth a mention because it's so unique. You will hear blues and jazz and sometimes ever techno and so on. The game has some memorable tunes which will stay in your head for a long time. The first sly game had some problems but it was really fun. It is linear compared to the next sequals but it's story is much better and the dialogue simpler and less childish. sly 2 is considered as the masterpiece of the 3 and indeed it has many improvments in gameplay over the first. The third is also fantastic and is very similar to the second in it's style. These games have much to offer so it's really hard to mention the content, you'l have to see that for yourself. If you like platform games and never played the sly games then it's about time you do.. An excellent example of re-releasing PS2 classics for PS3. I played and loved every minute of it. Newbies will enjoy this while fans of the trilogy will love it even more. Hopefully Sony will re-release other PS2 classics in the future.. Very enjoyable, have been playing with family all weekend. A game that is as fun to watch as it is to play. Plus it is a game that the entire family enjoys. If you are looking for a family friendly game on PS3 this is one of the best. Games are all 16 X 9 and HD. They feel and play like the originals, with said enhancements. We have spend the most time on Sly 1 as we are playing them in order. Finally games for the family that do not completely blow on PS3! Not sure about the move support, seems like these are just mini games that you need to earn. Kind of annoying that you need to sit through move logos even if you do not have a move. But games themselves are great!. One thing that should be said is that you dont get this game for its amazing story, or its fantastic gameplay, because sly 1 and 3 arnt that great, while sly 2 is the masterpiece of this collection. You get this game because you remember playing the PS2 version of these games and really want to feel that again. Sly is a basic action game, while it does have a great story, the level design and the combat is nothing special. I will note that the final boss of this game is easily one of my favorite villains. Sly 2 is the real treat, great story+great combat+great characters make this one of the best games iv ever played, and iv played alot of games. Thats saying alot that a game that came out in 2004 can be that good still after all these years. Finally you get Sly 3, which it really isnt a bad game but i feel that following up a near perfect game like its predecessor, it should have been better. The real tragedy is that they decided to change most the voice cast for 3, which really ruins the experience when you built up those characters so well in the last game. After your done with those the game gives you mini games, but they dont have any use at all. They are cheap, quickly made games that are used to slap on the move sticker on the package. The final note i should mention is that trophy hunters rejoice, this collection seperates the three games and mini games as full trophy packs, meaning you can get three platinum's in one collection, and they arn't that hard to get. The end result is a game that brings back memories and the satisfying ding of a new trophy. This is truly worth the $40 price tag, and deffinetly worth a rent if you dont want to buy it.. Sly Cooper was my favorite video game series when I was 10 years old until it was stolen when I was 14, I'm 18 and I still love these games. When I heard about this coming out, I ran to the video game store and got it. All I can say is, it's still my favorite games. The story is still perfect, the controls are still smooth, and the game is still fun. The only difference is the graphics are HD and little better than the PS2, and its all 3 games in 1 disk. I love this game, and I think people my age would like to replay the memories, and children will absolutely play this game again and again.. though i am a big fan of the sly series, i was dissappointed by the new bugs, minigames and bad lighting and graphic glitches. now on to positive stuff i believe if you liked the sly games this is a must buy but dont be surprised by a few bugs in the game, sly 1 was a great ride although sometimes the buttons dont respond right away, sly 2 suffers from graphical bugs such as shadows, lights and very stupid AI, but was a ton of fun to play, sly 3 was amazing to look at without 3d and didnt have any obvious bugs, you also get 4 move based minigames that can be played with a controller but arent really worth it you should just buy this game without any move controller but if you already have a move than go for it. along with 3 classic ps2 titles you get trophy support, hd quality, 3d, and move compatible features as well along with a surprise for unlocking all 3 platinum trophies. The Sly Collection is another great reason to own a ps3.. The sly Collection is a bad remake, old game play, bad stories, easy, bored, **** very expensive now, Â¡2002! too old for this gen, i need new ip, no old ip. Â¿Mini games? bah. If any series defined true platforming and stealth on the ps2, it was the Sly series. I've spent lots of great time exploring these games and taking in their great level design. I love these great renditions of the graphics and it makes them look better than most 360 games. This is the true reason **** Punch is so great and got the courage to make another landmark title, Infamous. This is a great way to spend time for Infamous 2 to come out. I say: if you played them on ps2 and want to see them again, GO BUY IT NOW! If you haven't been able to play it last generation, this is the best way to play the series in gold.. The three games on offer make for some of the best platforming available on the PS2, with jaw-dropping level design and variety. Each game has it's own stand-out moments: the special moves from Sly 1, the levels from Sly 2, and the variety and depth of Sly 3. With the added bonus of trophies, 3D and obviously HD, this Collection becomes one of the most absorbing and long games of PS3. If you strive to complete everything and have fun, you could easily sink 50+ hours into this, and the memories will likely still be as amazing in five years time, as they are now.. The Sly collection isa great game, improved graphics, great gameplay, wonderfull stories, its the perfect gift to anyine who owns a playstation 3. However, there is one weak link, in Sly 1 the cutscenes still use the old charachter model, unlike in the gameplay, it is also in my opinion, the worst in an exceptional serise. the mini games are fun and Sly 2+3 are wonderful to play, especially Sly 2. and even if I don't have a 3D tv, I can tell you this game deserves your hard earned ",i’m sooooooooo happy for love playing sly cooper video game anything is a good long time I’ll give a review 10/10 and 4.89/5 we so far an hour long every night Maybe a new Sly remake .
"1,094.Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars","It's not a conventional console choice for a fighter, but that's one of the many unique qualities about the exceptionally obscure Tatsunoko vs. Capcom -- you know, besides the cast of characters, many of which non-Japanese audiences won't find any familiarity with, and its visually colorful, stunning, and seizure inducing hyper combos, some of the best in the vs. series. It's an essential for anyone collecting for their Wii and Wii U collection, for simply being the odd one out of the bunch. Pros: A truly successful successor to the Capcom vs. series that's in its own league; the cast of characters, specifically Tatsunoko, are whacky, weird, and lovable all at once; excellent soundtrack; insane hyper combos. Cons: The Wii remote controls are a challenge in their own right; single-player value and online play don't support replay value; if the unconventional console choice and virtually unknown-outside-Japan Tatsunoko characters don't turn off casuals, the lack of English voiceovers might.. fun, easy to get into dificult to master street fighter alike arcade fighter with really nice visuals and tight controls, onpar with street fighter 4, but 20 or so arent very much and some characters are unknown or too weird...still Great. The shallow fighting game will be enjoyed by hardcore fans, but anyone else will be mystified by its sheer lackluster gameplay. There isn't enough content for a $40 pricetag, especially in the terms of characters. There is are three or so standard modes of ""story"" (there really isn't any, if you're wondering), arcade, and versus. They're all more or less decent, but get into the the gameplay and problems arise. Firstly, the two character swap out of place and useless. It's actually reallllly annoying, and can drag down any good match. The backdrops are poorly done and uncreative, just like the rest of the game. It's still fun... kinda... but the constant sticky controls, icky graphics, and lack of desirable content just makes it another mediocre installment in the capcom fighting franchise.. Best fighting game on the Wii. GRAPHICS: clean, fast, amazing- 10/10. ACTION: Fights are fasted paced and unpredictable, the variety of characters is great, and the mini-games are awesome. Basically everything you could want out of a fighter- 10/10. MECHANICS: The controls (Classic Pro) are easy to learn unlike some other fighting games. Special moves are easy to learn and each character has their own style- 10/10. EXTRAS: Having half a cast of relatively unknown characters makes the game BETTER in my opinion. No preconceived notions about who should be good, better than X, or whatever and no nerd rage when Magneto doesn't instantly (instantly) kill Iron Man. Having what are essentially blank slates gives the player (or maybe just me) the chance to make up their own stories for the characters, like how Tekkaman is fighting for gay robot marriage- 10/10.. No fighting game is ever perfect. But there are a handful of fighting games that are near perfect. Tatsunoko vs Capcom (TvC) is one of them. There are only a few minor problems, the main one is that not many people know or even heard about Tatsunoko, therefore some of the characters will be brand new to the gamer. Secondly, like nearly all fighting games, there isn't much of a story. Well for the majority of this game, it is excellent. The graphics are good (for Wii), the fighting is intense and very addictive, the hyper specials are awesome and multiplayer is just great. If you are a die-hard fighting game expert or you're still a rookie this game would fit perfectly into your Wii games collection.","it's an essential for anyone collecting for their Wii and Wii U collection . the cast of characters, specifically Tatsunoko, are whacky, weird, and lovable all at once . there isn't enough content for a $40 pricetag, especially in terms of characters ."
"1,095.Sam & Max Episode 205: What's New, Beelzebub?","An excellent finale to the second season! Loads of great and memorable jokes/moments. Fantastic depiction of Hell in a modern environment. and censorship lol that was the best part of tha game. Although a bit dated by today's standards, this game still holds up super well in my eyes and is the best entry in the Sam & Max Telltale Games series.. Once again, solid conclusion to the Season, which seems longer than Season 1 (although, I might be mistaking). Full of surprises, Season 2 arches nicely, uniting partially revealed main story and subplots of other episodes. Characters are more developed, voice acting is superb, jokes witty and pleasant, and Max – well – is Max! ENJOY!","this is the best entry in the Sam & Max Telltale games series . full of surprises, Season 2 arches nicely, uniting partially revealed main story . voice acting is superb, jokes witty and pleasant ."
"1,096.Daxter","One of the greatest PSP games ever made. It's simplicity makes it easily more enjoyable than the sequels. Music is decent. Characters are boring.. Daxter is a game that was good for the time it came out but it does not hold up like other psp games. It is just a repetitive collectathon platformer, but it is not the worst I did not really enjoy it but if you are curious play it.. this game is a freaking masterpieceee!!!!!!!!! This game is the worlds best created game ever and is a must play game for anyone that plays games if you havent played daxter then ur a fake gamer that doesnt take anything seriously thats all i can say.. The story plays out like a bad fan fiction, and combat just ends up being mindless button mashing, but the Platforming is still good despite how hindered it is by the PSP’s design. But in the end, Daxter still delivers something to those that are really wanted to know what he was up to during that 2 year break between Jak and Daxter and Jak II. It’s not a bad game, but it certainly isn’t a good one either.. One of the greatest handheld games I've ever played, Daxter is a must-own game for the PSP. It offers memorable characters, fantastic graphics, exceptional voice acting, and an abundance of cool power-ups, all wrapped up in a decent story.. The best exclusive the psp has to offer. An underrated gem among Sony’s platformer games and a nice prequel to jak 2.. For a PSP game this is really good. Not as GOATed as the Jak games on PS2, but pretty solid for what it is.. This game is okay, not bad but also not good. Sure the graphic and the visual artstyle is great even today. Daxter is a cool, crazy character and carries the humor alone in the game, which works well. The abilities are typical for a plattformer. Nothing new or special, just good working standard moves you know from other 3D-Plattformers. It could be a solid 8/10, if there weren't some heavier issues. First, the control is not 100% accurate and feels a bit clunky, which you will recognize painfully later in the game and in the final boss fight. The camera angle is sometimes focusing in the wrong direction and is not easy to handle with the shoulder buttons. Than there are some framedrops, especially when there are multiple projectiles, which again you will painfully recognize during the final boss fight. At least there are the vehicles and some quick-time minigames to mix a bit of variety to the good 3D-plattforming standard. The little missions with the vehicles are fun, the quick-time minigames unfortunately not. They feel annoying and their only purpose is to stretch the playtime a little bit. In total it is simply an average 3D-Plattformer with high-quality visuals at the time, an artstyle that even looks good today and a cool, refreshing character. However technical issues like poor camera control, annoying frame drops and a not 100 percent accurate movement holds this game back.. Very nice game for the psp. It was a game that fully leverage the possibilities of that console. Nice plot. One of my favorite video game characters deserved this title, fun and playable 10/10. Passed the game on psp, I liked the game as a whole, it was a bit boring towards the end due to small puzzles, you can’t control the camera even in the fight with the bosses, it really bothered me, but I liked the game, it took a couple of days. I couldn’t get past the part with the llillypad platforms but who cares it’s still a good game. One of the best 3D platformers honestly ever, on any system, fun combat and some of the greatest level design around, plus the dream sequences are hilarious.. The great memories playing this game on my PSP. One of my very actual ""console"" like game. The story was so engaging with lovable characters. Each level felt unique and were so fun. It had a great variety of gameplay features and puzzles to feel fresh. Overall, this is an amazing game and had unforgettable memories with this game. This game was definitely way ahead of its time.. I think this could be the best Jak game. Right here you can play without strafe and don't have fire in your ass. Daxter isn't annoying, levels are good, music is good. My first Jak game. I really enjoyed it in 2010-2015, but it still playable in 2021.. First I was a bit sceptic but the game turned out to be very enjoyable. Somehwat simple mechanics and low amount of a bit frustrating moments but the game itself is a lot of fun. Had a great but short time with it. Would definetly recommend it for someone that wants an easy to pick up game for some chill fun every now and then.. A great childhood game, I still remember how I killed bugs and flew in the final on a plane. For me, the final as a child was difficult. It's good. In general, playing music and the environment leaves warm feelings and memories, returning to feel a pleasant taste of nostalgia.. I played nearly all of the Jak and Daxter games and i really love them, same goes with Daxter for PSP! Its an (as usual for a Jak and Daxter game) really funny game with cool characters and an unique art style that stays in mind. Its a nice addition to the Jak and Daxter series and in my opinion a must have for everyone who has a PSP!. Daxter a spinoff not made by Naughty Dog is pretty amazing. Daxter still got the moves and the groove to attract pretty women or captivate those that want to help him on rescuing his best friend while being captive by Haven City militia before the events of Jak 2.. Amazing game veey good story and so much fun best psp platform game very good game. Daxter is a platform video game, it is the only game in the series featuring Daxter as the main protagonist. The game was developed by Ready At Dawn studios and produced by Naughty Dog and published by Sony. + Fun + Variety Gameplay + Daxter Dreams - Same Enemies Types. Memorable characters,great graphics,awesome voice acting,tons of cool powerups and a decent story make daxter a must own game for the PSP. It is truly one of the greatest handheld games ive ever played.. Fun and addicting. This game is has among the highest replay values I've ever seen. You never grow tired ow this game. If you're on the go, you need to own a PsP with Daxter. It's not a choice, it's an obligation.. Lovely graphics, memorable characters, intriguing level designs, laugh out loud humor, and the fact it is all portable. Simply put, if you own a PSP, you SHOULD have Daxter. I've beat this game twice and i still enjoy playing such a fun game you get to collect these eggs to unlock stuff and the soundtrack sounds awesome especially when your going to the baron's palace, fish cannery and the final boss. The best psp game ive played besides gta vice city stories. Back in 2006 I picked this game up for my psp (without having ever played a Jak & Daxter game if you can believe that), and I really enjoyed it despite that I was confused about the story here and there. It's a decent size game for the psp, around 17 or 18 levels and more importantly, it's a fun, solid platformer. I would recommend it even to vita owners, it's only 10 bucks on psn.. I only paid around $15 Australian for this, and I certainly got my money's worth. The story and humour aren't stellar, but the visuals and gameplay are the big achievements and more than make up for the other shortcomings. Quite a bit of fun, but it's unlikely to resonate with you afterwards, nor is there any replay value.. I couldn't get into this game. For me it is kind of flat.. Daxter is a great PSP adventure that nicely compliments the Jak and Daxter series. Exciting gameplay is coupled with a fun campaign and although aspects such as the open world and game length are sized down for a portable device, the heart that characterized the series remains intact.. This was quite an enjoyable game with loads of fun. Great platforming. Superb graphics for a psp game. However, I was kinda confused by the plot (although that's probably because I never got Jak 2).","the story plays out like a bad fan fiction, and combat just ends up mindless button mashing, but the Platforming is still good despite how hindered it is by the PSP’s design . for a PSP game this is really good. Not as GOATed as the jak games on PS2, but pretty solid for what it is ."
"1,097.Dragon Age: Inquisition","Neat world. It's a shame you have to torture yourself with the God-awful gameplay to experience it.. It’s lovely that spiteful people spend time here rather than out in the real world where only 0.6% of the population is transgender. There are more Cubans in the U.S. than trans people. The game was a blast, played thru it twice. Love the story, though once again making the DLC too important is a bad idea. Still, not here to review the DLC. The combat works, though not great. You’re really here for the story and the relationships and those for obvious reasons won this game a few GOTY awards.. Absolutely the worst instalment in the series. At least so I thought until veil guard came out. Dragon Age is dead.. Great story and characters but the gameplay with the boring yet beautiful open worlds was at times a trudge. They Killed one of the interested game verse. nothing new, no choices and a lot oft of bad tolerance.. Oh, Inquisition. Some people hate you, some love you. You hold a very very special place in my heart. With your amazing characters and interesting story and absolutely AMAZING music, you truly are a memorable and repayable game for me. (Especially after the 4th installment that shall not be named). This game has a story and soundtrack that sticks with you. You play a lot of games and only a few stay on your mind. Ofc there are a few grind and fetch missions. I definitely recommend this game.. i love this game so much, i cant choose if this one or the original one is my favorite,Ihave sunk hundreds of hours into both,the cutceans and choices plus the keep. which allows for so manny new and unique play throughs makes this one of my all time favorite games even more then skyrim or dragons doga.. Dragon Age Inquisition was my introduction to the DA series. I played it blind, not knowing anything about the series and was able to have a great time, but then I realized how much story I was missing and ended up playing Origins and 2 as well. The world was beautiful, the story engrossing, and the characters are some of my favorite in fiction ever. Inquisition is probably my favorite in the series just because I played it first, but it definitely has its issues, with the war table cooldowns and the fetch quests being the biggest ones.Fortunately I was able to mod out the war table cooldowns, so my experience the second/third/fourth time through the game was much faster.. Thiswas the first game I played tbat really drove home how much wokeness abd dei and ruin a game. I live both he previos DA games but by the end I loathed **** much cringe feminism, hirible ugly female characters, unlikable soyed male characters.. Dragon age inquisition is probably one of the most boring game i've ever played, except there the story therewas nothing in the game tha was motiviting me to finish it. The gameplay is awfully repetitive and most of the quest (main and secondary) are equally. The game is also much longer than it should.. An ok game, story is worse than 1 and 2. But gameplay is better than two. Too much boring fetch and kill quests to make the game longer, but not better. a disappointment in all respects, both as Dragon Age and as a game in itself. Bioware's usual attempt to try to follow the various current trends has led it to make a mixture that satisfies no one and has no personality. the gameplay is a bad hybrid. the maps huge and boring. of the story, just a couple of missions and the ending (which is sold separately) are good. the characters are bad. this game has nothing to offer, only boredom.. Sorry ------- ------------ --------------- ----------------- ----------- ------------------. Game was decent but its not as good as previous games..what hurted it the most was the open world fetch quests system..however it has its good moments... This is an all-around decent game. While I enjoyed playing it, I found it overstayed its welcome and has very little replayability for me. It took me about 90~ hours to complete with the three content DLCs, doing most of the side quests early on, giving up on doing them all roughly 2/3rds of the way through, and gave up on the Rifts entirely after the main story was done. For context, this is my first experience with a Dragon Age title, so I can't compare it to its predecessors. -The Good- - In my opinion, the graphics hold up pretty well for a decade-old game. - I enjoyed the story, It made up for all the negatives I'll list later. - Decisions matter to a degree, though a lot of it is flavour text. - Player Character feels meaningfully connected to the world, you don't just feel like an observer. - Many companions have fleshed out, meaningful stories. I cared about them to a degree, and most of them are well-written, even if they frequently annoy me (Sera). - Pretty good customisation in the character creator (except the hair, way too many of them are just bald with varying degrees of stubble) - Story progression feels earned. - High-intensity moments during the main quest (for the main story at least) feel high intensity, I contribute this largely to the music. - Music, particularly by the bard in Skyhold is nice and immersive. - Occasionally acknowledges past choices/dialogue and feels immersive even if its often flavour text. - I liked rebuilding Skyhold. -The Bad/Not So Good- - Movement feels heavy, clunky, bad. - Movement is especially bad in combat, feels like wading through sand. - In general, I do not like combat. I set it to as easy as possible just so I could be done with it faster and it still took forever. By late game with the build I chose (Knight Enchanter), I could just sit there holding down the button I bound to my sword (I play on controller) and do nothing else, maybe occasionally cast barriar or some other spell. - Some companion AI's are really bad. Particularlly Dorian, who seems to be under the impression he is a melee fighter, and Ironbull is also not great. - Glitches in companion AI (like just not moving. Or running away. Or just suddenly having no HP) were common. All around Companion AI is frequently hot garbage. - Almost egregiously repetitive, especially fade rifts. - Too many boss enemies have the constantly regaining guard gimmick. You bring down their health too much and they just spring up a ton of guard. It's demoralising and irritating when the combat isn't very entertaining to start with. - Imshael (idk it was on my cons list). - Too stretched out with filler. - Vital story content for the follow-up game is locked behind paid DLC (I got everything for free but it's still a weird move) - Mounts don't seem to be much faster than running, and your companions just disappear when on one so no companion banter. - Running animation, at least for female PC is comically dainty and light. - Employs the cheap auto-damage-when-you-go-somwhere-we-don't-want-you-to-go gimmick. Even if realistically, I should be able to survive that drop/jump, or standing in 2 feet of water. - Can get stuck in death/revive loops in some cases, where you can't potion or move before the enemy knocks a character down again. - Tactical camera can be jank. - Clearly not built for parkour but occasionally tries to implement it (and fails) - Actions don't really cancel when you tell a character to do something else. So it's near impossible to move a controlled character out of the way of an attack. - Ideal level not stated for non-main quests. - if climbing a ladder and someone slides down, you get LAUNCHED. - collection filler. - Invisible barriers at most random moments. - Areas with multiple geographical levels **** to navigate (Forbidden Oasis). - Leads a huge, powerful group with connections everywhere, still doing fetch quests. Conclusion: Liked the story, disliked multiple mechanics, get it on sale.. A chapter with great merits but also some flaws that can alienate some players. The writing is complex and well done, the game world is fascinating, but the progress is very slow.. Boring and not interesting. It looks like a kid’s cartoon but for adult, not dark fantasy - candy fantasy with no chooses. I enjoyed Inquisition. Not as much as Origins, but it's a rather nice game, with good interactions between the characters and a world that feels well written. It has both serious and very funny moments that kept me playing and the Combat system, with a mix of action and strategy, felt nice and I enjoyed it. Armors felt a bit too ""shiny"", as if they were made of translucid plastic, and I really did not like the villain, which is the main reason I'm giving it a 7, as it felt a bit shallow and lacking depth in both personality and motivation. The final fight was also a pretty big disappointment. I'll also say that it felt as if the game had a bit too many collectibles to find.. As a huge fan of Bioware since the beginning, this is by far one of the worst ever made. The combat is clunky and boring. The story is terrible. This game forces you to do side quests to even unlock the dlc. Origins story was incredible but clunky combat, DA2 story was alright but the combat was incredible.That's why I am very much enjoying Veilguard is it's story and combat. Inquisition was a complete waste of time. After playing Veilguard this has become a gem. Not Origins level but alot better than Veilguard.. Pros: - Mythology: Ancient Gods and Goddesses, the Blight, and some other legends are explored in greater detail in this game, with some big surprises. - Story & Lore: It's a BioWare game. And even though it may fall short to Dragon Age: Origins or the Mass Effect trilogy, it offers an immersive tight plot and rich lore. - Dialog wheel: A neat upgrade from Dragon Age: II, with some special dialog options if you purchase Inquisition perks, e.g. 'ancient history'. Cons: - The 'war table' is atrocious. - Side quests mostly boring. - Horse controls are a nightmare. - Movement feels clunkier and less responsive than in Dragon Age: 2. - Open World is too big and boring - e.g. collecting shards is one of the most boring things I can imagine. - Few important decisions. - There are way too many characters in this game. They are somewhat well-written, but still much less unique and memorable than in Dragon Age: Origins. - Main antagonist is boring. - No ethical dilemmas are explored. The story is too linear. Where are the tough decisions, BioWare? - Collecting 'power' to unlock main story missions is boring. You are forced to do boring side quests. That might be just me, and I know this is going to piss off a lot of Dragon Age fans, but I also don't like the 'tactical' combat. I would love a more action-based combat system. 'Tacical' RPGs do their best to always remind you that you're simply playing a game. I want the gameplay to feel more like a cutscene - the more action-based and the more immersive, the better. This is why I loved Mass Effect 2 and 3, as well as Red Dead: Redemption 2. And more Dragon Age fans might kill me for this, but why, exactly, do I need to level up and control all 4 characters? In the end, it's the protagonist who makes all the in-game choices - YOU are the protagonist. You are NOT the NPCs. It ruins the immersion, having to manually control your party members for 'tactical' advantage. One major plus though - Inquisition is still much better than The Veilguard.. Felt more like an mmorpg and was the beginning of the end of the franchise... had so much fun playing this game, but it didn’t standup on the games released at that time.. good game i love to play this game remeber me the oldests dragon age, must play if u love rpg. One of the best RPGs of all times. The story is simply mesmerizing, the plot twist at the end totally unexpected. They know how to make good deep character and get emotionally attached to them. This is more than a game, all this franchise of games are rooted in our hearts. Also visually stunning for the time.. WAY better than DAII, still short from DA:O, but it did get GOTY for a reason. If I gave DAII a 6, I have to stay somewhat consistent here, as this is a big improvement in gameplay, story, graphics, everything. This is why I gave DA:O a 10, see? DAII doesn't deserve less than a 5/6, DA:I doesn't deserve to be right next to DAII, and DA:O doesn't deserve to be right next to DA:I. Anyhow, I love this franchise, and I was happy to see DA:I as a bit of a return to form.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best video games to have ever existed. It looks incredible, it feels and sounds incredible. Spectacularly design and a great campaign, the combat is methodical and fun which is suited for the dragon age series. Very open and explorable areas which all look incredible and are exceptionally well designed. Easily the best looking game that Is already a decade old and to this day it holds up to any other RPG of its kind. Even if the story or the writing is bad and whatever **** you might hear it doesn't matter because the game is great.. I have very mixed feelings about Dragon Age: Inquisition. The opening is extremely linear and doesn’t represent the rest of the game well. I also really dislike the 'chosen one' aspect of the main plot. Much of the game feels grindy, forcing you to complete repetitive, pointless tasks to earn an in-game currency (power), which is needed to unlock the more interesting quests. That said, some of the content, like the ""Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts"" storyline. Unfortunately, there isn’t much of this high-quality content, so it’s padded with tedious filler. At its best, this is a 9/10 game, but it's interspersed with 3/10 sections that you’re forced to slog through. While it's an open-world game, which lets you tackle these tasks in any order, you can't skip the filler entirely. The graphics and sound have aged incredibly well for a game that is now almost a decade old, and the soundtrack is great. Note: I played this game on the EA launcher, with the 'Skill Enhanced - Bugfixes and Tweaks"", ""Bugs be Gone"", ""Community patch"" and ""Nullify Fall Damage"" patches. Whilst it is graphically superior, it is definitely the weakest of the three Dragon Age games released to date. I'm giving it a 6, but cant help feeling this should have been an 8. If they'd cut the lacklustre content they would have ended up with a shorter but much better game.. 120 hrs ..Great game, Soundtrack, Gameplay, story, and rifts were annoying but completed.. I feltlike this game was a reasonable return to form, from Bioware. Gone are the days when Bioware games were edgy, gritty and morally ambiguous but at least they told a fully flushed out story with good villeins and interesting companions. The combat is leaps and bounds better than DO2 but this isn't enough to make stand toe to toe with DAO. EA has firmly started to dilute the original product.. Fights are so boring, impossible to block or dodge an attack without using a special skill, characters are slow. In fact, the game didn't choose between a tactical game an an action game. So it's bad in both ways. Quests are a bit boring as well, too much FedEx types. And not enough skills to unlock for character in my opinion. How possible this game was GOTY?. no dash? no block? no parry? like nothing just go and die just what is this game? how is this game even GOTY? every time i try to play the game the game play gives me a headache because of how bad it is. finding loot in this game is by far the worst in any game i play and if anyone say hey take it easy its a 2014 game you should show them the witcher 3 from a year after and both of them are GOTY too although i cant even think how this game candidate of that. there are a lots of problems like the bad mini map and ui and bad performance in cut scenes and more i cant even count its problems. this game is one of the worst game or maybe the worst game i play in my life.. a lot of potential wasted. Artificially stretched, boring game. Its bad RPG. bad game and worst Dragon Age (for now). Controller support is so inconsistent as to not work at all. I've launched the game 6 times and it refuses to let me use a controller. The startup process is also really janky. This makes the game DOA on PC. What's the point of buying for the best platform where you get all the options if the **** options don't work? Even if I do get it working, it will probably have to be through Steam instead of Epic>EA, but failing at basic ability to play the game is a death score. Probably EA's fault, but knows. Also, **** whoever made this text input form. Jesus **** this site is awful.. I had a LOT of reservations to try this game because I had so much hatred for the second opus of dragon age. My heart was broken as the first one is one of my favorite games of all time. It took 10 years before I gave it a try, especially considering the mixed reviews of the game. I was pessimistic but the story, the characters and the journey as an inquisitor took me where I did not expect. It is a good game. The lore and the political intrigues are nuanced and immersive, your impact is satisfying and the characters feel fleshed out. The downside is the immensity of the game and the amount of side quests that are not essential. It is pleasant to visit the many areas but if I'm honest, it's better to cherry pick what you want and ignore the rest.. Probably the worst game I ever played. Truly. I would never come back to it. I would rather play some old PS game.Quests are boring and they are the same for the every location. The only good thing is that Bioware has worked on locations that were very poor and repeatable in Dragon Age 2. But it is not enough.. I love RPGs. This game, however, makes me want to eat drywall it's so painfully boring. Combat is slow and clunky, the open spaces are way too large for how slow you move and how much content is actually there, and characters are plain bland, a far cry from other titles from Bioware. Genuinely awful.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game in the trilogy. From the open world, mounted, voice acting, to the combat. Inquisition offers thr best slice of everything.. This was underwhelming, for sure. I already beat it like... 8 years ago. Since I had little experience in gaming in general, I pretty much loved it. I finished with over 60 hours. However, replaying it was a mistake. First, the dialogue is bad. We're talking about an RPG with companions, such as Baldur's Gate 3. Why does the dialogue feel so bland? It doesn't resemble any human interaction I've seen. There are some pauses between lines that reveal the script so much that... holy ****. The characters as a whole are uninteresting as well. Not only that, the gameplay is basically automated, at least on normal difficulty. The TTK is so huge that it becomes honestly boring. And I'm talking about regular enemies. At least the game runs well, but that's not enough, unfortunately.. One of the 3 games that I wanted my time back after finishing it. Soul-less grind with MMO and mobile vibes.. Out of all the three games so far from the Dragon Age series, Inquisition has to be my favourite. True that it may lack the immersive background story of your chosen Inquisitor like that of Origins, but what it lacks from the first game, it makes up for it with graphical improvements, far more interesting challenges and deeper lore. Even to this day, Inquisition’s graphics are phenomenal, despite that this is a game which is reaching its tenth anniversary this year. I’ve been playing this now for some time, and I still love it. To me, it’s one of those rare few games that has fantastic replay value, and yes, it may have its faults, and can be a bit buggy here and there, but what game isn’t nowadays? All in all, if you’re new to the franchise or you just want to play a really good medieval fantasy RPG, then I highly recommend this game. 10/10!. the game fixes the only problem with dragon age which is the visuals, this game looks amazing, but sadly I really didn't like the story in this game.. Mixed Ideas with no idea how to realize them. Сastrated: AI, Interface, tactical system and everything related to gameplay. The game is not worth the money it cost at the start. I bought it at a discount, 10 times cheaper than at the start and I think it’s a decent price.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Honestly my first time playing a dragon age game and while I wouldn't say it was one of the best games I've played, it truly shows how deep the mechanics of RPG's should be for a start.. I love RPGs, specialy Hardcore RPGs and Party RPGs, how like BG, DAO... But this is awefull. The controls, the AI are a nightmare. The party members not doing what you want... after 10 Years, time to patch.... This game caught a lot of flak from users but it really wasn't bad at all. In fact it's quite good especially compared to what have been coming out in the last 10 **** graphics still hold up and them some. It's a gorgeous game visually as a matter of fact. It's not Dragon Age Origins level awesome as far as the story and quests go ,but it's still great in its own way. I'm on my 3rd playthrough now..... The game is ok but I wanted more. I love rpg with relationships w your companions and decisions on the story that matter. This game on that aspect doesnt come close to DAO. Still, it is better than DA2, but worse than DAO. And the story is short asf. Apart of the circle and main ones, quests are all mmo like which ****.. I loved it when it came out, I still love this game. Gameplay has its flaws and the story does not hit like Dragon Age Origins. But I still love it.. Engaging story almost on par with the first game. Looked great for it's time. Great soundtrack. A little buggy with the movement sometimes but not enough to spoil it for me. Playing this game first meant that I had a whole other level to discover after played the 2 older games, and it gave it some great replay value.. I love dragon age games so much, bring on the next one please. Another of the few games I've never been able to enjoy. There isn't much about this game that is fun or impressive, but it's also not terrible either. It's decent, through and through. For a video game, that's just not enough.. This game is so underrated. It seems like it has just become an average RPG.. The characters and lore are amazing, but the gameplay is just terribly boring.. perfectly! This is my favorite game, special thanks for such an ambiguous character as Solas!The plot, characters, and world are amazing!. So booooring. Just find every bit of this and some of that and do it 1000000 times more, but on different map, that should be semi-open, but it's just another labirynth to make you spend more time in game and get more frustrated.. It's a good RPG and a solid game, but hasn't enough charisma to hook the player. It lacks deeper mechanics and a better history. On the other hand is a beautiful game, with extensive landscapes, interesting characters, interesting ""castle"" ownership and funny combats.. Why try to put MMO like quests and things in thé perfection that was Origins... Lost what made this franchise good.. Better than the second game but much worse than the first. It's an average game in short. Even if I say it's better, I have to say that I liked it less than the second game.. if you don't want to look for minuses, then it is a complete masterpiece. The dawn will come.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. DA:I is an interesting case, it is an RPG and they put in a lot of effort to try to establish the world and characters but at the same time, most characters are boring. The only memorable ones are Cole and Cullen, the latter from the first few games and maybe Dorian. The rest are just poorly created, the VA saves them a little bit but there's only so much you can do. I played a male Inquisitor and the females characters in the game are some of the most boring and poorly written stuff in the last decade. It's an insufferable lesbian, a token black character and an uglified 'butch' female compared to DA:2. Awful, I feel like the writers for the game are either gay men or far-left women, there is no chance there were straight staff in the writing room. They brought back Leliana and Morrigan which are from the first game and written infinitely better than the rest so there is that at least. The world is an MMO, great main questline plus some decent side companion quests but outside of those, it's usually collect 10 herbs and find my mirror type of garbage. One massive positive are the locations and also the animations, those were 10/10, way ahead of most other games for its time. This game would become the Harbinger of woke in gaming as it has many of the SJW points that were so popular in 2010-2015 before it morphed into the current woke when Americans elected Trump and 'creatives' lost their mind. Considering the company (Bioware) has been going down since ME3, I fully expect them to bomb and lead to layoffs when going broke with DA:4 but we'll see. This is not a bad game but only do the main questline and the side characters and slay some dragons, the rest is MMO garbage and there is some woke, though not obnoxiously much, if you also like/hate that.. A good game, nice characters and races... but I will not forgive the fact that they eliminated the possibility of us romancing Varric over an extremely boring, lame and idiotic Bianca! It was better that they never revealed Bianca to us.. DA: Inquisition falls short of expectations due to its lackluster plot, shallow gameplay and uninspired open world filled with meaningless content. Consider revisiting DA: Origins instead – 3/10.. Dragon Age Yawnquisition is the perfect example in how *not* to make an Open World game: - the game world is sterile: NPCs are anchored at a specific spot and don't respond to the environment - there is no day and night cycle - randomly spawned in encounters include: mages vs. templars, mage vs. templars and templars vs. mages! Using the same character models over and over again makes this even worse. - enemy AI is terrible: enemies on a hill can't find a path to attack you below. - quests: fetch x amount of y and bring to z. Almost exclusively! Then there's the rest of the game: - butt-ugly character models that look like they were from 2002. - dumbed-down RPG elements (this is more an action-adventure than an RPG, let's be honest here!). - loses the dark & gritty setting of Dragon Age 1 for more of a pop artish style. Yuck! - controls are horrendous. Don't have a controller? Better not try playing it then! Mouse & Keyboard controls are almost unplayable. - went woke (comments about transgenderism in a time before transgenderism even existed?!) Dragon Age Inquisition manages to be even worse than Dragon Age 2: The Great Recycle. I'd rather play that one again than this piece of garbage. There is nothing redeeming about Inquisition!. I enjoyed the game a lot, it adds some new aspects to the game, with more intense fights and cool animations. The story is the continuation of everything that happened in previous game, so its nice to see how it unfolds. Graphics are stunning and some characters are more likable than others. The boss fights are even more epic than before, and your main character really feel like a hero of some sort. Unfortunately I dont feel like there is many decisions or at least not as many impactful decisions to make, not many memorable moments aside from the epic fights and relationship with characters.. I love this game as much as DAO. I actually finished it when the Trespasser DLC came out and I think that DLC really completes the game, it really shouldn't have released without it. I also want to remind people that when the game released it was between the PS3 and PS4, so a lot of people were rightfully upset they couldn't finish the game. However, despite any logistic faults made by Bioware or EA, I absolutely love the characters, the story and the combat. Also, my review was longer, but there were issues posting it and I've read random words will keep reviews from posting.. It's an absolutely fantastic game, the best of BioWare and Dragon Age. Can't wait for the DA:D sequel.. The most boring, tedious and grindy game I've ever played. **** Bioware and **** EA.. Pros: -Nice visuals -References to DA:O and DA2 -Soundtrack (tavern songs are amazing) -You can play as qunari Mehs: -Flat new characters -Main story -Crafting Cons: -MMO elements are everywhere -Awful player control -Terrible animations -One of the worst quests I've ever seen -Empty open world with only one activity for you - collecting stuff -Interface -Combat system -This game is more of a tycoon than tactical RPG. Far away from the first game in series. Uninstalled it after 30 minutes. Disappointed.... This isnt exactly a bad game, but it is bland. Every single part of this game is mediocre. I'd give it a 5 but considering its a downgrade from origins, and even a downgrade from 2 in some ways, it deserves a 4. In terms of game design it is miles behind other RPG games in a quasi-open world setting.. It's funny how Bioware took a franchise created by a master piece initial game and ruined with all awful following releases. This game shouldn't exist.. Dragon Age: Inquisition is the third installment in the classic fantasy RPG series Dragon Age. Released in late 2014 this game was supposed to be the big rival for the upcoming Witcher 3. In fact, from the very beginning this series was competing with the Witcher series for the unofficial crown of current RPG games. But unlike the Witcher series, which started very well and then only grew to excellence, Dragon Age started superbly and then declined. This decline definitely shows in the Dragon Age 2, which so many people hate, but for me the game that completely broke this series was Dragon Age: Inquisition. It started with big promises of an open world game, which DA:I most certainly is not. The open world aspects are pointless, the maps are either plain empty or filled with boring and useless collectibles. But I will try to first focus on the positive aspects of this game and there are some. The graphics looks very nice, even today, eight years later and it suits the world of Dragon Age well. I like the war table missions, they give you a sense of command, but they have very little actual impact of anything, which is a pity, but more about that later. The crafting system, while it has many flaws and can be pretty confusing to first time players, is still a nice addition to this world. And sadly that is about it. Now I must bring up the negatives, of which there are many. First of all the two major ones, that completely ruin the Dragon Age experience for me. First one is the lack of choices. In DA:I, you play as the Inquisitor, arguably one the most powerful men in the whole Thedas and yet your choices are cosmetic at best, usually there are not any choices to be made at all. What a stark difference with the two previous installments, where your actions had a huge consequences on the world. This is absolutely unforgiveable to me and I cannot think of a reason, why this vital part of the Dragon Age experience was not included in DA:I. The second big problem for me were the companions. In Dragon Age I always reveled in building strong and passionate relationships and rivalries with your companions. In DA:I, the companions are mostly badly written stereotypes of certain Thedas races. It is really disheartening to see yet another great aspect of the DA world being destroyed and spat upon by the developers. Sera of course springs to mind, this incoherent elven lesbian murdering proletary. Or Cole, his story is actually an interesting idea for a character, but somehow he winds up as a self hating crybaby, who for some reason (same as Sera) cannot form a coherent sentence. The best characters in my mind, Varric, Leliana, Cassandra were mostly just taken from previous Dragon Age games. Generally","the game was a blast, played thru it twice. Love the story, though once again making the DLC too important is a bad idea . the gameplay with the boring yet beautiful open worlds was at times a trudge ."
"1,098.Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Game Series","One of the best Telltale games ever. Goated store line, decent characters, borderlands original soundtracks.. Very good. Story is really nice and most characters are memorable and likeable. I dont want to profundize too much since its better to go blind but it really is good. Price should be cheaper in regard to replayability and length but its worth it (on sale). My only gripe was the villain (Not the first one nor the ex villain but the later one) was incredibly cliche and counter tones the vibe of the games. While Telltale games today may seem dated, with your choices leading to usually one of three endings and lack of gameplay, Tales from the Borderlands excells at its genius storytelling, likeable protagonists, and amazing writing. It succeeds at being a faithful spinoff of the Borderlands franchise, while also being a great standalone story for anyone to enjoy. Tales from the Borderlands has an amazing blend of comedy and drama, brought to life by it's cast, consisting of well known actors from other hit games, like Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, and Ashley Johnson.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Loses some of the momentum near the final episodes, and even though it's placed in Borderlands universe, it tries hard to not overuse it, and tells a story that's good on it's own. Brilliant screenplay, that often made me both laugh out loud and sob uncontrollably.. Highly Recommend. It's a telltale success. The Borderlands universe is colorful with good humor, solid story telling, while being an emotional, character-driven story. Gameplay is standard telltale format, so pretty much just interactive movies, but if you like them you'll like this one. Art-style and graphics are great too. Nothing to really complain about.. It's a good game from a time when Telltale could make successful games. But since there was no sequel season, the ending was not enough and the story was left unfinished.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. If ""The Walking Dead"" (including TWD: Season Two) hadn't resonated with me so profoundly on an emotional level, I would confidently declare ""Tales from the Borderlands"" as my favorite offering from Telltale Games. It's a game that's perched on the precipice of greatness, almost claiming the top spot on my list of TTG titles. The only factor holding it back is the raw emotional impact left by TWD and TWD:S2, which hit me like a ton of bricks. However, let's talk about the brilliance of ""Tales from the Borderlands"" from a broader perspective. It's not just the emotion, but the game's remarkable ability to tick every box that sets it apart. This title encapsulates a spectrum of human experience – from heart-rending emotions to gut-busting comedy, and it masterfully weaves in suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The depth of character development and the intricacies of the storyline are where this game truly shines. The characters are richly layered, evolving as the story unfolds, and making you genuinely care about their fates. You laugh with them, empathize with their struggles, and fear for their safety – all within the span of a single narrative arc. I must tip my hat to the individuals behind the scenes who crafted this masterpiece. The creative minds, writers, designers, and developers all deserve accolades for delivering a game that encompasses the essence **** tale. It's evident that a labor of love went into creating ""Tales from the Borderlands."" Without a doubt, TFTB stands tall as the pinnacle of Telltale's accomplishments.. A really nice game, I enjoy every minute of this game. Nice characters and be a Team with Handsome Jack is awesome!. Fantastic story that has a few downs and suffers a little from the telltale engine but a must play for fans of the franchise. 3 disgusting betas theit **** mothers were cheating on their pitiful father grew up and decided to express their memories of seeing their ****s cheating on their the most disgusting trash ever and whats happening between them and their **** wives now they also cheating on them like their fathers they like it theyve other men children in their home theyre not theirs they like it so they decided to become writers and put all of that in the most disgusting thing of all time by order from their cheating ****s if ur a fat ugly virgin guy or a beta piece of trash whose wife cheats on him and has other guys child in their home or a fat ugly feminist lesbian **** whose dad **** her u will love it kys u will love it kys. Somehow Telltale managed to capture the insanity of the world of Pandora into a very unique and interesting story taking place after the events of the 2nd game. Every member of the cast are funny and offer something unique to the story. Especially loved Rhys and the intro credits of the 2nd episode and the 5th one. Don't miss out on this one if you are fans of the series!. Tales from the Borderlands not only is the best of the Tell Tale games but is also a fantastic Borderlands game. The story telling and characters are top notch and really make you root for them. It does a great job of integrating itself in the Borderlands lore while introducing new characters as well. It has comedy; action; sadness; drama; everything you could hope for and is a great roller coaster. It also has some of the best use of music of any games I have played. Not just the songs themselves but their placement. The choices were well done with a couple minor gripes. The voice acting was fantastic across the board. I played Tales From the Borderlands on Linux using Wine and DXVK. It never crashed but I did notice a small issue. At the end of each episode I wasn’t able to view my choices or see how other players chose because the server couldn’t be reached despite me being logged into the Tell tale Account. Now this wasn’t a huge issue until after the final episode where I couldn’t click on anything because I couldn’t see the mouse cursor. I’m not sure if this was an issue with the game or Wine. Performance was good overall but I did notice some slight lag right after load and save points. It only lasted a split second so wasn’t a big issue. The game saves at checkpoints and I wish you could manually save. There was an AA toggle; a resolution option; and one other graphics option. You can pause the game and cut-scenes but not skip cut scenes. Game Engine: Telltale Tool Disk Space Used: 8.9 GB Game Version Played: 20171128 Graphics Settings Used: AA on; High Texture Quality; 1920x1080 GPU Usage: 15-57 % VRAM Usage: 986-1713 MB CPU Usage: 9-23 % RAM Usage: 2.2-2.9 GB Whether you enjoy Telltale games or Borderlands games there is something here for you and a lot of enjoyment to be had. Despite the technical issue I had I can’t think of a major change I would make and liked pretty much everything about the game. Because I’m unsure if it was a Wine issue or a game issue I won;t dock the game score. I finished my play through in nine hours and fifty two minutes. It is easily worth it’s current price tag of $26.99 and then some.

I really don't know what the hype was/is for this game. It's supposed to be an adventure game, but in fact it's a game on rails. In only a handful of scenes you feel like you are adventuring a bit. It's a bog standard story about friends and heroes. I felt very little emotional connection, maybe just a little bit with the two sisters and a bit with rhys. That's it. If you are expecting an adventure game that grasps you by the throat and never let's you go, like the walking dead did, or life is strange ... don't expect it from tales of the borderlands. Sometimes, this game was funny and absurd ... it should have been A LOT more like this. Then maybe it would have been a good'ish game. I'll probably have forgotten this game and its story by next week.... Definetly the best telltale work, cant fight me. The Walking Dead has a good pacing, good emotional story. This one has both of those plus pure comedy moments, much better characters, better pacing imo, just great.. Another good game from telltale with superb music , nice story ends with great boss fight of the cutest gortys.. Summary: Very strong game, picking one of the most difficult genres - comedy.. A game by the company that tried to kill the adventure genre. And failed, fortunately, by getting bankrupt with a series of turds that were more like television turds than video game turds. You wait for ages, unable to skip, and once an hour you must wake up to choose a dialogue option, except that you can't do that because it's a reading race on a short fuse and the game chooses for you while you are reading while a NPC is still talking to you. Looks like making adventure games for the double-digit IQ crowd wasn't sustainable after all. Good news and good riddance. If you want a more involving turd, in which you have more to do, play a walking simulator instead.. The best game that Telltale published. I even prefer this over the Borderlands series because it's more story-driven but in the same universe. If there was more choice and less illusion of choice, I'd give it a 10/10.. Good game, the story is quite funny, the mechanics identical to other Telltale games. Overall it was quite pleasant to play, but not outstanding.. Good story set on the universe of Borderlands with good twist and characters. It's fun and if you like at least a bit the world of Borderlands this is a no brainer.. Even as a non-Borderlands player, Tales from the Borderlands work so well that it stands on its own. It is a funny, thrilling and engaging experience that you would find in a moderately budgeted Hollywood adventure comedy, but in a Telltale game. Tales from the Borderlands excels in the laugh department and it is so well executed along with the story pacing that they couldn't have done it any better.. Funny game, but the story isn't that tense and doesn't make that much sense for a story driven game.. Best telltale game out there and is one of the best pieces of the borderlands series.. Definitely one of the best games from Telltale, a shame they won't be able to make more as they used to be, and also quite sad that this game was removed from the stores, because it offers a lot of interesting lore and new characters, and some will even be used in the upcoming Borderlands game. The game is quite simple and linear, except when it comes to the typical Telltale Games choices, but the story is what it is, with a clear journey and all that. It looks quite good and clean at 4K, doesn't have high requirements so it means any normal PC can run this at 60 FPS. I haven't played all of the Telltales game catalogue, but this one is definitely quite good and a lot of fun, the characters are well written and the story even surpasses that of any normal Borderlands game so far, in my opinion, because of all the player choices and input needed to make it go forward. It's not a long game, about 10 hours, but it's nice to just binge play it from beginning to end. If I have to nitpick a negative, probably the forced use of my local OS language (Spanish) while my Steam client is set to English, I never like when this happens, and the game lacks options to switch languages. A minor issue (can be fixed by tinkering with some files), and in the end the Spanish translation of all the in game texts (including images, posters, and digital screens) wasn't too bad, all things considered. Maybe someday this and other games from Telltale will be able to come back to stores, because they're pretty good story based games and the style is quite unique.. Tales From The Borderlands is the best game Telltale has ever made and will still appeal to people who has never touched a Borderlands game. The humor and heart is phenomenal and has better humor than the main games.. Another great game form Telltale they know thier job ;) . If you looking for a game with deep story mix with some funny moments this game is for you .The story is cool and the game play is the same as other Telltale games with some small changes. Story 10/10 Realistic 8/10 Graphic 9/10 Game play 9/10 Sound 10/10 --------------------- Total 9.2 Single player time 4 to 6 hours Worth to buy this game with $ 24.99 no you can wait to get it around $ 15. Excellent, underrated game from start to finish. First-rate voice acting and great Borderlands animation style. The story and characters draw you in and keep you entertained throughout, faithfully adhering to the Borderlands universe. Small segment of SJW-heavy side arc regarding a lesbian couple, aggravated by a nails-on-chalkboard Aussie-accented character. (They go on and on about their wedding, and on and on and on, and then on and on some more. Enough, I get it already) Anyway, not too bad that it can't be tolerated. Minimal cringe - one scene in particular where you sit there blubbering away (gag). Females are flawless and brave at all times while the men suffer from d-baggery, yellow belly and awkwardness. Besides a few forgivable flaws, game has a big heart and soul. Opening credits sequences are fantastic. One particular ""gun battle"" should go down as one the legendary moments in gaming. Camera work is near perfect, soundtrack superb. If you already know what to expect with Telltale game story-driven gameplay and are a Borderlands fan, this is for you.. Easy achievements and several laugh out loud moments made me like this game overall, but it goes on to long and I often didn't like the stereotypical ""choices"" the game gave me. Also way to much Q ing.. Beautiful game. Epic. Interesting plot from beginning to end, never predictable, beautiful music. The best Telltale game of all time. Recommended for everyone. I can not wait for a sequel to come out.. Borderlands world suits interactive movie format perfectly. I liked Borderlands 1 and 2 a lot but the main problem with them was gameplay itself: mediocre shooter with minor RPG elements. And now there is a chance to finally explore Pandora without all that nonsense.. I haven't played a Telltale adventure this funny since Tales of Monkey Island and I've only ever finished the first Borderlands too! If you want a humourous adventure filled with pop culture references, Borderlands cameos, strong voice acting along with a groovy soundtrack to boot, you'll find it all here in Tales from the Borderlands. The game does have moments where the animation is choppy (something that Telltale has become infamous for), some scenes appear to be rushed and the damn thing doesn't work on my Logitech F710 controller for some reason (even though it claims “Full Controller Support"") but I'm willing to overlook these flaws and recommend the game anyway. Especially recommended if you're a Borderlands fan.. Amazing game. I love the story, I love the variety of things to choose, I love how relatable you can be to the characters, it's just overall a great game. I love telltale games, they're very fun and definitely make YOU feel in control. Highly recommend this game.. I had very little knowledge about Borderlands series and had not played any of the main series games before jumping into Tales so i was a little bit skeptical of what i might find, but turns out it was well worth a try. Really well made story, likeable, funny characters, awesome action sequences and some pretty crazy set piece moments by Telltale standards. I also liked that not many people you like in game die like in Walking Dead series. Game ran great with just bit of freeze and stutter here and there, nothing major. I would've liked having couple of seconds more between dialogue and in game choices in some instances, i coudlnt fully explore and consider all the options at times cuz time was too short.. I've been on a Telltale binge as of late, and Tales from the Borderlands was the last one on my to-do list, and now it's done. TFTB has a very different tone to other Telltale games, with a focus on humour and it really is funny at times, If you want a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and offers some laughs along the way you can't go wrong with Tales, especially if you're a fan of previous Telltale games. I would say Tales is technically the least ""janky"" Telltale release, if you've played previous Telltale games you already know the engine is old and frankly quite poor in certain areas but the ""jankiness"" was definitely at a minimum compared to say The Walking Dead: S1 which had all sorts of issues including character stutter. Visually it was also very beautiful at times, and thankfully the devs didn't employ a similar filter to the one used in Game of Thrones, which IMO completely destroyed the visuals of that game. Overall the presentation was very good with many improvements to the HUD, the audio was also top notch with great voice acting and a brilliant soundtrack backing it up. Without making this review too long I will just say Tales from the Borderlands is one of the better games Telltale have released, so if you've enjoyed any of their recent work you'll no doubt enjoy Tales. I bought it on sale and at that price you'd be mad to pass it up, add it to your wishlist now if you don't want to pay full price and wait for the next sale, but I'd say it's worth it at full price when you consider it's about £1.50 per hour of entertainment.. Might be the best Telltale game ever. Great world design, realistic and deep characters, really well-implied humor. I honestly liked it more than the original Borderlands series.. One of the best games I've played in a while/ever it has everything, Great gameplay, Comedy, The story draws you in, The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in any game and the characters are fantastic. Telltale and co' really did a great Job with this and I will look forward to playing through this again further down the line.. Best telltale game so far (yes I finished all of them), and may I say, this was better then the original Borderlands games!? Ok... different genre, but still. Ty. After I've finished the hit ""The Walking Dead"" from Telltale Games to compare: this one appeared to me much more positive but still very entertaining. Without spoilers I can say that I was a little bit saddened of some completely non-realistic parts in the world, some of them where way too unreal. That's the biggest con for me. But to sum up, I've got adventurous and not boring story with the feeling of watching some cool TV show. I was excited to see what will happen next in the episodes and in some moments it was really great to choose the direction that story goes. Very good!. You need to know TWO things about this game: 1. Best game from Telltale so far. 2. Better than original series. (Yup, this game is THAT good) Sure thing it have a few drawbacks such as somewhat rushed ending or no real variability. But still, it's an awesome experience.. Decent game . In my personal top 3 took place among the games Telltale Games (Psole Wolf and TMD) . Cool story , a good design . Not very satisfied with the only music , it is not enough .. Great game. A must play for any one who likes story driven adventures filled with laughs and thrills till the very end. Can't wait for the second season.. Telltale did the impossible in my perspective with Tales from the borderlands, making you care about the history of the universe of Borderlands. You can ask to all your friends who have played the other games a lot, most part of then don't know, and don't give a **** to the history/backstory, what really ****, because the history it's kinda ok. The best part about Tales From the borderlands, it's the relevance that game has to the canon of borderlands, with a lot of facts and characters from this game being key parts to Borderlands 3. Rollercoaster of emotions, good amount of lore, silly random fun jokes and a big pokemon fight? You got the right game! Especially a must for Borderlands lovers. Indulging, Fun and Awesome experience. Some of your choices really matters and changes the narrative. The story is well done, very interesting. The emotions are mixed, comedy, suspense and tragic. Two POV Characters is a great idea.. I haven't played a lot of Telltale games because I'm not a huge fan of episodic games but I'm really happy I played this one. Initially I was lured by the Borderlands name because anything Borderlands tends to be great and also the fact that this was supposed to be a funny game. And I can say for sure that this game is worthy of all it's praise, it tells an awesome story and it's funny as hell. I literally played the whole game with a smile on my face cause the jokes just keep coming (and that isn't a bad thing). It's not the funniest game I have ever played, that title goes to South Park: The Stick of Truth, but it does come in at a close second. So just go play this game even if you're not a Borderlands fan, but if you are then this is a must play because it tells you what happens after Borderlands 2. And even if you're not there's still plenty to love here, it's fairly accessible and fills in newcomers quite well. It's well worth the money and my personal favorite Telltale game.. I love this game!!! I played all the Telltale games and personally loved them all. The game shows that gameplay can beat graphics. Sure this has a lot of bugs but gameplay and story totally makes op for it. Playing the game it has a wide variety of humour, links between the other game (Zero, Claptrap, Handsome and Athena) For me this my favourite Telltale game to date, hell this my favourite game to date. Playing the other Borderlands game their amazing and playing games with a ""leveling up"" system it makes it VERY hard to go through levels without breaking my $400 controller (Game is $25 AUS on steam, didn't rage) I know fans that played this game did hate the wait for episode 2 it gave us time to think about the characters and play episode 1 until our hearts content. This game has done something special... This is the first time I've cried playing a game and probably be the only game I will cry in. So this why I rate this game a 10/10 because of the feeling the games evokes and the gameplay given. P.S This is best Adventure game of 2015 - IGN. Best game i've played in a long time. If you liked the humor from the borderlands series, don't worry! You won't be disappointed with TFTB. While i like most of Telltales games, this is their masterpiece.. TellTale! I hope you never stop making these kind of games , i am addicted to this game , the lore , the drama, the suspense and action are just so GOOD that it makes me want to replay it all over again ( which i will). This game is highly recommended to anyone who wants to go on a WILD journey ;). A good Telltale game. Much better than their Game of Thrones game which is pretty boring. Extremely funny and a lot more intelligent than the humor of Borderlands 2. If you love the Borderlands universe, buy this. If you like Telltale games, buy it. Etc.. This is Telltale's best! Great game that plays out truly like a choose your own adventure book. The joy in this game is from making choices but not worried about living with every moral choice. It's a true joy to play. You should check out this gem, no question. ON PC don't use an xbox 360 controller though, it will crash the game for some reason.. I hate it. I love games of Borderlands title, but this is just... just... ... (Noah Entwaler's (Spoony) voice)... BETRAYAL! The first games haven't got extremely good plot, but Humor always hid it, when humor wasn't really good, gameplay hid it, when gameplay became boring, plot moved. All was in balance. But this game doesn't have any good jokes, doesn't have any good gameplay, storyline is betraying and spoilering in teasers and boring. 4th episode has the worst intro ever made for borderlands, when i heard it, i thought that it was OneDirection or justin bieber or other WGWTAG. A quality interactive game, and another quality telltale game. This game is up there with the walking dead, just not as emotionally tolling or keeps you that invested in. It replaces that formula with humor, and it does a excellent job at that. Heck, I would even say buy this game just for the laughs, it really keeps the game fresh. The story was pretty good, kept me interested throughout, and the characters were top notch and really like-able. The world of borderlands was wonderfully imagined in this game, something borderlands fans probably will enjoy. The only negatives were that most of the action pieces were not that fun to play, and lacking real user choice consequences. If you go into this game with the mindset of choose what you want to say or do instead of choosing your own adventure, you will enjoy it a lot; I know I did.. You need to know TWO things about this game: 1. Best game from Telltale so far. 2. Better than original series. (Yup, this game is THAT good) Sure thing it have a few drawbacks such as somewhat rushed ending or no real variability. But still, it's an awesome experience.. Captures the Borderlands vibe well, which is basically ridiculousness, outrageous fun, and crazy adventures. The characters are all well-made and deep, with tough decisions all-around, and plenty of excellent writing. By far the best Telltale game I've played. Highly recommend this, especially for people who've played the actual Borderlands games.. Borderlands is easily one of the best co-op shooters of all time. Tales from the Borderlands is one of the best Telltale games of all time. I loved it to bits. The story is absolutely amazing, the gameplay feels really solid, the characters are so likable and easy to connect with, and the graphics really show why Borderlands is different. The style of it feels like a comic book or a graphic novel, and that's what makes it special. It's not just the graphics, however. The game's story is easily one of Telltale's best, and I hope it is continued. Most likely it will be on account of it's sequel-bait ending. In total, Telltale has created an amazing return to the Borderlands series that completely makes up for 2014's The Pre-Sequel. 9/10.. I've only ever played one other Telltale game (The Walking Dead, Season 1), which I enjoyed a lot, so I figured I'd like this game, since I love the other Borderlands games. I figured right, and then some. Not a huge fan of the Telltale-style gameplay mechanics, but I loved the story and characters so much. I wish there was an easier way to know the different outcomes of making different choices, and I wish they gave you a bit more time to decide, but that is a very minor complaint. I should also mention that the music is awesome in this game. I am sad it's over. Excellent, excellent game.. If you are sick of Telltale's illusion of choices, think again. This game is actually good. And very humorous. I quite enjoyed it and now I am sad because I finished it. Best game of Telltale so far.. Telltale Games finest to date. I have played many point and click adventure games in my life (Broken Sword, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Monkey Island etc.), so the games that Telltale were producing were right up my alley, I remember playing ""The Walking Dead"" for the first time and realizing straight away that Telltale is the future of point and click adventure games, I played ""The Wolf Among Us"" and loved that too, it was so satisfying to see this new spin on the genre, these are games with modern graphics and great cinematic quality, of course they are more linear than the old classic games from which Telltale were inspired by but what matters in the end is the characters, story and how well developed it is. Then ""Tales from the Borderlands"" was announced, I wasn't hyped for the game since I wasn't a big fan of the Borderlands series but nevertheless was still happy another game was coming, when I finally got down to sitting and playing it, I was blown away. ""Tales from the Borderlands"" shines in its humour and great characters, the humour in this game is so brilliantly executed, never have I laughed so much in a game before, this is also the most interactive and beautiful Telltale game to date, there is a great deal of variety in the areas you visit throughout the game, the cinematic quality has been raised and the characters are so well defined, it doesn't matter whatsoever if you liked or played ""Borderlands"" or not, this game stands on its own but for those who did play it and enjoy it, I'm sure you will enjoy the style of humour and pop culture references that is abundant in its setting. If you love comedy adventure like Pixar's movies and the old classic Lucas Arts games then you will simply love this game, if you are into something more serious and dramatic then you can check out the Walking Dead series that Telltale has done, I loved both but in the end was drawn more to this game because the comedic charm and wit of Ron Gilbert and Tim Shafer's games in the 90's is what got me into point and click adventure games and the characters kept me there, that same charm and wit is present here in ""Tales from the Borderlands"". To be honest I've never played Borderlands before. And I didn't know what if I was going to enjoy it or not. But Oh My God, that was a masterpiece with Telltale's seal on it. The story and the dialogue were very well written, the voice acting was amazing , the choices were very logical regarding the situation, it was one of the funniest games I've ever played,and the soundtracks made it a complete game in every aspect. To sum up; This game is Amazing. :) Good job Telltale. I hope there is a second season.. Warning: contains very mild spoilers! Background: I've never played a Telltale game before, this was my first time. I did watch a long play of the first Borderlands and played 67h of Borderlands 2 so I'm mostly up to date with the lore. Intro: Tales from the Borderlands is a digital story. It's almost not a game and there's nothing wrong with it. You'll get to watch a cool story, choose dialogue in a split of a second (most of them have a timer, if you fail to choose your character will remain silent) and ""play"" some quick time events on the action sequences. There are also some very tiny ""exploration"" sequences where you'll get to move your character in a tiny area while interacting with other characters a searching for items and/or paths. If you don't like any of these elements or if you were looking for a highly interactive experience then you should stay away from this game (even though this is not a bad game). What I liked: - Well crafted story. - At its best it's great, it's really fun. - Failing miserably at taking down a guard while telling everyone it was under control. - A certain ""gunfight"" in the offices :P (you'll know what it is once you play it). What I didn't like: - There either isn't or I didn't find a way to skip some of the conversations. This would be useful when repeating certain parts of the game. - Graphical glitches, some popping and stuttering. - There's really no way to screw up. As a result the characters are never in any real danger because I know that no matter what I choose to do the game will always find a way for the main characters to continue. This ends up breaking the game a little and turning some parts of the story flat-out boring. - Most of the ""action"" sequences in the story are well crafted but when they, they fail badly. There's a sequence where you're supposed to avoid some turrets fire and the game will only let you progress if you click to advance when the turrets are facing a single predefined direction. Even though there are plenty of other directions the turret could be facing without seeing you, the game will shoot down your character relentlessly unless you the exac","""Tales from the Borderlands"" succeeds at being a faithful spinoff of the Borderlands franchise . it succeeds at being a great standalone story for anyone to enjoy . it's a good game from a time when Telltale could make successful games ."
"1,099.Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft - Whispers of the Old Gods","A waste of time. The old hs was really good. Nowadays its just bad how it is.. this is **** totally **** game dont play it and waste your porr time if u play it u ****. So the r4elease same crap new name to get better reviews. Resourcehogging. Got the latest icore and a 1080 grapgh but as soon as I start this the computer slows down to a crawl: So unbalanced game. Forget to get ranking without using a lot of money and when u play for a month they reset the ranking so no meaning playing ranked for the first 3 weeks because you meet ppl that have awsome cardcollections. It is like if all soccer teams restarted so the div 5 teams will lose first 100 matches with no chance at all. Gameplay is all about getting your combo before the opponent.. Unstable connections + rigged win/lose system. The more you pay - the more lucky card draws you'll get. Also a lot of bots that play withour mistakes, farming gold/rank/arena.. This is not a game that the user has any control over, they might as well sit back and watch the computer play their turns, everything relies on the computer which has not been programmed with even basic probability or even mathematical odds, because its algorithm has already decided in advance just how its formulations would go, effectively pre-selecting any winner. It is not a game that rewards its gamer's for their time and investment, so they get better and progress, instead every time they achieve it matches them against something x5 times better. This is because it makes melon head get an even fatter head. A head that literally should be knocked about like a pinata until balanced cards and fair play fall out. The cards aren't balanced and neither are its classes,, because freaking melon head only fancied himself as that class its best. The game constantly disconnects it players, unlike any other game they play, because melon head greedily steals all the money instead of even doing basic server maintenance. Melon head server maintenance was programming in more melon headed bots to rig any outcomes. Everything in this game is rigged from the way the cards are drawn, the way any cards attack, the sequence the cards attack, and every opponent you are fixed against. Do us all a favor and put this crappy game just where it belongs. We might suggest the steam pro tourney version might be fairer. No it still had the same melon headed concepts to begin with, where you are literally just watching a computer choose and rigging your luck. Because any deck will win and every deck will lose, but it is up to the computer just what it decides. Stomp that freaking melon head in.. This update completely ruined Hearthstone. It utterly shocks me that Blizzard really thought they could get away with doing this. Whispers of The Old Gods is one of the most gigantic failures **** update/DLC I have ever seen. There are three clear reasons for this; 1.) Blizzard broke their promise. When Hearthstone first began, Blizzard promised that all cards they released would remain relevant. With the WoTOG expansion, however, they made the past two expansions null and void for the ""official"" game mode called ""standard"". 2.) Obvious money grab. A lot of the problems Hearthstone had was the over-powered classes and cards in the game, specifically the cards from the Naxxramas and GvG expansions along with some infamous decks such as Ramp Druid and Patron Warrior. As a result, whenever Blizzard released a new expansion, it made little to no money since everyone kept using the Naxx and GvG cards. This could have all been fixed with some patches and updates, but Blizzard chose not to do this. Why? Because THERE'S NO MONEY IN DOING THAT. Instead they simply got rid of all those cards all together and forced people to buy the newest expansion in order to win games. It is the most blatant money-grab Blizzard has ever pulled that the fans weren't fooled for a second. 3.) Goodbye Control, Hello Rush Decks! The heads of the Hearthstone department at Blizzard made it blatantly clear that with the new WoTOG expansion they wanted to make the game more control/late-game oriented instead of aggressive and rush-based. Well remember how I said earlier that Blizzard got rid of the Naxx and GvG cards? Well, THOSE WERE THE CARDS CONTROL DECKS USED TO STAND A CHANCE AGAINST RUSH DECKS. So instead of having a control-deck META, Blizzard accomplished the EXACT OPPOSITE in the WoTOG expansion. Now you can't play/win a single game without a Aggro Shaman, Face Hunter or some overpowered rush deck being involved. So this expansion was a massive failure because not only did Blizzard break their promise, they made this expansion an obvious cash-grab which accomplished the exact opposite it was supposed to do.. Complete and total pay to win game. the game is build just to milk money from people. there is like 10% skill involved and all else is pay or RNG to win.. This is the worst update ever. My reasoning is very simple - they've ruined the balance. Basically, Blizz forces you to use new cards by making them so much stronger. Some of the older cards can as well be deleted from the game and very few will notice that they're gone (since nobody uses them anyway).. The best expansion so far. C'Thun makes the game go faster for fear that the rival improve it and throw it before you, and Yogg Saron gives the possibility to create the deck most fun of the entire game. And the standard mode makes new players can play, simply.. Literally 0 decision-making involved. 30-card decks and mana limitation means that every game is decided by RNG. You can only play 1 card in pretty much every turn,so if RNG decides that your opponent draws better cards or cards that counter your cards, you just lose the game and vice versa. Also, the community is **** (I mean, they still play the game, duh).. Literally 0 decision-making involved. 30-card decks and mana limitation means that every game is decided by RNG. You can only play 1 card in pretty much every turn,so if RNG decides that your opponent draws better cards or cards that counter your cards, you just lose the game and vice versa. Also, the community is **** (I mean, they still play the game, duh).. Hate it due to... 1) old cards becoming irrelevant. 2) the whole xpac being centered around one card. 3) some OP cards forcing you to play C'Thun (3-mana minion with 3/4 & win condition) Don't get me wrong, I love Hearthstone, but this is just a terrible product.. Cool expansion with interesting card design. Whispers of the Old Gods also brings some balance changes, which made meta more diverse and control oriented. After not great TGT this is truly a breath of fresh air in Heathstone.. This expension did what every expension does, just better. The Meta is very diverse and the old gods - or at least three of them - are really good and fun. It is to bad that people seem always to go for fast face decks, but with C'Thun/Control Warrior and N'Zoth Paladin/Rouge/Priest there are enough slow decks to choose from. I really like this expension and the new rotation based format is really good for new players.. Nice expansion with good cards for all classes. The new Meta is also more diverse and control oriented. Good work from Blizzard, after the good expansion LoE I was expecting this one to **** like TGT, but surprises are always nice!. C'Thun, C'THUN, C'THUN!!! Someone was under a heavy Lovecraft influence or playing too much Bloodborne when making this expansion and I love it. The entire old gods theme is just amazing, finally cards in Hearthstone that are not completely kiddie & goofy, much much better than both GvG and TGT. With these cards and new standard format, this has been the biggest change in decks in Hearthstone history and it feels like a very welcome refreshment. By far the best Hearthstone expansion yet. 9/10","the old hs was really good. Nowadays its just bad how it is . melon head greedily steals all the money instead of doing basic server maintenance . the game constantly disconnects it players, unlike any other ."
"1,100.Among Us","Pretty Average, the game is pretty cool, and the idea is pretty good as well but the game is overall an average. Perfect to play with new aquintances, although you might not make the best first impression.... When I hear “Among Us” I think wow… what a diamond in the ruff here. Not only does it ruin all types of relationships, but it even manages to bring out the fighting spirit in the most introverted people. This game is super fun with friends if you have a full group, and don’t have to type to randoms. My only minor complaints would be the servers being over capacity during the majority of ‘peak’ times. Also randoms leave quiet frequently in the games causing some games to be very short so that’s a bummer if you don’t have a full group. At the end of the day this is a Gem to be treasured with your closest friends, and even a game where you can make new better friends who won’t sus you first round and throw you out into space you know who you are (cat you sus ass ). Among Us is a Below Average game. While you can extract some enjoyment from the experience, you're better off doing just about ANYTHING else with your time.. I love Among Us but it does get repetitive,the new ""Hide N' Seek"" gamemode is just Camping:The Game and the moderation almost being inexistant. *Among Us* is a simple yet captivating social deduction game that has taken the world by storm. Set aboard a spaceship, players must complete tasks while trying to uncover who among them is the Impostor—a player secretly working to sabotage and eliminate the others without being detected. Player interaction is central to the experience, with moments of tension and accusation that create a unique and engaging **** visual design is minimalist but effective, featuring colorful characters and simple maps that allow players to focus on the gameplay. The mechanics are accessible to everyone, which has contributed to its massive popularity, especially among friends and families. The excitement of *Among Us* lies in the discussions and bluffing during meetings, where players attempt to convince others of their innocence or shift suspicion onto others.Regular updates to maps and game modes add variety, though the gameplay can feel repetitive after extended sessions. The multiplayer experience—especially with voice chat—is the game’s core strength, making each match a fresh and unpredictable experience.. Very easy game concept but its implementation is awesome it made so much fun back then when it was hyped nowadays it's kind of repetitive.. Among Us in 2020 was a solid 8/10 indie title, and ever since then it's legacy has been completely destroyed. Among Us kept adding maps that are all rigt, but too infrequently. In 4 years of it being out, it has gotton a total of 1 new map. Because of this and the quality of the maps in the first place the player base has dropped and continues to drop. It's a joke **** that has been ruined with the drop in player base, quality of gameplay (They added more players to one lobby making it more chaotic, and added permade chat prompts for talking to each other) quality and infrequency in updates,etc. The game itself is fun, a murder mystery game with different roles, accessories and easter eggs relating to the Henry Stickmin series. The game itself is enjoyable, but slowly became more and more tedious overtime. The game became easy to cheat in, as well as using accounts in a way that are annoying and difficult to set up. Lobbies can also randomly crash at anytime, and there is no punishment for players leaving games simply because they didn't get the role they wanted. Despite this, the roles add a new layer of the game and heavily alter how difficult it is to catch the right person, while also making it difficult to trust anyone. The tasks have become less annoying and tedious and the game only keeps improving as time goes on. I'd recommend trying it out, though I'd understand if you wouldn't want to continue the experience.. Great party game. There's not muchto go in-depth on. Could use some more roles, non-imposter killing roles could especially help. Tasks are well designed but skeld and polus are the only really good maps, with the most recent maps being too big. High reccomend for parties but only if you have at least 7 people.. The game pits players against one another, with each player being randomly assigned the role of Crewmate or Impostor. Mechanically, the game is rather basic yet quite fun as players attempt to complete their tasks on the spaceship while potentially being sold out by one of their **** minimalist, abstract visual style coupled with the creepy sound design enriches this in such a way that is easy to get into and yet highly engaging. The game is entirely based on social interaction: discussions and debates are a pretty important part of the process in this case you will have to show your team or deceive them.Even with its community-supported, live-updated, and multi-platform being would ensure that it goes on for a longer time. With its distinctive mix of strategy, diplomacy and conspiracy being one that any multiplayer fan deserves to experience Among Us is a true grander.. still quite fun today and still are no hackers so dont have to worry about them ruining your day tough some people arent very nice and there are so many roles is hard to keep track of stuff. Lost Its touch. Network problems, Unnecessary new roles, and no voice chat?. The game itself is INCREDIBLE, it deserve a 10/10 but the community.... some of the player are really nice, but the most part are just 9 yo stupid ahh children who rage quit 90% of the time, and i don't like the update, too complexe for a stupid player like me. AMONG US. Its the best game but you need 10 people to play and also among us. Game is okay. I find it frustrating how the game formats player interaction. The game is very repetitive. Playing crew mate is generally significantly less fun than impostor. The art direction is good, the audio is decent for selling an atmosphere but the game just doesn’t seem to fit that atmosphere.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game is fun until someone spam reports your account and gets it banned. Then when you email Support to get it back they don’t care and will keep it banned. They SUUUCK at doing their crappy “stay at home, sitting in front of a computer all day” jobs. Quite literally the worst game I've ever played and may be one of the worst of all time. There is absolutely nothing charming about the game. It's hideous, and the characters have the visual appeal of road kill. The control to actually move your player character make E.T. The Extra Terrestrial for the Atari 2600 seem smooth in comparison. Ride to Hell: Retribution is a better social deduction game and it's not even one. it's in a completely different genre. Online play is stupidly laggy, even with a cable internet connection it feels like you're playing on a server that's basically two cans connected by a string. The tasks are mindless crap and garbage. As far as the community goes, might be the single most toxic fandom in the history of fandoms. Poisonous to the nth degree, society was made worse by the existence of this game. I guess COVID really did rot everyone's brains because people think this is a good game. Stay away, for the love of God.. I guess there is no need to explain the game of years, there is no one who doesn't know it anyway.. Honestly it was great before they decided to fill the game with unnecessary mechanics like shapeshifters and engineers. Basic elements of gameplay that were integral to catch the impostor were thrown out. Venting? Might be an engineer. Literally seeing someone getting murdered in front of you? Might be a shapeshifter.. Among us is a fun and exciting game, but the only issue I have with it is the lack of Game modes. I would have loved to play this with a group of friends, but sadly I never had that opportunity. But I think playing in random loobys is fun as well, you sometimes get games where you get voted randomly and many players leave lobbys because they dont get imposter, but aside from that you can sometimes really investigate and communicate in the chat. But all in all I would recommend to play this with oral communcation, I think there you can lie better and identify them more than in a chat.. Among us is still a valid game Among us didn't die because we are no longer in are houses. Is becuse you let it go. I believe you and everyone can still have fun and enjoy the game. Innersloth is a video game company that doesn't back down and never gives up.. fun game, terrible, toxic community. Wonderful game, that could use some graphics update. Red sus.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great multiplayer game with tons upon tons of different modes and activities to play. This game has only gotten better and better over time where every once in a while I'll still launch the game for a good laugh and a good time. I have never understood the hate for this game, is it because the game is popular and people are just tired? if so, I recommend rating a game based on it's actual quality rather then the internet ruining it. My one complaint is that if some other people are using mods, they can make it public and an unsuspecting soul (such as me) can join without even knowing how the mod works! which can make it very confusing.. A real-time Mafia/Werewolf clone that happened to be at the right place at the right time. After a bad first impression with the game thanks to severe connectivity issues and occasional freezes, I finally had a chance to experience the game and it's fun. I still find Town of Salem to be a more cerebral experience compared to Among Us although one can't deny the continued popularity of Among Us and it still continues to receive updates despite us being halfway through 2022.. The social deduction is fun, but gets stale after a while. The failure to add meaningful content outside of one update per year leaves this game in an awful state most of the time.. its a good game, a great game even. i wouldnt say its amazing, nor anything, but if you pretend that its gaming community doesn't exist; then you are going to have a pleasant experience.. If you play with friends, it can be a lot of fun! It's done simply and with love for the work.. This is such a fun game to play if more of your friends are up to it. But playing it with other players isnt fun most of the time so yeah. Got on Epic, will not run unless I give it permission to read unnecessary info from Epic.. Fun experience for a little time. Getting bored after weeks/months. Reccomended to play with friends, old version also much better. New updates kinda bad and ruin the game in my opinion. Rating then (2021/2022): 8/10 Rating now: 6/10. red sus great for friend groups and parties, **** to play alone. barely anyone plays right now, but at its peak was a great experience.. Had one good game in which managed to thrive as an impostor. All subsequent play-throughs ended up with me immediately dead or voted off. Still worth it. Gets old fast but a fun first time experience.. Wow, this game died hard. Despite the developers continually adding to this game it is still not as good as it was in it's heyday. You can still find fun playing this game with a group of friends but public lobbies are just brain numbing. It's still the same game from 4 years ago but with added micro-transactions. Only download if you are planning to play with friends. Great and simple game with hours of fun. Among us was a completely new concept and a unique new experience for me. It is so simple, yet so fun to play. You play with a group of people and friends, in different spaceship maps, each containing a different area. On a map, different rooms with various tasks are present. The crew members, aka the “good guys”, need to complete the tasks to win the game. When everyone is done with their chores, victory is theirs. Meanwhile, one player is an imposter, who pretends to be a crew mate, but is secretly murdering everyone and sabotaging their work. It is the imposter’s goal to murder everyone or to hold off the completing of tasks, until the timer runs out. When other players find a body, or saw something suspicious, they can call for a meeting. In this meeting, dead players are muted and the rest can determine who the imposter might be. This can be done in text or speech. When people know or suspect someone, a vote can be cast, after which the player with the most votes is yeeted out of the space ship. The imposter has some handy tricks up his sleeve. He can sabotage certain parts of the ship like communications, oxygen, overheating or overheating the reactors. In this events, the other players cannot continue with their work until the problem is solved. Giving the imposter the time to hunt down lone players or to escape through the many air vents in the game for fast travel. In terms of graphics, Among Us is nothing special. It uses simple and jolly 2D graphics with fluent animations. The cartoon style really fits the game well. The sound on the other hand is solid. Alarms are loud and trigger your attention, the soft footsteps, the sound of a vent opening, it is all great and mysterious. All sounds also really help you determine what is going on around you, it is just very well implemented. The controls are fluent and easy to understand. It takes some time to learn all the buttons and actions but you will get used to it soon enough. This game is really all about tactics, choosing the right moment and timing your sabotages right. Matches can be over in seconds because someone betrayed their identity at the start of the game, and sometimes, a match goes on for a good half hour because the cards have been played so well, nobody has the slightest clue who could be the imposter. There are just so many different ways in which you can play this game. With big groups, the game is a lot of fun because the imposters are now with two and the length of the match, confusion and overall chaos is increased. I found it especially fun with a group of friends. The only downside to Among Us are the idiots or trolls that sometimes join matches, just to cause some uproar and fights between players. They spoil stuff, put random stuff in the chat that makes no sense or do not actively engage in the meetings to determine who is the imposter. Another small issue is the hostility of some players. They take the game way too serious and when accused or accusing someone, it sometimes actually feels like someone is trying to solve a murder on their loved ones. People get mad sometimes or vote you out of the space ship just because you did not give the response they wanted. Of course, this is a small group of people, but it can still be annoying sometimes. The game play is repetitive because you always have the same objective, but with this game, it is just perfect and does not need any other modes or styles of playing. In the end, I think this is one of the most surprising and fun games I have played in a while and I would recommend it to everyone.. This game is good with friends, it's funny to play. Nothing special and everyone play it because of viral.. I soon as I started playing Among Us I was hooked with its fun Murder Mystery style gameplay and its variety of maps and locations. Among Us is an online game where there is a bunch of crewmates around a spaceship doing tasks and one imposter going around killing people! It is really fun as a crewmate running around doing tasks and trying to find out who the imposter is and trying not to get killed. BY FAR the most fun comes when you become imposter and have to go round killing, hiding in the vents and lying to other crewmates, it is so thrilling and nerve racking! And with its cosmetics and Hide and Seek mode it makes for more fun! I we are talking negatives the server can be laggy or disconnects at times and depending on what people you play with will majorly effect your experience! Overall It is a great game and I would recommend. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. Overall - 5/10 Difficulty - Very Easy Platform - PC/iOS Replay Value - 6/10 Gameplay - 3/10 Hours Played - 10 hrs Extra Notes: It's best moments are when you play with friends, but getting 10-15 ppl is hard and I rarely expereinced that. It had potential but I never got to see that.. Game is very, very fun. It doesn't get repetitive and each round can be fun... However online ****, and i can't blame the devs for it, it's stable enough, the player-base is horrendous however. Buy the game if you want to and play with your friends, it's not worth bothering with online play.. Graphics - 5/10 Gameplay - 10/10 Controls - 10/10 Detail control - 6/10 Optimisation - 9/10 Interesity - 7/10 Personal taste - 8/10 Sound - 7/10 Physics - 4/10 Mechanics - 6/10 Getting bored quickly - -1/-10 Bugs - 6/-10 Balance X Community - 6/10 Players - 2/10 Servers - 6/10 Add-on: Virtually impossible to play with random players, only friends -8/-10. fun, interesting game, with friends you can cool interesting to **** cool game.. Superior to most mystery games. Plus, years after its release, it's still great!. Really fun idea but needs to be polished more on the gameplay part and more maps.. Among Us is an online multiplayer in which players take on the role of either a Crewmate or an Impostor. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostor(s) and eject them from the ship through the interactive voting system, whilst the goal of the Impostor(s) is to eliminate the crew without being caught. The gameplay itself is very simplistic, and as such it is the social deduction element that makes the game. This means that you’re enjoyment of Among Us will very much depend on the group you’re playing with. When playing with random opponents, who very often just quite when they’re not picked to be an impostor, you’ll find many games become completely unbalanced and frustrating. Get the right group together however and it can be good fun, and I imagine this’ll remain popular for a good while yet.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Among us is a pretty well known game that is about there being a bunch of crewmates and 1=3 impostors in a ship. The impostors try to kill the crewmates and the crewmates try to complete tasks. I've played 200 hours, it is a pretty fun but mediocre game at the end of the day, but it is really affordable at 4.99 on steam and free on mobile. 8/10.. It has been 2 years and this meme won't go away. My review must be at least 75 characters long. Fun gameplay, pretty good maps, but gets very redundant very quickly. Also doesn't have proximity voice chat in the base game which is something that could definitely make the experience more enjoyable. The tasks are also quite unenjoyable as well.. Well, it's because of the update, such an assessment, and the game is cool in the style of a card mafia, it's cool to play with friends to find out which of them is a traitor :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really fun multiplayer game. Only fun if played with friends over voice chat though, a rather large group is needed.. To be honest back in 2020 Among Us was really fun experience, something new. Nowadays Intersloth made Among us an game service, with a progression, lots of cosmetics, and new strange **** i haven’t played nowadays, I don’t want to screw good memories of this game from past. 6/10. i farded because i farded amongus in rel life sussu playing sus game in rel life gaming. Among Us is pretty a good game for friends to play like it's investigate who murdered and people have to find out who is the culprit. But the times go by, the game makes unplayable because of hackers and toxic players since the popularity in mid 2020. I played Among Us before the game is popular and now there are new updates, the game will not return its glory just like 2020 popularity because of the Amogus memes.. An online and local party game of teamwork and betrayal for 4-10 players.... Unironically a good game, the best thing about it is the communication between the players, it's very fun to play with friends.. STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US, I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT! My friends on TikTok send me memes, on Discord it's **** memes, i was in a server, right? and ALL of the channels are just Among Us stuff. I-I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo i flipped it and i said ""Hey babe, when the underwear sus HAHA ding ding ding ding ding ding ding *takes breath* ding ding ding"" I **** LOOKED AT A TRASH CAN, I SAID ""THAT'S A BIT SUSSY"", I LOOKED AT MY ****, I THINK OF THE ASTRONAUT'S HELMET, AND I GO ""****, more like peenSUS"" *takes breath* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Check out our full video review below: ****/cqNDDzAvR0A Thanks for watching. Innersloth are the most neglectful, laziest game developers ever. Among Us is still a glitchy mess, even several years after its release. They have made millions of dollars from the game and could easily reinvest some of that money into hiring programmers to fix glitches, but they haven't. They don't care about their customers at all. Among Us is also plagued by cheaters, and Innersloth doesn't actually do anything about it. I know because I have ""reported users for hacking/cheating"" for blatantly obvious cheating only to find those same exact users still using the game the next day. Their website claims ""bad faith reports… will result in enforcement of consequences,"" which is their excuse for ignoring this problem. They haven't banned me for ""bad faith reports"" and they haven't banned cheaters for cheating, by the way. That's just their excuse for doing nothing. I sent an email to them via the Contact Us link on their website about this, and they haven't replied. I bet this review will be ignored by them too, but you should heed my warning. Innersloth and Among Us are terrible. Wait until another game developer makes a game like Among Us but without glitches and without cheaters. Then buy that game instead.. This game isn't perfect, but with the right group of people, it can be a great game similar to Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Mafia.. amogus is the best game ever, because i found in it my best friend and girlfriend at the same time. Amogus can give you a hope to communicate with female, so im gonna rate it by 12 amoguses out of 10. Gonna be honest, the game quickly became bland. Even with friends, this game makes me feel bored constantly. 5/10.. Its an awesome idea and is a lot of fun for a long time if you know enough people to play with with voice chat. But technically its a very bad game. What I mean is that its framework is really bad. They should have added voice chat support a long time ago. They could have increased player count. They could have added many more maps. They could have added more game modes. But they did nothing of that. They pretty much are the definition of to rest on one's laurels. If you think you will have fun playing with silent strangers from random servers, you will have a bad awakening. And you wont find new friends in this game either, because its so massively restricted in social interaction. You almost feel like youre playing against bots. If you want a much better Among Us, try Goose Goose Duck. Lots of Youtubers and streamers have already discovered it and showed how superior it is to Among Us. It does everything better than Among Us. EVERYTHING!. I am actually really **** furious! This game is literally the worst piece of **** I've ever played in my god damn life! I wish nothing but the fiery pits of hell upon it!. Playing as imposter is enjoyable. Playing as crewmate means chores. These tasks are just boring not fun to do. It is only fun when you perfectly guess imposters. Quickly becomes repetitive. Always the same thing. No change, no difference. After some time your brain get numb from monotony and you don't care about anything anymore.. Great game to meet new people. Half of players are toxic c**** but some are really nice. I played this for 3 months back in 2020 and it was really fun.. top game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It is accessible. It isn't a negative experience. It is a good enough game to recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is just murder mystery on Minecraft's Hypixel server but much more accessible. It deserves all the praise it's getting. It's literally free on your phone. Just try it, man.. Good and enjoyable with friends. Sometimes boring to wait when dead, missions are not enough.. I picked this up due to sudden popularity and cheap price. It really is not a good game and it owes its popularity to streamers. It plays like a mobile game (in fact it is a mobile game) and game mechanics are extremely simplistic. There is a lot of down time on lobbies as well as when you vote. You may think “it’s fun with friends”. Well, all games are fun with friends. Among Us is one such case where your friend makes it fun, not the game itself. Finally, even the idea behind it is not original. Town of Salem did this years earlier. I do not recommend it even at this price point.. A good game to play with friends. It has simple graphics that are eye-friendly.. dont recommend. 0 stars since update. no chat. DONT BUY!!!! cant chat no fun at all dont buy and waste your money. I gave this game a solid 9. I do not think saying ""I had an encounter with a 6 year old saying red sus, so I give game 0, bad game, trash game, ooga booga."" Yeah that is a little exaggerated but that is what most of the reviews are on here. So you might as well go rate every online game in existence with a 0 because you are bound to have a bad experience. Also teling the devs to add anti cheats and new content and ranked systems is ok I guess, but remember, their team of devs is one coder, and some artists. So it will take some time. My point is stop giving bad reviews because of some toxic people. Also someone said the game graphics are bad so it gets a 0, like you don't need great graphics for a game to be good, anyway I gave it a 9 for what it is, fun gameplay and when you play with friends or have a decent group of randoms, the game can be very fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. that epic amogus moment whebn you catch the impost or (sus) on cams!!! asmong us!. The game of 2020 is a very simple game so I’m gonna keep this short and sweet. It’s fun i’ve played it hundreds of times and even with the hyped dying i’ve still gone back a few times there’s not much to it which is it’s strength as well as it’s downfall and overall it’s a fun game everyone can enjoy, not an amazing game on the grand spectrum but still just a very fun enjoyable simple game. This game is so rediculously overrated. This game is full of toxic players and it gets boring fast thanks to the boring, tedious tasks and same old simplistic level design. I found it boring to play with friends as well. I'm also fed up with seeing this game constantly on my YouTube recommended. I just don't understand how a boring mobile game can get so much popularity. It just shows the bad direction gaming is going in.. Thanks to Henry Stickmin, we discovered this self-repeating game. Good idea. Its processing is nice, but of course it repeats after a while. We are waiting for the 2nd game.. Complete and utter ripoff of Pretend by Whitesquare. Among Us rips assets straight from the game the maps layouts are near identical just with a nonsensical spaceship theme. Among Us has no voice chat support and has paid DLC. This game is just a big cash grab. I recommend picking up Pretend on steam now, it's only 1$ USD and out preforms the game in every category.. Among us is free to play on mobile and blue stacks but is £3.99 on steam and epic games on these editions you get some costumes though its a very fun game more enjoyable with freinds but still very fun `1-3 imposters have to kill tcrewmates where the crewmates have to do tasks and find out who the imposter is its a bit like John Carpinterrs the thing.. We need ranked matches. I'm tired of being paired with dumb people in a social deduction game. If the developers don't want this game to die, they need to drop more maps and add a win/loss based ranked match system instead of worrying about their merch shop.. This game is awesome. You can play with friend and enjoy. This game have great graphics and cute death animations and have a good details but this game have a few server and filter in iran plz solve that problem. Play this game but dont trust anybody because maybe they imposter or maybe not?!. It's a fun game, but there are many issues. The worst issue is that the game is overrated. This doesn't deserve to be the GOTY. These 6 year old ""gamers"" can't afford good games like TCRSS or Red dead redemption 2 so they bless Among us. The next issue is the repetitive gameplay. Every round you do the same stuff. The last issue is that the game wasn't updated in a year.. Fun at first, the game quickly degraded from a game of deduction to ""who can say red sus the fastest"". People don't see evidence when it's in front of their faces, ""oh that person was not the Impostor, logically there is only one left that could be impostor... hmmm today i think i will vote for the guy i clearly saw scan at medbay"" The game is also pretty poorly made with weird controls. Fun for 15 minutes, though.. The idea for the game is good. Gameplay third-person view. Find out who is good and who is a traitor. If he throws traitors, the survivors will win. If not, the game continues. Cons - Inadequate community and cheaters.. the game is pure fun, more fun when playing with friends, glad i got it on pc, bigger screen than phones. THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! 11/10 nice graphics! 100000000% recommendation! You are kinda sus. Great creative multiplayer gameplay. Doesn't look like much but entertained me a lot. The task in itself are pretty bland but its tense to find the impostor. I hate this game. The community is super toxic. Half the server leaves the game when it starts, nobody wants to be crewmate, and people vote you out for no reason. 10/10. Yes. The score is the same. I loved this game. In the very old days. Now it has changed beyond words. Intermediate exits, illegal programs, bad words, and all sorts of dirty and bad things started to happen. I really liked this game, but people were doing so badly that I'm now in my worst game. It is the worst. I miss the old Among us.. ""Among Us"" is a simple, yet thrilling game of murder mystery that makes for a great time of fun, betrayal, anticipation, and lots of yelling. The game is free on mobile and only $5 on Steam for PC, which is a HUMONGOUS bargain. The visuals and animation are pleasing, the different strategies and ways to win the game are fun to discover, and gameplay with or without friends is mostly spectacular. Although there are definitely some issues the developers need to fix, they currently are working on implementing needed commodities and fixing those that are already in the game (they just added COLORBLIND SUPPORT!) Despite this, the issues fortunately are not severe and I definitely recommend checking ""Among Us"" out.. It's a fun game, what makes it addictive is that you won't know when you will be the impostor, and that makes it fun, and being a crewmate gives you fun tasks, so you have to use your detective personality to win. This game is very bad, it is absurd to pay 10 dollars in a game like this which is the same thing on your cell phone and in days you already get sick. These positive rewiews are all about kids who don't even know what a real graphic is, they don't even know what good gameplay is. There is no anticheat just to warn you, cheaters are able to play the game with","Among Us is a gem to be treasured with your closest friends, and even a game where you can make new better friends who won’t sus you first round and throw you out into space ."

"1,103.13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim","The best ending in all the games i have played////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////. The combat has a surprising amount of thought and strategy to it and can result in some impressive carnage. But, the draw here is the absurd and engrossing time-travel story of teenagers using giant mechs to fight aliens that ends up having so many more layers to it. A bonkers experience.. Not very stand out on gameplay, but this game delivers incredible way on storytelling.. The story plays on many settings of classic sci-films, and makes a coherent story out of them. Overall, the story is fun and creative but it has nothing extraordinary and meaningful. Recommended for visual novel fans and sci-fi enthusiasts.. If mindbending Sci-Fi stories are your thing, 13 Sentinels is the game for you. You won’t find another game like it.. This might unironically be the best written piece of media ever. Not joking, managing to seamlessly connect 13 character stories, how they intertwine with each other, builds up misteries and plot twists every few hours and manages to create moments that want you to KEEP PLAYING even though there's barely any gameplay... This game singlehandledly got me into VNs. Very very good writing and epic sci-fi story told here. There isn’t really much gameplay here, besides going around and talking to people. There are short strategy mini games that are fairly easy and quick. The only knock I have is that it’s very very slow paced. But amazing game besides that. Thank you Japan for making this hidden gem! Proves once again that good games don't necessarily get the marketing they deserve.. At first I didn't think I would be into the whole idea of this game, as it is primarily a Visual Novel and tower defense game. However, I really bought into the concept as the story is super intriguing. I also ended up liking all of the characters and they all have their own motivations and stories that play out in very smart ways.. Absolutely mindblowing. This game has one of the most complex narratives I've seen in a videogame, and by the end, it successfully manages to answer every single question you have, and this is what I call good writing. The way the story is structured is very fascinating, having to replay the same sections but slowly gathering more information and creating new branching paths is such a clever way to tell a story, and it never gets boring. Also the way the overarching story is connected via the character stories is incredible, some character arcs conclude within other character arcs, and they make perfect sense. Reading the mystery files also gives a ton of information about what is currently happening in the game, and it's very helpful. Sadly the game has only one specific flaw, which is honestly quite major, and it's the gameplay. The Destruction mode itself is a decent idea, having combat in between keeps it fresh considering how the vast majority of the game consists of pure dialogue, however, the combat itself is very shallow and mediocre, even though it can be fun sometimes, there are barely any interesting mechanics, and it's frustratingly repetitive. It only gets worse when you are forced to progress the Destruction mode so you can progress the story because it hurts the pacing. Personally I didn't expect to love this game that much, it's a very unique experience, the plot hooks you from the beginning and slowly unravels in a way I've never seen before, the overall story is just phenomenal, and the characters are very well written. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. It is definitely the intangible cultural heritage of PS4 era, the story says all hail to all the great sci-fi in the history, if anyone says negative to this, punch right on his face, period.. Stunning art, good music, Amazing story, Fun gameplay. The grafix during battle keep it bellow 10/10 kinda hard to se what unit is what at a glance. And no sense of scale. Hopi g for sequel.. Peak anime visual novel. It's hard to imagine how someone could make a game in it's genre any better than 13 Sentinels. The needlessly (Yet since it's an anime ass game needfully) complicated story that leaves enough room for the player to guess the next twist while getting blown away by four other twists that happened simultaneously, never got old. And when it did get old switching to the """"""action"""""" side was a good breaker reset to let you process all the new revels you where just hit with.. This game is breath taking how they were able to pull off 13 different characters into one coherent story and different time the story takes place in. the gameplay is on another level when it comes to intense tactical **** what's most striking when you play the game is the visuals I absolutely adore them. I have always liked vanillaware drawing artistry, but this one just takes it to another level in how much time was put into each drawing. Oh my god looked like **** I love the characters they have so much charm and character to them and I cannot stop thinking about it even after I played it. I got a platinum and God everything on it. I just wanted to play this amazing story I was so sad after 26 hours that it was **** way the story is separated so you cannot see all the character story at once you have to play that is character and this character and this character and feels like cliffhanger's all of it and it's so weird what I want to know more about the story so I played the Gameplay part and the story part just to know what's happening to my boys and **** the game keeps so many disks in the air so many story points but its career and there is a good coherent fun intelligent story behind this game. I did not expect but I'm so happy about it.I do not want to say anything more about the story. I do not want to say anything more about the gameplay this game is amazing. It's a 10 out of 10. Please play it, it's vanillaware best game.. 13 Sentinels is an excellent game that has a top notch story, though some of the combat might be a bit infuriating in the end game. Vanilaware have outdone themselves with an excellent, though sometimes convoluted, story that might require multiple replays to properly understand. The writing is excellent, with likeable characters, and solid voiceover performances. The game is as visually stunning as previous Vanilaware works, especially in the story mode.. This game can be separated into 2 parts, the story and the combat. The sci-fi story is like a visual novel that leans heavily into time-looping tropes similar to the show ""Dark."" You play as 13 different characters with branching narratives as you relive certain moments and make different decisions. The writing here is interesting, and throws major surprises, even if it often relies on standard anime hi-jinks. It can sometimes be frustrating, as you often have to keep clicking on people in a certain order, or clickables can be hidden, and you spend time trying to figure out what you're supposed to do next to advance the **** combat can be thought of as a minigame where you control pieces that represent mechs, and battle other pieces representing kaiju on a warboard reprsenting a city. This part is just ok. It's basic, and not great, but it works. Overall 13 sentinels is a bit of an odd duck, but creative and well-executed. It took me 34h17m to complete 100%.. Nice game, i like **** Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Play as 13 different characters and choose between story mode and battle mode,loved it so much. Story was fun but extremely convoluted. Hard to keep track of everything, but it is cool how they can make a cohesive story amongst 13 different protagonists without some stories feeling inconsequential. My main gripe is the rts gameplay portion. Not very fun and was just a means to an end for me to unlock more story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim may have its flaws, but it is also a one-of-a-kind experience -- far better than the sum of its parts. Vanillaware's best effort by a mile, 13 Sentinels is an incredibly unique and ambitious game that's separated between two very different gameplay experiences -- a story-driven visual novel, and a real-time strategy RPG -- and while combat is serviceable enough, the former works better than the latter, as 13 Sentinels' story is really what holds everything together. Despite a few too many instances of cringy teenage romance drama here and there, 13 Sentinels boasts one of the most finely crafted high-brow science fiction narratives you'll likely ever encounter in a video game. Smart, weighty, extremely dense, and completely engrossing, 13 Sentinels' story and characters will stick with you long after completion; even if its 40-hour playtime may go on for a bit longer than is necessary.. An absolute masterpiece in storytelling, it's incredibly satisfying how the 13 characters stories intertwine as you gradually learn more and more about the world and events. The story can be a bit confusing at first, but as you progress, every piece falls into place. The combat mode is surprisingly fun as well.. 13 SENTINELS: AEGIS RIM has one of the most unexpected yet brilliant narratives in both visual novels and strategy games. Despite the lack of impression in the combat part, I would still recommend it to any gamer who has a predilection on storytelling.. Amazing story, nice graphics and gameplay. It provides what you expect from a game: it's fun.. While not perfect, this clever adventure packs enough excitement to keep your head and your thumbs spinning. A truly innovative story makes for a bite-sized game that can feed a village. Go in as blind as you can!. Pros - one of the best takes on visual novels ever made - a masterpiece of storytelling when it comes to mysteries - each of the 13 main protagonists feels just as valid and interesting as the rest - perfectly paced to drip feed you information for you to make your own conclusions - beautiful artwork that is a joy to look at - the tactical gameplay is a lot of fun Cons - poor optimization on the Ps4, you will experience performance drops during the major battles when there are hundreds enemies exploding on the screen 13 Sentinels is one of the best hidden gems that you have never heard of. Made by Vanillaware and published by Atlus, the game is a hybrid between a visual novel and a light strategy game, each part feeding into the progression of the other one. When it comes to visual novels, they live and die by their story. So how is the story of this game? Masterful. Perfectly paced, as you have to meet certain thresholds in both the story and combat to progress most of the characters' segmented storylines. Steady and unrelenting drip feeding of information allows you to come to your own conclusions, sometimes letting you click a couple of things together in your head just seconds before it confirms them. Absolute perfection. I also believe that the order you play this game in lets you figure out different things at different times, so I might have figured out plotline A ten hours in and plotline B thirteen hours in while plotline C, D and etc. had to have been spelt out for me. While you play the game, you might understand C then B and never get A until the game beats you over the head with it. Perfection. The strategic part, called Destruction, has you fighting the enemy forces on an abstracted map of a city, where you use a team of six sentinels to plough through horde after horde of enemies. Each mission has a unique set of objectives that reward you with exp and additional information. The sentinels themselves are divided into four classes, allowing for different loadouts and combos to be thrown at the hordes of enemies. The last thing I will mention is the Analysis section of the game. I have never seen a more fantastic glossary for a game in my life. The Analysis serves as a sort of timeline for you to put context to the non-linear storytelling the game engages in, allowing you to look through many of these to understand the correct sequence of events. Just brilliant. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is a game that everybody should play at some point, because between the story, the art, the combat and the interesting mystery, this game is that one hidden gem that is missing from your library.. One of the best stories. At first things make sense, then they get wildly confusing depending on which order you play the stories in. Eventually the game gives you a guide to help explain the twist within the story guide which is nice. And then everything makes sense again. The real time tactics gameplay was okay, it never really sat right with me as the two gameplay styles felt very disjointed from one another. One being very low stakes story based, and the other being a very high one with drastically different art styles is a little weird to me. I always got the mech fights out of the way as soon as possible as they weren’t nearly as enjoyable as the story itself. The graphics during the story portion was absolutely lovely, like a nice painterly and anime mix. The story plays on the obvious anime troupes really well and it’s done very purposefully. If you love a good story and don’t mind real time tactics to get to the end, it’s worth your time.. Great story and visual, worst gameplay possible. A rts -tower defense hybrid? What the hell are they thinking? Gimme a real jrpg!. I didn't really like this game. The story had no real hook in the first 3 hours, felt confusing just for the sake of being confusing (like a soap opera style of storytelling) and the gameplay style of RTS/Tower Defense wasn't my thing. It'a a shame because I love Vanillaware art, and I tried to give this game a chance, but it just doesn't suit my style, and probably won't suit a lot of people that don't fit the niche.. The game is a slow burn but one of the best stories I've ever experienced in any media. Great game, shame I can't share more of my thoughts because I keep getting a 404 error.. This was the first game of this sort that I've ever played, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but by about 20 hours in, I was growing weary and I just wanted to see the end of the story. And when I saw it, well, it wasn't as profound or intriguing as the buildup made it seem. The whole ""Remembrance"" mode (where you're controlling the characters and interacting with other people and objects) weaves a convoluted tale - one that really doesn't come together neatly in the end; partly, perhaps because I'm just too stoopid, but partly because of the way the game allows you to jump around narratives. I felt there was too much forced intrigue; it's a story that features time-travel, clones, androids, AI, characters who are the child version of the parents of other characters, good guys, bad guys, characters who can transfer their consciousness into other humans and machines, etc. Much of it was shoehorned in to the detriment of the clarity of the narrative. This became especially clear towards the end as the developers tried desperately to tie it all together by making Renya Gouto the final character's story you can complete before the final battle. To muddy the waters even more, two characters have EXACTLY the same name, and two others have the same first name, different last names, but actually are each other (or, the same person). The ""Analysis"" mode is more or less throwaway; it's a collectopedia and reference in case you get lost, but it's not well organized and can be ignored entirely, except to spend your ""mystery points,"" which is required to progress the story at one point. It can be kind of interesting to peruse, but I didn't spend much time here. A lot of the files are updated as you progress through the game. It's possible that if I were to seek out the characters or events that were a little confusing to me and read, I would understand better, but I never really felt compelled. There are some interesting tidbits about Japanese culture here and there, though, so that was nice. ""Destruction"" mode is a game within a game (within a game?). It's a turn-based RTS-style game where you control up to 6 sentinels with the goal of destroying all the bad guys, represented by weird, twisty, stacked two-dimensional shapes on the battlefield. It was interesting at first and had some good potential, but by the end, I found myself bringing down the difficulty to casual because I just wanted it to be over with. Every level was more or less the same, with slightly varying goals, enemies, etc. While it's not un-fun, it's not the most engaging aspect of the game and you really need to grind A LOT in order to upgrade your sentinels sufficiently to be able to able to get S* rank in every battle on Normal difficulty, let alone Intense. It's satisfying watching the icons blow up, but I found I only used a scant few of the skills available. Each sentinel has around 10 or so active and passive skills that can be upgraded, plus overall sentinel upgrades, plus a ""meta terminal"" that can be upgrade, all which require hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands of ""meta chips,"" - the currency you get for winning battles - to upgrade. The problem here is that battles don't net you nearly enough meta chips when you have to spread them between 13 characters' skills, 13 characters' sentinel upgrades, and the meta terminal. This is what I mean you have to grind if you really want to upgrade. A battle might net you 100k chips (once you've sufficiently upgraded your terminal) but those will be gone in a flash on ONE character's skills, let alone their sentinel upgrades. The thought of the grind makes me shudder. Anyway, I'm glad it's over and I'm glad to have experienced it. Pros: - Natsuno's butt in the track outfit - Beautiful art style - 100% voice acted (English VA was great) - Ultimately, a very cool concept Cons: - Walled-off progression pending other activities - Too many required destruction stages (should have been skippable) - Some characters' paths were VERY unintuitive (only needed a guide once, though) - There's no secrets; nothing to ""find"" - you just push the button until you exhaust the prompts Scores Visuals: 7/10. Sound: 7/10. Gameplay: 5/10. Story: 7/10. Replay Value: 2/10. Total: 5.6/10. Average. It's not all it was hyped up to be, but it's by no means a bad game. It's not a ""must play"" and I certainly won't replay it, but I have no regrets and will probably give these sorts of games more of a chance in the future. It was intriguing, tedious, confusing, interesting, annoying, and heartwarming all at the same time.. This is truly a masterpiece in the sci-fi genre. A beautifully crafted game with gorgeous art and music, which is brought to life by its immersive story and cast of characters. This game truly blows you away, the number of twists and turns and questions to be asked and answered in this game's narrative is truly mind-boggling, and yet somehow it all makes perfect sense in the end. Play this game.. If you love Japan, big chance you will love this game :) its mostly about story, gameplay itself is simple.. Must play masterpiece with 10/10 story telling. Visual novel and tactical mix works pretty well but the split is about 80/20 for the gameplay.. I genuinely don't understand why this game has so many reviews raving about how great the storyline and conclusion to it are. I honestly enjoyed the combination of strategy and the sense of trying to piece together what is happening, but the conclusion was, in my opinion, so bad that it ruined the rest of the game for me. If you structure a game around trying to figure out what is really going on, then the anseer had better be good, and it wasn't. Add to that some transphobia pretending to be trans positivity and a lot of unnecessarily sexual drawings of teens, and I'm honestly annoyed that I bothered to play the game, much less finish it.. Is 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim a masterpiece? No. Is 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim a good game? No. Will you like it? Maybe. I'd like to preface this review with saying that I have the platinum for the game; not a difficult feat, but it should at least inform you that I've played my fair share. There are three different modes in the game, but your time will mainly be split into the combat and story modes, so I'll be focusing on those. To start off, even people giving this game a 10/10 will likely submit that the combat isn't the best; certainly not masterpiece level. In my opinion, it's a horrible and confusing mess to look at, and the strategic gameplay isn't fun for the most part. None of Vanillaware's strengths are on display here at all. I'm done talking about combat; I'm pretty sure even Vanillaware doesn't really care for it all that much. The artwork in the game's story is just as beautiful as you might expect from Vanillaware, and it brings up what would otherwise be a 3/10 to a 6/10. Unfortunately, you'll be staring at the same environments and characters for hours on end, which can make even the most beautiful artwork look boring. The story itself isn't hard to follow despite being very complex, which is the only positive thing I have to say about it. I won't get into spoilers, but for certain reasons, character development isn't really possible in this story, and we don't get much of a chance to get attached to any of the characters anyway because we only get to spend a few minutes with each at a time. On top of the characters being uninteresting plot devices that we follow around, the reveals and plot twists are just as boring, and only serve to add layers of needless, empty complexity onto a story that really didn't need it. If they had spent more time trying to get me invested into the lives of the characters, and less time talking about every sci-fi trope under the sun, I may have enjoyed myself a bit more. The way you interact with the story, at first, is actually rather interesting, but 20 hours in becomes tedious. Running around trying to figure out what object or person you're supposed to talk to is just wasted time. There's no choice here, you find where the story wants you to go next, and you go there, or talk to that person, or think that thought. It's not hard, it's not engaging, it's just boring. The voice acting is excellent (I played in Japanese, not sure about English). The dialogue feels very natural, but it's often very boring because of this. I found myself watching schoolgirls speaking to one another, and thinking: ""this conversation seems like what actual schoolgirls might talk about; too bad I have absolutely no interest in anything they're saying."" There were other characters that did make me laugh a few times, and I was occasionally interested in what was going on, but most of my time listening to conversations was time wasted. Excellent voice acting can't save a boring story with mostly boring dialogue. I could go on for ages about how stupid some of the twists and reveals are, but obviously there's loads of people that actually love this game, and I wouldn't want to spoil anything for anyone reading who also might wind up loving the game. I consider myself a fan of Vanillaware, and I have no issue with them making different kinds of games; I just wish they'd stick to their strengths, which is mostly their beautiful artwork. If I could take a break from the story, and button mash with a gorgeous 2D sentinel instead of giving myself a seizure looking at flashing neon lights in the combat system, I may have liked this game. Vanillaware has never been good storytellers, but that didn't matter when I could take control of their art and beat up other art. Odin Sphere had better character development and a more engaging story even without its combat, but letting me control the characters in combat helped me get more invested in them; 13 Sentinels could have greatly benefitted from giving the player more agency over its characters, which rarely ever happens at all. Decisions are actually meaningless, and will force you into saying ""yes"" if you said ""no,"" and any combat in the story is just a single button press that often fades to black with beat-em-up noises playing in the background. I just didn't care. Regardless of what I think, there are people that will love this game, and there are people that will hate this game. There are also people that will fall in the middle and tear themselves apart agonizing over it (me). What it really comes down when deciding whether or not to play this game is to figure out what kind of person you are.. 13 Sentinels is two games in one: An epic visual novel where you play as a rotating cast of high school-aged protagonists, and a tactical combat game where those same characters pilot giant robots (“Sentinels”) to defend your city against waves of kaiju. The visual novel is where you’ll spend most of your time. It’s a lavish production: beautiful art, excellent voice acting, and tens of hours of content. The only problem is… it’s boring. The story is convoluted even by the standards of sci-fi anime. I tried my best to follow it, but at a certain point I just stopped caring who’s a clone of who, whose dreams are whose implanted memories, and so on. And the gameplay is tedious. There are no choices, just steps you need to take to advance: talk to X, think thought Y, touch item Z. Usually the next step is obvious, but occasionally it’s a frustrating exercise in trying to read the dev’s mind. The combat is actually pretty fun, though it doesn’t require much strategic thinking. Usually you can just spam your rockets at the incoming waves and call it a day. (If you like your kaiju fights to be more cerebral, go play Into the Breach instead.) Also, your performance in combat doesn’t affect the story at all, so there’s no sense of stakes. Overall, 13 Sentinels is a unique, ambitious genre-bending experiment that fails to cohere as a gaming experience.. It's just a masterpiece. Amazing story, thank you for this amazing videogame, Vanillaware.. This reminded me somewhat of a telltale game with more depth and tons of borrowed scifi themes. There was a lot of fluff in the story, but it was good overall. It's a fairly easy platinum trophy, just takes about 40 hours depending on mode you play. Overall, it had beautiful static backgrounds, but there were elements that needed more work. The characters look like paper cutouts, and the battle system looks really bad. It felt like a really long $15 game with a better than average story that was a little messy.. The few times I heard people talking about this game I always heard that it was amazing. I went in with pretty high expectations and it completely blew those out of the water. The game loads up and you're greeted with probably the best title screen music I've ever heard. The game is split into a real time tower defense combat mode, and a visual novel mode. While the combat mode is good, the main appeal defiantly comes from the vn mode. In the vn mode you go through the events that happened to the 13 main characters leading up to the final battle. What makes the game so incredible is how the story is told. As you experience each characters story, you'll get twist after twist after twist. At first nothing makes any sense, but as you get further and further everything starts connecting. I didn't have everything 100% figured out until the ending. You can also play through the stories in almost any order, so your experience with the game won't be the same as someone else. Like I said before, I went in with high expectations, and this ended up becoming my favorite game of all time. If you have a PS4/5 give this game a shot, you won't regret it.. It’s a definite 10/10 *if* you can enjoy a game with a lot of story (and some tower defense that’s fun and pretty easy). There’s a lot of effort put into the world, the story, the animations. Watch some gameplay videos and you'll know if it seems interesting. It’s misleading to call it a visual novel because you play through the story instead of just clicking through text. The graphics are really pretty, and there are a lot of different locations. The gameplay in the story sections involves talking to people, a little interacting with things, and presenting topics to people. It’s very streamlined so you don’t waste time trying out every option like in adventure games. It’ll highlight any option that you need to use, and give you an onscreen indicator that you have a topic you need to present to someone. The story involves time travel, high school, conspiracy theories, a cat, mech battles, gangs…I mean, it’s a fun story that touches on a lot of topics and genres. You play through short episodes that continue each character's story, and after the prologue you choose what character's story to play next. The tower defense sections are cool and I’m not usually a huge tower defense fan. They’re pretty easy on normal difficulty, and I enjoyed using the different abilities. Like, some characters control mechs that are for close-range damage, so you can make them jump in the air and do AOE damage. If you don’t enjoy it, you can set the difficulty on easy and just rush through it. I looked at screenshots and didn’t get why I kept hearing rave reviews of “This game deserves to be way more popular,” but I bought it and agree. The story is enjoyable to follow and slowly understand, and it’s presented in a way that feels like you’re playing through a season of a cool show. It’s a special game that just has that game magic you can’t explain.. It's difficult to find a game with a good story. Even the story driven games tend to be bland and generic. This one however is really great and worth the try. The battle system is a bit simplistic, but it serves as a nice change of pace as well. Game is pretty chaotic and that may turn some people off, especially at the beginning where you are seeing things happening on the the screen but they are so random and seem mostly unconnected, that it's a bit of a struggle to get enraged. But if you give it a chance and you reach the point the stories start to make sense and create one big narrative, you'll feel it's the best thing ever.. This is honestly a masterpiece. The biggest draw to this game is it’s story. I’ve seen haters say two things about this game’s story. “It’s so full of cliches” or “the story is way too much”. These are both not true. This story seems to start out with all the main cliches and slowly starts to destroy those cliches throughout the course of the story. You may believe you know how one character’s ark will end but it will instead completely twist and end up much more different than the cliches they’re based off of. And the story is a lot, I will admit, but anyone can figure it out if they retain some generally important information. However it perfectly balances the 13 stories and all of them are important to the story in one way or another. And in the end, the story takes a huge twist that caught me off guard. Very good plot, for sure. I liked the idea of separating a plot and an action - very innovative. Tactics part is very good, the only downside is that the last fight is harder, than all fights in the game altogether.. 13 Sentinels was a bit tough to get into, but the more I played, the more I enjoyed. This is an incredibly deep game in terms of story and will require quite a bit of investment from the player. The first thing you should be warned of is that this 'game' is split into three sections, with only one of them being actual gameplay, similar to a turn-based RPG. The second is a visual novel where you control a series of protagonists to develop the story. The third section is then a library of sorts, with mystery files you unlock to learn more of the lore. This means a brief glimpse could give you a very misleading perception of 13 Sentinels. The story of the game is the bread and butter, so let's r","13 Sentinels is a time-travel story of teenagers using giant mechs to fight aliens . the story plays on many settings of classic sci-fi films, and makes a coherent story out of them . there isn’t really much gameplay here, besides going around and talking to people ."
