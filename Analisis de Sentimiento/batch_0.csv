"1,000.Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack","Believe it or not there was a time when Ps+ was actually worth it and during that time I was blessed with this amazing platformer. The graphics are awesome to say the least, the game is challenging enough to keep a gamer entertained. Hopefully we'll see more of the same franchise, this game is a gem.. You run as a blob and eat other blobs and grow bigger and bigger, until you're as big as Godzilla eating everything in your way. Nice feeling, fun game, good times. Recommended.. Well done classic platformer with some good ideas, solid gameplay, funny story, stylish visuals and motion-sensor controlled bonus stages. It will entertain you, sometimes challenge you and makes you smile.. Tales From Space is original game. Gameplay is cool but boring after a while. Graphics, music and sounds in this game is absolutely perfect old school stuff!. A nice small game based on physics. Kind of short (finished in about 6 hours), but fun. Became kind of repetitive close to end. Very nice music but not enough tracks for variety, so it started to bug me out, and i turned it off :). Awesome side-scroller. Good amount of challenge (especially if you wanna get a gold medal on every level) very touch friendly. however, besides the gold medals, not much reason to play it more than once. still though, worth the $8.. Having got Mutant Blob Attacks as part **** bundle when I bought my PS Vita I must admit I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Playing almost like a 2D version of Katamari Damacy, each level tasks the player with collecting various objects from the game world in order to increase their size thus allowing the exit to be opened. Unlike Katamari however the difficulty is not as a result of any time limit but because of platforming sections and puzzles that require full use of your characters (the mutant blob) powers as well as a number of the Vita's feature. Each level is just the right length to be played whilst travelling on the bus or train and the game as a whole is just long enough to provide decent value for money without outstaying its welcome.. great fun. loved the way it moves from the small to the large, the mad rush of the stuff at the end, the noise, the hard-to-find areas. great platforming, great colour, great sounds, great value. Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is an creative platform game from DrinkBox Studios the same team that brought us Guacamelee! Even though it is not as ambitious as Guacamelee! was, this platform´er at least as lovely and fun to play, and everybody who likes a good platform´er should check it out!. I wasn't at all surprised to see that (at least at the time I wrote this) there were only positive reviews for this game. I heard this was a fun game back at launch but hadn't really gotten on board the Indy train yet, but I'm glad I finally gave it a try. It is simply a fun, charming, challenging while not frustrating game. You would think a game about a rolling blob would get stale fast, but I'll give it to drinkbox, they are constantly throwing in new little twists to the gameplay. I gave it to my wife to try who is far from an avid gamer and she really enjoyed it. It does a great job of using the Vita's different features without making it feel like a chore. If you like Mario or little big planet do yourself a huge favour and drop a few bucks on this game.. Felt like a cross between Sushi Cat, Katarmi Damacy, the credit sequence to the Pixar film incredibles (sort of.. in art style.. kinda..) and.. well pretty much any modern platformer. There's no huge leaps in innovation in store for you and it's not a particularly challenging game, I imagine most people will breeze through the levels in 2 or 3 moderate sessions. But it's a charismatic little beast. The art style is charming, the cut sequences funny and whilst the individual components to the games core mechanics might not be that new, the combination of them was quirky enough to keep me fully entertained the entire time. Replay wise, I'd say that the game has a fair bit to offer too, there are hidden collectibles on each level but more importantly, a global score board. In well known games a global score board is usually a bit of a waste of time as there are so many people competing the odds are you wont get anywhere near the top 100. But in mutant blobs (for now at least) the board is not so over saturated that its an impossible task to get down into double digits, offering a nice incentive to really push your skills to the edge. When I bought this game it was on sale on Steam and cost me slightly under £3. At that price, you're practically mugging yourself not to buy it. What could have made it better? ->More levels ->Option to play against either your best time's ghost or your nearest best adversary on the score boards ghost.. Surprisingly good,got it with my plus subscription, and, well had a great time with it, everything is simple, but it does take a little creativity to get trough, so you have a real good time :D. The most fun i've had on the Vita so far! This game saved me from utter boredom on an 8 hour flight! Uses the vita's functionality perfectly in a cute, fun, interesting game with varied levels which flow seamlessly from one to the next. Not alot of replay value, but the game has a decent length. Great value for money considering how cheap it is compared to most titles, and I had more fun with this game that others that I paid more than four times for! Must have for Vita owners!. If you own a vita you must buy this game. The controls are great the story is fun and the gameplay is spot on. If you don't own it go and buy it. It's that simple.. This wonderful platformer game for a very good price really made me play it until i completed it with all trophies. Controls are awesome , also using Vita's touchscreen and motion sensors feels great. You play as a blob , which is eating everything he can and everything its smaller than him. When you eat and eat and eat you get larger to proceed to next areas where you are eating larger objects and also people , tanks and helicopters trying to shoot you down. I highly recommend to get this game for PS Vita , its not very long but getting gold medals and all blob friends in all levels can take you some time and WILL entertain you.. Just a simply wonderful game. One of the cheapest, and one of the greatest games on the Vita so far. Its controls, gameplay and art style fit together extremely well, and the humour element is more icing on the proverbial cake.. Only purchased the game after seeing it was on sale on the PS store, and i have to say it is the best £3.99 i have spent in a long time! Absolutely everything works as it should, the graphics are bright and crisp the only bad thing is the length, but for the price you can't complain!. I gave Mutant Blobs a 7. It's a visually lovely bite size platformer with a few shortcomings but ultimately it is what it says on the box. There's some replay value in finding all of your little mutant blob friends, and of course collecting as many points as you want, there's also leaderboards which I personally don't care for. I'll no doubt jump back in every now and then for a bit of mindless fun, but the pretty aesthetics aside, Mutant Blobs is a shallow gaming experience reflected by it's budget price. It is however, a nice showcase of the Vita's software variety.. Mutant blobs attack s the best tales from space game and one of the best game on the vita. The controls fell fluid just roll into things to pick them up. With a great sound track, level design and top notch graphics. The story is simple and easy to follow with some very funny moments. Its just a ton of fun to play i only have one complaint and that's it is to short but for £3.79 its a must buy.. This was a fun game with a fun story to it. The controls worked very well and included all the Vita's functions sensibly. The puzzles were creative, and for the price, this game easily has the best value. Unfortunately it's a short playthrough and there's not much replay value after attaining all the trophies, which took me around 3 hours.. A fun and clever little side-scroller you can pick up off the store for 8 bucks. In a lot of ways it's like a more challenging incarnation of loco roco, and dare I say even better. It's easy to pick up and play and despite it being short, I can see this as a title I'd go back and play again just for the hell of it.. An interesting game that never seems to get boring. VERY addictive and fun too! This is a must have game for anyone who likes to kick back, switch off and enjoy video gaming.. This is the best deal available for the VIta if you missed out on getting Motorstorm RC for free. It is a great little platformer that is fun for all ages. It does have some challenging levels towards the end and some hard to get trophies if you are a trophy ****. Worth every penny - very highly recommended.. Another gem that every Vita owner should have in their collection. Wonderful fun game design and execution! And for the price it's a great deal. Highly recommend.. I loved it. This was a short and sweet game at an inexpensive price. There was a fun art style, the game looks great on the Vita, and the game play was fun from start to finish. I highly recommend Mutant Blobs Attack to anyone who owns a Vita system.. One of the cheapest games for the Vita is also one of the best. If you own a Vita there's no excuse for not buying this wonderful platformer. And the online ranking system, will make you keep coming back to beat your own personal scores. This game is totally worth every penny. I bought this game because of the great reviews, and am happy I did. It is the first Vita game I feel is a 'Must Buy.' Every time I pick up my Vita, this is the first game I go to - fun and addictive - the way a handheld game should be. Plus, it is priced right for a handheld game. If Vita wants to make something of itself, it needs more games priced below $10 like this one. Buy it now! You won't be disappointed.. To be short and to the point - If Sony can get developers to make more games of this quality and stick them up for a fiver, the Vita would be more appealing to potential buyers of the console. Personally, I've bought all of the games that are Â£9 or under, and compared to the 3 or 4 full priced games I bought, with exception to Everybodys Golf (Hotshots golf in the US), I've spent a heck of a lot more time on the budget titles than the supposed AAA titles so far....... These types of games could be the new ""Minis"" for the Vita.. This is fun! Neat physics that complement, not hinder gameplay. Detailed artwork, ironic backgrounds and a fitting soundtrack makes this a well rounded package. For that price, a no-brainer.. Good game, good price, good graphics... I'm enjoying the slow paced nature of the game, only enviromental enemies, plenty of time to explore, maybe it will change soon enough but I think this people nailed it with the art style and gameplay.. This is by far one of the best games on the vita. It is addictive, fun,and cheap. It also utilizes all the function of the vita very well. I would of rated this higher if it was longer, but other then that it is perfect. Agreed with other reviewer, didn't expect too much for $8, then was awesome. Maybe you could say it was too short, but, then again, I payed so much less for this than other games that ended up costing me 50 bucks.... and i had already spent all my money on memory cards. :). This game was a real surprise. It started off as a harmless platformer, but it just kept getting better and better. I feel bad because it's the most fun of any of the vita games I got at launch and it was the cheapest! The only launch game that deserves a 10 IMHO.","the game is a classic classic with some good ideas, solid gameplay, funny story, stylish visuals and motion-sensor controlled bonus stages . it will entertain you, sometimes challenge you and make you smile . besides the gold medals, not much reason to play more than once ."
"1,001.Max Payne 3","Please add FPS Boost support on The Xbox Series X|S . PLEASE ROCKSTAR GAMES. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Gripping Masterpiece (10/10) Max Payne 3 is not just a game; it’s an experience that transcends the typical boundaries of the action genre. From the moment you plunge into its gritty world, the game immerses you in a dark narrative filled with complex characters and a haunting atmosphere. The storyline follows Max Payne, a former NYPD detective turned bodyguard in São Paulo, as he grapples with his past while fighting against a backdrop of corruption, betrayal, and **** of the standout aspects of Max Payne 3 is its writing. The narrative is rich and layered, weaving a tale that is both personal and universally resonant. The game’s script is filled with sharp dialogue that feels authentic and deeply reflective of Max’s troubled psyche. The internal monologues are beautifully crafted, providing insight into Max's thoughts and emotions, which adds a profound depth to the **** dialogue is not only well-written but also expertly delivered. The voice acting is top-notch, with James McCaffrey reprising his role as Max, bringing a gravitas and vulnerability to the character. Each line is infused with a sense of weariness and dark humor that feels true to the series, enhancing the overall immersion.Moreover, the game's ability to balance the intense action sequences with moments of introspection is brilliantly executed. The writing captures the essence of noir storytelling, making every cutscene and dialogue exchange feel significant. The philosophical undertones and existential themes explored through Max's journey elevate the game beyond mere shooting mechanics, engaging players on a deeper **** terms of presentation, Max Payne 3 excels with its stunning visuals and atmospheric sound design, which complement the writing perfectly. The cinematic flair and innovative storytelling techniques, including the use of graphic novel-style cutscenes, further enhance the narrative **** conclusion, Max Payne 3 is a masterclass in storytelling within video games. Its exceptional writing and dialogue not only serve to propel the plot forward but also leave a lasting impression on the player. This game is a must-play for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted narrative combined with thrilling gameplay—an unforgettable journey that deserves its perfect score.. I find it hard to believe that Rockstar have still not started doing anything about the continuation of Max Payne 3, It is in my opinion one of the best third person shooters of all time.. This game could have been better. The beginning of the game is perfect, but if you get to the end of the game, bugs and how many NPCs there are like in the 80s throw you. 2 painkillers fill the life of a single bullet.. Replayed on Xbox series X in 2024. A Rockstar gem. The only problem is that it continues at 30fps on Xbox, a shame. The point and shoot system is very satisfying. One of those games that is always worth replaying!. This game is an absolute masterpiece. I did'nt really like the story that much, but the missions and the combat were amazing so that's a 9 for me.. One of the best TPS of all time. I loved it, Amazing combat, amazing soundtrack, amazing story, apart from some issues this game is a true masterpiece.. Rockstar Games developed this belated sequel to Remedy's classic shooters. It has a more contemporary setting, but retains the ""film noir"" aspects. The bigger scale action is very Hollywood-esque and rivals the ""Uncharted"" games. Rockstar also added bonus modes, unlockable golden weapons and competitive multiplayer to the mix. It's just as good as its predecessors. Overall, I would rate this with a 9 out of 10.. Feels insanely good. I lost track of time playing this. The story tries to do things that it doesn't commit to, especially in terms of commentary about racism, colonialism/imperialism, racism, etc. They end up feeling hollow because of Rockstar's mistreatment of workers.. This game on an Xbox Series with a proper 4K TV looks like it just came out. And plays better than most games which came out this year. Fact. Play this game. NOW.. This is not game, this is movie. Repetitive TPS game with more cutscenes where Max is talking nonsense. Stranglehold is better than this bulls..t.This score is crazy man,definitely doesn't even deserve 50 points.. Best TPS game of all time with some of the best gunplay in terms of tight controls great physics and bullet wounds and slow mo along side a kill cam really set this game apart from other TPS games.. Today out of boredom I played Max Payne 3 and dedicated the entire day to it. This game is still great despite almost twelve years having passed. In 2024, the game is still good and hasn't lost its **** shooting mechanics, bullet time, still demonstrate that an action shooter can be interesting and have its own mechanics. I like the mechanic of coming back to life if you had healing on you; it's quite an interesting concept for those (like me) who forget to use previously acquired healing **** for the storyline, it shows that it was possible to write a well-crafted plot and conclude the story of the titular character in a good way. The concept of sending a former cop, Max Payne, to work as a bodyguard for some wealthy personality is great. The idea of involving him in such intrigue is also dazzling and refreshing for those times. This storyline presents itself much better than in most AAA games from 2020-2024.I recommend this game to everyone who hasn't played it yet. Anyone who would like to play it should play the previous parts. However, it's not required; it can be understood without it, and that's also good. Still, anyone who played this game in the years 2012-14 should play it again!. Amazing arcade style shooter with super fun mechanics and awesome physics. Definitely one of my must plays, I can't recommend this game enough!. Due to the stringent nature of my parents, I was only permitted to play Max Payne 3 instead of Grand Theft Auto 5. I found this game to be exceptionally impressive, particularly in terms of its gunplay, gory visuals, and captivating graphics. I thoroughly enjoyed Max Payne 3, particularly the slow-motion shooting sequences it featured. I am eagerly anticipating the prospect of Rockstar developing a fourth installment or eventually releasing a port of Max Payne for the PS4.. Playing this at the end of 2023 ! Amazing game . Its like Developers forgot how to make great games with great storys like max payne 3 . Graphics hold up good as well. 10/10.. My God, the story, the gameplay, the speed, the gore, everything was better. It was everything I wanted and more. I hated some of the story, but I understood that it was part of Payne's curse. Great game, really recommend the trilogy :D. It's a must to play it.. Max Payne 3 is the peak of the 3rd person shooter genre.. Hands down the best TPS game of all time the Physics,Tight and fuild Gunplay combined with bullet holes entries and exit holes make this thepincclucle of theThird person shooters and still feels as good to play today as it day over ten years ago. Max as chracter in maxpayne 3 is also one of the best in gaming.. If Xbox can't figure out why they aren't at least going toe to toe with Sony these days, it's because they forgot how to release games like these. One of the best shooter franchises, no stealth, just balls to the wall fire-fights. The story is grim, but pairs well with the intense action.. Feels like I'm back to when I was 11 years old before GTA V ever came out, when I first played it, it was kind of hard for me to remember when I ever played it, a few days ago when it was for sale on Games for Gold deals I decided to buy again since I recently brought Hyperkin's revision of 360 controllers for Xbox One and Series game consoles when I started playing it again, I'm starting to feel the Payne inside of me following the old roots of the game, the weapon wheel was familiar to GTA V one, and the combat was almost GTA as well, but I ignore quite well when I was playing as Max Payne, the story was great during its time, I was loving the Payne of the action and drama genre of the scenes, it wasn't Payne of me dying about 50 times in my playthrough and when I got done playing the story now I'm starting to feel the Payne of The Max. The granddaddy of bullet time returns with a similarly lead-riddled storyline involving a kidnapped Brazilian heiress. The blasting is pretty much non-stop to the point where it resembles a third person version of a shooting gallery game thanks to the linear structure and a total lack of variation in gameplay. Technically well done but those not so enamoured with shoot 'em ups will find it very, very repetitive.. Max Payne are legendary games. The first two parts have a dark and dirty setting. Max Payne 3 has another approach, which works just as good. Overall rating: 8.8.. Max Payne 3 is the pinnacle of third-person shooter games. While the previous two titles were developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Rockstar Games, this installment was both developed and published by Rockstar. Although it sheds some of the layers of the past, such as the heavy emphasis on neo-noir elements and trading in the dark and lonely nights in New York City for sunny and crowded days in São Paulo, Brazil, the title feels like a natural evolution of what came before. Max’s character remains consistent with his journey in the previous games, and the plot follows a similar formula and story beats to the original titles. The gameplay of Max Payne 3 is often cinematic and brutal. Shooting feels exceptionally polished, coupled with enhanced returning features, and new mechanics that further strengthen the intense combat. Like previous installments, the plot of Max Payne 3 is divided into several chapters that are sorted into three acts. Max, himself, serves as the narrator of the events of the game, while occasionally chiming in with thoughts that he has in certain moments. The game is also told in a nonlinear fashion, as it opens with a look at the final confrontation, and a few of the chapters take place in the past, establishing Max’s reason for moving to São Paulo. The cast of this title is fairly small, with only a handful of clients and antagonists for players to keep track of during the narrative. Nearly a decade after the tragic events of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, a new crisis surfaces in South America. Left with few options following a bloody scuffle in New Jersey, disgraced former NYPD detective Max Payne flees his home country to pursue what is promised as a temporary distraction. However, what should have been a string of easy paydays quickly devolves into more of the same bloodshed on different lands. Outnumbered, outwitted, and outgunned, Max quickly comes to the realization that he has bitten off much more than he was ready to chew: facing death at every turn, with few reliable allies, unable to speak the local language, at his lowest point of health, in unfamiliar territory. Grappling with severe addiction and long-held misery, Max drags himself along from failure to failure until he finally comes to a costly realization: Max must swear off his demons and adapt to this new environment, committing himself fully to unraveling a terrible conspiracy. Choosing to drive his own stake deep into the matter, Max openly challenges near-endless waves of bloodthirsty gang members and soulless paramilitary brutes. His unstoppable rampage through the tattered state of São Paulo echoes the ferocity of the Max Payne of old, as the former detective desperately chases after a chance to right old wrongs, avenge his fallen clients, and claim a recovery long overdue. Eleven years later, Max’s third outing continues to be a tough comparison to many recent third-person shooters. This game is an old school shooter, primarily guiding the player’s focus to two elements: the narrative and the shooting. There are no side quests or upgrades for the player to grind out, as progression is based solely on the player’s skill as they navigate through their difficulty level of choice. With linear chapters, little side content that disrupts the flow of the narrative and levels, and a lack of role-playing elements that may otherwise over-bloat the game, Max Payne 3 excels in compelling players to root for its titular character as he fights his way toward his new lease on life. This installment is stocked with a vast array of weapons to wield, new cover and second chance systems, and updated Bullet Time and kill cam mechanics. Gunplay and intensity reach cinematic peak in this installment. Varied level design, a lack of load screens and natural transitions between cutscene and gameplay, immersive physics, heavily detailed environments, brutal gore, and relentless enemies only add further compliments to the experience. The game even delivers a sequence that manages to create a pure adrenaline rush and captures the kind of climactic cinematic experience seen in levels like the Suicide Mission in Mass Effect 2 and the final Warthog Run in Halo 3. Max Payne 3 is among the best shooters I have played, sporting a strong pairing of polished gunplay and an inspired character journey. Rockstar’s contribution to this series is an underrated title that gives a fitting sendoff to its haunted protagonist and an action experience that is worth playing through to completion. Thankfully, all three Max Payne titles were added in with the final batch of games made backwards compatible on newer Xbox consoles, allowing for many more players to experience the entirety of this series.. Max Payne's third installment is old, but gold. I recently returned to Max Payne 3 to fairly review and I have to say it has aged like fine wine. The game is enjoyable, gunplay is amazing as always, and offers some of the best story telling in what I see as the ""magnum opus"" of the franchise. It is sad that this is the final installment in such a great trilogy. The game has some stale moments however, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone looking for high octane gunplay and great storytelling.. Good to see you finally retire, Max! Especially in my country! Look, Max Payne 3 is a fine game. I had a lot of fun with it and loved finally concluding this trilogy. The gameplay was improved from the previous one, they managed to successfully change the environments and the game's tone. The writing is still pretty cool and Max is still a badass protagonist. Voice acting alone could convince you to fall for this game, in fact. Even if it feels, at times, quite forced, with exaggerated plot points and murky point of views. But it IS supposed to be a moody noir game after all and they manage to sell this through storytelling, bloody set pieces and frenetic gunplay. I also really liked how they set this one in Brazil. Not only for the necessary change of pace that the game (and character) needed, but also from the perspective of someone who lives in a coastal city in São Paulo. They hyperbolize and dramatize the country's crime gangs A LOT, but they did it in an interesting way, nailing a few of the environments, from the rich to the poor ones, as well. What mostly **** this game up are problems from the past, though. The same things I hated back in the previous both games are still present. Somehow improved, sure, but still a mess. Clunky aiming, weird cover system, too edgy, mindless shooting endless enemies, repetitive level design, weak replay factor, Max Payne's life is made of thin paper and too many bullet-sponge-soldiers. I swear, you could shower someone in bullets but some **** just refused to fall. Felt like Gears of War, but without sense, because you fight humans here. Playing this game on harder difficulties must not be fun at all. I also felt like this game took longer than it should. Outstaying your welcome by doing the same flaws, repeating things over and over, just isn't good. Especially right at the end of a trilogy, with an actual cool story. It just kills the rhythm. So, yeah, I'm glad Max finally retired. It was a fun ride and I do recommend this game if you've played the other ones. But, honestly, I'm pretty much done here. Enjoy Bahia, Max!. I love this game I played it when it first came out and now again on the Xbox series x great story great graphics takes the best from the old Max Payne games mixes it up with gta like game play.... This is probably my favourite Xbox 360 shooting game that is only let down by the cutscene you can skip if you want to play the game again. The cutscenes are very good to work that and good to watch but sadly. They take away too long off the game time. I would have liked are always skippable. This is one of those games. I recommend in playing on normal at least if you using a controller because the game crave so much precision that I would recommend it, energy getting pierced by the bullet and the movement feel heavy so it feels good to move. I can hear they have a different writer for Max Payne and he is still the same voice actor but the way he talks is different I get used to it, but it isn't the same exit in the two first games. Everytime I play this game. I want to enjoy it as much as possible and for that. I will recommend staying in cover as Little as possible because just you shootingdodging all the time is way more fun.. On xbox 360 rockstar give what we the fans deserve HARD CORE ACTION GAME with the legendary MAX PAYNE probably one my favourite game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For 360 this game was average. I loved the story, that alone was a 10/10. I just hated the cut scenes and the blur they would do in the game. It really dropped the score for me. I would love another one. I really would. Or a remastered edition. I would very much enjoy giving this game another chance with it's minor flaws fixed. It has so much potential to becoming a perfect game.. Eventually, the GTA and Max Payne sensibilities came together. It's the most cynical, gory and cinematic Max Payne to date. Also, that's why it feels really dated in 2022. Pros: * James McCaffrey now portrays Max not only in voice, but also in body. * You can shoot grenades mid-air. * Sao Paolo looks really dirty, levels are highly detailed and you get onto shoot outs all over the sightseeing spots. In general, replacing NY cold with SP heat was a stroke of genius. * They don't translate Portuguese! That feels very authentic and helps to show Max as gringo. * I enjoyed the storyline here better then MP2 (yes, it's an unpopular opinion). Cons: * This game has more cutscenes than shootouts (ok, I'm exaggerating a little). But during the second play-through that becomes much more visible and annoying. That part didn't date well. * The over-the-top brutality entertained me 10 yrs ago (as I've never seen anything like that before), but now it feels overly gratuitous and not necessary. This game is a teenager take on what 'adult content' looks like. * Gameplay itself gets old faster then it should. W/o auto-aim the game is too hard. With auto-aim -- too easy. It had never found a difficulty balance for me that I could enjoy. * The resolution is too low. I played this on Series X, and the age shows in resolutions. Models and levels are cool. But any time you need to shoot smth in the distance, you start pixel hunting. * Achievements are unreasonable.. Great, intensive gameplay, nice plot, incredibly enjoyable shooting. Love the game!. In the first Max Payne 3 it is still neonoir. Second, this is probably the best game of 2012. It is still relevant, modern 3-person actions with shelters have not moved much in front. Here is an integral plot with excellent gameplay, not microtransaction and great gun-play. Personally, I liked the change of setting for the series, but there is nostalgia for cold and night New York, but it would hardly seem boring to see this 3 times. I advise everyone to try, especially not, who missed the first 2 parts.. A return to glory for this franchise. Great story and graphically, it is easy to forget that is is being played on the 360 because Rockstar did a great job pushing the system to its limits.. I honestly would've rated this two or three points higher but I want to account for all the fanboys giving it a perfect 10 (some who admit they're giving it a higher than deserved score to make up for all the haters.. ironic). The game is not *terrible*, but like other low score reviews, I agree that the gameplay is not good either. The character actions are difficult to control (movement, aiming, gun selection, etc), and just when you're feeling confident and getting the hang of things after successfully handling a shootout you get hit with yet another cutscene that immediately makes you lose control of Max. Then, just when you start to follow the story of that cutscene, you're put right in the middle of a bunch of enemies with no idea of precisely when you gain full control and take action. It feels like you're taking part in the story in a haphazard way, never really being able to fully enjoy a cutscene without feeling anxious that you could be put in a shootout any second, but then never really getting into the game as a player because you're also arbitrarily taken out of control just to go over another cutscene. It wouldn't be so bad (but it'd still be bad) if the story itself was good, but it's just mediocre at best, the dialogue gets tiresome, and overall it doesn't have that classic Max Payne feel like the original.. Rockstar proving that they are also one of the best at making linear games, but again they are unfair with another of their games. It is not that he was not chosen goty of his year but that they gave him very few awards. a shame. The game is not too long and the ending is too Hollywood but those are its least favorable points. the story is closely followed, it is realistic, cruel, harsh and even complicated. Max payne 1 and 2 are great games but max payne 3 is not far behind and rockstar has managed to give it its personal touch The gameplay is without a doubt the best of the game. Being able to shoot and aim while moving in the third person, being able to rotate 360º on yourself when aiming even on the ground, take cover, bullet time, how good the gunplay feels being able to carry two weapons at the same time even being different, its different missions such as the sniper copied by other games in 2013, the zip line and being able to shoot at the same time. Each chapter feels different and the i.a. of the enemies is at a good level, the physics are incredible with the last death bullet created in real time and its effects on the bodies, the physics of Max when he moves carrying the weapons changes and the weight is felt when running, move. This game is very undervolorized It is an ideal game for speedrun lovers with a trophy / achievement of passing it without dying, with quite challenging regressive time. Online is very addictive, but many of its modes are paid dlc's and there are people who prefer it that way before gta / rdr micropayments, because they are very wrong. This an amazing game that never fails to make me feel like a bad ass. The whole Max Payne series is a group of great games. All of them are filled with action and great characters, but this one just stands out to me as the one and only Max Payne game that makes you feel like you are in the body of Max. (:. Max Payne is a brand when it comes to atmospheric third person shooters. While the first two parts of the series had a dark depressing mood, the third installment follows another approach. The fallen hero never changed, just the setting. And this brave step by the publisher leads you to an action packed blockbuster movie game that leaves no cross unturned. A terrific but way too short game. Personally, I recommend the PlayStation 3 version due to its better controls.. Max Payne 3 is a masterpiece. Max Payne 3 is a third person shooter set in modern times. The story is great. This game is average. This was developed completely by Rockstar and as hard as they try, they can't pull off the same quality as Remedy when it comes to writing. They also added cover mechanics which just completely ruin the core gameplay of Max Payne in my opinion.. A beautiful game that caps off Max's story like a classic Western. Logan in video game form.. Love this story and atmosphere! Beautiful action game! Thanks for developers and very recommended!!!!. Awesome game, i really enjoied the time playing it, finished twice. For those that say it has long cut scenes they dont consider they exist to hide the load screens wich is better than have to see a black screen constantly. Also the game takes into consideration a precuel comic wich ties Max Payne 1 & 2.. To put it simply, this is hands down the most underrated video game of all time. i'll stand by that for the rest of my life.. Extremely One-Dimensional, Linear and Overrated. When it comes to Rockstar third-person games - if you like true story-led detection then LA Noire is far better (albeit repetitive and not that great either). If you like third-person gun battles with a great story, Red Dead Redemption is for you (a truly great game). Max Payne 3 feels like a very poor cross between those two games and as a result can be compared to, and totally outclassed by, Resident Evil 4 (so, if you've never played it download yourself the HD version of that instead). Review score: 5/10 This score may seem low, but is fair and truthful. If the content of this game had been polished to perfection the maximum score it could attain should still only be 7/10. Due to sheer lack of gameplay variety, content and its linearity any score of 7 or above is impossible, or Rockstar's best games, which are at least 10x bigger and better, would be due scores far greater than 10/10.. This one has Rockstar's label of quality, although not being perfect. Ok, it's a linear game, but it's inevitable playing missing freedom gived by Rockstar's open world games, it's kinda make playing feeling stucked and lefted a few options what to do. About gameplay, it has GTA's shooting mechanicals, what is very good, making playability best thing about this game, counting to style of hiding, that works well too. Story is interesting too, but not intriguing as seen in another producer games. Not really stain perfect Rockstar games library, but isn't amazing, much less bad, just a good game.. After the emotionally intimate first chapters in this trilogy, we return to protagonist Max Payne as he's pretty much given up on life. He's a drunk bodyguard for a wealthy family when everything just seems to go wrong and he has to find it in himself to step up to the plate one last time and seize his chance for redemption. Gotta say, I played this game 5 years ago and loved it but after finally playing the first two, this one pales in comparison. I didn't care about the trials and tribulations that he went through and I felt as though this was an unnecessary final chapter in an otherwise perfect saga of games. The game was extraordinarily glitchy (NO textures aside from the backgrounds loaded in 2 separate missions so I just had to run around in circles avoiding invisible walls until prompted with a button-command or cutscene transition). The story felt like it dragged on and I got bored of it fairly quickly; all of the missions felt the same and after awhile, uninspired. If you haven't played the first two games, then this one could be a lot of fun but after playing the others, this ending disappointed me greatly. I'm giving it a 70% because I still had a good time and since this is a Rockstar game, I feel the need to explain why it's not a 100%.. Storytelling so i love, with non-chronological chapters. Addictive, wanted to finish the game as soon as possible. The only drawback of this game is a schematic, too much monotony and irrational number of people to kill. That why when i finish the game i felt relief. Shame because it was the only game that i finished a couple of years. Almost a masterpiece but a little lacking to achieve this title.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic game. The story is a great length and on par with the best that Hollywood has to offer. The shooting and cover mechanics are excellent and the game is a joy to play. Worth every penny that you pay for it.. A definite departure from the classic Max Payne of the PS2 games but boy is this a top notch shooter! Fantastic character driven story which has a super fast pace to it. Bullet time and last man standing are exhilarating. The script, voice acting and graphics are fantastic. Quite possibly Rockstars most underated game.. This is interesting game with interesting story . Very many different cutscenes . Very Very good graphics . This is best game of 2012 . This is good returns of Max Payne series . Awesome gameplay . This is gooooooood game . 10/10. Just want to say I love this game. Thanks Rockstar for making such a gritty, real feeling shooter where the stakes are real from the difficulty, the graphics are exceptional, the gun-play brutal, stylish and just as it should be and the atmosphere never lets up. Replaying this in 2016 and having a superb time, when I'm having trouble keeping my attention on any of the new releases this grabs you and doesn't let go and gives you a hell **** time.. There is much to say as to why I don't like this game. For one, on harder difficulties in older Max Paynes, (1 and 2), it wasn't gut wrenchingly cheap to the point where an enemy (excluding the few and far between bosses) can take a headshot, their helmet simply fly off (and I know I hit them in the mouth where they're exposed) and they return fire and kill you. And the ""minibosses with shotguns"" or whatever they decided to throw in here are absolute BS on hard. You could sit there with a submachine gun wailing on their heads with every round, yet I guarantee at some point they will get the upper hand and make you waste on of your health items just because Rockstar doesn't know **** about boss design. Yeah, after a few deaths the game will give you a break and give you some painkillers or whatever when it reloads your last autosave, but even then, it's usually barely enough and it feels like pure luck when you finally make it through. Why not just reduce the enemy count? Or hell, why not just make these ""everything but a headshot only phases me"" bulletsponge horse**** enemies take a few less shots to kill on the next reload? Also, who the **** is the guy going behind Max and locking every single door? Why? What's the purpose of this? When there's collectables involved, things like this in a game are even more frustrating. I don't understand why Max Payne needed a cover system, what this boils down to is, ""wait for the enemy to reload and hit him in the head"" or, ""blindly fire an automatic gun into a hallway full of bad guys."" It's redundant, Max Payne already had its own unique and entertaining system for avoiding fire and giving you an edge over the enemies, and yeah, it's still in here, but you waste half of your bar just from one leap, and it's bundled with an unecessary second wind mechanic. Or at least, it would've been uncessary if they toned down the hit-detecting AI that pin-point shot your head if you so much as one of Max's hairs pop out of cover. Then there's the story, yeah ok, MP1 Max gets revenge on people who wronged him, MP2, he gets his revenge on the remaining people. Here? They use the backstory of 1 and 2 to shoehorn him into some white knight role, not to mention at one point they make Max look like a total moron if you find a certain clue during one of the flashback sequences. Max might not be the smartest guy, but after finding that clue, it's like they didn't even try to dev","the storyline follows Max Payne, a former NYPD detective turned bodyguard in So Paulo . the game's script is filled with sharp dialogue that feels authentic and deeply reflective of Max's troubled psyche . the voice acting is top-notch, with James McCaffrey reprising his role as Max, bringing a sense of weariness and dark humor ."
"1,002.Skate","This is definitely the best skateboarding game, the main things that make it a very iconic game is its flickit game system which is ultimately the best system for a game of this type and also its extensive customization that makes it a very good game Apart from that, one of the things that also makes it quite good is the range of famous skaters and challenges 10/10. My love for the skate franchise is huge. I started with Skate 3 and then I was curious to play the prequels. They didn't disappoint. I love the fact that this game works with sponsors.. Great game, although not as polished as 2 or 3. .. The first game in the Skate series laid the foundations for what a good skateboarding game could do that wasn't Tony Hawk inspired.. Activision and Neversoft's Tony Hawk games were already on a steady decline in popularity by the time 2007 rolled around so it was probably the perfect time for Black Box and EA to release Skate. The first Skate game came out at the special time where Tony Hawk games were no longer must by games but the extreme sports genre of gaming wasn't yet ready to go into hibernation. This is what lead Skate to become the top dog of skating video games for a few years, along with the completely unique approach to the sport with a more realistic portrayal and completely revamped control system. At the time, Skate was the best skateboarding simulator anyone could ask for. It had a wide array of tricks, a completely open world map full of dreamlike skate spots, a character creator, a list of legendary pros... I could go on. When Skate was released, I'd never played anything like it beforehand. The closest comparison I can make is the SSX games, another EA extreme sports franchise. Despite the obvious connection to the Tony Hawk games, SSX and Skate have much more similar control schemes. Even the presentation of the first Skate game reminds me a lot of SSX On Tour's presentation. Anyway, Skate is a great game. The only reason I'm not rating it higher is because it was heavily outshined by its sequels. I beat this game in February of 2020.. Great game. Such good steering, feeling, music,voices!! Very playable game! It is my favorite!. the original Skate is a decent game. The physics in this one aren't quite to the level of the 3rd game but better than the 2nd **** whole security chasing you thing can be pretty annoying,particularly if you are trying to do an **** controls scheme is excellent however,with the FlickIt control system.These can cause problems though,as in challenges where you have to copy a trick,it's lack of precision can result in you failing the challenge. The graphics are medicore,though the framerate remains solid throughout the whole game. The sound design is mediore,but the soundtrack is good. Overall,the original Skate ranks inbetween 2 and 3 for quality for **** has the better physics and single-player design,but gets crushed by Skate 3 in almost every ****'s still worth playing however.. Outstanding and fun mechanics, not to mention the realism... If tony hawk's is the need for speed of skating games, then Skate is GT/Forza, because it is more of a simulator... But never than less, it is fun... Skate 2 and 3 are also incredible but the first one is had more impact on me... It was innovative for the time.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game i played because the soundtrack the story and the feeling of the game its not objective based like skate 2 or skate 3 and i honestly dont like skate 3. Surprisingly innovative and hugely enjoyable, Skate (and its sequels) is a refreshing alternative to the endless button mashing of the Tony Hawk series, which have long been the go-to skateboarding game. Skate sets a new standard for realism in skateboarding games, with accurate collision detection, great physics and the beautifully implemented flick-it controls. There's an incredible amount of replay value, the city overflowing with spots to skate - everywhere you look you'll find new and unique places. While the graphics are somewhat mediocre and the character animation (especially on NPCs), Skate more than makes up for its negative qualities with its endlessly fun and unique gameplay.. The revival of an almost death genre, Activision did good stuff with Tony Hawk, the consequences? it made so many Tony Hawks you can't count how many were developed. While EA observed every move, of his rival, there you go, now you have Skate. Skate is something new with a pretty nice touches for a franchise that i didn't expect to have anything new on it. The soundtrack ( as always) is great. Skate goes with stylish direction.. Repetitive, annoying dross, doesn't compare to the decent TH games by a long way. If you like repeating the same move over and over again until the game decides you've done it enough and lets you move on to the next bit where you repeat some more then you will like this, otherwise avoid.",the first game in the Skate series laid the foundations for what a good skateboarding game could do that wasn't Tony Hawk inspired . the flickit game system is ultimately the best system for a game of this type and also its extensive customization that makes it a very good game . i beat this game in February of 2020 .
"1,003.Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning","Warhammer Online and later Return of Reconing is the best game of my life, where I have spend countless number of hours! This is the closest to the living in the Warhammer Fantasy world I had so far. Plus I was able to play it with my daughter, showing her Warhammer Fantasy and teaching about absolutely everything! That was super bonding for us!. If the game had not closed, it would have been a worthy competitor to World of WarCraft.. Without a doubt this is the best online game thanks to his amazing **** levels of fun that you can have with a good leader and a good party is out of this **** clases are very interesting and with their own **** world of Warhammer is **** only complain is that the system of rewarding players with renown points needs to revert to the old catch the flag gain the points style.. is beat by wow and age of conan, the latter impressing me the most with epic 24man raids, and great openworld pvp more importantly warhammer seems to be dying some more(maybe bioware is too). there are a lot of things that just plain disappoint me about this game.. i mean its WARHAMMER.. one of the best fantasy worlds ever created. i play and love the tabletop game and i read a lot of the books as well.. but i mean this mmo is just plain dull. the characters move sets are slow and casting times take a while.. there's no normal attack so everything requires action points. compared to wow in the combat area it lacks greatly. where wow might have some slower cast moves it keeps the speed and excitement up with lots to pull off and your basic attack for some classes to be going at the same time. another thing is the world looks great but theyr isnt enough of it.. no expansions ither witch is a huge letdown. they needed to add more races i would love to play skaven with all my heart!!!!!. the story is dull and boring and could have been worlds better, why not have some epic quests including some good characters like gotrek and felix or a fight against grey seer thanquol :( sadly gotrek and felix just stand in a bar and do f*%k all all day year after year. if they wanted this game to be good they should not have only copied wows ENGINE.. they should have taken inspiration from the game as well and made it more epic with more of an rpg feel and a bigger world to travel and explore. instead its just all pvp and who owns what zones which is a cool idea but it kills the whole rpg exploration and epic adventure feel for me completely :(. i was so excited when i walked into my first town.. only to find out that you couldnt even go in any of the buildings and every npc was standing out infront of them.. and this was a problem that plauged the ENTIRE GAME. maybe once in a while you find a building you can actually explore but my god why is every other one jsut a set piece. the lands feel like they were just made with the leveling in mind.. its just a straight path with little areas cluttered with trees or rocks where all the mobs to kill are.. no dramatic area design here no no... in WoW it feels like a living breathing world. the lands are unique and you want to explore and see all there is to see and do all there is to do and there are so many hidden and extra things they just throw in for the people that want to play like that. warhammer online is just a series of small areas where you grab some xp.. meaningless enemies and meaningless, unimaginative areas and storyline.. one of the biggest letdowns of my life :. You can go RvR (PvP) untill lvl 1 and PvE is there also good dungs works better and are more fun than in games like WoW. WAR also support addons so u can customize the game by your own.. I really liked this game, good PVP, half decent graphics, PVE was **** meh...whatever... Poor customer support and constant game mechanics changes have made the servers combine down to only a few (people left in droves), and many levels are so empty now that you are shocked if you see another player since you started to think it was a single player game. I wish EA would rollback the character mechanics to an earlier time rather than just let the entire world wither and die as it is, sad really.. Played this game for almost 2 years. Waited for the company to address many player versus player issues. A good ride until you realize the top tier experience is very one sided. An unbalanced PvP game does not deserve a subscription. The guys involved with this title moved on to help with Star Wars The Old Republic. That game has tanked as well. Wait for another title, or try a free to play game.. An excellent massive pvp game with massive siege in castles and epic open massive battles nice scenario batttles and i think a usually pve content. Mythic has done some very serious mistakes in this game. First they have open too much servers and the most of them was empty. The second was that never has create a new content and the veteran players was boring to play the same things again and again.. Had so much potential, but failed, largely due to lots of lag and that the player base was spread out on far too many servers. Many of these issues were fixed in later patches, but there are still to few players, and ideas such as Public Quests and RvR is something that I think Guild Wars 2 will do several times better, when it it released.. I know many of you will discredit me when saying this, but I tried WAR coming from WoW. Tbh, I probably would not be into MMO's if it werent for the PvE of WoW. I was given 2 months of paid subscription from my friend, since he knew I played the free version and didn't like it, and I couldn't play it for more than a day... The graphics and mechanics all point towards an unfinished game, and the PvE is just terrible. PvP is decent, but I couldn't get into the RvR.. Decent game, but it was just too similar to WoW for me and it didn't have nearly as much content. That was probably what really killed it, if WoW had not been out I think it would have done much better. The pvp was fun though, I just quit before I had leveled to the maximum level so I never experienced the end-game (I went back to WoW instead). Still, it's not a bad game by any means, and today it might be worth trying out since it probably has a lot more content now than it did when it was newly released.. Played this every day for over a month, nice ideas executed poorly I expected so much more from this but it ended up being a real disappointment which is a shame really as it got old very quickly and so the initial novelty soon wore off The interaction with the other players and the environment felt very disjointed the progression past level 20 was excessively slow and the trade skills were confusing and hard to level.. This game is multi-dimensional and allows different avenues for players to explore the game experience. Free trial users can play to their hearts content in the beginners sand pit area, and discover a mini-world of unlimited free trial players there. Most players will focus on the PVP battles and contests that make up the core activities of WAR. By engaging in this constant combat and chasing the ebb and flow of the battle lines, players will not have much time to devote to the player quests and other quests that are available to explore. Specialised dungeons and mini-worlds are also available to players to venture into with an organised group occasionally. But for many, the lure of constant battle, interrupted by matched combat arenas known as scenarios, will be too great! The worlds are stunningly created and incredibly engaging. My experience with joining a player guild in the final stage of the game was the highlight. My only problem with this game is the lack of time to devote to it!. Very good pvp, great and fun classes, good community, warhammer athmosphere. I have played casual since launch ( about two year ) . I think war have best and most balanced pvp, lotro have best pve and most intresting quests and character modification, wow is mix all off these but have most fun dungeons and boss fights.. I'm not saying Warhammer is a bad game. It's just that we've already seen things like it. If you've played WoW or LOTRO, this won't have you hooked.",warhammer online and later return of reconing is the best game of my life . without a doubt this is the best online game thanks to his amazing **** levels of fun . there are a lot of things that just plain disappoint me about this mmo .
"1,004.Resident Evil 7: biohazard","One of my most favorate game of all time! The horror and suevival elements are super!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the most scariest game from the Resident Evil franchise. The story is interesting, containing some plot twists as you progress through the game, About the graphics they are good but compared to the current ones it leaves a little to be desired. Another thing that is important to mention is that this game is the first in the franchise to take place in first person In general is a game that worth to play.. The best game in the series and the most horrible and it has good character. Resident Evil 7 is a game that I put on hold for a long time. Aside from a slight personal bias of already experiencing the "" best"" through RE1R and RE2R, I can't entirely explain my precise reasoning aside from some personal bias. Additionally, the decision for Resident Evil to move from classic "" third-person"" to "" first-person"" in a more "" Outcast""-style felt a little alienating for a Resident Evil instalment. Nevertheless, I gave it a go when the opportunity arose to play this game on sale and was pleasantly surprised. While cliche, I can see what fans and critics mean by RE7 feeling in an odd position between ""Old"" and "" New"" Resident Evil. The Baker House and environment feel like the Spencer Mansion in its labyrinth-style corridors, backtracking and trap doors. ( Including some of its similar puzzle-solving.) On the other hand, unlike the original climate of RE1/ RE1R, the Baker House is pretty different in its layout and setting in Louisiana, as well as the evident Baker Family. The first thing that has to be said is that Resident Evil 7 is a stunningly aesthetic game. As one of the first major Resident Evil games pre-rendered in the RE Engine, Resident Evil 7 may feel less glossy than in 2017. However, that doesn't deny that the game is exceptionally full of detail and design in its environments and atmosphere, and most character models still look good in 2024. ( Aside from the controversial character model, who, if you know what I am on about, you will agree it was an odd design choice by the developers.) Then, we move on to the actual gameplay mechanics. Resident Evil has always relied on a third-person perspective unless we consider fewer mainstream entries, such as the more light-shooter games, Umbrella Chronicles and Operation Javier. The decision to move towards a first-person viewpoint was a gamble that paid off in the long run—playing as Ethan Winters is not only akin to the player being the main character but becoming Ethan Winters himself. The jumpscare and enemy moments are intensified in an up close and personal way, which certainly adds to the survival-horror experience. RE7 also introduces something that has been a great core to recent Resident Evil titles: the crafting mechanic ability. Surprisingly, the yellow crates from RE4 and green herbs from older titles also return, allowing players to hunt down items or materials, albeit they sometimes feel a little scarce. I wish the game did offer a slight tutorial on combinations before starting, although with some trial and error, it becomes easy to work out what combines. ( The new and unique aspect of this game's psychostimulant usage is the fun mechanic for finding items.) Additionally, the game reintroduces the idea of save rooms and item boxes and has its save room theme. ( Although the absence of the typewriter in favour of a cassette feels a little odd.) Players can get an early idea of where the developers were going with RE2R, RE3R, and Village by playing around with the stalker enemy type through Jack Baker. Baker is a formidable enemy to put down, and his relentless pursuit in the first part is slightly undermined by his inability to access certain areas and disappearances. I have mixed feelings about the side enemies of the game, the Molded. On the one hand, they are pretty terrifying to encounter for the first time up close; on the other, they feel less like the innovative Crimson Heads and more like rebranded zombies and lickers with only slight variation. Regarding writing, RE7 finds itself in a very odd position. Unlike RE1/ RE1R, where the plot and characterization were rough ( aside from the main thread in the ""traitor"" plot), RE7 has a rich narrative drive in its foreshadowing and lore. Ethan's hunt for his wife, Mia, prioritises the early part of the game, while the latter half focuses on the game's central antagonist, Eveline. Most of the cast's backstories, even our central antagonists, are surprisingly profound for a Resident Evil game. Ironically, the one character who suffers the most in the writing department is Ethan. He does have some pretty humorous voice lines which point out the absurdity of the series' long-running mechanics. However, Ethan feels and plays out in the same generic way that Chris and Jill felt in RE1R. He is an extension of the player, not a character who feels unique in himself. His reactions to his wife, as well as the situation as a whole, feel a little despondent. Overall thoughts: RE7 is often seen as the game which reimbursed the franchise's horror, and it's apparent after the calamity that was RE6, to see what fans and players alike mean by this. It takes the core elements of Resident Evil and rethinks new mechanics to create an experience that simultaneously feels familiar and unfamiliar and content-rich with its additional DLCs. ( Especially End of Zoe.) While the writing does suffer with Ethan a little, the experience of Resident Evil 7 is a rollercoaster for any fan.. This game is incredibly fun and incredibly stressful. After the disaster that was RE6, this game really drew me back to the franchise. The first person view was definitely a smart choice for this one. A must play!. The best game by far. Themost tense and fun atmosphere I have experienced with vr. Everything was so perfect that the last boring bit barely changed my opinion.. The game is very good, it's the only RE who made me scared so many times. But I don't really like the first person. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My New Favorite Resident Evil game. I was worried about this game going to 1st person because I grew up on RE. It's my favorite series. In fact, I was sad when Re4-6came out. I didn't like the direction RE was going. I know everyone loved 4 and I thought it was okay but I felt it strayed too far from the original horror element and 5 and 6 getting more and more action-oriented proved my point. Glad they rebooted the series. 7 and 8 are the best in the series! My only complaint would be the little shooting felt repetitive.. Really good, from the downhill that this series was experiencing RE7 came back to its initial ways, horror. RE7 is a horror action shooter but this time with more enfasis on horror, sound design, enviroments and atmosphere can really scare you, and when it wants to be scary it does a fantastic build up of it, tension, music and encore. Storywise the plot is simple, Ethan wants to save its wife even after she told him, if you come you will die and to forget her. But the characters are so good. The family is charming, not in a warm way, but in that they are unique and fun. They are scary filled with personality and a good chunk of lore behind especially the whats behind of some characters. Ethans allies are good too, memorable and always tranquilizes you. It has a rather traditional or cliche finale but its satisfying especially after what you have come through. Gameplay is solid going through the environments filled with detail with beatiful design is fun and scary. Getting chased is tense. Shooting is fine, a lot of times it feels really underpowered but it kinda works. The problem is who you shoot. While bosses are really good, like really good, common enemies are uninspired black monsters that the only feeling that gives you after you see the 4th one is that of boredom, repetitiveness and knowing that these tanky thing will eat all your magazine. Very few variety in all sense, not many types and nothing new to look at, which is why i havent chosen an 9/10. DLC (chris) is terrible and unfun, the ending is good, because lucas carries but its a slog. Incredible game, you dont need to play other games to understand too much. Holds up increidbly well up until this day. Dirty cheap and really fun and arguably in some istances the best resident evil.. This game is a true horror game that set resident evil back to its roots but at the same time loses that feelings once you leave the house and go to different locations which felt disappointing but still offers a good scary experience non the less. As brilliant as it is bloody, Resident Evil 7 doesn't just give the franchise a refreshing reboot, but also raises the bar for future survival horror **** we had to nitpick, we'd say the campaign's a bit short and the enemy variety slightly lacking. Those are small gripes, however, for a game that consistently gave us goosebumps the size of golf balls.. A shock for every fan that almost saw the downfall of this franchise after what happened with RE:5 and 6.. This is a masterpiece. One of the top 5 entries in the series. It took me a while to truly embrace it. ""Biohazard"" isn't so much a sequel as it is a revamp or a spin-off. The Southern Gothic setting is not what you think of when RE pops into mind. But ""Resident Evil 7"" does it right. There is still some trademark cheese, but this entry is definitely more horror than action. It pulls from many cinematic influences. You'll see ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Saw"" and ""Ringu"" all over this thing. But the gameplay is what is truly amazing. It's almost like the original ""Resident Evil"" only set in an alternate universe. Overall, this is a 9.4 out of 10.. Resident Evil 7 is phenomenal. The old lady is terrifying, and the story is top-notch. Compared to Village, it's simply overwhelming. I'm not a big fan of the main character and the first-person perspective, but the game is still amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. OMG I LOVE THIS GAME! It's the right amount of horror and suspense and the boss fights are super fun! The gameplay is really great and this is the game that revived my faith for the Resident Evil games.. My first attempt at this game with in November '22. The next in April '23, then August '23 then January '24. Never finished. Why is that? Because there's a few key problems with the game that hinders my personal enjoyment, and this is very subjective. If we just look at the objective facts: It's a decent game. The story is servicable, the characters are well written and the graphics complement the atmosphere it's going for. But it hasn't really completed these points to a place where it's great. The problem mainly stems from gameplay. It's a problem when that is the problem with your game. The gun mechanics do not feel that fun to use, there is no aiming down the sights instead they opt for a system that was outdated like 15 years ago, where the camera zooms in order to aim, and this is awful for the feel of shooting in first person. It takes me out of the game when your camera just... zooms. The guns don't really feel that nice to shoot either and that is a very subjective thing and hard to describe why it's the case but there's something that doesn't make it fun to use. The early game enemies (since I have only reached the second boss I can't speak for what happens after that) are weird humanoid monsters with very weak designs but feel awful to face. They implemented a block system in the game to take reduced damage and it felt like they designed the monsters after this or that it was a bandaid against pretty iffy monster design. They don't really stagger in a way that I could understand and that made it awful. The monsters before the second boss are even worse, as they are small insects. The bosses I managed to face were 50/50 on good and bad. The first boss is good, he feels fleshed out and he actually interacts with the player. His fights also uses some cool mechanics. The second boss feels like they put in too many resources into the first one and had to cut back. What is also annoying about the bosses is that they have phases and between the phases you have to investigate and find your way in the map classic RE style while the boss, invincible in these sections, walk around searching for you. This section is really annoying. It's supposed to increase pressure and horror on the player, but it just becomes an annoyance. There are so many poor decisions made for this game, which is very sad because it has a lot going for it outside the gameplay department. The map is great, the puzzles are nice, the atmosphere is great, too bad the gameplay is lacking.. I feel like this was the turning point for the slump resident evil franchise was in. Good game, with enjoyable gameplay. However the intro deviates heavily from the familiar formula of res games, once the intro is over the game goes back to feeling like a resident evil game. Yet ,the game does not feel like any other resident evil game in the franchise previous to this. Would recommend!. Although it was a return to the Survival Horror genre after the garbage fire that was RE5 and 6, I can't say it appealed to me. RE1, 2, and 3, were much better.. One of the best survival horror xperiences out there. game was pretty cool :). holy guacamole this thing is scary. I audibly yelped and jumped out of my seat a few times. mid last couple hours tho. Biohazard manages to keep all the best aspects of classic Resident Evil while modernizing it for today's survival-horror audience and proving the series can, in fact, evolve and mature in it's own lane, instead of trying to capitalize on modern action shooter trends. A claustrophobic, unsettling environment populated by utterly unforgiving enemies and clever puzzles make the game one of the best examples of what RE could- and should - be.. Resident Evil 7 probably will never be topped by CapCom. It takes a desperately needed simply approach to a formula that otherwise had completely lost itself. Exploring environments is better here then it ever has been, and the combat is just punchy enough to create excitement without needing to be campy or crammed with action. The only thing that irks me is the severe lack of enemy variety, which is odd for two reasons. Firstly, the resident evil franchise has never fell short on enemy variety, even in the worst of games. Secondly, the game gives you so many guns with their own unique hard to juggle ammo types that I mostly rocked the pistol and never once ran into a problem. Other than that gigantic hiccup I really loved this game and doubt CapCom can recreate its magic.. Fresh air for the franchise, excellent graphics for its settings, very convincing story, as a horror game one of the best without a doubt. Well this game where do I start the amazing charecters gameplay bosses or muisc if your a fan of survival horrors welp your in a treat resident evil 7 is a must play. resident Evilresident Evil One of the best games in the seriesOne of the best games in the series isis we can saywe can say. It is a must play in my opinion. One if the scariest games ever made. But besides the good points there is one thing i have to say, they should have done more with the baker family.. The controls take some getting used to, but once you do it’s worth it because this game has some great world building. Truly creepy and nerve racking even replaying on madhouse difficulty.. Resident Evil 7 delivers a heart-pounding experience that revitalizes the franchise with its intense horror and immersive gameplay. From its atmospheric setting to its nerve-wracking encounters, every moment keeps players on the edge of their seats. The first-person perspective adds a new layer of terror, drawing players deeper into the terrifying world of the Baker family. With stunning graphics and gripping storytelling, Resident Evil 7 earns its spot as a must-play title, securing a perfect 10/10 rating.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Would have given 7.5 here. First half of the game was a 9. The second half was a 5/10. It doesn't feel like Resident Evil at all though and I would have given the game a different title, not trying to push this into the franchise as it wasn't needed.. Resident Evil 7 Biohazard is a disappointing entry in the series that fails to capture the essence of what made its predecessors great. Lacking in thrills, variety, and compelling storytelling, the game struggles to hold the attention of players and ultimately falls short of expectations. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or a dedicated horror enthusiast, I would recommend giving Resident Evil 7 Biohazard a pass. Play Alan Wake 2. Its very similar but better.. Boring, forced jump scares, bad story. Useless gore. Truly a trash game. Yet made an @ss load of money.... Every game nowadays is **** yet makes money, but the one that is different gets downvoted to ashes. Thats gaming for ya.. This game has a poor protagonist. Infact, its story in general isn't that strong and its final few hours are actually quite bad. But the setting, atmosphere, and the cast of ""villains"" really do elevate this game. It is one of the best survival horror experiences i have ever had. Its the type of game that manages to scare me whilst still giving me enough power to feel like i can fight off the things scarying me. Every new villian and area introduces something new and interesting to a gameplay formula that is already fun and tense whilst actually giving me memorable side characters and moments. Its such a great game.. One of the most scariest , horror and good game I ever played. Story is really good, the atmosphere is briliant.. Close to perfect game! A return to Survival Horror. I really don't understand everyone's complaints about the third act of the game. I think it's fine. Story is great just like most RE games. My only complaint is the loading screens are too long. Especially after watching the VHS tapes. But I love the gameplay and the scares. Definitely the scariest RE game so far.. -7/10 story -6/10 gameplay -8/10 environments -7/10 characters -6/10 music. The game is so impressive to me (I give it straight 100 points) there is no argument. I think this is the definition of a perfect game. I had a heart attack 3 times. Graphicsare stunning. I was scared and ultra focus. I was calculatingall my moves. The parts that are SAW like are juste incredible. I purchased the DLC right after completingthe game and had even more fun. What a game. Resident Evil Biohazard is a video game released in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC by Capcom. At first, the game takes place on a farm called Dalvey Louisiana with Ethan Winters as the protagonist, where he tries to save his wife from her family called Bakers because it is infected by a mold resulting in chaos taking over them and bringing them to a very unpleasant situation. This contamination broke out from Evelyn, a biologically engineered humanoid weapon that invaded their home. In addition, the narrative of the game has a smooth flow and is well structured from the beginning to the end, so I was not disappointed. On the other hand, we see the franchise from the 7th chapter changing the form of the gameplay, as a result of which the player handles the character in a first-person camera instead of the third-person we had in the previous ones. Subsequently, we see that the characters do not have a fixed manner, but that their behavior changes, and from one moment to the next they change a lot regarding their evolution. Also, the technical side of the game compared to the older resident evils, makes a big and shocking leap in the graphic area, in its lighting and renderings, thus making the experience much more fun and creepy. In other words, the audio-visual orientation of the game has been improved and upgraded to such an extent that it surpassed every previous game in the series. Despite this, the game also contained action scenes in a rather stressful and disturbing atmosphere with an atmosphere that impressed and marked the chaos and atmosphere that prevailed, giving a great feeling of anxiety and fear. Also, the different animated effects and in general the design of the world and the characters played a big role in how gruesome and scary the game could become. In conclusion, it was a very exciting experience with all the above-mentioned and it is very much worth trying because it will pique your interest even if you are not a fan of the series.. Better game than Outlast, Outlast only has 0 guns, but this one has 2, so therefore it's improved. Do you like moving at the speed of an elderly person? Do you like micro-managing your limited inventory while the game packs the map with items around every corner? Do you like bullet spongy enemies that may even be invincible, but you won't find out if you're supposed to fight or run until you use up all your ammo and they're still attacking you? Welcome to Resident Evil 7. From a genre that just shrugs off all of its immersion breaking faults, poor design choices, and says, ""well, that's survival horror."" Luckily, this gets better towards the second half as the story starts at least making some sense. I just wish they modernized some aspects. Also, there is like a couple types of enemies you fight throughout the game and they're not that great. The End boss is a joke too.. I completely did not expect such an amazing game. The story is very interesting and in some ways unexpected. But the most polished thing in re7 is it's gameplay! Hardly any game that I've played soaked me so quickly and for such a long time. Resident evil 7 is an amazing example of immersion in games. Mechanics are great, puzzles are very interesting not too hard not too easy. Lots of hidden artefacts and Easter eggs. Graphic design is beautiful and very realistic and RE engine is just so well optimized! I can recommend this game to anyone who like a little bit of horror!. The most scary resident evil so far, the change from 3rd to fisrt person is also genius, very good game. This is the game that changed everything! This is by far the scariest resident evil game.. A return to form for the series!. Probably the best in the whole franchise!. short, but scary, but linear. Resident Evil 7 is a return to form for the Resident Evil franchise in every way, offering not just the best installment since Resident Evil 4, but a game that goes toe-to-toe with any of the franchise's best. Resident Evil 7 is the second time Capcom has successfully reinvented Resident Evil, this time putting it in first-person and putting the horror front-and-center. While RE7 takes clear inspiration from modern horror titles such as Amnesia and Outlast, it is still a Resident Evil game first and foremost, and brings the franchise closer to the classic days of RE1-3 with a combination of intense action, campy but scary horror, and clever puzzle solving.. Yeah it’s cool. Lots of fun, creepy and scary. Not a big RE fan but I’d recommend. The first person really adds to the horror. 8/10. i personally dont like too much horror in resident evil games, and this game definitely has alot of jumpscares unlike the other games like re2 re3 re4 but although this game still has a good storyline gameplay but i personally dont like this much horror in resident evil games so ill just give it a 8 for good gameplay and story. The general consensus is that this game is a return to form for Resident Evil, as in it brings the creeping survival horror element back to the forefront. While this game is memorable and definitely a great reference point for the series going forward (hopefully they remake the original game to be more like this), I do feel like the story didn't draw me in right away because the rational part of my brain kept going ""literally none of this needs to happen."" But that said, once it gets going, ya get locked into it. The one particular complaint I want to include here is that the VR mode is better at most points, but then there are other points where I just flat-out wasn't looking at the right area for certain jump scares like I would've in non-VR and it actually confused me. That and the sound design is a little over-reactive to Ethan's footsteps; I kept thinking someone was right near me when it was literally just Ethan brushing up against some tiny object. Overall, great game, though. The story is more believable than most Resident Evil titles. The grittiness in the atmosphere makes the environment feel somewhat less fictional, which makes the scares from abnormal circumstances remain engaging, even when it gets ridiculous. Comes off a little bit like an homage to multiple classic horror movies, but it ties it all together organically enough to not feel like fan service. Definitely a worthwhile title for fans of horror games.. This was my first resident evil game and all I could remember was people hating on the first person POV. I wish I could see the dumb look on their faces when they realize how good this game is.. This was my introduction to the resident evil franchise and I will always be thankful for it. F#ck you Jack Baker.. absolutely fantastic!! this game shows perfectly how the RE formula works in the modern era. A mixed bag of highs and lows. The actual game play was crap. It was slow, clumsy and glitch ridden at times. The atmosphere, story and characters generated loads of spooky creepy weird fun. RE7 looks and sound amazing and the voice actors really all shine in the roles they have, but I am here to game not to watch a movie. That being said this one did really grow on me and not like mold. VR mode vs standard mode? Well standard mode the odd jump scare. VR mode screaming my head off multiple times! After trying several different VR games the motion sickness has finally gone. Still with all that plastic and rubber on the head? Head overheat happens pretty quicky. Yeah even when using a massive floor fan to try and counter it. Maybe I need to use PS/VR in the winter or something?. A terrifying, surreal experience in VR. I haven't been scared to move the controller since Silent Hill 2, so it was nice to get that feeling again.. This game is an intense and terrifying survival horror game that delivers a heart-pounding experience from start to finish. The game's graphics are top-notch, creating a creepy and immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the gameplay. The level design is also excellent, with each area offering unique challenges and surprises that keep players on their toes. The game's story is well-crafted and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked. Overall, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is a must-play for fans of the horror genre, offering a thrilling and unforgettable gaming experience.. amazing game Tried it in VR lol but I felt sick jumping off the first ledge at the start. Played it without VR, unreal. Can’t imagine how brutal it is in VR. Bring on RE Village ! edit - played it in vr, absolutely mind blowing. I like resident evil formula a lot, however this game would ve worked better if had the same thing as re2 did where u can see if a room you ve explored has no more items u can get. The level design while its still mind blowing at times it isnt as well put together as sometimes i didnt know if i should keep some items or if theyre usages is gone. Also the last act felt a bit overwhelming, like i totally wanted to be done with the game, and thats bad cuz the level design in that area was surprisingly well thought out. This game single-handedly saved the franchise. Bringing it back to its survival horror roots. RE7 will go down as one of the best in the franchise, as it tackled something new to Resident Evil... first person. It exceeded in a majority of areas, though the boat segment is a bit off-putting even though I kind of like it. Definitely a must play for all horror fanatics!. I love this game and lot action game and graphic amazing and story amazing and try scary friends or family cool use vr. This has nothing to do with older RE parts. In fact, it is an even heavier kind of horror. The fps perspective just works fine. Overall rating: 8.9.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I recommend pick one up lot action and also and excellent graphic and good day. Not my thing, but I can understand why people like it. I'm really tired. Really tired.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the awesome games i see. Game design, Characters, Mechanics. Its one of the best games i played.. BRAVO!! as a day one fan this game is what we wanted after 1,2,3 & CV before it drifted away with 4,5 &6 and became a non horror game which were CoD like with no real survival. 7 brought the series back on it's feet!! the formula is finally once again: low ammo, survival, some riddles (could be more and more difficult) and maybe the best setting ever. THAT is what RE should look like. the first person view makes it a lot more intense (which i wasn't sure at the beginning). a true masterpiece. One of the best resident evil for sure. Good story and excellent dlcs. very good. With Unreal Engine and kind a freak stories. This game is awesome, so little different feelings from other series.. My first resident evil game. immediately fell in love with the game and the resident evil franchise. This game doesn't have the same vibe as the previous one where you are a cop fighting zombies, it has a vibe of a classic horror movie where you explore a house with a **** up family. Overall good story I suggest you give this game a try!. This is my favorite part at the moment. A new protagonist who was just a regular guy, not a cop or agent, the game play itself from the first person gave me more fear while playing it, and this whole bakers family thing. Perfection, one of my favorite games. Most boring and annoying game i ever play this game not horror only annoying. Great game, this is the most horror RE I've played by my opinion. I'm not very familiar with the series but I think they made it perfect for the genre. There is as much action as it needs and the environment is as dark as it should for this game. The adventure has great pace as well, and also has the right amount of challenge. I highly recommend it.. honestly this is my favorite resident evil and it saved the series. im still shocked capcom took so many risks here but thank god they did. also I wish other re games would be as random and experimental with dlc. Resident Evil 7, arguably the scariest modern Resident Evil and probably the least enjoyable one... but not in a bad way. Once again in a Resident Evil game, the story is not good but it's not an important part of the game either, no need to analyze it. Same goes for the characters, although the Baker family are very creepy and interesting antagonists, particularly Jack Baker, one of the most threatening yet fun antagonists in the entire series with some of the best moments in the game. The gameplay is okay; everything works well, the shooting mechanics are satisfying and the survival horror elements are there, however, the movement is very slow and it gets annoying when facing the Molded; the main enemy type of the game and the only enemy type of the game, unfortunately. The atmosphere and the setting though, are probably my favorite parts of the game; they're haunting, terrifying and disgusting, which are backed up by very good graphics and audio design. As for the pacing, it's mostly consistent up until the last third of the game, where it feels dragged out, but the final boss is kinda cool. Pros: + Memorable antagonists + Decent gameplay + Compelling atmosphere + Wonderful setting + Beautiful visuals Cons: - Poor enemy variety - Boring enemy types - Bloated last third Narrativ",one of my most favorate games of all time! the horror and suevival elements are super! compared to the current ones it leaves a little to be desired .
"1,005.NHL 12","This game was not something I expected to be as fun and great as it is. It as an exciting feeling every time I play it, even when its just a simple 1v1 vs. the CPU. The different modes the game has is pretty cool as well. I think it past its potential very quick and they were convinced to make even higher standards for NHL 13, 14, and soon 15.. I just want to say that just because a game is disappointing does not mean it's a bad game, and even though it is similar to nhl 11, I still had a lot of fun playing it. I am not really a big fan of nhl 13, but they tried something knew with it. I will probably be stuck playing with this game for a while, and I am not upset about that at all.. What a game! NHL 12 has very much improved its Be A Pro mode and GM Mode. The career mode allows you to first play in the OHL and other Canadian leagues to get yourself ready for the pro draft. The depth of this game is amazing. Great work EA Sports!. the game ****, it seems to act on its own. i can spend some games bring players out of the play and the will be no more goals despite difficulty, when it decided to score there is no stopping the computer despite skill of player or strategic defence. Be a pro was very close to the same. advice: watch highlights videos cause you are not really in the game. This is probably the worst NHL game I have ever played. If you were thinking of buying an NHL game sometime soon, either go back to NHL10 or wait and see if the AI is better in NHL13 because this is a complete waste **** $60. Physics don't exist in this game. What I mean by that is if someone tries to hipcheck you, just hope you aren't within 3 feet of them because otherwise you are going down... hard. Also, don't even bother to try to dive down to block a shot or pass because you will rarely stop the pass and the shot will literally go right through you if you are right in front of someone when they shoot it. EASHL will. provide only extreme frustration when the other team waits at your blue line for a break away pass or uses one of many other glitches that EA didn't bother to fix. The AI is completely useless, and most of the time only serves to get in your way. If this wasn't bad enough, you can't even fix the bad goalie problem by playing goalie because the game doesn't allow you to make many saves. You will find that generally 1 or 2 times per game, you will be in perfect position to make the save and it will somehow go in anyway. Basically if you want a semi-realistic hockey experience, look elsewhere because this game fails to impress even a little bit.. A very fine game. Very similar to NHL 11, which was already a great game though. Good gameplay, fine graphics, and a buy for regular hockey fans, who did not buy NHL 11.. For the third year in a row, the EASHL remains corrupt. Every year, a glitch has been found that results in an instant breakaway or goal 99/100 times. This year however, EA really outdid themselves. They included 2 of those glitches this year. The first being a fake slapshot glitch that will literally freeze a defenseman in place. Quite literally, he is frozen in place while you skate by him. The other, (which took EA 6 months after release to address, Yes you read that right, 6 months after release keep in mind this game is meant to last a year before the next installment) was a glitch where the skater would pull the puck to his forehand, and cause the goalie to come off the post far to early at an angle, that would result in a goal every time. This glitch has somewhat been fixed, but not nearly enough addressed. Now, the goalies are more inconsistent than the LA Kings. They will either pitch a 40 save shutout, or give up 5 weak wrist shot goals on 9 shot where the puck bounces off their glove. Another problem with the computer goalies is that they THROW THE PUCK OUT after making a save FOR NO REASON. This has cost me and my team games and even playoff games many a times. Goalies need to be consistent, hell there is even an in game stat for them to be consistent that is buried in edit player that must have not shown up in the EASHL. One of the final major problems with this game is the defense. They ****, there is no other way to put it. In a game that promises better AI, they not only fail, they embarrass themselves. My tamagachi was more intelligent than some of these computer defenseman. Not only do they face the complete WRONG DIRECTION at times, they also cannot deliver passes at times. They also have some mechanic built into them, to ALWAYS shoot from the point when getting the puck. It is IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS, EVEN WHEN CALLING FOR A PASS. So, to highlight some of my points -Glitches that lead to AWFUL and downright INFURIATING gameplay for team of less than 6 -Computer Goalies that can make post to post diving saves for one team, and others that cannot stop a rolling puck coming right at them -Goalies still throw out puck for no reason -Defensemen with the IQ of a Jersey Shore cast member If you are a casual hockey fan, please I beg you, do not buy this game. EA does not need anymore of your money. Their main selling points on this game were broken glass, ""improved AI"" and adding a Winter Classic mode. EA fails miserably with their latest NHL entry. It is as if EA was submitting their final college thesis paper, and spelled their own name wrongs on the Final Copy. That is how embarrassing this game should feel to them. I bought this game a long time ago and it really has little changes to the game play from NHL 11. The only thing new is the Glass breaking, the hitting is based on momentum now, you can hit goalies, and be a legend which is an unnecessary addition. Other things such as create a team and Be a Pro hasn't changed a bit. The thing I was looking forward to was create a team logo design which is terrible. You can only choose the logos in the game and you can't make your own, and some of the names don't even match the logos. Overall the game is basically the same as NHL 11.. Worst Game I ever Wasted money on, Highly recommend you do not buy this game if you are new or semi new to NHL, Its terrible, I played my first online game on it and it placed me against a level 39, 39!!! I'm level one and playing my first game, The in game controls are terrible, passing is horrible and computers are far too hard,. This game is horrible. I have been buying these games since the 90's and they seem to be digressing in stature. Lift a sick? Only if you want a penalty. Poke Check, again only if you want a penalty(when you can actually make contact with the puck). I have tried sliders and it doesn't matter. I don't bother with online since I know it will **** because of glitch goals and crappy servers. Be a Pro? Be a bore. That mode is terrible. This game is broken and unplayable unless you like arcade games. Physics? whats that. This game has no Physics. Rehashed EA crap again and again. I am done. DONE buying this garbage. Nhl 09=Nhl10=Nhl11=Nhl12. Same crap again and again. They don't even bother to fix the bugs that have been there for 4 YEARS~!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY~!!. Fantastic in my opinion. I would give it a 8.5 if possible. HUT mode is a lot of fun and addicting but the contracts are too short and most of the time is spent in the menus. Be a GM mode is great but Be a Pro mode is not as good as Be a Pro in NBA 2K12. NHL 12 is especially fun to play with friends but hard to play on the same TV since going down the screen is almost impossible for me.. This game is average. The game shows great potential in certain areas. The season mode is greatly improved and the mechanics aren't completely frustrating. However, this game fails to deliver anything new or improved in most of the game's areas. 5 hole scoring is impossible and the goalies seem to be superhuman at times. The game fails to put the puck where you want it to be. Amongst this Be a pro is useless for players looking to be snipers and Defenders. Poke checking is best left to the AI and for Snipers one-timers are non-existent. You're left taking the puck up to the slot and hope your deeke is good enough to trip up the goalie. Also opposing defense-men can easily poke check or cross check you and completely obliterate any chance of scoring. I found myself scoring 15 goals in 30 games beginning my career with 4 goals in a single game. However due to the lack of assistance from teammates winning the ross art would require you to somehow have a 2 player career and ask a friend to constantly feed you the puck for one-timer goals. Also there is no hope for the AI i tried to find hope in giving my teamates the puck and then asking for it while i was in the slot. 2 things will happen. 1 they will fire the puck around the back of the net and screw you over. Or 2, they will try and take the shot for themselves ignoring the fact they can't shoot and ignoring your call for a pass. The team practice is not as one would hope playing a 4-4 3-3 skirmish. You have 3 chances to fire on the goalie if the puck is held by an opposing player you must restart and try to score again. The game showcases many amazing things but its nothing new. EA failed to deliver an interesting and fully functional game. If controlling a whole team by yourself is your cup of tea then purchase this game. If your looking forward to having a career your better off playing real hockey.. This is very close to a masterpiece. This is what hockey gaming should be. It is so spectacular to be rewarded with so many game types. I do have one problem though and that is that the KHL is not included, but that is my problem and shouldn't affect the score whatsoever.. same as last but the last one was good. thats all i have to say but i have to have 150 characters. And the goalie fights are fun. grezky mode is aight, they could have made it better.. Log into online game, try to push someone and nothing happens. Oh they have a legend card and near-impossible to attain stats. The can look at me and I fall. Go grind and farm for that legend card. Stupid.. A very disappointing release. The game continues to be riddled with bugs and terrible design and interface decisions. It seems like EA Sports has whittled the NHL developer down to about 4 people who's only job is to program in a couple new features. This game has all of the exact same animations, celebrations, and commentary as NHL 10. Career mode is still completely random and arbitrary. The servers were a mess at launch (an EA staple). EA, maybe next year have your 4-man team work all year fixing this game before spending any more time on meaningless bullet-points for the back of the package.. The lack of hockey knowledge of the designers of NHL 12 is glaringly obvious. The same brain-dead AI, barely any changes to game play aside from a couple tweaks, interaction with the goalie (which can be exploited, and is not adequately penalized,) and the hip check as the most effective means to separate an opponent from the puck, regardless of what part of your body makes contact with your opponent, make the high scores of this game laughable. I can't wait until the exclusivity of the NHL to be removed from EA, so that another designer can make a hockey video game that actually plays as the sport does, rather than an arcade fantasy for individuals who've never seen a hockey game, played the sport, or touched a puck in their lives.. With a clear conscience there is no way I can give this game less than a 10!. Its beautiful. The depth of game play is inconceivable. The sounds on ice and in the stands plus the commentary are all awesome. presentation is spot as well. oh and tight game play make this game a legend. if your a hockey fan or not you need to buy this game!. This game, while making improvements upon NHL 11's animations and gameplay elements, has some serious issues. The main and gamebreaking issue right now is the lack of proper collision detection. Sticks warp through the sticks, bodies, legs, and arms of opposing players, and sometimes--when a pokecheck is attempted--through the puck itself. This makes defense very difficult and leads to a huge amount of frustration. The new goaltender interference mechanics in the game are also broken. There have been instances in which my goalie has been run over and thrown into a corner, only for no penalty to be called and the opposing side to score into my open net. Online team play and EASHL are dominated by forwards. EA has put no effort into balancing out the positions. The result is a step backward in this game mode. Figure-skating, and persistent cross-crease passes are thus still the order of the day, rather than realistic play, and glitch shots still exist. This could all be fixed with even minor effort by EA, but that is sadly lacking. I've never seen so many complaints about an EA game as I've seen over the last month on EA's NHL 12 forum over the past month. This game is a huge disappointment to those of us who have been fans of the series for a long time. I give this game a six because it's still a decent play. But if you've got NHL 11, don't transition until EA does some work on the game (assuming this will happen).. NHL 12 really improves upon last years game with new "" tie up"" moves in front of the net and even the goalie gets involved and is no longer a stone wall. I will say very little has changed with the grpahics but what really has changed is the animations that the game has and really makes it look like the real thing. I do like how the puck is not like glue to your stick which really makes it jump around the area alot more which is another touch of realism they added. The speed of the game has seemed to move up as well so its alot quicker than last years game and really reflects how quick the game is. I like how the players now move around alot more and get involved instead of jsut standing around waiting for you to pass them the puck and there are a few instanaces where goalie collsion really can make for some interesting goals but in the end it really sells the fact your playing a well tuned hockey game that is getting really close to mimicking the game you see on tv. If you love hockey games this game is a no-brainer. I havent played online but offline im having a blast and playing online later will only keep me comming back to this game. The long standing undisputed KING of online hockey, there isn't any sports game out there that can touch the EA NHL series. NHL 12 is both incredibly rewarding and incredibly addicting, pretty much the same as NHL 11 with just a few tweaks, but that's a really good thing. Playing the best online sports experience, leveling up your online pro, customizing your attributes and unlocked gear, competing against some great players, it's all here and it's all good.. This is an incredible hockey game. As with all the critic reviews, the Be A Legend mode is a silly addition that isn't all that special. The AI in the game seems to have improved a ton with this release, which makes the Be A Pro mode a lot more fun. The only thing that can be frustrating is with the new goalie interaction, AI goalies are much more likely to run away from the crease without contact just to get a new penalty. This is a very minor complaint to a near-perfect hockey game.. Terrible AI, or the people that made the game never played hockey before. Extremely frustrating trying to play be a pro when you teammates not only refuse to help but actually get in your way. Online's the same as it always was, buy packs to make you better than your opponents.","the depth of this game is amazing . this is probably the worst NHL game i have ever played . if you were thinking of buying an NHL game sometime soon, either go back to NHL10 or wait and see if the AI is better in NHL13 ."
"1,006.Rise of the Tomb Raider","Tombs are the best thing RotTR has to offer. Compared to the previous Tomb Raider, there really are more of them, but not quite as many as we’d want. Plus, unlike the stealth/combat sequences, most of the tombs can be skipped – although the game would’ve been much better off if it was the other way around.. Expands the tight journey of the original into a brilliant open-world setting with secrets aplenty. The story is complicated and justifiably pokes at Lara's legacy to great effect.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 7 Total: 7.83. Delivers an experience nearly on par with its acclaimed predecessor. A solid sequel that maintains the series' quality.. It's at that moment that you realize how infinitely better the Xbox is than the PS3 since they made this game only pays x360 and left the PS3 aside................ When I first got my hands on 'Rise of the Tomb Raider,' I'll admit, I had my doubts. The old Tomb Raider games on the PlayStation 1 were a bit campy. But, let me tell you, I was pleasantly **** gameplay here is a smooth, well-oiled machine. You'll find yourself seamlessly transitioning from one action to the next, making the whole experience feel fluid and natural. The combat, oh, the combat! It's downright addictive. It strikes that perfect balance between being challenging enough to keep you on your toes while not so hard that it feels unfair.Then there's the storyline - a captivating journey that keeps you hooked. You're not just playing a game; you're unraveling a narrative that's as engaging as any blockbuster movie. And the upgrade tree? It's incredibly satisfying. You really feel the impact of each upgrade, making your progress through the game feel **** of the standout elements for me is the game's exploration of the Byzantine Empire's history. It's refreshing to dive into a period that isn't as commonly depicted in video games as, say, World War II. This historical depth adds an enriching layer to the gaming experience.However, it's not all roses and sunshine. The climbing mechanics can be a bit of a drag. Sometimes the button combinations aren't as intuitive as they could be, leading to some tedious moments. It's a hiccup in an otherwise smooth **** that's just a small complaint in an ocean of positives. Overall, 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' surpasses expectations. It's a game I'd highly recommend. If you're a fan of games like Uncharted, this will resonate with you. It captures some of the best elements of that series while carving out its own unique space in the action-adventure genre. Definitely a game not to be missed.. It'sa solid game, but the controls, mechanics, and camera are junk. Modern games feel this way, where the character you're playing as is sluggish, weighty, and an all-around pain to maneuver. I guess devs are going for the more realistic feel, which is cool, but I'd have more fun with a character who actually is faster, and actually maneuvers correctly when I press a specific button. The delayed mechanics are frustrating, too. Sometimes, Lara won't even grab a ledge when I press the right button. Ugh! The first section is awful, as it hits you with platforming, on top of QTEs. Terrible mix to start a game with. I get they need to keep people's attention, but they could've started it with a free roaming section with combat. Instead of icepick climbing up a mountain, have a combat heavy section going up a mountain. The combat is actually very minimal. Not a big complaint, just frustrating. The stealth mechanics work really well, but it only can be used in certain sections. The survival aspects are cool where Lara has to hunt her own prey is cool, too, but the prey seem overly tanky. The checkpoint/campfire aspect is cool in theory, but weirdly executed, along with the upgrading system. Also, the objectives in-game aren't obviously stated and I find myself questioning where to go next in these little mini-arenas the devs have created. I don't know exactly where Lara has to platform, or which ledge she's supposed to grab. Especially frustrating when there's time limits on where to move in certain sections. Even with all the negatives, I still felt the need to progress in the game. The game is very linear, and doesn't leave much room for exploration. At least from what I can tell so far. I find the game to not be punishingly difficult and I'm playing on Hardcore, which is a good thing. When you die, you return to a checkpoint, which is normally not too far from where you die. There's literally a checkpoint every 10 to 20 steps.. Simply awesome I ll just say this , it is one of the best story driven games I hv played saying this for the 2013 tomb raider as well. Crystal dynamics know how to create a fun and engaging game, the puzzles, the gameplay , crafting weapons from the environment it's all superbly done. Bought the entire trilogy on sale, and boy am I not satisfied by the purchase decision. Gonna play the third game shadow of the tomb raider soon.. One of the best adventure games. Restart saga. Win UNCHARTED in everything.. The Rise of the Tomb Raider game has improved in some sections compared to the previous game of this franchise, but some weaknesses are still repeated from the previous game in this title and even have new weak point. Exactly what I mean is the super clichéd, repetitive and ridiculous story and antagonist that get worse the further you go through the game. And also in the meantime, the low variety of environments and some AI problems, prevent this title to use its full potential.. This game is amazing and deserves all the love. They took the combat, stakes, tomb raiding, and traversal from the first game and turned it up to 11. The story picks up and you are introduced to more of Lara's past, she gets even more development here which is awesome to see. This game also has more travel in it, instead of being in one place (like the island from the first game) you go to several locations which was also a great expansion. The tombs in this game are so fun, way bigger and better than the last game, with much harder puzzles that are absolutely worth your time as they give you good loot. My only critique is that if you are looking for a game that is as focused as the first, this one opens up quite a bit and does not feel as zoned in on the cinematic story as the first. Don't get me wrong, the story is great and cinematic, but there is more to be distracted by in this game than the last. If you like a more open world this won't bug you, but I have open world fatigue and loved how focused the experience was in the original game. I think the first game is better over all to me for that reason.. A grand sequel, this game is an improvement over the first game in every single way. I'm very satisfied with the fantastic set-pieces and the high amount of action, some pretty cool moments here and there. The biggest improvement here is the gameplay, it's more accessible, and feels grounded with additional mechanics that make it feel more like a survival game where you have to manage your resources. As for the puzzles, they're awesome, every puzzle is creative, fun, and very unique, all in all very enjoyable. The side content is more than enough, the game is overall very complete and there are many things you can do. Exploration is one of the game's strongest points, there's a good amount of side quests to do, tombs to raid, secrets to uncover and collectibles to find. What didn't really surprise me is the overall story. It's very similar to the first game in some ways but it's not as dark, and the writing is straight up weak, predictable plot twists and characters making questionable decisions, it's unfortunate how even this game suffers from this issue. Last but not least, this is my favorite version of Lara Croft, I think she looks the best in this game, and she's very likeable. This is my favorite Tomb Raider game. Final Rating: ""Very Good"" ~ 7.5/10.. This installment refines and expands upon its predecessor. A bigger and better sequel. The action has been increased and the scripted events rival the best of Uncharted. In this sequel, Lara is on her way to becoming the strong iconic character we've all come to know. This time, she's on the hunt for a mythical Holy Grail-type object hidden somewhere in the wilderness of Mongolia. Unfortunately for her, it's also being sought out by a paramilitary army that descend from an ancient order of knights. Visually, the game is amazing. It showcases the Xbox One's graphical capabilities. Overall, ""Rise"" is one of the best action games of 2015. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. Best game! One of the best action and adventure games!!! Full ratings are less. The stealth tactics, the zipline and much more! New themes and things appear once you move further into the game. Enjoyable scenes.. Very good game. It is better than the previous Tomb Raider, in every way possible.. a good continue from the previous one, is better in much ways, and that graphics! damn.. this game needed more attention. A better Tomb raider than the first, highly recommended, a great adventure game that still needs a better story and characters. I think it's everything this generation of Lara Croft should be. It has great cinematics, fantastic cliffhangers, shooty bits, and some puzzles.. I don't think I've ever played any better Adventure game except Uncharted Series but yea as xbox time exclusive it well represented the console. Gameplay : 9/10 Design (video + audio) : 8/10 Story : 8/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 8/10. EN: Nicely done AAA game. Extremely high quality continuation of the previous part. The story is interesting, as are the missions. The ambiance is simply beautiful. The mechanics are good, the puzzles are not too heavy. SRP: Lepo urađena AAA igra. Izueztno kvalitetan nastavak prethodnog dela. Priča je interesantna, kao i misije. Ambijent je jednostavno prelep. Mehanika dobra, puzzle nisu preterano teške.. The second offering of Lara Croft hopes to build on the fantastic reboot game from a couple of years earlier. The scale of Trinity has now expanded to fill an entire game and memories from the past haunt our lovable Tomb Raider girl. Pros- Much larger hubs than the first game- allowing more exploring Combat is awesome! Upgrades and skill trees are necessary and fit perfectly Heaps of underground exploring- small crypts and caves More sneak sections in this game I enjoyed the extra costumes via DLC Blood Ties was great to see more backstory of Lara Heaps of collectibles to find Larger number of challenges and side quests Less heavy breathing and screaming from Camilla Luddington (SAM!!!!) Cons- Siberia was a poor location choice- absolutely zero mythology and history there Baba Yaga DLC was horrible and very short Optional tombs are still very small- where are the multi level dungeons? Music was not as good as previous game Last section was a copy and paste- deathless ones have just replaced the Oni. Boring! As far as the story went I enjoyed the antagonists- Konstantin and Ana were quite good, and I was pleased that Crystal Dynamics tried to put them in a grey zone where they had their own motives and goals, separate from Trinity. It worked good enough for me and gave me reason to push through the game. The Divine Source become slightly annoying but tied together with Jacob and the tribe. Game Content- 9 out of ten Fun Factor- 7 out of ten Overall Score- 8. This is what the sequel should look like. It takes more or less everything that worked in the previous work and tunes it to the maximum. This is exactly, in my opinion, Rise of the Tomb Raider. At first glance, what fascinated me was the graphics. An incredible shift. The game from 2015 and even today looks wonderful. You will also enjoy the opportunity to play the game on 60FPS. A classic for PC players, but not so obvious for consolists. I played the game on Xbox One X, where you can play with better visuals, but 30FPS or worse with 60FPS. I (like most) prefer worse graphics, but smoothness in the form of 60FPS, so I welcomed this change and it improved my gaming experience. I mainly praise the graphics and the possibility of choosing FPS on consoles, but the story has also changed and in my opinion for the better. The plot is much better with better characters and those locations have also undergone a change and it cannot be said that they are bad. The locations are beautiful and in addition to the main storyline, you have slightly more open places here and there, where you can do various side activities, thanks to which you can, for example, improve Lara. The improvements were already in the last part, but there is perhaps even better. In short, Tomb Raider from 2015 takes all the good that the one from 2013 offered us, but still takes it to a completely different level.

[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite the numerous complaints I had about the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, I really enjoyed my time with it and was really looking forward to playing the sequels. I think generally, this game was better where it counted but there are some things I think the original did better. Gameplay wise, this game is definitely my preferred one. There's less combat, which I like. The combat in general is also better, with some new additions like a bigger variety of weapons as well as different ammo types for most of them. There's a lot more exploration and puzzle solving this time, both mandatory and optional. The game is also a lot more open ended this time, you can do side quests, explore bigger areas and there are incentives for revisiting places you already explored before with new abilities. Where it lacks I think is the story. It's not very good. It's not horrible or anything but I was more interested in the first game's story, as generic as it was. I don't think most people play these games for the story though. Personally, I'm much much more focused on gameplay and I think there's some significant improvement here over the original. Not to mention, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I'm very excited to play the last entry of the trilogy. I beat this game in March of 2020.. i fully enjoyed the reboot game of 2013 and when I finally picked up this sequel I was excited to see what can they do next. If I'm being totally honest I thought the first couple hours of the game was boring and I really had no desire to keep playing. Eventually I buckled down and continued my play through and I'm happy to say that this game is pretty epic. After *for me* those first couple of boring hours the story picks up fast and becomes pretty insane that slightly reminded me Uncharted 2. Laura also brings new weapons along with a more open world environment and side stories that make this game feel more alive than the first one. Even though I still prefer the first game over this one, it's still a worthy sequel that keeps this rebooted series alive.. The best video game . the best open world, fun puzzles. the history is very good muy bueno. Rise of The Tomb Raider was better than the first in every way. Game play and story were real highlights here.. This game and its story was a great follow up to the first one. I loved it, but part of me was hoping to see Lara traveling the world rather than having one linear map. It still turned out amazing, that is really just a personal preference stemmed from the original games. There was also a big that kept me from completing it, so that definitely irked the score a little, but my second playthrough had no issues.. The story is nothing special but the gameplay is very satisfying, stealth mechanics are decent, the environment looks incredible, stunning graphics & character models, exploring areas, collecting treasures and uncovering secrets feels great. This game is very good, definitely my favorite Tomb Raider.. Rise of the Tomb Raider is Tomb Raider done right - a complex, suspenseful storyline, innovative game mechanics, an immersive experience that doesn't feel like it is dragging on too long. Not my favorite franchise, but I definitely didn't regret buying it.. The Great Evolution of Tomb Raider 2013 , the game unites adventure and action expanding the formula by Tomb Raider 2013! Lara shows her strength and has grown in history! The fluid gameplay, the beautiful graphics and arts, the fantastic soundtrack and the story are very good!. There are more 50 hours for complete the 100% of the game in hard mode, and I liked so much!!, I didn't tired and there are still some achievements and two DLC for me!. Graphics: 10/10. Art/Design/: 10/10. Music/Soundtrack: 8/10. Gameplay: 10/10. Story: 8/10 interface: 10/10 World: 8/10;. Good evolution of the graphics since the first ****'s still a pleasure to control Lara through a new adventure, nevertheless I couldn't help thinking at some stage : ""well it's like the first episode but in the snow .."" Still, I must admit the mechanics still work and it was a pleasant experience.. Playing in 2019...Great sequel to the first game of the reboot series. More tools and weapons to vary up the gameplay. Provides more options for stealth or you can just go Rambo on everyone. Graphics is amazing! on the Xbox One X. Not as much suspense as the last one. Optional tombs are great. It is in fact one of the greatest graphics of its generation. Very good campaign, soundtrack, characters, gameplay... it is a very good sequel! Personally I prefer the 2013 tomb raider 'cause is darker but Rise of the Tomb Raider is indeed a improviment.. I got this for free as part of the game pass on the xbox, and even though it's free i don't recommend this game. The previous one was way better, I really like the jumping around and solving puzzle and the occasional combat of tomb raider, this issue with this one is that there are certain part of the game where you can to shoot about 20 guys, but the combat system is just broken, lara is simply not equip for fighiting and you end up having to repetiveily repeat the mission 20-30 times trying to pass it, at which point all enjoyment is gone and it just feels like work. I've notice alot of games doing this in recent years, they somehow thing annoyance its something gamers want, so they add this **** missions in there, e.g. where they know the moment control is so bad, they add missions where you have to get to places, it's just shoddy.. Honestly, I finish this game a long time ago, and I don't have my game analysis paper with me right now :( But I give this game a score of 9 out of 10. History 8.7 Gameplay 8.5 Fun 8.7 Graphics 8.5 Final Score 8.6 Good Game !!! Try to play it. A very fun game! I really enjoyed exploring different areas and solving all the puzzles. There is a little bit too much of an emphasis on combat, as the best parts of the game are the stealth and the puzzle/platforming, but it is very fun. The graphics are also incredible. The landscapes are great, the art is great, the effects (such as snow falling or water shooting out from somewhere) are very well done, and Lara herself looks incredible. They did an excellent job of bringing this game back to what it is supposed to be.. Great game, too intuitive, pay attention to details, many hours to full-fill it. Bad is the micro transactions always kill a good game. It has it's issues, sure. But every time I open up the game I can guarantee that I'm going to have fun. I've never not had fun playing this game. On top of that, the game is beautiful and god damn is Lara Croft beautiful too. Rating - 93%. The feeling of adventure you get in this game is incredible. The story is pretty good, such as the gameplay and the graphics.. NICE GAME. About 15 hours good gameplay. No flaws. Syberia part a bit Long though. For 10 bucks Super game. Another good Uncharted esque game. I'm not too big of fan of Uncharted and the Tomb Raider reboots, at most I just think they are good games not great. I do however prefer the Tomb Raider series. Something about the gameplay feels better to me.. If would even say it’s better than the first title of the reboot. Pretty fun and the enhanced version on the Xbox One X looks just stunning.. Great sequel to a great 1st game. Amazing graphics. Breath taking at times. I power played through this game as I couldn’t put it down. 100% recommendation from me.. Pretty good graphics... almost great. Stunning landscape. Story is interesting enough. Somewhat forces player to be a completionist. Combat is ok, seems like there's no place to hide well when you're engaged. The tomb puzzles aren't too hard but satisfying enough. Great game overall.. Square enix and Crystal Dynamics upped the ante with Rise of the Tomb Raider, XBOX ONE exclusivity and coming out against Fallout 4 hurt its early sales but ROTR is easily one of 2015s best games. The sequel delivered all the good things from the reboot and then made it better. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a top notch game and a 2018 third installment hopefully will add more to Lara's adventures.. Lara searches for the Divinity in this prequel. Its a mix of shooting, stealth, climbing, collecting, and puzzles. All in gorgeous environments. Recommend playing on Survivor mode. Pros: - Just a smooth and easy to play game overall - Stealth play is my favorite, and Rise did it well - if not enough of it - Using the bow is just boss - Great mix of climbing and hunting and encounters Cons: - A couple of forced action (no stealth available) put me in a bind - Almost too many collectibles, even on Survivor didn't really ""need"" them. Another great TR game by Crystal Dynamics. Taking the formula of the reboot Tomb Raider and revamping some things it plays and feels a lot better to play. Also the story was much better and really fun to play.. Excellent design, rewarding gameplay and gorgeous to look at, the entire package is near perfect for a hybrid survival/action game. A poor story the only slight disappointment, but thats only a small mark on a top game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rise of The Tomb Raider A Step Back From Greatness Tomb Raider 2013 is one of my most favorite games ever.. Needless to say I was excited to play the sequel.. Unfortunately, they dropped the gritty tone of the original to chase uncharted…. Lara sets out to uncover a mystery her father was mocked for.. This game starts out in the Serbian mountains and the majority of the game keeps you in the snow covered mountains… And of course there are bad guys after the same artifact you are.. So youre not alone… The tomb raider reboot introduced a crafting system which has been brought back, but this time feels much more in the background.. You can gather items and hunt animals for materials to craft bandages and upgrade your weapons… But none of this is forced… And much like the past game you upgrade your weapons at a campfire, which also acts as a fast travel point and a place for you to spend your skill points as you level up… Rise of the tomb raider feels much more linear this time around.. The world doesn’t really feel as connected as the original… Its for the most part a linear path that you traverse with climbing aces and ropes.. The game feels much more like assassins creed this time around because of this… It gives uncharted 4 a run for its money with how much climbing you actually do here… As well as the series as a whole during the few epic chase sequences qhich are easily some of my favorite moments in the entire game… When you aren’t climbing there are a few **** sections you can explore but the mistake the original made is back as well with secrets being locked off until you progress further in the story to unlock the needed tool and come back... This is a cheap tactic to prolong gameplay hours… but more so its frustrating and ironically discourages exploration… Why look around when 1 in 2 areas is going to tell me to come back later? I might as well just ignore everything and run forward.. This is what I ended up doing.. Fortunately rise of the tomb raider is gorgeous, and traversing the parquor sections and solving environmental puzzles old fans will be happy to see returned outside of just being secrets is a great deal of fun… And the 3rd person shooter combat feels decently nice, its not uncharted good, but its passable.. you have the option to stealth or shoot your way through most sections… you can also dodge attacks and counter…. The puzzle pieces are all here for this to be a masterpiece ****… except theyre missing the center piece… the one thing that makes all of this come together and work for uncharted in such a beautiful way… And that’s character… Theres not a single well written character in this entire game… This includes lara… The original this wasn’t so.. the game felt so real and you felt so vulnerable.. not only having to survive enemies but the environment.. I cared the entire way.. here however youre just a girl Nathan drake with 0 personality… Which ultimately makes this feel like just a generic third person shooter experience… There was no reason to stray away from the unique gritty adventure they had going on with tomb raider 2013, but they did and the feel of the game suffered for it And Im not sure if this story was game of thrones inspired, but it felt pretty copy and paste making every turn so predictable, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing if again the characters had character, but they didn’t.. I wasn’t invested in the story at all… The PS4 20 year celebration version also comes with all of the dlc… Endurance which can be played either single or co op where youre tasked with surviving by eating food and gathering resources.. Very fun idea, but the challenges for the trophies wont unlock unless they are an active challenge, which if youre trophy hunting kills all reason to continue if there are no more trophy related challenges to do… cold darkness which is a stealth zombie dlc where you have to infiltrate a research base for a chemical weapon as well as Baba Yaga and Blood ties which ill be reviewing on their own as they are each about an hour long expansion with their own stories.. While I do wish the characters were better written in Rise of The Tomb Raider, I still feel is a quality experience, well worth your money if youre a fan of action adventure… I Give Rise of The Tomb Raider.. an 8/10. [Nice Gameplay+story+character+GRAPHICS] , better than uncharted 4. similar to FARCRY PRIMAL. the game was boring at the beggining, i kept playing then i get so excited .(shooting+adventure+Archaeologist+survival). Why can't I just buy the core game for $20? What if after the core game, I am good, and don't need/want any additional content. What is the worth of the DLCs and others that I will not play? As a PS4 consumer, I don't have the option to just have the core game and decide later if I would like additional content. Why make it a bundle, just to justify the $60 price tag.. This is really a beautiful game. I really enjoyed playing it and this was my second real Tombraider adventure. I hope they continue the story in the style of the current reboots. I loved Tomb Raider and I love Rise of The Tomb Raider even more.. WHAT A GAME - Whether you're a casual gamer or a full-blown gamer, this game is perfect for all. Completion is monitored in an easy to understand fashion and the game is so much fun. Movement is fluid and the restrictions it does have you'll get used to and ignore. Missions are entertaining and deep. Also, if you're a history buff then you'll be even more in sync with Rise of the Tomb Raider, from Cold-War, WW2 > Ancient Greek, Syrian and Mongolian, it will keep you satisfied the whole way. A bench mark platform game.. This sequel to the 2013 gritty reboot is a rare case of bigger AND better. Like “Uncharted 2: Among Thieves”, it’s an improvement over its predecessor in not only story and character, but in action as well. And just like in “Thieves”, it’s a visual feast mainly set in a snowy landscape. In “Rise”, Lady Croft is no longer green, but a few steps closer to being the strong iconic character we’ve all come to know. This time, she is on the search for a mythic Holy Grail-type object hidden somewhere in the wilderness of Mongolia. Unfortunately for her, it's also being simultaneously sought out by an evil paramilitary organization that descend from an ancient order of knights. The whole thing recalls “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”, but that’s okay because Lara has always been a female Indy. The gameplay is a refinement of the formula established in the first game and there’s just more of everything this time out. There are more tombs and caverns to explore, more puzzles to solve, more firearms to equip and more upgrades to use. Additionally, developer Crystal Dynamics has made this TR even more cinematic with huge, dazzling action sequences reminiscent of those featured in ""Uncharted 2"". Beyond the excellent 20 hour campaign is ""Expeditions"", an arcade-style spin on each level that players can modify to be more difficult or easier with RPG-like cards. The cards can be purchased with real money or with earned in-game currency. You can also tackle user-created Expeditions and /or create your own which you can share with others online. However, unlike the first game, there are no multiplayer modes included. As I stated before, the game is graphically gorgeous. There is very little screen tear and framerate issues are virtually non-existent. In the audio side, the musical score, voice acting and sound effects are all top notch. The overall presentation is nothing short of amazing. In the end, “Rise of the Tomb Raider” turned out to be one of the best action games of 2015. If you were a fan of the ‘M’ rated reboot, then you’ll be a fan of this more explosive follow-up. I’d rank it with a 9 out of 10. This game looks absolutely incredible on the Xbox One. Square Enix made an incredible choice in choosing to put it on the best console on the market, making it FIRST on Xbox One and making sub-optimal platforms wait a year.. To scripted. I expexted more freedom. Lara does everything on her own - if the game doesn`t take over control. The climbing is like in Assasins Creed - just hold forward and watch.. This was my first Tomb Raider game since the original on the PS1. I almost didn't bother with this game but MS put out a demo for the Xbox and I fell in love with it straight away. It is arguably one of the best looking games on the Xbox One. The graphics are beautiful, good storyline and fun, smooth gameplay. I look forward to replaying it again in the near future. As someone who owns both a PS4 and Xbox One, I will say that this game being a timed exclusive does leave a sour taste in my mouth. While I encourage PS4 users to pick this game up at some point (especially since you're getting all the DLCs), I can't argue against many who are boycotting it purely because of the timed exclusivity.. Even previous tomb raider 2013 was better. Trash. No sense. Boring. Even previous tomb raider 2013 was better. Trash. No sense. Boring. Even previous tomb raider 2013 was better. Trash. No sense. Boring.. With an uncanny performance by Camilla Ludding","compared to the previous Tomb Raider, there really are more of them, but not quite as many as we’d want . unlike the stealth/combat sequences, most of the tombs can be skipped – although the game would’ve been much better off if it was the other way around ."
"1,007.Chants of Sennaar","Wow. This game is a complete masterpiece. The core mechanic is so original and does a fantastic job of getting across the message of communication and unity. It’s just a triumph in so many ways, all working together to create a truly perfect game. I’ve never played a game that got me thinking about the craft of game design like this one did, and it’s left me excited to find more games that are this completely original.. Puzzle/mystery game that reminds me of other top games in those genres while still bringing something meaningfully unique to the genre. Thinking through the lens of different languages for this game provides an interesting and intellectually fulfilling problem to solve. Good puzzling fun in old school point and click style. It's not point and click but the overall feel brings back those games. I want to erase my memory and play again. Everything was a perfect experience.. I love the idea of a puzzle game that creates its puzzles based on language and learning through action. I thought the story and the world were beautifully realized. I just don't think the large amount of forced stealth sections in the middle of the game really was the best choice. It killed the pacing for me and made me not want to continue playing.. I love languages, and I love puzzle games, so Chants of Sennaar sounded like a game that I would love, and... I really did! As soon as you get a good grip of the main mechanic, Chants of Sennaar becomes fun, and it hits this sweet spot of being challenging without ever becoming frustrating. The game is full of love (and research!) towards the concept of different languages and how they are spoken, it explores the themes of humanity and understanding between different people, therefore, the concluding part of the game feels really nice and heart-warming. Definitely one of the brightest indie highlights of 2023 for me!. This game is a confusing mess that explains nothing in detail and is so abstract it does not even qualify as art. By the time I had gotten to the second ""puzzle"" which was 6 levers that needed to be moved the journal still showed nothing except the three symbols from the first door and the ability to note what you think the symbols are. This needs direction added and even more guesswork removed before I would consider this an enjoyable, playable experience.. It is a good, cozy, and creative puzzle game, the storyline is intense and full of meaning. also, the game is for the casual players and can be bitten by any person. it has very unique and memorable style in the arts. so give this game a try. Best puzzle game i've ever played. It feels a bit like obra dinn and similar, but this one is actually good and doesn't make my eyes bleed. It really shows that devs put a ton of love and care into this game and it's worldbuilding.. One of the best games I played. Great puzzles and story. I like how languages are really different.. Absolute hidden gem that you should try asap. The game is so clever. Being able to find out each word means is sometimes hard but not that hard. The game makes you feel you're a genius once you found out. Give it a try, you won't regret. One of the most unique games I’ve ever played. Beautiful design, a great story, and lots of puzzling gameplay.. Very interesting puzzle game. Wish it was just a bit more satisfying to solve the languages as the concept is a lot cooler then how it actually works in the game. It pulls it off to a degree, but I feel its just missing something that makes it a really top tier puzzle game. A few of the puzzles can be fairly obscure. The story was ok, but feel it could have gotten a little crazier and taken a bigger risk with the ending.. Great game if you like adventure puzzle games you need to play this game you will love it. EN: A beautiful, captivating game, with a wonderful soundtrack and gameplay that brings satisfaction to every minute played. However, i believe that the game did not reach its maximum potential, it could have been brilliant but it is good in its own way. PT: Um jogo lindo, cativante, com trilha sonora maravilhosa e uma jogabilidade que traz satisfação a cada minuto jogado. Porém acredito que o jogo não atingiu seu potencial máximo, poderia ter sido brilhante mas é bom à sua maneira. Great art style and puzzle mechanics. I really like this game, but the animations were clearly not the focus of the devs, could get some work. Overall 9/10, solid game. Love it!. New creative puzzle mechanic with some nice levels, but does't add much on top of that.. An amazing game that will make you binge it for hours. The scenery is beautiful, the story is entertaining, and the gameplay is extremely unique but simple in theory… but hard to actually accomplish in practice. The objective is simple… reverse engineer entire languages with nothing but texts or speech. Simple, right? Maybe not, but it wouldn’t be a fun challenge if it were! But don’t be dismayed, as the game won’t leave you hopeless for long. Moving on is often the best choicefor figuring outwords, and backtracking often requires. Somehow, this is never boring though, as while doing so, you will be instead learning new languages in the game’s world, how they work, and how the context of words is done. If nothing else, you can make an educated guess at certain points of the game, and the game will confirm if they are correct, so you will never be stuck for very long. In conclusion, a beautiful casual game to relax to, while also being fun and investing, that will make you think about it when you’re not playing! And as a bonus, works extremely well on the steamdeck!. Great puzzle and learning based game highly recommend for people who liked Return of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds. Absolutely brilliant—a game that reveals the ingenuity and creative joy of its developers like few games do (Papers, Please; The Room series; Paradise Killer; Hades). I bow with respect and awe for the game’s creators.. A unique game with a unique and charming mechanic, translating languages is way more fun than you would expect, and the Devs managed to provide the player with much more than you can think of, also great ending. Absolutely recommended.. This game does everything right! The gameplay is entirely novel, the story and puzzles are clever and motivating, graphics and design are beautiful and the game mechanics and wonderful music fit perfectly. The best adventure type game that I played in years!. This game offers a very satisfying gameplay mixing translation and detective work, in gorgeous environments reminiscent of Moebius comics. It is a short and condensed experience (6-10 hours) rich in ah-HA moments where everything clicks and suddenly the whole world starts making sense. Highly recommended to those who enjoyed games such as Return Of The Obra Dinn.",the core mechanic is so original and does a fantastic job of getting across the message of communication and unity . thinking through the lens of different languages for this game provides an interesting and intellectually fulfilling problem to solve . the large amount of forced stealth sections in the middle of the game really was the best choice .
"1,008.Advance Wars: Days of Ruin","Way better balanced than previous entries. Please release this one again. It's so easy to pick up and play, and has all the interesting choices you can expect from a strategy game.. Very dated tactic game with a military paint. Would rather play the gba version of Final Fantasy Tactics.. I played through the game and its dark and not cozy. However, its not what I expected but still fun. I hope for another part of advance wars which is colorful again! One minus: Fog of war is just a bit too random in this game, giving you as the player an unfair disadvantage as the ai sees everything. You need to replay matchups over and over to remember, where the enemies will attack or have their units placed.. Solid release in this starved title. I still play it in 2022 and have over 70 hours into the game. Very replayable, addictive and a good followup to the Older AW games. Prefer the single CO over the Dual Strike version, and I like the implementation of the CO in vehicle+unit leveling a lot. For my personal enjoyment I'd give it a solid 10, but I do have to admit the story is nothing incredible (which is not what I play this game for at all) and I do miss the connection between the older games a little bit storywise (guest appearances would be cool, at least for the maps which by the way have also been added to this game). If you can pick this up second hand, it's worth your money.. One of the best games on the DS. The main story is fairly easy to get through and for those seeking a challenge there are a ton of extra challenge maps, each with their own gimmick. There were two that were too hard for me at first but I liked the game so much that I came back months later to beat those maps. My only complaint is that I had to look up how the scoring system works because that's not explained in the game at all.. I applaud the developer willing for change in art direction, as Advance Wars is such a successful series not everybody would have feel that need. But as kiddie as it was, i still prefer the Dual Strike cartoony style. Also, the lack of CO power make everything feel flat. Plot is cheesy as hell. The graphics for the fighting skirmishes are bad by 2008 standards. You can have some good times, but Dual Strike is better in any way (beside multiplayer ofc).. A nice evolution of Advance Wars. Intelligent Systems took a huge risk here and completely overhauled the Visual and even strategic nature of the game. While some may argue that the new gameplay elements are for the worse, I think that is largely just nostalgia talking. As someone who has played every AW released in the US, I think the new CO system is amazing, and the game overall disposes of the clutter and imbalance issues that dual strike had. For once in an AW, there is a serious story. And it's actually fairly compelling, I would say even on the level **** JRPG story. Days of Ruin takes war seriously, and recognizes the repurcusions of it, which is a nice change of pace from the fun and games of previous AWs. The difficulty is also set pretty high for the last few missions (I mean really really high) so the campaign lasts a good while, and S ranking the campaign is harder than ever. Overall, definitely rivals, if not bests previous AWs in quality and value. Excellent game.. Bottomline: Overall this is just the kind of reboot this series needed. There is so much to explore in this game, which makes the game so interesting and, what makes this game really amazing is how, they add all these new dimensions without damaging the core mechanics in advance wars that players have come to love. There was something truly interesting about Advance wars days of ruin that stuck with me long after I put down my D.S and that was how much they explore in the game. There is a lot of depth to be explored in this game and while many players might enjoy the more cute and colorful experience of this game's predecessor there was so much about this game that truly caused players to explore the darker side of war. Players get to explore topics like post-apocalyptic worlds, unregulated science, charismatic megalomaniacs, how individuals select role-models, the dark side of being a soldier, fear, hope, mercenaries, governments, etc. all wrapped up in a turned based platform long-time fans of the series will love and is quick to learn for new players. In terms of game play there is a significant decrease in the number of commanders you get to choose from in multi-player mode, each commander holds little advantage over other commanders and Co-powers are less dominant in this game then in other games that share the advance war title. However, there is a major benefit to this new design and that how the playing field is leveled, which means players need to better major their resources in order to achieve a strategic advantage in battle against friends and AI enemies.. The story was brilliant, I enjoyed the living **** out of it. The gameplay was great, and everything about it was great... BUT the difficulty was quite weird. The level, ""A Hero's Farewell"" is one of the hardest (if not the hardest) things I have ever done in a game. The final level is a cakewalk compared to it. But this game is still just fantastic, and one of my favorite DS games. 9.25/10 BAM. I think it was a great step foward for the franchise, the campaing mode contain an amazing story and I found the combat more balanced than the past advance wars games, I really liked the way CO power works and there is just no need for 50 COs in it (just as dual strike did). So, I think thats it, my dream of a more hardcore advance wars came true.. This is essentially the Advance Wars series perfected. In terms of gameplay, it is not such a major difference, but all the details are nailed and it is easily the best balanced game in the series, and the best turn based strategy game ever made, for that matter. Too bad they don't release it for iPhone, as I have essentially outgrown DS.. Probably the best Turn based game for the DS I've ever played. One of the only reasons why I have a DS in the first place besides Pokemon. The post - apocalyptic change was pretty cool, it really adds more flavor to the game. Very good game overall.. This game is very fun, the music is great and the difficulty, while high, manages to please. The story and setting also get a little more darker, which in this case isn't a bad decision at all, and it actually benefits the game. Characters are also likeable, and villains are detestable. Perfect! For TBS fans, this should be a must play. It's really awesome.. This a really good ds game but somtimes gets boring and slow but most of the time it's fun it has good graphics for ds and there's so many classes and they all have good and bad things but it's a fun game overall!. I am a fan of the series, but I was disturbed by the direction of this game. Part of the allure of the previous installments was that it allowed for a Turn Based Strategy game with a followable plot but none of the emotional depth. Bringing the ethics of war, genocide, and genetic engineering into the game made it more mature, but lost the causal gameplay status, in my opinion.",i still play it in 2022 and have over 70 hours into the game . the main story is fairly easy to get through and there are a ton of extra challenge maps . the lack of CO power make everything feel flat .
"1,009.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'll start with optimization, or rather the lack thereof. For 7 years, this game has been stagnating in terms of optimization. Each patch adds only paid skins and edits to the display of these skins (various visual bugs when putting on different skins). Each patch brings bugs to the game lobby, random ping increases and disconnects from the server (and this is a problem exclusively with cheap servers and not a problem on the part of the player). New maps are a separate type of masochism, if you take Sanok. This map lags like hell. Everyone's favorite cheaters. After the game switched to FTP, it became a breeding ground for cheaters. On average, 70k accounts are banned per week. But I will tell you that Crafton cooperates with software developers, because old accounts with a large number of donation skins can easily use a hack wall aka ESP, scripts for shooting without recoil, and especially impudent ones and aimbot. Stupid cheaters with fresh accounts get banned for a week, and often they are banned for a couple of **** Chinese are a separate type of subhumans, the percentage of cheaters is about 70%. They occupied the CIS servers and reports do not work in most cases.There is no balance in the game at all. Recently, Crafton has merged regions to find games faster, but this is all a lie. In fact, they decided to save on servers and simply merge neighboring regions and not pay for servers and their maintenance. Everyone already knows the situation with the SA region)) ping 150 and the inability to play. Fortunately, the resonance and the petition for 60k signatures about the return of the SA servers bore fruit and the developers **** their pants and returned the servers. The balance in the squad search works against you as much as possible. As a player of rank 1 bronze, 95% of the time I come across noobs with new accounts or rank 2 or 3 with complete noobs who don't understand where they are being shot at from. The enemy team will interfere with you with rank 5 masters who can see everyone through mountains, walls and kilometers of distance. I think it's not worth talking about the results of such matches. As a result, I do not recommend anyone to play this garbage sharpened for donation skins and a huge number of cheaters until the developers take up the creation of an anti-cheat.. its mid, not all, fortnite better, but its slightly cool i would say, overrated.. Made a lot of memories with this one!! i recommend everyone to give it a try :). It's sad to see what this game has become. A genre-defining game turned into a ""may the best cheater wins"" game. Winner winner cheater dinner. Fun times with friends in collage. 8/10 gameplay 7/10 graphics 7/10 environments. It was interesting to play in the third person instead of the first person, and it was fun when I played with my friends, but why did my account get banned for using it in China? It's a game with a lot of hacks and a lot of problems.. the game is awesome but they dont do **** about the cheaters, they just dont care. neither is there a ranking game if u **** and want to play with friends u get obliterated by clans. there is no balance and just cheater galore. dont waste your time if you want to get frustrated like me. Great potential but just horrible execution.. It was amazing, and then it wasn't don't fix it if it ain't broke. Nuff said.. Amazing game. I played for 2500hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. PUBG is also really good at anticheating and the game is super clean, at least in the mode I play, there are almost 0 cheaters and when you see one and report, they are banned almost immediately. The updates are smart and we are lucky to have a lot of amazing maps. If you are interested in realistic BR, its a must try imo. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC. gl hf. Whats with all the cheaters? Shooting thru walls is not a game... Also only 3 matches max per day? LOL Glad I didnt pay for this..

With its realistic graphics, immersive atmosphere, competitive gameplay, and ongoing updates, PUBG continues to offer an exciting and competitive experience. This game is undoubtedly a must-try for players who enjoy the battle royale genre.. Kind of boring and empty Battle Royale game, in my opinion. PUBG was the first Battle Royale game I played, when the genre was still new for me. I liked its style of playing, with the arena that got smaller over time, finding weapons to defend yourself against other players and the teamwork when playing with friends. My fun however, was short-lived with this game. This was mainly because I thought it looks and feels a little empty. I played many times with friends, and even then, I got this feeling. Normally when I play any game with friends, this is not the case, so for me, I knew that this was not a game that I would play for many years. The graphics in PUBG are a little boring. I did not expect shiny next generation visuals or something, but everything is almost the same color, green grasslands with a orange sky. It looks kind of realistic, like everyday life, but the whole atmosphere just felt hollow. The sound effects from weapons are great and get close to realism. The controls and movement are a little stiff and felt a little slow. This is mainly because of the big world you are walking in, making a mile really feel like a mile. My problem, as always, with this kind of games, is that I am just not skilled enough. I try very hard to stay alive and kill another player, but they are always faster than me. Well, in a game like Counter Strike for example, this is fine, I respawn immediately and can try again and might get some kills and streaks afterwards. But with games like PUBG, you walk around, collect stuff, do not see a living soul in sight and then *Bam*, dead. For me, the game is over and I need to find another server to play on. Then you got the fact that this game felt like Battlefield 2, my arch nemesis when talking online shooters. Massive open, empty world, walk for miles and miles, and then get shot. It was some sort of Vietnam flashback for me and I immediately disliked the game by the second. The biggest problem, that has been patched if I am not mistaken, was that players could turn down their graphics to potato mode, in which grass and foliage disappeared. This gave them a huge advantage over players that were hiding in the grass to avoid being killed. For me, this almost killed all the fun I had with the game at the time. In the end, PUBG was fun for a couple of hours, and I had some joy with it, but with the knowledge of today, I prefer Apex Legends over this one **** me personally, I would not recommend this game.. It's a revolutional game of history of FPS genre. In this game, you can feel a dramatic recoil like real gun. And, it basically paly in Third perspective but you can change your perspective to First perspective. Also, this game spread one of the genres, 'battleroyal' around the world. *Surprisingly, this game has a storyline like other games. But, its story doesn't appear in this game directly. You can watch this storyline only in PUBG's Youtube channel.. the game is good, but of course not too much and for the mode why you have to pay 12USD just to open ranked, this is really unfair. literally this game are rpg ****. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Not the PUBG we used to know. Back in the days it was the best battle royale game but we all know what happened afterwards. Giving it 5 for good memories but I won't recommend it right now.. Game is alright, could ve been way better optimized considering that time, but its alright, fkn review bomb. This game lives and dies by the quiet moments of tension when you aren't sure if youre alone, and the sudden bursts of violence and noice when you realize you aren't. Its a riveting gameplay pattern and with a variety of vehicles and tools to use rounds always feel different. I was terrible at this game but still a lot of fun with friends.. I play PUBG Lite but unfortunately game abandoned by the developers, I installed PUBG but it is very poorly optimized unless I have a huge PC, I much prefer Fortnite which by the way has anime characters, etc ..., In short I uninstall this ...

This game is that started the Battle royal thingy. But i see why no one is talking about this game to day. I have one point why i think this game is rather bad, and that is after 5 hour of bot mach you get to normal game to get destroided by lv. 70 to 80 players when i was only lv 5. that destroid my motivation to go on with this game. with that ill give this game 2 of 10(at least this game did not crash and stuff).. Great game, super addictive and fun. .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game started an era, it is the ancestor of battleground games. It's not a good game for me, I've come across a lot of bugs, but I have respect.. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. Graphics - 8/10 Gameplay - 6/10 Control - 6/10 Detailing - 6/10 Optimization - 8/10 Interesting - 5/10 Personal tastes - 6/10 Sound - 5/10 Physics - 6/10 Mechanics - 5/10 How quickly you get bored - -4/-10 Bugs - -2/10 Balance - 4/10 Community - 5/10 Players - 6/10 Servers - 8/10. I think it's the fundamental game of Battle Royale! It's so much fun and money is not a waste! I really recommend it!. It's been 3 years since I first played. For those who are not familiar with FPS genre, it will be really hard to play and survive. Many things have to be updated.. In my opinion the worst of the biggest BRs on the market. Comparing it to Fortnite, Apex and Warzone PUBG simply dies on the vine. The first issue you'll run into is the optimization. It hasn't improved much since the launch of the game. It's horrible although the game looks like stitched up Unity assets. Thank god this game is free now and not like it used to be. My second point is the gameplay. The recoil feels terrible and FP camera looks quite clunky when compared to TP point of view. The movement is really strange. Sometimes it feels like you're sliding on the floor and sometimes your character can barely move. While the unforgiving aspect of the game can be really adrenaline pumping in the moments where there's nothing happening the game can feel like a walking simulator. Yes that aspect also extends to other BR games but in PUBG because of the size of the maps it really shows. Along with it's unforgiving nature it creates really unfun situations in which you're often killed before you even have a time to react. Along with it comes lots of controversies the game and dev team had through it's lifespan like for example releasing an unfinished and broken port **** for consoles when the game itself hasn't been fully finished. Overall the PUBG in the bigger scale may not seem that bad but when compared to it's competition it has nothing to offer apart from unforgiving gameplay and semi-realistic weapon systems. If you really want to play a battle royale you've got a ton of better, free and more fleshed out options.. Too much **** players that proning in the blue zone and wait until sombody cross their pass. Non sense non fun gameplay. Pubg should change its priciples about blue zone. People picking up a huge amount of meds and jammer pack and camping in the blue. It must got a faster movement that campers cannot one shot players. PUBG is perfect example of nice idea but horrible realization. This game just bad in, well, every aspect.. PUBG: Battlegrounds is not really free-to-play, but rather a demo version, it is possible to download PUBG for free. But there is a catch. You cannot play Ranked and Custom mode for free. If you can get by with Normal or Training mode and Team Deathmatch, there is nothing to worry about, which is limited to only a few matches and then you are out of luck. However, you can access the full version of the game only after purchasing the Battlegrounds Plus DLC worth $12.99. In addition, you will also get some skins and 1300 G-Coins. 1 map all the way around.. This is the only game i've needed to play in the last 5 years, say what you want about things that are common to ALL games such as bugs and desync and the torturous learning curve. Truth is, once you learn to play, you'll not need to buy any other game, I have 3000Hrs on this game and headed seriously to keep on playing. That's worth a 10 in my book.. Really good game to play with friends. Has some optimization issues but the main problem is the abundance of cheaters.. They cant even spell their own name right let alone make a half functioning game! Literally worst thing I've ever played.. Lierally nothing is made properly, cheaters in every single match and each patch makes the ""game"" worse.. Guys can you send me to hack link please because everybody is cheating in this **** **** game and nobody ban them **** your **** game **** **** asian idiots. Real name: Egoistic idiots laggy game. -Insanely long time to kill (people survive multiple rifle rounds to chest and head from close range) -Not enough time, if you get into a fight on going to new zone you will be killed for being outside it. -ugly as **** the textures are worse than ps2 games. -cluttered mess of a menu with no explanation to anything. -Full of cheaters, if you reach top 10 you will get killed by some aimbotting loser. Monumental waste of potential.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What ""PUBG"" stands for is below: Plagues the players with tons of Chinese and hackers Unoptimized as hell even ""decent"" rigs can never keep up **** teamers and team-killers everywhere to ruin your fun Garbage, the total garbage nobody should even look at The devs are all brain-dead, money-bagging, fraudulent scammers. They have no idea about making the game better or ""FIXED"", they won't do something with infesting cheats, but all they do is money milking. With no doubt, it is the worst game ever, the most toxic cancer in the entire gaming industry. We can never see why that ****ness still exists, while there are quite a lot of BR followers which are definitely better than that. All we need is the DEATH of the game and the bodies of the entire dev team, including that PlayerUnknown guy.. At the time this released, it was generally an enjoyable experience. Nowadays, though, the game is starting to feel more and more like those mobile rip offs that keep popping up.. Score: 7.7 I think a User Score of 5 is very low, i understand the problems this game has, they are a lot.... But this was by far the best Battle Royale we had after Season 3 H1Z1. The enviorment, the gameplay, the feeling of actually winning.... Amazing. Too bad this guys in blueballs didn't deciude to actually use the money they got from all of us, and invest it in their game.. And for what reason does this game refuse to run? Just a flight without explanation. Probably I have something licensed, what is IT swearing at all the time? Strange, but how does he let cheaters into the game then? I'm already silent about the horse update system, where each patch weighs like ****.. t the time, it was a breakthrough. The birth of a new genre. But now, several years after the release, this game seems so slow and outdated. Respect for the genre, but now the game can go to rest, because there are many battle pianos on the market that are much better.. I gladly tried the game out on a HEAVY discount, quickly refunded, was a couple months ago and glad my intuition was correct on refunding because now it's a free to play garbage of a mess.. Personaly i dont like this game,beacuse we have far more creative and interesting games like Apex Legends and CoD Warzone,so i dont see sense of buying this game. UPD from 2022, game is worse than ever a lot of cheates, thrash optimization and horrible new maps. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I found the mix of survival, online FPS game with a lot of gear options quite intriguing. The first image I watched of it on twitch was of naked people running with guns. Judge me but I consider this iconic for the age. All in all, I enjoyed the game.. It was at the right place at the right time to explode with the rise of BRs. It's fallen far, far, far from the heights of 2016-2017. It was a great time when it lasted but it's miserable to play nowadays.. the best battle royale, the casuals were given a casual warzone, they started to put 0 points to battlegrounds because they are being torn there, it's funny.. The fact that the game has a 85 metascore is really amazing to me. The game is not good name any other BR and it's probably more worth your time than this game. Fortnite? Warzone? Apex? go play any of them. The game itself is cool, but there is no approximate ranking system and this is sad. You just enter the game and play against lvl 500. I do not recommend the game just because of this, it is impossible to play.. There is no way this game gets a 10. It is super buggy with rampant rubber-banding and desync. There are a lot of cheaters, which Brendan Greene talked about on the H3H3 podcast yesterday. Plus the current ranking system favors super boring camping style. An excellent game, however, a huge number of bugs, cheaters and performance problems prevent the game from playing.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 62 IIIIIIIIII====================NP. It was fun to run for a hundred hours - two, high-quality shooting physics, low-quality driving physics. Really slow. Weapons and hit-reg are so bad. Walking, running, driving, shooting and everything else is slow and feels so bad. You will keep walking and walking to find some action, and when you do, you realize it's for nothing. You can't hit the enemy because hitbox or hit-reg is a failure. This game is probably made for 80-year-old people that cannot reach the speed of new games.. While I may enjoy this a ton more than Fortnite, the community is still relatively toxic and the only people playing now are the sweaty tryhards who will show you no mercy.. the worst battle royal game i have ever played thare is nothing good about this game. This game is too bad. Trash optimization, bad graphics... Please dont buy it!. The worst game I played ever. There are cheaters on every game... And lots of players played it I don't know why.. At first it was best of its kind, but it gets worse than a good action surviving game. So many cheaters.. A lot of fun, despite many issues and bugs. The shooting is a bit difficult and the movement stiff, but overall it is still great.. Game is dying **** optimization,game crashing,cheaters,slow game loading(even on powerful PCs).Devs removes map pick because of bots(300k online,nice).Also they dont communicate with community. Battle royal games like this one ****. They're bad for the gaming industry. And the fact this game got nominated for GOTY back in 2017 in a dreadful state what a joke.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I mean the game itself isn't too bad, but i just cant have fun in it anymore. The gameplay looks like: -Join game -Go loot something -Go loot more -Get shot from a guy in a bush or a hacker -Repeat It feels like now only the most determined players remained in this game and if you are a new player then you will have very hard time trying to do something... or maybe im just so bad at it. this game is the badest game i have ever seen befor it have potato graghic and bad optimize call of duty war zone is way better than this game i can say is tupid game. This game is just so ehhh. I would like to go in-depth, but this game isn't getting a recommendation from me.. Lazy game by lazy developers. ""Bluescam Inc"" took all the money and ran instead further developing the game. It's not even a 1.0 release yet, feels like beta, smells like beta, still is beta. It can be classified as a niche game that was great in development stages but all the hype is gone and what's left is the bones of a potentially great game. Sad. 1/10 because I still come back to it to try and recapture the feelings from it's early stages, needless to say, the feelings just aren't there anymore. Every other BR has come from far behind and passed this dying horse like an Olympic runner. Without the backing of the company that birthed this potential creation, it just doesn't stand a chance. RIPPUBG TM. its an alright game i would not pay full price for this and wait for a sale if you are planning to buy it its also very buggy and the graphics are terrible. Overrated trash game which started cancerous dumb battle royale trend. It is just blatant ripoff H1Z1. Gameplay is very slow, boring, and infested with bugs and glitches which haven't been fixed to this date. Dead teammate is forced to just watch and wait other teammates to be killed, there is no respawn mechanics. The idea is good, but the implementation is very poor. You play as if against bots, a lot of bugs, in short the game is not worth the money.. 6000 hours. 500-650 ADR depending on game type. It's safe to say I have invested in this game quite a bit. I love it. Not much to say.. Bad, boring unoptimized game. What a waste of time! Developer ****, gameplay ****, there is no reason to play this game in 2020. I can't even be bothered to write anymore than this for this garbage. Everyone that plays and enjoys this game is an Idiot.. Tried the PS4 version since it's free for PSN user...Luckily I didn't buy it before. Poor graphics, very laggy gameplay. Literally unplayable. I also own the PC version and it was okay, PS4 version is a piece of ****. Devs made 720$ millions in couple weeks. Instead of using it to fix netcode and optimize game, it ran poorly even on geforce 1080! They added micro-transactions and random loot boxes. They started as small company, wanting make a good game and after they made tons of money, they turned 180 to pure mindless greed... Game is still to this day bugged and not so good. But how many realistic BR experiences is out there? Warzone? HAhaha it has 12 tick, you shoot first, yet you die to enemy, which shoot you after you shoot him... So PUBG has still player base, even its future is not so sure. Warzone has 50m, even tick rate is non existent.... Ugh another multiplayer only game with no story mode to show for ****'t care. This game has plunged itself into the ground. What once was a big game among streamers is now a dead space filled with hacking, a very poor learning curve, and completely dull cosmetic microtransactions. Most of the matches I played consisted of me collecting some loot and then waiting to find an enemy or they find me. Hackers also plague this game however some action has been taken against this however not much. The mechanics of this game are especially poor when it comes to listening for footsteps and its physics/movement. The graphics also feel like a half baked pie as the characters look lifeless and its map, which looks straight from a mobile game. Its a shame this game has come to this as it was once not like this. I think its time is over and that the studio should focus on something new.. The worst thing that ever happened to gaming this **** is worser than E.T Damn you blue hole Damn the battle royale games and the worst thing is that the creators are aware how a piece of **** their game is and they know they don't deserve this succes and still after millions of idiots playing the game and having millions of dollars they still don't try to improve their trash of a videogame because they know that some hyped idiots will play the game even though they don't improve it. I love this game so much I played on my iPhone and super cool and enjoyable game . And now i buy this game on my steam and game graphic looks amazing on pc PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is best battle royal game ️. Player Unknown's Battleground was a welcomed surprise, when I first discovered it in Early Access on Steam. It instantly hooked me, when I killed my first opponent with my bare fists, while rushing into the same house as him. Since then the game evolved rapidly. From time to time they add new bugs and for me as a coder it is unbelievable how this is even possible with all the budget and resources they have at hand. However, for 20 Bucks on Steam it is a great bargain, as it provides a ton of fun for a very long time.. Everything is clear here, the game is the worst in its genre. It's just a crooked ****. Best game ever! I`m playing PUBG since 2017 and i really like gameplay mechanics. I'll admit It's good, yeah perfomance never got any better but worse, I played over a hundred hours and never got past being average. Yeah you could say I don't like 'cause I never got good but that's on the game.. 2020: Heavy game with terrible optimization. The more you play, the more it increases your frustration. Too bad because the concept is fun. Save your money. About PUBG Lite. A lot of bots, especially at night. In a game of 100 people, there can be 95 bots. Terribly.. If you have the hardware to run it, this game can become very addicting. A great game to play with friends. The learning curve is steep but satisfying as you master handling each weapon.. Good game, set the beginning of the battle royale games. It is on it that other games of this genre are made. Unfortunately, it is not perfect, bugs that take a long time to fix cannot be played too actively in it, because any camper will punish you for it. Sorry 7.. I've been playing this game for quite some time. I remember when the game had very low FPS even on very good GPUs. Now as they've gone through #fixpubg I can tell that the game is very different in a good way from where it been. Sadly I think it's too late. I got banned once for a mistake and there was a ""game ban"" on my steam profile which made me very angry, turned out later that it was a bug and a lot of players were falsely banned, thankfully now I'm not banned but it was scary. The game itself is pretty good, it's just another BR game where you drop, loot, kill die/win. No fancy abilities, classes, building abilities or reviving on the nearest station, no way to ""buy weapons"" in game, no economy. The good thing in the beginning were cases where you could buy some of them in game and sell them on the market. I'm not sure how much I've made but it was probably close to the game price so I can say that practically the game has returned it's value to my steam wallet. Pretty nice thing. Unfortunately now there is no way like that. I remember that there was a case that was 1/4 of the game price. Fun times.. Preety fun, but also very annoing. Devs destroyed game market, and one of the biggest issue with this game is that if 100 players is on the server is very likely that atleast one will be cheater and destroy fun for all players :(. It's an average game. Not bad but also not good to be honest. You played PUBG because it was the hot game in Steam and got pestered to join the Squad/Duo. The game has average graphics but runs like Crysis 1 on crack. Could be that the Developer slept on the Optimizing Performance part. Minus Points for spawning Fortnites success and EGS dividing the PC Platform over some **** free games.. Having about just enough of the bugs, cheaters and bad design. I play about once a month since like february, and EVERY SINGLE GAME I run into cheaters. Right now, I got killed by a guy which sounded he's right in the front of me, while the whole time he was somewhere else. I went into the lobby, and the replay button is completely missing, even after restart. F*CK BLUEHOLE STUDIO. It's the worst technically executed game I have ever seen. From like a year 2016/17, they made an unbelievable amount of money, and the game is still the f*cking same, only like what... two new maps, which look like an 8-year old kid was playing with the editor. I would SO much like to see, what they are actually doing with the money they are getting? It's just not possible they are working there. Btw, you can see they don't even bother buying a bit more servers, because in like 70 percent of modes, the matchmaking is just infinitely long and the game never starts. This game was like accidentally good, because of Brendan Greene, but in every other way it's a DISGRACE TO THE VIDEOGAME INDUSTRY.. a lot like Fortnite, which is one of me favorite games, so that's a plus, would recommend to people who like shooter games.. Nice cheat, bro. no optimization, no content for such a price tag .It is fail. Six out of ten because PlayerUnkowns´ BattleGrounds Type Of Battle Royale. The game is always progressing in the same cycle. And It Makes The Game Boring. Except that one. Other Features Are Excellent.. This game is f*ck*ng flawless masterpiece. In this game you can be cheater (if you have more than $100). Good graphics, good synchronization but not so good hit registration.. I hate the mobile version of the game, and I hate that it overshadowed PUBG steam, But overall PUBG is better than Fortnite, But None of em worth playing in 2020, Because COD WARZONE is free and based on a very advanced tech, Don't forget about Apex too And even ROE is better than both PUBG and Fortnite, Meh.. All the good aspects of the game are incredibly watered down and hidden behind laggy servers, horrid optimization, washed colors and repetitive towns/houses/etc.. I made an account just to rate this game. Honestly, the gunplay and game mechanics are a lot better than most battle royal games, sadly due to the horrible Devs this game has, it has turned into Who has the Best Hacks. Almost every match you play has around 10%-30% of the lobby being hackers, with blatant wa","for 7 years, this game has been stagnating in terms of optimization . after the game switched to FTP, it became a breeding ground for cheaters . Stupid cheaters with fresh accounts get banned for a week ."
"1,010.Forza Horizon 2","A GOATED FORZA, WITH A ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE, INSANE, SENSATIONAL, the rain gaves to us a nice experience, the best rain in games that i ever seen, also, i like the cars list, really good, unfortunally un 2024, u cant get dlc cars anymore, but, not really a big trouble, i still enjoy this game, and imo its better than fh5. i like the 360 version better, you can sell your cars offline like on the first forza horizon but not on the Xbox one version, I will never understand why that feature was taken out, the Xbox one version is not as glitchy and has better graphics, but has glitchy gearshift audio.. In my opinion, this game is an absolute 10/10, it has almost everything good about new Forza Horizon, but it also has a lot of good stuff from the older games. Overall even though the servers have been shut down and you can't buy any of the DLCs (and also that's it's only on Xbox One) I think it's still worth a shot in 2023.. Perfect mix betwen Simulation and Arcade racing games.. It's OK, although the only game in the series that's not great.. This title of the Forza franchise is considerably one of the best arcade racing games, With a map that makes you feel free, driving on the road you will have the freedom to race with cars from the fastest to the oldest and most powerful.. This is the best Forza game !!!!! I love DustinEden !!!! I love DustinEden !!!!! I love DustinEden !!!!!!!!. This game is fantastic the setting is spectacular very good great I would say. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Forza Horizon 2 is definitely better than Horizon 1 in some ways but prefer the others. Maybe it's because I haven't spent as much time with it but I don't know. Forza Horizon 2 is a really good game and is beautiful to look at. There are a lot more cars than Horizon 1. I don't like how you have to choose a car class for the championship instead of what ever car you want. I think that's why I don't like it as much.. This is an amazing racing game, though I personally like the fist Horizon a little more.. The Best racing game of all time! Superior to anything to-date in 2022. Better than Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5. Beautiful roads, beautiful driving conditions. Brilliant Championships which have been lost to the series. Fantastic handling model, great speed. Bucket lists are perfect, so is the music and showcase events.. I'm not a big racing fan but I've always loved forza, it's not so serious it's boring like drive club or forza, they are dull Imo but forza - it's full of life and looks gorgeous, great music, great with friends and is real fun.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 8 Music: 8 Story: 6 Total: 7.50. After playing the first horizon I had to try this one out. Really different feel as it’s on a new console other than the 360 but loved the races. Some were difficult and I ignored most of the bucket lists and barn finds.. Graphics 7/10 Playability 8/10 Entertainment 8/10 Overall 8/10 Good arcade racing.. Another great outing in the Horizon series with a really awesome soundtrack. I usually play my own music when playing racing games but for this one it was not needed. I actually added music from the soundtrack to my actual playlist.. This game is gorgeous one of the best racing games ever made a classic of Xbox One a Masterpiece. It's great that more additions are being released to expand the number of races. The only downside is that at some point the game becomes very monotonous. Best race game!!! This is bietiful! I love this game! Thanks Playground games for this!. The good: You are the “friend of the organizer” of the festival and your idea of ​​where to take the action in the six locations to develop mini-festivals there. It has integration with the Xbox One Game DVR which allows you to record the best moments you make automatically. The licensed soundtrack. A classical music station in Italian (or they did not translate the participations of this DJ) is added to make the hustle easier. Horizon Rocks, Horizon Pulse returns with their respective DJs giving a lot of life to what happens at the festival. Random rain and dynamic weather storms are integrated. The Storm Island expansion and Porsche Expansion adds more hours of game and car challenges, as well as events in super-devastating storms and The Gauntlet. Challenge lists and Drivatar integration from Forza Motorsport 5 are added for your friends to integrate with you asynchronously and play credits in the process. The bad: Super stars do not return. Illegal races do not return outside the festival. It only has five special events. The scenarios of forest, vineyards and forest with vineyards, castles, ruins and plantations are repeated a lot and it may seem like a ""rural"" Forza (plus a more modern coastal strip) The Meh!: Although this is a version called the same for Xbox 360, the Xbox One version is much superior with different events, cars and features. And by the way many talkers that Playground Games has created works of art, there is also the logo of Turn 10 in the box. I love this franchise! The best racing game of all time, yes now this is the one to beat!. [ ] Perfect [x] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. My childhood in a game... This game marked my life in Xbox 360, it has some bugs like 999,999,999 cr, but you can avoid it. But it is really nice.. As good as the first one, if not even better. Racing, that is actually fun (I'm looking at you Need for Speed). Pickens out.. I started Forza Horizon 2 previously having played the 3 and 4 part. As I was surprised when understood that 2 parts are what to surprise. In 2 parts there is a similarity of a plot, there is an interesting card on which Italy and France went in. And the most important in Horizon 2 the most convenient management in all series. It is a pity that a game was already removed from Xbox Live and there is no opportunity to buy DLC or Season Pass for it.. yet to come -----------------------------------------------------------------. Bought this long time ago and never actually got the time to try it out as not a huge racing fan but i started it few months back finished it and restarted it again, simply brilliant, worth every dime and i got it on discount so tat makes it even better. A great Racer, love the campaign.. Amazing game. It's extremely fun to explore the area, and the option to add realistic damage or keep arcade damage on your car makes it much better. The developers obviously put a lot of time and effort into this game. I still haven't gotten Forza Horizon 3, but I feel as if I don't have to because of what this game has to offer. The game crashes every once in a while for me, but that may be a hardware issue with my XBOX.. This is such a good game. It is by far my favorite Forza game to date. It has very modern look in terms of it's UI. Also, it has vey little to almost no bugs. This is my third favorite game I've ever played and definetley the best racing game.. Forza Horizon 2 I love this game because of the realistic cars and driving. One feature of this game that I like is the autoshow, where you can buy cars with in-game credits and real life money. Another brilliant feature in this game is the ability to upgrade your car. The point of the game is to beat the Horizon Finale, but before you can do that you have to race in and win different championships. One thing that keeps me in this game is the barn finds that can be found through earning, or buying, the $20.00 treasure map ('_'). My favorite car is the Lambo LM002 because it is huge and is classified as an offroad vehicle. I would definitely recommend this game to other people, it'll be worth your money.. Great graphics, Immensely fun but some are bit repetitive. Good selection of cars in base game. I still hate it that not all car packs are included in the season pass.. The best arcade racer on the Xbox One, with enjoyable gameplay, nice radio stations and colorful graphics. It's a lot of fun to find shortcuts in the vs races and time trials and the off-road races are unlike anything in other racing games. The only minuses are that the visuals aren't as stunning and next-gen as in DriveClub and also the career mode was over too quickly.. Spectacular, is what Forza Horizon is! I really enjoy this game, such a beautiful and big open world! If you want a racing game with open world, this is the game!. I have to start out with this the game is amazing and i love the graphics and the cars are way better and we get Porsche in the game which is awesome. Also when i started out i noticed that u can give every single car all wheel drive which was necessary cause most of the races are a bit off road. I also love the music in the game its great but not as good as horizon but still its a pretty good soundtrack and the physics are really good too.. An expansive, open-world visual thrill, Forza Horizon 2 caters to light drivers and hardcore racers alike. Featuring top-notch graphics and a massive racing circuit, Horizon will definitely not let players down.. HORIZON is the BEST version of the franchise HANDS !@#!@#!@ DOWN. Ultimate freedom in an open world is WAY better then the other versions which are tracked based and simply BORING. Forza 3 is going to be EPIC as we all know.. It's so simple ... Driving Nirvana ... Digital Decadence ... A perfect blend of simulation and arcade ... The PERFECT driving game EVER made in OUR time and reality ... The BEST game since Top Gear 3 on the snes ... Even better than that ... Forza 3 is the 2nd Coming apparently ... But I love THIS game and I'm keeping the first car I won ... The red one with the white stripe ... Whatever ever that was ... I'm a public transport kind of guy, I don't know all the cars ... But I LOVE this game! ... phew. Good game but the first part is more like in the game does not have the career that was in the first part of it is very boring Graphically, the game is not very if the car looked properly but unfortunately they messed up in Forza 5 parts and just perenisli in Horizon where cars are not that present graphical bugs and not fixed a still.. A superb driving game that keeps pulling me back months after I will stop playing. Graphics, Cars, Sounds Game play is all superb but the only problem I have with FH2 is the fact that the story is so bland after a few races and finales.. The best arcade racing game what is possible. This game gives you freedom, great world, amazing cars and comfortable drive system. Hundreds of car models with full details, real models includes rare models and prototypes. There is nothing negative for me.. First racer I have ever played, so I am not rating on a curve. The game was fairly good, but it did not persuade me to want to buy a sequel when it comes out. I appreciate the steps they took to change it from a pure racing sim, but thye need some serious help on that front if they intend to broaden the appeal to non-racing gamers. Pros: They made an easy difficulty that allowed even a noob like me to find the game accessable and enjoyable. For the first 1/3 of the game I used the easy mode and then gradually stepped up the challenge. Really well done. Pretty looking game; not the greatest graphics nor the most scenic settings but better than average. Car sounds were very realistic and enjoyable....easy to find immersion just cruising down the road. Cons: Biggest single player gripe is the radio stations. I get it that songs people know are expensive to license, but everyone else seems to do it. I see fanboys positing that it is done purposely for this reason or that but it is obviously a money issue. The most popular music of the people your games a geared to is pop, rock and hip hop and yet we get 1 station of classical, and 6 stations of indie house music garbage. Neddless to say I, and I imagine the vast majority play with the radio **** least allow us to customize a playlist.....huge fail in a driving game. Largest gripe in the online play is there is no penalty for damaging your car....sure it looks damaged, but it doesn't impact performance, so every race turns into a smash and crash.....like laying Hold'em with no stakes....every fool goes all-in every time.....another huge fail. Outside of racing there is very, very little to do......even the road trips are a race...sure, it says take your time, enjoy the scenery and yet you add dozens of AI vehicles all around you going your exact speed, no matter what it is, and smashing into you. Finally, for as expensive as it is to make these games, adding a few extra towns so you aren't asked to take road trips to the same 6 spots over and over again would be relatively inexpensive and yet would go a long way to cover up the monotony.. One of the best racers in years. A proper story mode, great graphics, and an exceptional soundtrack. A true next gen racer with flair. The new Need For Speed.. I heard that it is a really good game, so I went to buy it, and I started playing. I started to drive, and I found myself with controls that aren't easy for me, because I make a lot of mistakes in Forza. After the first race, I got 8th place, because the controls in my opinion are very hard for me. If you can get past the first race, great for you. I could not, so I'm giving this game a 3/10 because although the graphics are impressive, it is hard for me.. Forza Horizon 2 is, simply put, the best racing game ever made. I loved every second of it, as everything just works. The cars are beautiful, and the gameplay is phenomenal.. the game is okay. but i really wish could marry the mechanic, Ashley. she is perfect. i am very disappointed in the fact that she is not even date-able. Maybe she is already taken, but i think she has feelings for me. if the game allowed for facial recognition maybe she would know how i feel. i just want closure. i just need to know if its time to move on. please, ashley. please....... For my money, it's the best racing game this generation. There's an insane amount of content in this game. The championship races can grow a bit stale after you complete the main set, but there's plenty of other options to keep the game interesting. Graphics are top notch. Customizing is what you would expect from the Forza series. The ""Storm Island"" DLC is a also well done addition with a bunch more races and bucket list challenges. 9/10. Spectacular! Simply amazing! I love the game. The graphics are so awesome! Great job for the team. Forza as always go forward and make me be just without words. Love the driveability. Love the news (dark, rain, country races, on line mode). So awesome! Horizon 2 a must have game for who love races games.. Horizon 2 takes the deeper aspects of the Forza series such as: excellent visuals, outstanding sound mixing, superb gameplay, realism and competitiveness, and translates it into a very addictive and above all fun open world experience. Although it is a shame that does not have a local co-op, online functions are more than sufficient. Horizon 2 arrives first on the podium for fans of racing games and is a good add to anyone's game library.. OMFG this game is just awesome! Huge open world, 200+ cars and the ability to drive everywhere. The game takes place after 2012's Forza Horizon and yes this is a direct sequel to Forza Horizon. The game features a wonderful array of cars, from jeep wranglers to Lamborghinis there is no shortage of fun here. The events are just like Forza Motorsport 5. They are arranged in Championships. Basically choose a car category and you are done. Select the car category, buy or choose a car you currently own and just race. During when the championships are over and you have the option to choose another championship and you pick it you are given a mini task to drive to a certain area on the map in a limited amount of time. But only if you want a small but satisfying cash reward. You can always rejoin the same championship and still possible beat the game with only one car. The map is also so huge. The time spent to get from one side of the map to the other side horizontally is almost 15 minutes. You'll also find fun car challenges that you can race in. They are called Bucket List challenges. All you have to do is follow the simple instructions on the car challenge bio and just hop in and drive. But you can only use them for the event. They also feel like test drives. In case you haven't got Pagani Huyura you've always wanted, try it out, you love it, like it, or hate it when it comes to its driving. Next we will talk/type about the special events. These are given out at a random time but you have a high possibility of earning a free car which is very nice. You can either face against train, airplanes, and hot air balloons. They are spectacular and don't get too boring. Rain and fog is now implemented into the game and they are both meant to enhance the simulation a bit more. The game also features a leveling up system. When you level up you get a chance at winning a free car or rewards ranging from 2,500 credits to over 100,000 credits. Its a really nice touch. You don't just get a free risk taker thing, but you also get a perk point. You can understand how this will go if you've every played an rpg. The game runs at an unbreakable 30 Frames Per Second at 1080p. Amazing how the frame rate never drops not even once. And did I say how good the game looks. HOLY F***ING S*** it gave me a boner. The game almost looks photo realistic. Bye Bye.. Best Next Gen game period. This can be played any style you want, arcade , sim, in the middle. Easy pickup and play for any age and glamorous graphics and perfect gameplay. This will be a keeper for a long time to come.. This is easily one of my favorite racing games of all times. It effortlessly blends elements of sim-esque physics and arcade gameplay into one original experience. This takes the premise of the first Horizon to the next level. The graphics are fantastic, the environment, outside of some sketchy off-road bushes, are surprisingly well detailed. The gameplay is fun and open world with a variety of settings. Want to go for a coastal blast along the Med in your LaFerrari? Do it. Want to turn an old Abbey into a rally stage with your Escort Cossy? You can. How about a 235mph blast down the highway connecting France and Italy? Just hop in your Veryon and GO! The free roam aspect of this game means you can never really get that bored with it.. If possible I would give this game a 9.5. I used to only be an action, shooter fan, but this game made me a fan of the racing genre. Presented racing in an exciting way that made it approachable to someone with no racing game experience. The offroad gameplay was fun as well as the storm island DLC. The Porsche DLC was okay and the fast and furious DLC **** but was free.. It's a simulation racing game, you do events, collect faster cars and race them against tougher opponents. Liked the off roading aspect but the story line was kinda iffy and the premise was not immersive. There was no objective other than more cars or any kind of real endgame pulling me along.. I have to ask, why the consoles can have 4 controllers? Even a racing game dont support local multyplayer! The new halo, destiny, this game, need for speed.... A father cant play with his son? I cant play with my brother with only one console and 2 controllers? Why?. this is the best car racing game out so far , it has everything imaginable that will keep u busy for hours on end !!! The game is so good that i just sold it at gamestop ( to have funds for the new forza game coming out soon) and still got 30 bucks credit !! If that doesn't tell u how good the game is nothing will. Online racing is pure joy and the world feels great in this game. All cars feels different and responsive. The game finds great balance between arcade and simulation. Playing the game without assists feels great. The only annoying part of the game is: the online infection and king games. There really should be an option to skip these childish games. Almost every roadtrip the infection or king games are a part of the 4 races. There are obviously people liking it, but for the more adult gamer, these gameplay variants are just annoying. Still: a great game.. Absolutely blown away by Horizon 2! Such a feeling of racing party, stunning landscape, cars, sound, seamless singleplayer>multiplayer, cars controls ..everything is just like it should be. I love it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is... perfection. Combining Test Drive Unlimited with Forza is a match made in heaven. I'm a huge fan of racing and open world games and after having played hundreds of hours of Forza Motorsport, I now feel like the Motorsport series has little purpose to exist. Make no mistake, although Horizon 2 comes across as being more causal and exciting, it makes no compromises in gameplay. Sure it's not 60 FPS but the environments are very pretty - as are the cars. Dynamic weather, day-night cycle, decent soundtrack and best of all, varied event types and RPG elements. All of these benefits without any loss of identity. This is still very much a Forza game in terms of its customisation. You can still upgrade and tune every minute detail of each car as well as create and download masterful artistic designs for the liveries. The skill system definitely adds to the gameplay and makes it more meaningful. The fact that it's all open world means you won't spend time in menus, and there's no long loading times. After each event you are given the option to improve your time for better rewards rather than having to go through menus to find Rivals. There's plenty to see and do in Horizon 2 - especially given the Head to Head challenges of Drivatars roaming around along with collectibles and the Bucket List challenges. My favourite thing about this game is the off-roading. With the variety of cars in this game - especially off-roaders and rally cars, this adds to the excitement. No longer are you limited to a limited choice of circuit tracks like in Motorsport. Rather, there are more exciting events like racing against jets in a Ferrari 360 CS or a train in a Lancia Fulvia. It's great to see so many licensed cars of all types being packed into an open-world game with deep customisation and tuning. Unlike the Forza Motorsport series, Horizon 2 is all about excitement and fun. Whilst it offers all the options of the serious simulator, it couldn't care less about how you've tuned your car or placing strict limitations on performance index. It's more focused on the type of experience and car - rallying, hot hatch, GT, supercars, saloons, retro etc. All of these elements combine together beautifully to create a perfect racing game. It has the solid mechanics and customisability of a simulator but doesn't feel boring. The excitement of an arcade racer with the depth of a simulator. It is not just Forza by name. The detail of the cars and their interiors - even the traffic cars - is amazing. Best of all, you don't need to be a Gold member or play with friends to get the full experience. The Drivatars roaming the world feel like real players even if they're not. I gave Test Drive Unlimited 2 a 9/10 despite it not being a high-budget game. But Horizon 2 takes the vision and refines it. This is any racing game fan's dream. It is the absolute pinnacle of racing games - both in terms of breadth, depth, design and quality.. If you like drifting, GET THIS GAME, Ive always enjoyed drifing in Forza, but you couldn't really do it very well in the first horizon because you couldn't tune your car, which was dissapointing because drifting around a real city rather than a race track would have been great. but then horizon 2!! and you can drift! they even put 4 very decent areas to drift on the map. If you like drag racing you in for a bit of a dissapointment, now don't get me wrong, they put everything in this game you need to drag, and a nice place to do it at as well, HOWEVER drag racing is kind of ruined by one single car, the alfa romeo 33 stradale. There is no other car in the game that can even come close to the speed and just raw acceleration of that car, which kind of makes drag racing boring because everyone just pretty much races those cars. BUT if you find a good group of people to drift with it can be a whole lot of fun. I think the only other complaints I have are that it seems to rain way too often, and the xbox 360 version they released was just a complete rip off, not cool. But the map is great, theres sooooo many cars, they even released a porshe pack that wont completely destroy your wallet like the last one. If your looking for a driving game, THIS is the only one worth getting (until forza 6 comes out at least). I got a Xbox One for Christmas, and got Assassins Creed Unity, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Forza Horizon 2. Since I have also gotten Forza 5, Destiny, Evolve, Titanfall, Battlefield Hardline, GTA 5, ect. But, no matter how many games I get I always go back to the Horizon festival. I like cars, so naturally I like racing games, but the physics, sounds and visuals are also superb in this game. It is just pure fun.. Forza Horizon 2 leaves all competition for dead,Why? Let me explain to you. Forza Horizon 2 sets a stunning first impression,why you drive a Lamborghini Huracan to the Horizon Festival,the music festival the game is based around. Graphically,this is the best game I have ever played,and as it's a big open world game,is even more **** will race through the streets of Nice,down the Italian coast,Through fields in Tuscany,and a whole load of other locations. The game has 700+ races in single player, from racing offroad against other drivers to racing a train,and loads more races should you play online. Gameplay wise,Horizon 2 is the best game of the **** handling is a bit more arcadey than Forza Motorsport,which this is a spin-off of,,but not to Need For Speed levels of **** the handling is amazing and is easy enough to pick up and play. Overall,Forza Horizon 2 is the best Forza title ever,the best racing game from 2011-2014,and the best game of 2014 in **** out and buy this immediately,you need to play Horizon 2 by any means necessary.. Probably my favorite racing game ever. The driving is just awesome, the places are beautiful. Great Xbox One game to get. Tons of cars to get, of course it's a better game if you get the VIP & Car pass, but if you're read to put the price in, it's definitely worth it. Not even starting to get tired of it. Just doing the roadtrips, buying new cars for new championships, doing the championships themselves... Buying a wheel and pedals with the game makes it even more fun to travel in the open world of Forza Horizon 2­. Challenges are fun to do and I think even taking pictures of other cars is fun... And I'm not even talking about online mode. Crazy fun, no regrets for buying it.. This game was amazing, a lot more fun and free world feeling than Forza Horizon. The mechanics were smooth and felt very good. Favorite game from Forza as of right now!. Pretty much everything in this game is great. Graphics, visuals, music (you won't be forced to listen to gangsta crap for countless hours), including the driving mechanics, which will really adapt to your difficulty level. It has an incredible number of cars and events to take part in, including the online modes, which are also really fun. So, the game will always remain fresh, even if you don't buy the Storm Island Pack. For me it was such a good game that I can overlook some things like sometimes cars becoming unstable when turning, or always burning out when the race begins, even not being able to take your car for a spin before making up your mind and buying it. I can only think of 2 downsides. Firstly, the skill points you earn don't grant you anything of real value. Secondly, car customization could be greatly improved. PS4 fanboys must be so jealous. I own a PS4 myself and the best cars game right now is The Crew, and boy, what a mediocre game.. Everything you'd expect. One of the best racing/driving games. BUT. BUT. BUT ...... the install time from physical disk!!!!!!!! This game took well over an hour to install from disc, with the optical disc drive on my xbone clicking and clunking all the way through. I thought my brand new game disc must be faulty so returned it to the store and changed it. Reinstalled the game from the new disc and exactly the same issue. Wondered if my disc drive was faulty so de installed and reinstalled my three other xbone games - they were all fine and reinstalled in minutes. There is something seriously messed up with the install process (or disc file structure, or anti piracy security, or whatever) of this game.. Fun game, great soundtrack. Graphics and the driving feel aren't as good as Forza 5 but I suppose that's to be expected for an open world game. Recommended for casual racing fans.. Pretty much my absolute favourite racing game of all time, and probably will be until the next game! I don't know what it is about Forza Horizon 2 in particular that makes me fall in love with it every time I pick up and play it. The soundtrack is one of my favourite features of the game, consisting of 7 stations that each play various genres of music like indie rock, garage rock, dance, EDM, classic etc. and the 260-270 strong car count makes driving to the music an absolute blast! Not to mention the graphics of the game, wow is all I can say. Full 1080p, high-res textures and stellar lighting, particularly at night, it is simply pure eye-candy, and the music and the driving just add to the sugar rush! Seriously, if you have an Xbox One, and you're looking for the essential racer, look no further! So get in your shiny new Huracan, blast some of the best tunes of 2014 on your stereo, and prepare for the summer festival of your life (even if it isn’t really summer)!. Cool game! I really like Forza Horizon 2, the graphics the gameplay just that I felt the lack of rain in the environment, the fact of have racing games today all with a rain weather, because it could not have into Horizon 2? Well, the game is good, if has a racing game today in day, that catches my attention is the Forza Horizon 2! congratulations on this great exclusive Microsoft!. It looks great, handles like a cookie cutter Forza game. but the major problem with this game, like many others on consoles: 1. It's a racing game. 2. It runs at a measly 30 fps. The reasons why it runs at this ridiculously low fps and not 60 fps at the very least are unimportant: it's the fact that it does. Racing games should also be at 60 fps. Go big or go home.. Stunning graphics and beautiful game , this is the best racing game in my opinion of 2014 and i give it a 10 out of 10 because there are no faults done while making this game.. One of the better race car games i ever played .You really can do every thing with this game , and you need over 90 hours (minimum) to finish it 100% . Just need sand environment to be PERFECT. Until now, i just finish 30% and too excited to try horizon 3. I'm quite sure that horizon 3 will be perfect game. my rate is 9.5/10 , but i can't choose 9.5 so i prefer to choose 9.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's not surprise than racing games, as a whole, are sort of on the decline these last few years, but not without reason - they've become very generic and severely lacking innovation. But maybe with Forza Horizon 2 there's hope. That's because this game doesn't just look great, it plays spectacularly as well. The graphics, from the cars to the setting, are some of the best around. T","forza horizon 2 is an absolute 10/10 . it has almost everything good about new forza horizon, but it also has a lot of good stuff from the older games . it's OK, although the only game in the series that's not great ."
"1,011.Monster Train","Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GOOD. Voice Acting: NA.. If you like Slay the Spire, you'd love this. It's quite different but satisfies that itch, this time you're the dungeon! You defend your train with different classes, I found it quite fun.. on metacritic you have to watch out for fake gamers like user whathefaq, although its kinda funny reading all their reviews. they tell a tale of massive skill issue. didn't give enough motivation to complete runs many times. But card/action parts were fun. This is a great deck builder. The concept of combining 2 classes (or races) is always great and underused in games. It leaves so many potential combos, and surprisingly many of them work well. Each race has their unique cards and combining 2 races' cards leaves some interesting potential combos. Runs include a card selection after every encounter, as well as 2-3 activities of choice, including various types of shops, recruiting a unit, removing cards from your deck, copying a card in your deck, relics, special events, etc. There are also ""challenges"" that you can toggle on or off on some encounters to increase your reward, but also difficulty. These can be interesting because the extra rewards is not always worth it depending on the circumstances. This feels more complex than Slay the Spire and you need to manage which units you put at the front, which units on which floor, which enemies will skip a floor, etc. This is not that similar to Slay the Spire though, as you don't directly control a hero that attacks & casts spells, you summon units & use spells from the ""outside"". It's more about managing the battle, the 3 floors of your train and the health of your Pyre.. Coming from Slay the Spire, I was really feeling like a similar game and I quite found it with Monster train. Nice concept, nice monsters, and a good replay value with the different races. I was just slighlty disapointed by the very low number of bosses that makes every run feel the same and some races like Umbra that are nice to play but a bit of a one trick pony.. this game is worse than Slay the spire in everyway possible - excessive animations - not well balanced - quite poorly optimized - too many animation - wonky animation - everything looks the same with the background - non transparency. You have no idea what card is discarded and what card is gone forever, unlike Slay the spire - again, unbalanced, none rewarding. Instead of killing some bosses for big reward you just randomly get some broken relic and upgrade by doing absolutely nothing - victory and defeat feel the **** same, there's no sense of achievement In short its bad, its not fun. If Youre a card games fan like me You cant go wrong with monster train. It offers tons of options, probably most complex deck builder created to this date. Definitely recommended, hundreds of hours of great gameplay. One of the best along with Slay the Spire and Castle of Morihisa.. There is no other game I've ever been able to put over 2k hours into and still find it fun and engaging. It's so much better balanced than other card roguelites, I was a huge Sts fan (over 1k hours) but this just blows sts out of the water IMO. True, technically it's easier, but for 99% of us that doesn't matter. I still can't win every game of MT, and only a select few players in the world can. And I like that - unlike StS where the best players can only hope to achieve around a 50% winrate, it shows that MT relies far less on RNG and allows proper tactics to usually overcome even the worst RNG that can occur in the game.. If you eat deckbuilders for breakfast, this game might not be the challenge you are looking for.. The negative reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about, imo. I have so much time in Slay the Spire (A20 on all characters) but this game is much better to me! It is not quite as difficult, but assuming you are trying for Divinity wins on Cov25, it has plenty to offer in that regard. Besides, top players frequently achieve a low win rate on StS A20 Heart runs (sometimes 25% win rate, and that is the best players in the world). To me, that is not just difficult, but in many ways impossible. In Monster Train,a run is almost always winnable - if you play perfectly. And to me, that's much better, as if I lose it was my fault! Long story short, it's plenty hard and well worth your time, just go straight for Covenant wins to start unlocking the highest difficulty where (imo) the game truly shines.. Monster train is a turn based card strategy where you fight your opponent inside the train, protecting the Spyre. It's very much like Slay the Spire with extra layers to the combat system. It's also less RNG as you know where you're heading to. Each run starts by selecting one of two (three in total) superpower options for the champion and an artifact of our choice. There is also a temple (from DLC) which allows us to gain artifacts and various rare upgrades for an additional difficulty. Our goal is to get through 9 rings of frozen hell in a monster train; that is 8 battles if we get to the final boss. Each combat starts off with deploying your champion unit against waves of enemies. Most of the time, the enemy boss will be flying between the floors deploying some distractions and joining the forces at the last wave into the combat phase or simply spawn last. Until that time you're supposed to fill up all floors with units and buffs to survive. The boss destroys the floor once it clears it from our units and it means we have less space to put units and less turns to beat the level. If the spyre falls, it's game over. Luckily, spyre still shoots back so it can serve as a 4th floor well if you've got dazed cards and increase its strength. We can also upgrade our Spyre with additional damage, armor, health and apply dazed to enemies entering it. The cards have various effects and can be upgraded, having 2 upgrade slots by default. The best part is 5x duplicating double, triple or even quadruple upgraded cards but having so many upgrades on one unit is uncommon. Each unit takes up space in the floor so when they're full we can use magic on top of it, and it's wise not to have too many units without enough buffs because they will be easily wiped out in the late game so there should be a nice balance. Another great feature is the alliance. We get to receive cards from two races depending on which railroad we choose or when we receive after battle rewards. We can make useful synergies, but sometimes allied cards just do not fit with our main one and only take up valuable space in our deck, but we can still get rid of them. Between battles, there are events like merchants for units, spells and artifacts, special caverns, duplicate hellvents, remove vortexes and health wells. We can even gain an extra gold. And the best part is, we can preview our run from start to finish, however we do not know the outcome of special events. So it is always wise to first take gold, buy upgrades, visit cavern, and then take artifacts, duplicate and regain health. Apart from those, we will be able to upgrade our champion 2 more times, once in mid and once in late game. We can have as many different artifacts as we get. They make the run easier in a way. Early game offers 5+1 champions, starting at level 1. We can also play Daily Challenges which are always Covenant 1. That is where the PvP element comes in. We can create our own runs and share them with friends. Our rankings are saved after we finish the run. We can also play simultaneously with other players at the same time, being only time limited. In mid game, we unlock the second champions and higher covenant ranks, probably reaching covenant 10 and getting used to all of the races in the game and learning some useful strategies. Now it is about making the perfect decks with a bit of luck from rewards. We will understand the whole concept of the game once we reach Covenant 20. Upon reaching 25, we gain even more difficult challenges that are usually available to mix up in custom games. The game is significantly more challenging than Covenant 1 and we can even easily lose the first battle with all challenges accepted. The game has a very high skill ceiling and me as an occasional card player, now only became an addict thanks to this game. I usually gain half or third of the best players ranked in the daily and custom challenges. There are 5 races + 1 in the Last Divinity DLC; Hellhorned - high damage multi strikers, rage and armor gainers focused on melee combat. Awoken - high health gainers, multi strikers and sweepers with abilities to draw more cards. Stygian Guard - incanters, frostbiters and spell users, low melee damage and starting HPs. Umbra - unit eaters, lifestealers, damage shield gainers, a lot of small units, late high stats. Melting Remnant - stealthers focused on resurrecting units and slow stat and gold gainers. Wurmkin - eggs and worms, echo infusers, focused on making the floors magically strong. Every run is unique, we can replay the same alliances and get different starting decks and meet different bosses. There are 3 major bosses and 12 minor bosses; they are accompanied by many heavy and support units. There is also a bonus level with 1 more boss but I only got there once.. I watched the game for a long time before buying it and saw its potential. Currently, it may not have a lot of possibilities, but as I mentioned - it has the potential for much more. In my opinion, it is more fun to play than Slay the Spire, if only because of a more thoughtful system of improving cards (because we decide ourselves how we improve our creatures and spells) and the requirement of more frequent combinatorics. For me, an advantage (though probably not everyone likes it that much) is the lack of annoying RNG, which will quickly destroy our approach. We also have interesting multi modes and interestingly designed daily challenges. The soundtrack is also very nice. Of course, as in any game of this type, we would like there to be even more cards, artifacts, enemies, etc. This is also the case, but I don't think the game will stop as it is. In addition, I hope that in the future the creators will develop their game, which at the time of release seems to offer more than Slay the Spire after adding (years later) the fourth character. After time, you can see the game is developing - there are new leaders, bosses and mutators of the game. Keep it up!. If you enjoy rougelite/rougelike deckbuilders then you'll like this game as well. Coming from slay the spire this game is easy to get into and understand, until you unlock Covenant levels and the game becomes really challenging. Ive played alot of hours in this game and the replay value with the different deck combos keeps me very entertained. Overall consensus this game Is Very Good.. Probably the best roguelike card game on the market right now. Quite fun and ultra addictive as expected. My main gripe with it is the enemy variety and end-game. Making broken decks is fun, but the creativity that was put into creating all sorts of different classes is lacking when it comes to the bosses and enemies. All of them basically feel like the same bullet-sponges. Just ramp up your attack and HP and you'll be fine.. As an StS fan - don't believe the hype. I have around 180 hrs on Slay the Spire and love that game. In comparison, Monster Train is far too easy and runs are very short. It's fun for a few hours but once I unlocked all the clans and champions I felt no need to continue playing. I'm told it gets to a satisfying difficulty once you unlock later 'covenants' (modifiers that up the difficulty) but I feel no motivation to grind through 15-20 more runs to get there, as I feel like I've seen everything. Each run is only 8 battles and the enemies get repetitive very quickly. There are limited opportunities to get artifacts and their effects are OP but a bit boring Synergies are basic and unimaginative I played this on Game Pass, but before I was on there I almost bought it on Steam. Let's just say as an StS fan I'm glad I didn't spend money on this as I would have been disappointed.. This is the most content-rich deckbuilder rogue like game out there, and has a huge breadth of interesting mechanics, choices, and difficulty that make it stand apart from it's competitors. Many reviews compare this to Slay the Spire, which is a great, but straightforward game. This game has a LOT more varied mechanics, strategies, and deck styles, with five factions, units & spell based strategies. Cards can be individually customized with upgrades, and refining your deck is about much more than just trimming your deck down to a lean machine (which is the optimal strategy in most other deck builders). While some cards are niche, every unit and card has a place in an interesting strategy, and the starting faction (Hellhorned) barely scratches the surface of what lies beneath. Don't buy this if you don't like deck builders: while it is mechanically very different from Slay the Spire, the deck and cards still form the backbone of how you play. But truly, this game is genre-defining, it does so many things well, and after having played dozens of deck builders on mobile and pc, this is by far my favorite in this genre. For me monster train is one step below Slay the spire. Pretty nice mechanics, art and game design.. For me monster train is one step below Slay the spire. Pretty nice mechanics, art and game design.. Initially I didn’t enjoy playing MT as much as I expected. I think that was mostly because the game doesn’t have a tutorial and there are a lot of new, to me, game concepts to learn. But that ends up being a plus, I’m tired of StS clones and MT definitely isn’t a clone. Lots of variety and tons of play value. The support from the devs is great, they bring out free enhancements that would be paid dlc in most games. For me this game has been significantly more enjoyable to play than StS. StS was very good but MT is better.. I compare this to Slay the Spire and think its worse in every single aspect. Unless you compare it to one of the best game ever made though its a really really good deck builder rogue lite. Its nice to see deck builders can be done differently then StS and be great.. If you love slay the spire you'll love this. The potential for some awesome OP combos is great with different clan synergies. Fantastic artwork and a snappy responsive UI. Multiplayer can be a bit hectic with a really short round timer but is a welcome addition. Definitely worth the price of admission. Amazing learning curve. Can be quite a challenge at times. I will say if you are a fan of games especially Slay the Spire this one is a MUST and should not be passed on.. Very fun and unique game. Fresh look on a deckbuilder games, with the great idea of combining 2 of the 5 clans/colors. So each of the clans got their ""style"" of play. For example you can chose Stygian guards who specialize with DOT and spells and combine it with Animus clan which specialize with big tanky units and heals. So after choseing the archetype you can than customize your main clan's champion so it will better fit your style. So how does the battle works? You have 3 floors on which you can place different units and 4th floor that has your train's core. Enemies will spawn each turn on the first floor until the boss arrives. After each turn each unit will deal damage to each other (enemies attack first) and than if enemy survived it will move floor higer. If your core's HP becomes 0 you lose. Between the fights there is a 2 diffrent ways you can choose each have diffrent upgrades and events so you can choose which one you want to get. Upgrades are really cool, each card in the game has 2 upgrade slots, the upgrades can range from simple stat boost, cost reduction, bonus effect or removing negative effect of a card but increasing it's cost. Soundtrack: 8/10 The game even says what track it's playing and they all feel very fitting. Graphics: 9/10 The visual are really great, some animations needs work tho... Gameplay: 9/10 Gameplay loop is really addictive and never get's boring! My Personal Overall Enjoyment: 10/10 It reallys feels amazing to play.. This game is fun and addictive, with lots of interesting choices. The deck building is strategic and requires you to think ahead for card combos that will maximise your clan’s strengths. The fights require tactical decisions to make the most of your the hand you’re dealt. I love his game!. If you enjoy roguelikes/lites, GET THIS. I love StS but this game is veeerrrryyyy different in pretty much every way outside of the inclusion of ""cards"". Both games are masterpieces, and both deserve to be considered two of the best RL games ever made. Been following this game closely for months and it had more than enough content when there were only two clans (classes essentially), but with release there are now 3 more and they're all SOOOO unique. I absolutely adore this game!. This game gets compared to Slay the Spire but the mechanics are completely different. The only similarities are that you can choose different deck archetypes to build, you can choose a path (of 2 per round), and the goal is to get to the end. Otherwise this is has a unique and very different feel, the main differences are: * You choose a main archetype to champion your deck but you need to choose another synergy to go in also (1 of 5 decks). * The game is shorter by about 30 mins per run than Slay the Spire. * There is more of a focus improve your deck between fights. * Fights are very different and run over 3 levels, any monsters you do not kill ascend towards your pyre which kills you if it reaches 0 health. All up if you liked Slay the Spire then this game would be for you, while not the same it is deliciously different.","the concept of combining 2 classes (or races) is always great and underused in games . combining 2 races' cards leaves some interesting potential combos . monster train is a nice concept, nice monsters, and a good replay value ."
"1,012.Europa Universalis","This is a huge game. I've been playing it for weeks now and am only now just getting an idea of what's possible.. This game is really fun, and has aged pretty well! I recommend that you start playing this game now. Not quite as good as Europa Universalis IV, but definitely worth your time and money.. For me, this is what started my admiration for Paradox Games. However I would recommend Europa Universalis II over this one. EU2 is very much the same game, but with a lot of improvements.","i've been playing this game for weeks now and am only now just getting an idea of what's possible . for me, this is what started my admiration for Paradox Games ."
"1,014.Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 - Yuri's Revenge","The person behind the script and level design(campaign) of this game is a genius, the gameplay of this game is so good that it has made me play it over and over again since I was young and never get bored.. Still a great RTS that I enjoy playing online to this day. It has variety of play-styles and maps for multiplayer and an entertaining, albeit silly campaign story.. Well.. the Game is just a masterpiece for its time. But it is also still playable, thanks to many modifications. In General, I spent my childhood so well that today I can go and play. It is also worth noting a company that is developing properly. Everything is very interesting and chic!. The expansion pack to Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 called Yuri`s Revenge can totally keep up with the main game. Highly addictive as usual. Check it out!. One of the best expansions in RTS history. New campaign is great, with addition to new Yuri fraction and his new units :). As I wrote to the original game: ""One of the best strategies of my time that I have ever played. This is just a bomb among the strategies. An excellent, thoughtful and interesting plot that was played by live actors. Very strong and appropriate atmosphere conveyed by this plot and game-play. Excellent drawing of the environment and controlled units and buildings. And, of course, this soundtrack... you'll recognize it from thousand others by its first seconds. A masterpiece of the classics of its time"". ...I will add only a few things: It is a completely independent game, with its own company and many changes in fractions. And all these changes, without exception, gave to the game only the benefits. Yuri’s revenge is no less a masterpiece than the original game. I would even say that in terms of game-play it is even better, since it complemented much of what its original brother lacked a little.. This is almost the ultimate LAN RTS. Fast paced and fun units. Great fun for everyone!. This game stands the test of time. It still has strong replay over a decade later. It is particularly awesome in network multiplayer for its gameplay. The map variations, units, etc. There are some quirky interface controls, esp. if you are used to game releases in recent years. The voices, the acting, the humor are exceptional. Great game, if you can find it.. With yuri character the game being good. Yuri can control other unit, is difficult to kill yuri alone. The storyline about soviet, allied, and yuri make this game better.. I can't believe that I'm still playing this game to this day, but Yuri's revenge got what it takes to be worthy of this incredibly long lifespan. Yuri's faction (although somewhat OP) and the addition of new units and maps really adds tremendous replay-ability. As this is a old-school game, there are a great number of mods out there for it as well. They all make this game way more diverse than the newer, more ""user-friendly"" and humanized CnC's where you have no options.. This is the best Command & Conquer game ever! So much fun and addicting, still playing it in 2013!!! The missions are fun, the graphics are superior to it's time. It's just a perfect game!. While I didn't much care for the storyline in the campaign, the new Yuri faction is a really fun addition to an already-awesome game. This expansion adds a whole new army with interesting new abilities, such as mind-control, unit recycling, and gravity-warping. I was never keen on playing as Yuri in multiplayer, but always found it to be fun when just messing around in skirmish. Definitely worth playing if you're already playing through Red Alert 2.. In short, this is the best, the one and only 2.5D real-time strategy computer game of all time in the history of mankind. It was released in 2001 and yet it still had a much better story lines and creative ideas created from the developers as compared to others. I played many other real-time strategy computer game but I do not feel the ""X Factor"" excitement as this one. From the moment of installation which has a nice song till finish installation it gave the feeling of you are inside the story. I do not really care much about the acting of the actors as this is a review of the game and not the movie. This game had great storylines, missions and most importantly many skirmish maps and modded extra missions which you can download from the fans/C&C community WEB sites. I had never bored playing this game and still playing till now (June 2012). Thank's to the fans and C&C community on this. There is no doubt that Red alert 3 and its expansions Uprising had a much better graphics. But Red Alert 2 & Yuri revenge definitely had a better story lines and missions. I wish they could be reproduced or remastered it in a better graphics. Command & Conquer 3 and 4 are not even close to compare. I played Command & Conquer 4 and stop at mission 3 or something. I have no interest to continue anymore. Command & Conquer 3 is a much better version than Command & Conquer 4. Red alert 3 is a much better version than any Command & Conquer series. Red Alert 2 Yuri Revenge is the winner of all.. This addon is just as good as a addon can be. New units, campaigns, cutscenes. Everything done in the same good quality like the original game. Just fun to play.. Follow up expansion to one of the most fun strategy games I have played, beautiful maps to conquer for your soviet or allied lords, and NOW YURI, along with interesting units and weaponry! Did I like it? YES.. It's the first and only time that a RTS expansion pack is better than the original. Despite 14 missions and no Yuri campaign, this game owes up with a lot of new interesting stuff, including the Yuri faction. However, there were some unbalanced issues that didn't quite get the gameplay going.","the game is just a masterpiece for its time. but it is still playable, thanks to many modifications . the expansion pack to Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 called Yuri’s Revenge can totally keep up with the main game ."
"1,015.Escape from Monkey Island","I am a big fan of point and click games and this game was something else. It was release in 2000 in the same time I was playing Banjo Kazooie and I putted BK on side to finish this game. Fantastic.. Everything has already been said I think. Less than optimal controls, some annoying puzzles, and the ""Herman bug"" which necessitated downloading someone elses savegame. Die hard Monkey Island fans should play it, but if you have no special feelings for MI, better stay away.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the weaker entries in the series. It had it's charm and it's gags, but they didn't feel that fresh and the engine brought it down a notch. In regards to the 2018 re-release, the biggest flaw about EFMI is its horrific controls. I get it that it was a game that (for some reason) had a PS2 release, but the PC version should have been able to utilize the mouse as lining up Guybrush using use the arrow keys to get anywhere is just impossible. Not to mention the poor keybinds that spreads everything across the keyboard. Just what was LucasArts thinking?. Good adventure game, bad Monkey Island game. Plot holes hurt my soul. Monkey Kombat hurts me physically.. Definetely doesn't deserve all the hate it had, at least back in the day. The graphics, at least for characters are not very appealing and the monkey combat was simply stupid, but everything else is just what you can expect from a Monkey island, definetely a good game in the saga, just probably not as good as the 3 previous ones.","""monkey island"" is one of the weaker entries in the series . it had it's charm and it's gags, but they didn't feel that fresh . the biggest flaw about EFMI is its horrific controls ."
"1,016.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GRACIAS POR ARRUINARLE LA VIDA A USUARIOS DE GTX CON LOS ASQUEROSOS REQUISITOS QUE NO TIENE NINGUN SENTIDO, YA HA PASADO MESES DESDE QUE LOS MODDERS NO SE PUSIERON LAS PILAS PARA QUE LO ARREGLEN, BETHESDA, TODO ES CULPA TUYA BETHESDA.. The game is gorgeous, the voice acting is superb, the sound effects are enveloping. The whole game plays and feels like an original Indiana Jones movie. The immersion is next level, you feel like you are actually walking around the Vatican, or Gizeh, exploring tombs and dig sites. The firefights and fist fights are realistic, you cant fight 20 enemies at once because you will be overwhelmed. You can just run in guns blazing because everyone nearby will hunt you down and you probably wont survive. This is a Bethesda game, and i encountered ONE small graphical bug in the entire game, that is unheard of for them. Highly recommend trying this absolute gem out, especially if you are a fan of the movies and universe. Great game and story like a move im happy to play this game Got and best xbox game. Just finished the game, and it has genuinely one of the best games of 2024. This is the 4th Indian Jones movie. Dialogue, story, game play and especially the voice acting make this feel like a game where Indian Jones would take place. Combat if a tad clunky at times is definitely fun. Puzzles and side missions tie into the main story making it feel like quests that flesh out the mission you are on, making them compelling and just just padding the length. If you are looking for a game showing the strengths of a single player experience that used to be made, where the player is treated to a solid experience free of micro transactions or bugs that are patched way down the line this is it. Highly recommended.. Holy s**t, MachineGames really got me good with this amazing game, I almost didn’t want to play for the reason why the excellent Cyberpunk 2077 got a terrible launch, but I was wrong, very wrong, with amazing visuals, fun gameplay, a incredible story, awesome soundtrack, and overall, a great time that don’t feel like a unnecessary cash grab and a game that is finally worth a damn on the Xbox Series X. I’m definitely giving the Great Circle a 9 out of 10. Absolutely awesome stuff. Bethesda somehow continues to amaze me with games not developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Just excellent.. It's a fun game that has its flaws. It can feel a bit clunky at times but it is fun to play and has a decent story. It feels like a breathe of fresh air in the stink that is the current state of the IP. If you are considering playing this game, I would definitely recommend it. There's plenty here for both new and old fans.. Great game and true to the films. We are in a day where movie games are no longer something to avoidand write off titles like this and RoboCop rogue city which immerse you in their world with and original story within the continuity of the films. My second game in Xbox series s, i Like Grafics and game 10/10 no respost . The game is inacreditable. Great story. Fun gameplay. The game play was fun enough. But as a lifelong fan of the Indiana Jones franchise this story fits right in. I found myself immersed in the story and it felt like i was experiencing another movie. Voice acting was great and the story beats were authentic. Side missions were surprisingly fun.. I can’t say nothing wrong about this game. Having really nice time solving mysteries, taking pictures and punching fascists :). Also secrets are not easy (and not too hard) just perfect medium rare iq required:). Before October 2024, I didn’t even know this game was in development. However, the developers managed to play on people’s nostalgia, and they succeeded. This game is a great way to introduce a new generation to Indiana Jones’ adventures and remind older fans why they loved him. Impressions: Personally, I found the game to be somewhat empty. Running from one tomb to another quickly became tedious. Perhaps this is because I prefer adventure games like Tomb Raider, where the gameplay is more action-packed. However, there were moments when the game captured the atmosphere of the Indiana Jones movies. Pros: - Combat System. The combat is very well-designed and enjoyable. Fights are dynamic and require interaction with the environment since weapons have durability limits. - Story. The story is simple but stays true to the spirit of the movies. It’s not too deep but works well for a lighthearted adventure. - Visuals and Sound. All the locations, from deserts to jungles, look beautiful, and the sound design enhances the immersive experience. - Technical Performance. At launch, the game performed flawlessly: no serious bugs or performance issues, which is rare these days. Cons: - Shallow Story. The simplicity of the story is both a pro and a con. After completing the game, there’s no sense of fulfillment or lasting impression. The plot lacks depth and isn’t engaging enough to surprise or amaze players. - Enemy AI. Some enemies are too unintelligent. For example, you can hit one with a metal pipe, and his companion standing just a few meters away won’t even notice. Verdict: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a game for those who want to spend a few enjoyable evenings without diving into complex stories or mechanics. Don’t expect too much from it. If you approach it with this mindset, it will deliver positive emotions. For me, it’s a 7 of 10.. Amazing game. The visuals looks incredible! Good gameplay, great voice acting, little to no bugs (on my first play) Troy Baker did Amazing as Dr. Jones. Ngl, The final fight stage is in my top 10 stages in gaming.. This game primarily offers an immersive virtual exploration experience with breathtaking graphics, though the combat mechanics leave much to be desired.. Nice and veeeeery good game, this brought back me to 1990, real puzzles, exploration, etc. I hope the industry may learn with Machine Games. I’m playing both PC and Xbox SX, PC has some bugs with Frame Gen, but it is ok. This game perfectly captures the essence of what makes Indiana Jones such an iconic franchise. From the John Williams-like score, to the archiology, to the fight scenes, you can easily see the passion from MachineGames when developing this game. Easily one of the underrated gems of of 2024 going into 2025.. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – A Triumphant Return to the Franchise’s Roots ""Indiana Jones and the Great Circle"" is a true gift for fans of the franchise, bringing the essence of the first three films straight to the player’s hands. This game isn’t just a tribute—it surpasses the last two movies by delivering a gripping narrative that could easily be the basis for a blockbuster film. The story is one of the game’s strongest points, offering a rich blend of mystery, action, and adventure that perfectly captures Indy’s charismatic and daring spirit. From ancient ruins to intricate puzzles, the game masterfully balances intellectual challenges with thrilling action sequences, keeping players hooked from start to finish. The game’s length is spot-on—not too long, not too short—ensuring every moment feels meaningful. Visually, the graphics are stunning, immersing players in breathtaking environments. While minor texture issues appear during a few scene transitions, they are negligible and don’t detract from the game’s overall beauty or experience. ""Indiana Jones and the Great Circle"" is nothing short of spectacular. It honors the franchise’s legacy with perfectly tuned challenges, incredible visuals, and a story that will make players feel like they’re stepping into Indy’s boots at his very best. A must-play for adventure enthusiasts and anyone looking for a memorable gaming experience!. I loved every single moment and I played it for 50 hours before finishing it. I will now go to complete the details. I hope MachineGames will develop a stronger sequel.. One word prefect new and Awesome game play. The graphic looks mind boggling on xbox ss withRay tracing. It's an instant classic, great immersive sim, and excellent writing. Secrets and adventures are around every corner.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really fun with a better Indie story than the last 2 movies combined. Gameplay is like a first person semi open world uncharted but manages to have its own identity.. This is how you do a linear, story-driven game. The pacing was immaculate, no need to bloat each area and instead let some areas serve a more spectacle driven purpose which breaks up the more open areas. Not too long, not too short. Lots of extra stuff to find for people that like to 100%. The music, voice acting and overall vibe entirely captured the original movies to a surprising extent. I was really against the 1st person but they made it work. My only real critique of the game was that the puzzles were way too easy. Everything from decoding locked chests and safes, to the major plot point puzzles. I get that they wanted people to feel smart and not get hung up and frustrated, but it would have been awesome if the puzzles felt more like a legit deterrent and not like 12 year old could figure it out. At least some of the major puzzles should have been more sophisticated. There could easily have been a built in hint option where Indy talks the puzzle out to himself or a companion chimes in. If there is a second game I do hope they up the ante.. Despite a few bugs this is a fantastic game, nailing the atmosphere and style of the films without getting bogged down in over long set-pieces or padding to reach an arbitrarily long run time. More then worth the asking price, be that gamepass sub or direct purchase.. What a phenomenal game! It perfectly captures Indiana Jones movies' vibes. The exploration is very cool in all the various locations you visit and the level design is really well made as well. I didn't know what to expect from this game but man, it has delivered 100%, and it has became my 2024 GOTY. Took me 35 hours to 100% the game with everything there is to collect and do. Highly recommended!. GENERALLY FIREBALE INTRESTING MOVIE download and watch i already watched this movie. A fantastic journey with an incredible Indy atmosphere! Graphics and story are top notch, and I would even say that it would fit perfectly as a real movie between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. Sound and music are flawless, including the voice work by Troy Bake, as Indiana Jones. AI is not the best, but still very enjoyable combat, although the adventuring, exploring and puzzles makes up for it. Congrats to a fantastic game, with a lot of heart and spot on feeling for Indiana Jones, MachineGames!. Good game. They nailed the feel of the movies. Some sections were a bit boring due torepetitiveness. Would have liked more a bit more and varied action game play as well as more storied side missions.. The gameplay is very relaxed, sweet and stress-free. The story is very good. It's like a spiritual sequel to the Indiana Jones movies.. The game has its flaws like clunky gun combat (i think this is acceptable since you basically never use your gun), drawn out/unnecessary cutscenes (basically half the game is cutscenes) but overall a pretty good story game, would recommend playing.. My personal GOTY for 2024. I have always been a huge Indiana Jones fan, but like most of the fanbase I was disappointed with the last couple of films, which failed to capture the magic of the original trilogy. Machine Games did an amazing job of capturing the feel of what Indiana Jones should be. Everything from the settings, to the plot, the (incredible) voice acting, to the sense of humour worked perfectly. It is a must for anyone who had a childhood love of Indiana Jones. My only negative point to note - please don't let annoying sidekick characters spoil puzzles, or tell you where to go next. Everyone hates it!. It took only a little while to get into this game and when I did I was caught until the very end. Awesome setting and adventure. Most fun since a long time and I went back to unlock most secrets. At this time only few bugs but those will probably be fixed soon.. The game is fun, and it looks stunning(except maybe for some animations). Also the music is great and the voice acting is really well made. Sadly it is also full of bugs. Besides all the minor stuff, like Indy getting stuck during climbings or Gina getting stuck in one point on the map, while Indy kept speaking with her as if she was still following him, I also encountered some game breaking problems. In the Vatican I involuntarily skipped a part of the main story; luckily I was able to do that part later, but the mission made no sense at that point, because it involved characters that weren't supposed to be around anymore. Later in the game, the main mission required to buy a device from a shopkeeper, but while I was collecting money I did a secondary mission and, for some reason, during that I found the device already in my inventory. That prevented me to actually buy the device from the shop, and even if I was able to follow the main mission till the end, the game kept pointing me to the shop, so I needed other guides to know where to go next. After that I was also unable to buy other books from the same shop keeper, preventing me to collect all the items in the game. All in all the game feels unpolished, which is a real shame because its the best Indiana Jones media of the last 20 years, at least. It captures well the original spirit and atmospheres of the saga. If you don't have the Game Pass, I highly advise to wait for them to release some patches.. Amazing story, fit right in with the Indiana Jones cannon, atmosphere, tone and biomes all feeling straight out of the films made with passion for the franchise and giving fan service without an over-reliance on it. Been a while since I enjoyed a stealth game with a strong story, excellent gameplay for the most part despite some odd AI vision cone detection here and there, was minor though so didn't impact overall enjoyment. Gameplay felt innovative with excellent well thought out puzzles making you truly feel like you're playing the films discovering mysteries with satisfaction. They actually nailed it, simple as that. Here's the translation for Metacritic in natural language:There are few moments in life when one can only say one thing: Wow! Without a doubt, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the standout game of the winter 2024 - 2025 season. It's an extraordinary work of art in first-person video gaming. Everything Starfield couldn't be, Indiana Jones achieves. A compelling story, an exciting narrative that keeps the player on the edge of their seat, and incredible gameplay. Playing this game isn't just like watching an Indiana Jones movie; it's much better. Much more thrilling, much more intriguing, because you are the star of an incredible story. While it's true that the game isn't innovative, repeating formulas from previous games, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proves that Bethesda is the foremost authority in first-person titles. You won't regret enjoying this grand adventure. The Good: A spectacular and thrilling game. The Bad: At times, the puzzles are confusing, and the game's progression isn't intuitive. It's not that I'm complaining about the challenge; rather, the developers don't provide enough clues, which often turns the experience into one that's frustrating rather than fun I Don't Understand: Why Xbox fans boast to PlayStation fans. After all, this game will be coming to PS5 in just a few months. It's not an exclusive.. Great game looks superb, great combat and stealth mechanics and interesting narrative.. Do you like linear dungeons devoid of anything the least bit interesting or fun combined with a single path for you to explore? Do you like simplistic puzzles that offer no challenge for anyone with an IQ higher than their shoe size? Do you like forced ""all-spice"" girl-boss companions whose sole purpose is to point out the solution to said super simplistic puzzles ad nauseam? Do you enjoy seeing your childhood heroes being emasculated at every opportunity by man-hating ""all-spice"" girl bosses? If you answered YES to ANY of these questions, then this game is for YOU!!!If you answered NO to any of these questions then congratulations, you are probably as sick of this woke BS as I am, and you have an opportunity to save your money. Don't make the same mistake I did. Do yourself a favor and play Uncharted 1 - 4 for a much better Indiana Jones experience.. Since I was a kid, I was always looking for a game that had the adventure feeling of indiana jones. Tomb Raider and Uncharted did that very well, but it wasn't Indy nor his music. This game mixes everything great from each of theses franchises and make it first person which I thought wasn't a good idea at first, but I was totally wrong. This game is so unique and captures the movies style and atmosphere so perfectly. Downsides are some bugs (not showing collectibles), final open world having a level design a bit repetitive and the giants plot not so well written. But I can easily forget about that as everything else was amazing. I think we have the best Indiana Jones villain here, by the way. What a time to be a gamer and an Indiana Jones fan!. This is diamond! For everybody, who loves Indiana. But its amazing game for people, who dont love Indiana, because this game, is really nice, great story, great gameplay. Love it and you need to played !. I absolutely adored this game. It embodies everything Indiana jones should be and delivers a story which could have easily been the third instalment of the films.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pro's : Fun gameplay, great graphics, a good overall game, its not memorable and it wont leave you in awe, but its a fun game nonetheless. Cons : The gameplay can be a bit tedious, especially opening doors and unlocking gates etc. The boxing pits challenges are very frustrating, in the sense that some of the higher end guys you have to punch them in some cases 15 to 20 times and they still dont fall, even though you have almost every power up and backup power up activated? The mechanics around it does not make much sense and will frustrate the daylights out of you. Apart from that, the game flows well until the end, where the pace speeds up very fast and all of a sudden you are at the endgame part and its all over? The game is quite short and if you dont do all the boring repetitive collections, you will find yourself finishing this game in a couple of days, I think more could have been done in terms of side quests and immersing you deeper into the lore. Summary : Its fun, its pretty and its entertaining, nothing special to write home about, I probably wont be replaying it again any time soon, as once you've played it through once, it doesn't leave you with that empty feeling of ""what am I gonna do with my life now?"" feeling afterwards. Is it worth the asking price? I dont know, probably worth about $35 in my opinion, but thats just my take.. Take the raving reviews with a grain of salt due to movie fandom bias. Had you placed another character instead of Indiana Jones, score would be more realistic. It's a fun game but gameplay and puzzles are repetitive. You basically crouch, get to an area, solve an easy puzzle, and watch a movie scene. Overall, nothing too exciting.. It's perfect in the context of indy. This is not a doom guy, and the game will push you to act like in the movies, or you will die. The gun are useless due to the loudness that will bring back a lot of enemies. It's preferable to use rifle like a wand to knock down. Sneak into bases to found items is super satisfying. I heard before playing thar the gameplay is to heavy, but in my point of view after playing and finish the game, it's the perfect gameplay to match the character and to adopt a play style that is clearly indy like expected. Indy is not Lara croft that do ticks, acrobatic jumps etc. It's just a guy like every one except that it is smart regarding the archeology and the usage of the whip, but the better way is no confrontation, run to survive and have a lot of luck in complicated situations. The fists are the indy basic way to fight.. Good story, good mechanics (though not that precise but since it is not necessary to be on point it is fine), good settings and mostly interesting characters. I question some of the female characters but they are not so impactful so it doesn't bother me that much.. It's so great to play a technically accomplished, polished title powered by ray tracing with an amazingly cinematic and immersive story. If you want to witness the cutting edge of games as interactive entertainment, you should definitely play this one.. Is not just a game, is experience of indiana jones story just wonderful. I hope to expand the game. Throughly enjoyed this game, phenomenal and not sure they can ever top this one!. For me and for fans of the license, this game is just amazing. Technic, Music, voices, story, durability, all is perfect. The Game of 2024. Congratulations to devs and Thank You!. I can't make a review for 7.5 so I am rounding down. The writing and story are quite excellent. Some of the game mechanics are a little wonky. The acting is quite good, especially Troy Baker's Harrison Ford impersonation. It's no Mark Hamill... but I digress. The story is quite compelling & I like stealth gameplay in general. I am a game developer myself for over 20 years and I love all kinds of games. Especially open world Action/Adventure titles. Games like Dark Forces II and the Thief series were great and got me back into gaming after a lay off except for the occasional arcade. They were PC games, first person and worked just fine with a video monitor close to your face. Some of the mechanics were funky because of first person. You just got used to the perspective. After consoles became more prominent third person took over and became more of a focus for developers. After a little hesitation I began to prefer third person which made more sense on consoles especially with TVs further away than a computer monitor in your face. So when I started to play the Great Circle I was a little disappointed it was first person. My friends know I have taken a pretty hard No FP stance when gaming online together. It just feels clunky compared to 3rd person titles. The Great Circle is no different. The 1st person perspective feels more than a bit dated in general and quite stiff at inopportune times. Even in the first level it was quite jarring to see certain actions switch to 3rd person suddenly and then back to 1st person. It's not exactly subtle. There are so many actions that play in 3rd person I felt it would have been great if there were a 3rd person setting in the options. Gameplay would have been considerably smoother. It's not just the switch back and forth that's wonky. There are times when Indy is around or in water. Swimming was fine enough but on the fringes with Indy walking through shallow water it was faster to have him crouch instead of standing. He sped up quite a bit which didn't make a whole lot of sense. Also when swimming onto land Indy will inexplicably be standing with no transition; one frame he is seeing at water level then the next he's standing straight up. Wonky. That doesn't happen in 3rd person games. Not good ones anyway. One really annoying thing about 1st person is the perspective never feels like it's at proper eye level. When Indy is around other characters it's almost like he's shorter than them, then you see them together in a scene and you see him taller. When crouching the visual perspective is not that different a height as when standing. The only real way to tell if Indy is crouching is a slight discoloration in the bottom corners of the screen or being near and object he an climb. In 3rd person a crouch is a crouch. There is also an issue with distance when certain jumps seem impossibly far to be made or items too far to grab yet they are highlighted to grab and jumps can be made. When fighting enemies hand to hand there are times when the enemy seems too far away to land a punch or kick then Indy takes damage. Sometimes just walking around Indy will drop off to a lower ""plane"" of surface yet when attempting to purposefully drop down while looking at Indy's feet they will not be on any visible ground but won't drop; like a Looney Toons cartoon character hanging in mid air. Then there is the whole strafe vs. turning stiffness. There is no head turning. Just rotating the character's body. Totally stiff. In real life we have a certain amount of peripheral vision that just can't happen on a flat screen. Just give us the option to play 3rd person so we don't have to deal with these kinds of issues. Another point of contention is the map and task tracking. The larger maps are hard to get fully in view without getting Indy to bend completely over. And even still it can be hard to view the bottom part of the map. There is no way to display all collectibles on the map simultaneously. Deliberate decision or not it was a pain to open the map and track one group of items then track each of the other collectibles individually to see if anything else was nearby. Tedious and time consuming. Could have saved several hours with a view all items option. Still even with all of these wonky controls I thoroughly enjoyed the story and side missions, which are more than side missions. They help Indy build up health and gameplay stats. I do enjoy collecting items and doing extra tasks. My final playthrough stats on a first play came in around just a few minutes under 72 hours. It's a quality story with some questionable mechanics and wonky controls. It would have been a 9 or 10 with a 3rd person option. Other games give players this option. Also with a better map & task tracking. AI often feels dumb as rocks then amps up late. The environments are quite beautiful. So in the end I have to go with a 7 because the controls and perspective just seem outdated compared to other high profile AAA titles.. An absolute masterpiece. This game is basically an Indiana jones movie that we never got and an amazing one at that. It feels straight out of the 80s and has the same spirit as raiders of the lost and the last crusade. It’s one of the most fun adventure action games I’ve ever played. I encourage both Indy fans and casual gamers alike to play it, you won’t regret it. 10/10. It was a **** third person view like Uncharted, It's better than FPS view. Im an huge fan of the series movie with Harrison Ford and i loved this **** to be completely honest Uncharted is better.. Maybe was just a first chapter for a game series who can even far of Uncharted. For next Chapter put a swap system for third and first person perspective.. This game totally surprised me, not only on a technical level but the characters, the setting, voice acting and gameplay wise its all amazing. My only two complaints and why its not a 10 imo is because the one on one combat specially the boss fights seem kinda sloppy, and there is one level far into the game that it feels like a stepdown from the rest, mostly because the bugs I encountered. In conclusion this is a must play imo and it encouraged me to watch the movies.. Wow. Finished this game over a week ago, and it was amazing! All the elements incorporated into this game truly made it feel like an Indy movie. The voice acting was great, especially Troy Baker (Indy), Mario Gavrilis (Voss) and the late Tony Todd (Locus). The rest of the cast was amazing as well, but these three I enjoyed hearing the most and think did the best performances. The puzzles I loved, as they weren't too difficult for people who have trouble with those types of parts in video games. Stealth was a great mechanic to be in the game, and I had a ton of fun surprising unsuspecting soldiers. I had a ton of fun just enjoying the overall story because of how well written it is. It doesn't get old or corny because it is something original. I haven't played many Bethesda games because I hear they're a little greedy, but despite that fact this game was super fun, but let's be real it was all MachineGames. Great game, really felt like an Indy Movie.. Yes Phil Spencer. Finally. I opened it up on Christmas day on my carbon Black series s. Game played good, AAA. Well done Xbox, finally. A few more like this can prove they can do exclusives & AAA etc too. I was annoyed about flight simulator 24. Sort that out. 20 was amazing. Only move forwards never back. Never look back.. I never played an Indiana Jones game. I'm not a huge fan of this franchise. The movies in the 80's were my favorite films for this franchise. Holy Archeologist this game is a gem. The world and setting fit this character and the franchise. I love this story from beginning to end. Dialogue is basically the same as the movies. I'm going to praise four things from best to good. Voice actor Troy Baker(The last of us) nails everything. I loved the puzzles in this game. The story is as good or even better than the movies. Don't forget the combat, it's funny and it works. Not much bugs in the game. My summary is if you like both the movies and the games, you will love this game. Try the game if you barely know the franchise and you like adventure games or action-adventure films. Must play for Game pass users. Somehow, I really want to play this game again. So, I decided to watch someone else play it. Yes, Game of The Year Contender. Best Performance ""Troy Baker"". I love adventure and exploring games.. This is a fantastic game that brought back all the memories of watching the original Indy trilogy as a kid. I was hooked and immersed for 30 hours, everything from visuals and music and gameplay, which by the way gave me the strong Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay vibes (made by the same studio 20 years ago), is a love letter to one of the most iconic Hollywood heroes of all time and the spiritual father to Lara Croft and Nathan Drake. Way to go, Machine Games, thank you for this gift, you rock! Really talented studio, wishing you all the best and looking forward to other single player gems from you.. Great game and mechanics. + In game textures and graphics are really good (water, vegetation, etc) + Fun game and puzzles + Good time even only for story mode with no 100% complete + Great locations. -The story is not good enough. - Plastic facial expresions even in cinematics like an old gen game - A lot of popping even with last update (Running on series X) - 3rd person camera would be great. 8.5 If you are a fan of Indiana Jones then you're going to love the game. There are a lot of easter eggs from the movies. Combat isn't great compared to other modern games but it fits perfectly for an Indiana Jones game. The stealth elements can be great but they also can be quite bad because the AI is dumb. Puzzles were nice. Side quests feel nice. It's one of the only games I went out of my way to do side quests. Graphics are great. Optimization is great. Even though there is a lot of jank in the game I heavily recommend it. Great experience.. The Indiana Jones game on Xbox, advertised as a grand adventure faithful to the iconic archaeologist, ultimately falls short in many ways. If you were expecting to embody a daring hero in epic adventures, prepare yourself for a monotonous and repetitive **** positives (because we have to give some credit)The visual atmosphere: The environments, while not groundbreaking, are decent. Mysterious temples, deserts, and libraries are detailed enough to feel immersive—but nothing **** whip: Using the whip to swing across gaps or disarm enemies is fun… for the first few minutes. After that, it just feels like an overused **** issues (and there are plenty)Highly repetitive gameplay: Honestly,",the whole game plays and feels like an original Indiana Jones movie . combat if a tad clunky at times is definitely fun . i encountered ONE small graphical bug in the entire game .
"1,017.Beat Saber","I like this game. Beat Saber is the only game, that tricks me into making somewhat of a workout... for 3 hours straight.... modding the game makes it SO MUCH BETTER, but without them the game is still phenomenal!. Nothing ground breaking, but a fun rhythm game. Good game but better with mods.. Best VR game ever made. I just LOVE Beat Saber. I bought this game because everyone was saying it's the best VR game. Played it for 30 minutes, I was sweating so much but i really enjoyed it. Now i have like 20 hours on Beat Saber and still love it. Borrowed it to my grandma, brother and mom and they enjoyed it too. 10/10 VR game for me but it would be better if there would be custom songs on PS4 too.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done!. Really fun to play on VR, a really down for the game is the cost of the new musics. So the new Fallout Boy pack really mixes things up for Beat Saber with some new arc moves whichthat are soooooooooooooo satisfying to pull off. On some cubes an arc will appear connecting it to the next one and you have to follow it around with your saber. Music's great as well. Nice to see fresh content coming out on a regular basis, even new concepts on how to play. I'm more of a ""wrist"" player because the PS4 tracking camera is barely functional and this new pack makes you perform wide arcing motions. Again, feels just so good to do.. It is easy to adapt, very entertaining and fun, and it has a very promising future with free DLC and songs, online mode, as well as new mechanics such as the slice blocks that we saw in the teasers, it is a very good purchase.. This game is so fun, it gets you in the move, I feel like my reflexes have improved and most songs are bops, I like the rhythm of the way your arm swings and moves.. I really want to love this game, and part of me does. But the lack of genre variations cripples this game to a horrible degree. Unless you like one specific genre of ear splitting aggressive techno, you will hate this. The dlc only includes 4 bands, and they are fine... but after having played Rockband, it's obvious these developers only care about PC players and electronic music. 10 out of God damn 10. Anyone scoring it less is still cycling on a Penny Farthing. Yes you're gonna pay on top for your favourite albums. It wipes the floor with almost every £45 AAA game I've played this year, so giving musicians royalties (which they need to keep making music) isn't a big ask. Maybe the record companies need to start tieing in Beat Sabre packs with album purchases, or some sort of subscription like itunes, or Spotify etc. This game is a beast, it gives you exercise, fun and music all in one go. Nuff said.. Over all a great game Fun Relaxing when playing casually and provides a good challange for when ur going for high scores My only complaint is how few free songs there are I really hope that the devs add a few more free songs in to the game But for the price it's definitely worth a purchase. The game beat saber, is such a wonderful and fun game to play. However, as you get better on the PSVR version of this game, the harder levels (i.e overkill expert+), become nearly impossible on the console. The amount of lag that is caused by moving the headset while swinging your motion controllers is unbelievable, and when you play levels that need you to be on your A game all of the time, it becomes too much to handle. I would not recommend purchasing beat saber on the ps4, however I would totally recommend buying on pc.. Great game, It's a must to have if you have PSVR, the only problems are the song packs sold separately as DLC, the core game is solid and fun. the best available modes are one hand, 2 hands, no directional arrows on cubes and 90° mode.. One of the best game I have ever played, and I've been playing for 25 years. This game provides the most unique experience, and it makes you healthier by playing it. For the first time in my life, exercising became fun. Unfortunately, the game still lacks some functionality (like an infinite mode, where songs just keep coming without you having to go to the menu). And songs are not released quick enough, so you get tired of them pretty fast.. Really funny games, but for ps4 the songs are really too few. This review must be at least 75 character so...i known you can read m y thougts, miaomiaomiaomiao.. I will say this is in the top level of PS VR games. I do think it's a must play game for the VR system. I will say the hype of Beat Saber for me came from the DLC songs such as Green Day and Imagine Dragons. The faults I had with the game that lowered the score was the lack of songs in the catalogue that you get with base purchase. I bought the DLC fairly not long after. I also didn't like the inaccuracy of the scoring system. I would do a song feeling I did amazing, I even would hit more notes. Yet my score came out lower. Clearly the game requires lots of practice, hundreds of hours possibly. I personally had no problem getting from Easy to Hard, but the bridge from Hard to Expert is off compared to the training to get to Hard. I feel it just falls into the same issues Guitar Hero has because it's such a jump. Lastly, I have to say, the PSVR Tracking doesn't do this game any favour either. Lots of issues with that. I really was expecting the experience I saw from PC players, but the difference is night and day. They also recently in the last year I'm told changed the scoring system and upped the point value of ""cuts"", this has made score ratings even harder to get.. Possibly the best application of the PSVR I have played. Great fun, very addictive, and very easy to get into. There are a reasonable number of songs available for free - though they obviously relying on people buying new songs.... which there doesn’t seem to be that many available on PS4. The only complaints I have is that there is too much of a jump between easy and normal on many songs - and it would be better if there was a more intuitive way to record times by different users when playing casually in solo (and sharing in a family). My wife who doesn’t like game consoles jumped straight into and loves it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games on psvr in my opinion. I loved it from the very start, although I'm not fan of music games in general. Just a feeling of smashiing those boxes with sabers to the rhytm of musis is awesome. I admire they made a great game not thanks to millions of dollars, but to a great idea. I just wish there was more music, especially rock / metal music. It has just like 20+ dance songs, with some synth guitar in 2 of them. It's weird, since unlike guitar hero or rock band, they have indie music and they don't need license of many big bands, or tracks specially edited for the game with separated instrument layers. Indie musicians would give them their music free.. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. In it's current state the motion tracking is awful. If you turn on the game and navigate through the PS menus, you'll see how sluggish and unresponsive it becomes. It does NOT happen with any other game, literally just this bag of cat **** **** THIS GAME.. Great use of VR, simple yet very challenging game that will give you quite a workout on harder difficulties. PSVR must have game. Move controllers are required to play the game.. One of the best games on PS VR, but no community songs make it far worse than the PC version. Beatsaber is an amazing VR game, it's fun and rewarding and definitely the first VR game you should pick up!. WHOAAAHHH! What a game. Made me feel like a Star Wars jedi. Highly recommend you buy this game. Its awesome. Even work up a sweat playing it. Fitness + Jedi Master training. What more do you want?!. Best game I’ve ever played, awesome unique content and keeps me playing all day. The game mechanics are simple but fun. Now all it really needs is a huge amount of hit tunes and varied graphic environments to keep it fresh for a long time.. the game is amazing and fun to play i hope that some anime songs will be added and some memes. What do you get when you mix Guitar Hero + Lightsabers + VR? You get Beat Saber. That is a sentence you thought people would never say in their life isn't it? But all jokes aside, this game is VERY fun! This game is fun slice n' dice rhythm, at the same time a great workout and very good exercise on the body. There is nothing more satisfying in this game than cutting up boxes to the time of the beat of a song and nailing down your first full combo. What more can be said?. The game is okay - a huge seller on psvr platform but developers don't support the platform pushing out half assed half complete ( no single saber mode) paid song packs - which is a huge slap in the face for what is a huge potential player base. This is the first game I got to try on my PSVR, and needless to say, it was fantastic. Think Guitar Hero, on steroids. I enjoy the music, the effects, the gameplay, and more. The music fits perfectly with the game. The 5 difficultly levels provide a fair challenge (especially Expert+, which I still struggle to complete) and there are modifiers for those that don’t like the pressure of slashing every note or those that want the hardest game possible. Very accessible game for all ages and types of players. I got this game for free with my PSVR, but I would’ve bought it as a stand-alone if it didn’t come with it. I also played the DLC, which was enjoyable, and the campaign of the main game provided a fun little expansion as well. The controls are tight and the PS Move controllers work very well with the game. My only complaints are that party mode makes no sense (only one VR at a time?) and that there aren’t enough songs (30-40, Depending on if you get DLC). Once they add more songs, perhaps it will be even better; amazing game as it is though.. When I first started playing this game, I generally couldn't get enough of it. But over time, I was getting unnecessary updates for the game, and they seemed to be making the game worse. Most of the maps don't really have a rhythm to them, and it just shows how little the developers care about this game. my one question for the developers is why bother putting notes that you have to hit into Beat Saber if each time you go to hit them it says you've missed them? You pay more for the PS4 version of this game, but on Steam its cheaper and you get more features, which in my opinion I believe is ridiculous. The song selection is pathetic and playing their songs a few times can easily bore you out your mind. I could think of so many more interesting things to do than play Beat Saber. Like maybe watching paint dry or even sitting in an empty room for 4 hours straight doing nothing.. Original tracks and maps ****. The devs just dont know how to do interesting maps. Nor show any effort in the right way. They've got tenths of good maps examples, but just dont care, they keep doing boring maps. If you dont know why, just go and download a few tracks by the moding community. I guarantee you will never ever again play one of theirs. I played beat sabers original tracks 1-2 only. But wait, no, you cant play moded tracks anymore because devs got gready EA and disabled mods so they could sell their dlc more easily. Which also **** because its the same genre of music and they made the maps. Their trying to sell this **** 30$ for ~9 songs made 5 years ago. All from the same artists.. Amazing technical achievement. No lags at all. Super fast gameplay. Pumping beats. Super intutiive gameplay. Great and stylisch UI. The #1 showcase game on my PS for VR.. I get motion sick with most Vomit Reality games, but I can play this one for hours without any motion sickness whatsoever. My daughter has the PC version and says that this one isn't as good, mainly because you can't import songs, but for the PS4 VR, it is the best game I own. Anyone who has the PSVR knows that it isn't the best VR on the market, and occasionally the controllers glitch and your 'saber' will go sideways, but its a pretty decent port.. I didnt want to buy the game at 36$, but my kids wanted to play the game really bad. The game concept and game play are very cool and fun. However, there are limited number of songs which you can play and get really bored with selection very quickly. I and kids played the game for a few days and now we are bored with songs and stopped playing the game. The kids are typically looking for those songs of their favorite singers (i.e. Dua Lipa, Ariana grande, etc...). I wish they could allow custom songs like PC. I dont believe that price is justified for the songs selection. I recommend the game, but wait until the price goes down or until they offer more free/addon songs selection.. I have purchased a lot of psvr games now and they're all a mixed bag since there isn't really a reliable place to get valuable insight into psvr game quality. Almost every PSVR game I have had enough interest to research and I look up on MetaCritic will have reviews from users saying, ""THIS IS THE BEST VR GAME I'VE PLAYED YET!1!!1"" I am an optimist and have purchased some real stinkers because of this sentiment. As for Beat Saber, I bought into the hype for it between seeing videos of folks playing the pc version, and reading comments from people on Reddit giving it incredibly glowing rave reviews. I'm not going to skewer it too much, as for what it is, it is well crafted and intuitive. However, if there were a demo for it with a single lever, I think that would truly be enough to go around for those who are interested in this game. The music in it isn't that great, as someone who plays drums and loves a wide variety of music, I find that the actual rhythm/block correlations don't make a ton of sense -- I found it almost more fun to play with the music turned down low or off. I thought it might be similar to Thumper, where the music will ramp up as you successfully perform the correct actions, making it more immersive. No, the music will play unaltered regardless of what you're doing. I think that's boring. There isn't much variety in the gameplay after you spend a half hour playing it, the shapes are all the same (cubes) -- thus far in my play through, I don't expect them to change -- as you progress through the campaign it simply ramps up the level of precision required to complete a level, and limits the amount of mistakes you can make. I think for some folks this would be addictive, but I found it a bit monotonous. Maybe if guitar hero is your thing you'll like this a lot. I think I am doing a noble deed by letting you know that Beat Saber for PS4 truly is overrated and that you should wait for it to be less than $15. Sounds like on PC there are mods that make it way better, but on ps4 it is quite vanilla and if you find that this is the ""BEST VR GAME EVER!"" - then you need to try some other games out, because that is a pretty bold statement. Thanks for reading.. I'd equate this to ""DDR but with your hands"". The game is very fun and one of the best for any VR system. It also is one of the least taxing VR games, I think, in terms of motion sickness. It makes great use of only requiring the player to look forward for the game itself. There's not a ton of head sway involved. Most interaction comes from moving your hands. The game itself is very fun. The campaign can be EXTREMELY hard at times, requiring tons of concentration. But its very fun. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great VR rhythm game.. I picked this up the day it was released and I've been too busy playing it to review it. For now Beat Saber is lacking on PS4 compared to PC due to licensing restrictions for custom songs and a lack of multiplayer but even with a limited track selection it's definitely worth the price. If you don't like rhythm games you probably won't like Beat Saber but if you've enjoyed Guitar Hero and want something like that for PSVR, check out Beat Saber.. Unique experience and fun game to play with your family. The music is excellent and i'm looking forward for the next batch of songs and beats. Would love to see some hit songs on Beat Saber. The calibration on the PS4 Move and Headseat work perfectly.. By far the best rhythm game in the VR community! Although must note that the PSVR lacks content compared to other consoles. A simple concept, executed perfectly. When you beat a level on expert, you come out feeling like you can take on the world. Brilliant.. I'm sweating, sprained my wrist, hit a table with my hand... and I love it! It's so responsive and intuitive. You just follow the beat and cut the blocks with your light sabers. I would just wish they add more rock songs. Dubstep isn't really my thing and I would appreciate more variety. I hope they release song DLCs quickly. Either way Beat Saber is a VR showcase.. The best playstation vr game I have ever played.Amazing enjoy and 0 motion sickness. This game is awesome and worth the $30 I spent. This game is exactly what VR is supposed to be. I shared this game with friends, and everyone has loved it. The tracking is so smooth and very precise. You feeling like your chopping up blocks to some great beats. Great work out also. Great way to get your teens and wife moving. I will definitely buy more content from this game. Just hope it comes soon enough.. The best showcase for VR - its so easy to understand and start playing, very rewarding, yet extremely hard to master on expert levels. I am in awe how well the game performs on PSVR compared to HTC Vive - calibration works I would say best in any PSVR game (floor leveling), its easy to customize it for kids, and the tracking is impeccable with the latest update. Also the music is catchy, makes you move. More expensive than the PC version but it's so much fun I didn't care. Soundtrack fits the game really well even though it's not the kind of music I'd usually listen to and the gameplay is absolutely fantastic.. This is the best PSVR game so far. While lots of games port known game mechanics to VR Beat Saber delivers a whole new experience. The gameplay is dead simple but SO MUCH FUN. The tracking is perfect. I wish they deliver DLC in the future to enhance the number of music titles and maybe even more/different play modes. The movement aspect of the game is probably one of the things I enjoy the most. You get into the beat with your light sabers, you start dancing and you actually do a workout. If you don't own it, get it. If you are unsure, try it somewhere else.. This is an incredibly fun game that absolutely anyone can pick up and enjoy. Great for highscore chasers and informal social gatherings alike.. It's best, I was surprised that a picture is more beautiful than VIVE and Oculus.. This is exactly the sort of thing that VR was made for - just pure fun, the whole way through. If you fancy giving your arms a bit of a workout, this could be just the thing for you.. This game is so much fun. The great thing is anyone can pick up and play. I thought originally the fact that there was no licensed songs would make the game not so great compared to all the PC videos I've seen with modded songs. However the song selection is on point and I cannot see a single person who wouldn't enjoy playing this game. Must buy for PSVR owners!",i bought this game because everyone was saying it's the best VR game ever . a really down for the game is the cost of the new musics . the lack of genre variations cripples this game to a halt .
"1,018.SteamWorld Heist","Great atmosphere, character design, & combat system. Story is just there. Highest difficult is ruthless.. A simple yet very fun, beautiful, colorful, addictive, challenging, and musically exquisite turn-based strategy game. Set in a retro-futuristic 'Steampunk' style with adorable retro robots and industrial steam machinery. It delivers for fans of turn-based strategy, filled with diverse and enjoyable characters, varied maps, a skill tree, fun and diverse eye-catching weapons, good sound effects, curious and whimsical dialogue, and superb music by the band 'Steam Powered Giraffe'. If anything can be criticized, it's its simple and basic menus, the lack of a more complex and customizable skill tree, and the fact that characters don't gain experience if they die in battle. Otherwise, the game is really great.. WARNING!! VERY ADDICTIVE!! The game is a bit meh here and there, but a decent game.. What is generally a fun game is completely stopped dead by levels that take ten tries to pass. I will never understand why developers insist on making games so difficult on the normal setting.. an average game that stands out for its special setting and if it weren’t for steam world dig, then I wouldn’t know about this game, although in general you can skip this game if you don’t go through only tactical games. So addictive, and so perfect for DS -- runs perfectly and the controls are excellent. There aren't many games this cheap that have such incredible replay value and attention to detail. And just so fun. One of my favourite games on all platforms.. WOW! I absolutely love this game. This is one of those games that you play slowly to savor every aspect of the game, -not wanting to go through it too quickly as you want the magic to last for a long time. Graphics: Excellent! -just stunning Sound: I love the way the robots speak, -turn your speakers up loud. Gameplay: Challenging, yet not frustrating. Fun, addictive. Really my only negative of this game is that there isn't a sequel out! I love this one, -I really wish that it was offered as a physical cartridge, as I do like collecting physical game copies.. Excellent game for the 3DS, which I've thoroughly enjoyed through and through. This coming from a non 'SteamWorld Dig' fanboy.. Initially I was a bit skeptical of the 2D action, turn-based shooter concept, being a long time X-com player myself. With that said, all my doubts were blown out the window within the first 10 minutes of game play. The developers totally nailed the gameplay. A common complaint with the game is the inventory system, which didn't really bother me much. My advice is that patient inventory management and non- compulsive hoarding behaviour can go a long way in improving your overall game experience. My only gripe is the minor lack of content in terms of the amount of levels in the game. But this is by no means a short game, clocking in around 15-20 hours per playthrough, without adding in New Game +. I found myself grinding the same few levels for extra XP and cash. I would have liked the release of additional content, free or paid, in terms of extra bosses, levels, weapons and hats. I doubt they would though, pending the release of a sequel ( Which I really hope they're working on). However, do not let this detract you from what is an otherwise stellar gaming experience.. If you are a fan of Steam Powered Giraffe, you will fall in love with this game and have the best steam-powered erection of your life. Here are some paraphrases for you. First, there is NO multiplayer. Sorry but this sort of game doesn't support it in the first place. Second, this is basically, boiled down to it's most basic concept, worms with robots. This is not a bad thing. The animations are great, combat is easy, and it has a good difficulty curve. I played it constantly for three days to beat it and fully intend of playing NG+. get it, play it, love it. Downsides? There needs to be more content... there really needs to be more content.. SteamWorld Heist was a game I had been waiting all year for. After playing SteamWorld Dig and being swept away with the characters and lore I figured the series could only get better and to an extent I was absolutely right. This game has a certain polish to it that doesn't seem like it would be a ""Nindies"" title but that definitely isn't a bad thing. This game is brilliantly fun, and a breath of fresh air. Finally something new, this game is a good break away from all the FPS, and Sports games that are in abundance. SteamWorld Heist is well worth your money, and it boasts a fairly mediocre playtime. Longer than SteamWorld Dig. The main reason why this wasn't a 10-10 or 9-10 for me is because in all honesty this game is amazing, it lacks certain customizable features that make the game feel a bit dated,the gameplay can get kinda repetitive, and the loot options are not as different as made out to be. This game would be one of the best games on the 3ds if they could possible add free DLC which adds more weapons, hats, characters and so forth. Anyways I hope this review helped some of you. This is only my second review on Metacritic but I try to give my honest opinion. My final conclusion to SteamWorld Heist is that if your sitting comfortable with you money definitely go out and pick it up, but this isn't the game of all games on the 3ds that will keep you busy and busy. It is a great time killer just go into this game with a level head.. I would have given Steamworld Heist a 10 but one thing held it back. That was the inventory system it was too cumbersome and I wished they can make a patch to fix it. Otherwise it is a fun game.. Loved the game. Took about 17 hours to finish and loved every minute of it. Especially enjoyed the Steam Powered Giraffe songs that played after bosses and in bars.. I really liked a first game (Steamworld: Dig), even though I'm not a huge fan of ""dig stuff, find gems"" type of games. So picking up this one was a no-brainer. I was slightly surprised that the genre changed, but this was a good kind of a surprise! This game is absolutely fabulous in terms of visuals, gameplay and world/story. Detailed tactically developed levels(randomish generated, but with a very thought through generator) and variety of tactical decisions, robust character roster, and interesting and involving RPG elements. This is one of the best games on 3DS with was not developed by Nintendo or nintendo affiliated developers. This is an absolutely must have game for every owner of a 3DS nintendo system.. I traveled home for the holidays. Saw people calling this 2-D XCom which peaked my interest, as I love X-Com. I absolutely blown away by how intuitive this game is. The presentation, style, menus are all top notch. So without anything holding it back, the question is, does this have the addictive ""one-more mission"" of XCom with tense combat? The answer is Yes! This game is brilliant! If you're an X-Com afficianado that likes a challenge, play on high difficulties. I am addicted to this game, and at 20 bucks, it's a simply phenomenal deal.. To put it in a sentence, SteamWorld Heist is the best game I played on 3DS in 2015. It achieved everything it was aiming for, to create an enjoyable 2D tacictal RPG à la XCOM in the SteamWorld universe. TRPG often tend to be repetitive, and filled with grind (FE:Awakening). However, like XCOM, SteamWorld Heist is neither of that. Though the story itself is quite straightforward, the background of the game benefits from a fantastic soundtrack, engaging graphics and funny characters. This game is definitely a must have for every 3DS owner.. I'd skipped this the first week it was out despite being a HUGE fan of SteamWorld Dig. It just didn't look as good to me. Well, I was wrong. Heist is an essential strategy game with a great light RPG element. It's perfect for gaming on the go with quick levels (~15 minutes) if you play smartly. The visuals are wonderful, and it is one of the few games that JUST SHINES in 3D. Strategy is a tough category, but if you like strategy, or SteamWorld games, or masterfully crafted awesome gaming experiences, you should check this game out! I am glad someone convinced me to give it a try, I think you will be too!. This game is surprisingly good. I don't play a lot of games like this, so it's hard for me to make a comparison, but the gameplay is similar to Worms. You move your character, you choose your weapon or action, and try to take a shot on the enemy team. The loot you can acquire in this game, coupled with the leveling and acquisition of new team members makes progression feel really rewarding. If you're into collecting things other than tactical weapons, you can shoot the hats off of enemy scrappers and wear those on each of your missions. SteamWorld Dig is a good game. But this is the deeper and more interesting game, by far, and almost makes their first game look shallow by comparison. It's also a beautiful game. The environments are rusty, but the characters are well animated and the backgrounds are really detailed. I hope this game isn't overlooked because it really is fantastic.. This is a very fun game. It makes me think that the creators of the game played Codename Steam and said ""how can we make that game more streamlined, engaging and accesible."" The graphics are crisp and fresh. The characters are diverse and their various class skills (which level up with XP) add depth to the combat (which feels fair and challenging). The combat itself is very easy to grasp but as you progress through the game you gain new weapons the combat becomes more nuanced and allows you to play the way you want to. I don't know why there would be negative reviews (unless someone simply doesn't like the strategy genre). The game excutes very well at what it intended to do. Enjoy!. That is one of best's game for 3ds in this year. Awesome graphix and nice music. Incredible gemplay with fun mechanics. This geme is 100% must have if you like games.. What can I say, this is my kind of game! Awesome graphics, great gameplay with fun mechanics. And who doesn't love a good fedora. I want more, and then some.","the game is set in a retro-futuristic 'Steampunk' style with adorable retro robots and industrial steam machinery . it delivers for fans of turn-based strategy, filled with diverse and enjoyable characters, varied maps, a skill tree, fun and diverse eye-catching weapons . if anything can be criticized, it's its simple and basic menus, the lack of a more complex and customizable skill tree ."
"1,019.IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946","for such an old combat flight sim, It packs a lot of content, you can play 229 aircraft in total, no DLCs included, and not only that, it is another one of those games with a dedicated modding community, so you can play even more planes from whole different eras. but although the game is loaded with awesome content, it is incredibly hard to get into, having a joystick is mandatory since there is no mouse-support, and even if you have one AI will always be better than you because they don't have to deal with the shaky aim and lack of sitautional awareness like you, it's more unforgiving than it's successor game and it's graphics (which usually is a huge selling point in any flight sim) is long due, it will take a long, long time and lots of studying basic flight maneuvers before you can actually enjoy the game for real.. Note: Game is a Flight Sim if you’re not into Flight Sims step away! IL-2 is more or a semi-sim between arcade and a real simulation; this due to there being no clickable cockpit (like DCS of BMS) or advanced flight management or planning (which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you are). Though like all Sims it still suffers in the Boredom Simulator (flying around doing nothing, feeling like a commercial pilot unless that’s your cup of tea) to which all Sims suffer from not a real surprise; though this can be overcome by time compression and best of all TimeSkip which skips you to the next waypoint much like in Combat Flight Sim. So you can take off, set up your plane, then TimeSkip to the mission point no boredom involved. The A.I (friend and enemy) is competent in most situations and will follow orders when given, along with ground control. There is a lot of content in this Sim from single missions to Mission Builder, and Campaign; you can also record and replay your flights and the replay system is one of the best still in a flight sim! It’s originally from the early 2000's (first release), and it can show in its rather overly sensitive flight controls of some of its planes (especially on takeoffs and landings), much like other early flight Sims from the early 2000's (They can be tweaked somewhat in control settings). Though ‘Damage models’ and ‘3D Models’ in general of the planes, ships, and ground forces are really Impressive; especially the planes and their **** (with fully functional gauges). Visuals are still pretty decent today (really good for its time; compare it to Microsoft Combat Flight Sim of the same time. P.S. I would only recommend for those who are flight sim aficionados, and love flying in WWII. A Flight Stick is also recommend but not necessary; because of the touchy controls. Really if you want a cheap and samey experience along with updated graphics and flight controls/flight models get the 2008 IL2: Birds of Prey for the 360, or Wings of Prey for the PC (it’s a little more on the arcade side but feels like IL-2). Pro: It’s a Flight Sim. Mission Builder so always new content, Tons of rendered **** (Fighters and Bombers). Great looking models being eighteen years old! Con: Its ‘Flight Models’ and’ Flight Controls’ leave something to be desired on some planes.. Well worth any price that will be asked. You will have to do some patching and a little modding to get it up to the community level for online play. **** still run online servers to play for free!. This Is a must have for every aviation history fan and simulator fan out there, Its pretty cheap on steam and GOG ! And the community mods are super good! this games feels very realistic and it is realistic! Planes are perfect , historical accurate and look good! there are hundreds of planes. Also this is an old game so it may have old graphics but that doesn't mean its a good game! Its fantastic! The controls may feel strange at first with a keyboard but I got ok with them also its good to have a good old joystick to play this! And this game is not for normal gamers. This game is serious and its not an arcade game! If you don't like hard games then think twice! Multiplayer its pretty populated! and its fun to play with a friend. For me this game is 10/10 and from an reviewer's eye this game is 9/10! I love this game! and I really suggest it for those who want to learn a bit of flying skills too!. This is the second best flight simulator on the PC (first is Digital Combat Simulator) and the best WWII flight simulator. There are over 300 missions, over 200 missions, and a near historically-accurate campaign. Despite this game released over 6 years ago, it is still supported, and the modding community is well active. Since this is a simulator, it's not for everyone (you can change the setting to be more arcade). It's now $9.99, so go pick it up.. The best WW2 flight sim! There is no better one. Grate physics, flight model lots of content because of all scenarios, static campaigns and dynamic campaigns random set of scenarios witch are generated based on your combat performance and general casualties. Game engine is old but there is still unofficial patch support redoing textures and improving graphics so it looks good.. great game with fantastic gameplay and excellent graphics. There are many enjoyable modes and campaigns to fly and have a really good time doing. There is a great damage engine to enhance the sense or realism and difficulty menu which lets you taylor the realism to your own preferences. However there are some complaints such as lack of tutorial, poor editor and the fact that many of the best planes are unavailable for use. For example if you want to do a mission with a bomber you are stuck with a smaller bomber or the TB-3. Also not that many different missions in single missions many are just take off or land missions. Other than that great game. But best for simulation fans.. I'm still shocked after reading JaredJ's **** poor guy was trying to play this game with the keyboard. I guess it's Ubisoft's fault, since they don't warn people of the need to buy a joystick. In fact, a joystick is compulsory for anyone who wants to play this game. I'm going to review my IL-2:1946 modded install (I'm playing Dark Blue World 1.71 mod right now). First of all I'd like to remember the fact that this game was launched in 2001. By that time, IL-2 Sturmovik was a total revolution in the pc WW2 flight simulation world. Never before a WW2 pc game allowed the player to fly so many aircrafts from so many countries in so many missions, with so much depth and detail. Since 2001 this game has been upgraded almost all the time. Now there are different ""supermods"" that introduce a huge number of improvements, and also there is a big community of modders/players who enjoy and improve the game day by day. Newcomers would ask: What makes this game so special? Well, if you like the idea of flying almost every plane that fought in WW2, if you like the idea of becoming a decorated flying ace (with the possibility of joining almost any airforce involved in the conflict), if you like the idea of flying hundreds of combat missions (from 1941 to 1946) as a fighter pilot or a bomber pilot or even a fighter-bomber pilot, if you like the idea of experiencing one of the most realistic WW2 flight simulations ever (with unmatched physics effects,realistic flying models, realistic damage models, etc.)...then this is THE game. But, of course, all the games have its flaws and IL-2 Sturmovik isn't an exception. Some people would find the game's interface just ugly, even tatty. Some people would find the graphic engine to be obsolete (we are talking about a 2001 game...true that the game's graphics were astonishing by then, but things have changed a lot since then. Though I must admit that, still, IL-2:1946 graphics aren't too bad...considering). Some people would say that the game is too difficult, that it's impossible to survive some dogfights (in WW2 this was the reality for most pilots...when outnumbered it was best to run than to fight). Some people would say that it's impossible to take off or landing without crashing the plane (specially in carriers) and that there aren't proper tutorials. Well, it's true that tutorials could be a lot better, but believe me when I say that it's perfectly possible to take off and land your plane without crashing it, all you have to do is to get the knack for every aircraft (this is one of the great virtues of IL-2 Sturmovik. Every aircraft has different handling characteristics, it's not the same thing flying a Yak-3/BF-109 than to fly a IL-2 Sturmovik/BF-110, for instance.). If you want to survive as a combat pilot, you must master the rudder in order to compensate the propeller wash effect during take-off, your must learn to trim the elevators in order to keep your plane in a straight course, you must learn how to get the best performance from the engine using the mixture, pitch and supercharger controls, you must know your aircraft's capabilities as well as the enemy's. This isn't an arcade flight game, this is a WW2 combat flight simulator, and you must learn to handle your plane gently and efficiently unless you want to die. Flying and shooting down other planes will get increasingly easier as you progress through the war. By 1943 almost every fighter will be very dangerous, fast and **** 1945 all fighters are dreadfully destructive, fast and maneuverable. Obviously, if you don't know how to aim your machine guns and cannons or when to shoot them, you won't destroy many ****'s a matter of practice. The AI in this game isn't perfect, sometimes your aircraft crashes without reason when in autopilot, sometimes a plane from your squadron simply crashes into you (or between **** I said, the AI isn't perfect, but isn't bad either. Another problem that a lot of people find is that there are HUGE distances to be covered and it takes many minutes of flying an empty sky to get to the action. In fact there is a time compression feature, autopilot and a time skip option to cope with those HUGE **** anyway, this is a ""realistic"" WW2 flight sim, what did you expect? Of course you'll need to fly huge distances through empty skies, that's what WW2 pilots did most of the time! Lastly I'd like to say that there are countless supermods for this game that take it to another level and make a big deal of improvements. If you want the most complete and realistic WW2 flight combat sim, this is the one.. Along with Silent Hunter III this is my personal favorite simulator of all times. With the Dark Blue World mod, this game is a masterpiece which never gets old and even newer Rise of Flight is not as good as this one.. For a 2007 release, this is still the best WW2 sim to date, every single thing about this game is so good. So many planes, you name a plane from WW2, it's in here, and any small detail is added in. Stuka sirens and air breaks? F4F manual landing gear? MiG-9 cannon smoke that will ruin your engines at altitude? Certain planes having odd trimming? IL-2 1946 has them, and other small details that really make planes feel so personal and unique. I was surprised how well the commands system works, it really isn't very hard to learn, and after about a day using them you will have the entire system laid out. This does have a learning curve, you will be in downward spirals and stuck on the runway wondering how the hell to start up this weird jet as a manual engine startup isn't working. Such is the fun of this game, it will last you so long just to figure out your favorite plane. The campaign system and quick mission are pretty eh in the stock game, but at the 4.101 patch they are drastically improved upon, adding in campaigns with briefings that oddly do a decent job of setting up a mood. The physics are spot on and everything works like a dream, with some annoying texture popins and weird issues frequently however. Moving on, I strongly suggest you get the SAS Modact, the modding community is great with this game and basically extends this game to 1956, adding in upcoming cold-war era planes. As for maps, the stock ones get old, but the patch adds in much more European as well as Pacific maps that really add in more length to the game. Voice acting is good with localization, really though the voice acting is solid. Navigation is extremely realistic, no icons, no arrows, no nothing, you have a map with cities and airports, you fly by instructions based on height and heading. There is a heading indicator on your HUD but it can be manually done as well. A.I. is done well, if you expect your wingmen to change formation in a tight formation you'll see a lot of shrapnel coming your way, and on average I have no problems with god-like A.I.. I've experienced the odd technical glitch like instances loading in wrong with planes destroyed and scattered, but a reload has solved them and nothing else major has occurred. The complete flight sim experience. Extremely realistic and addicting, provides the best immersion experience in ""hardcore"" servers in multiplayer. Large learning curve for players who have never played flight-sims but nevertheless, was endlessly fun.. Years after its initial release, thanks to unprecedented support for this game from the developers, this simulation still stands alone as the best WW2 combat flight simulator of all time. While the flight model might not be perfect, it is very, very good, and the planes are very smooth to fly (provided you have a joystick with throttle and rudder). The patches for this game not only contain minor fixes, but a wealth of realism and balance tweaks, and new free content including dozens of new planes. Despite concentrating on the Eastern front theatre of war, IL2 1946 presents a very complete history of WW2 aircraft (and beyond, with the theoretical 1946 aircraft) and their relative performace. There is a very devoted online community for this game, who are very vocal in making sure that the weapons and relative flight performance characteristics between aircraft are as true to life as possible. The fact that this game can be found for only a few dollars in the bargain bin just make it an unbelievable deal. Although it has no real interactive tutorial, the game does have excellent options to make the planes easier to handle, if you're not 'hardcore'. The downsides? The graphics aren't quite up to today's effect-laden standards, but you can forgive it that because it's an older game, it still looks nice with a few config edits to enable 'perfect' water/clouds mode, and damage modeling is still impressive. The main flaw in the game is the campaign generator, it is more random than dynamic. However the game includes a full featured mission builder, and robust online play which more than compensates. If you like the subject material, this is the only game you will need.. OK, if you hate the game, you're either doing it wrong or clearly aren't interested in simulation games. IL2 IS A FLIGHT SIMULATOR. If you want action-packed simple controls, get something else like Blazing Angels. Several years old, but remains probably the best combat flight sim in existence. Destruction, realism, good flight simulation, and okay graphics. In game multiplayer is useless, but getting Hyperlobby (****) is easy and pain free, and offers many benefits. Mods are readily available, with many communities alive to this date. At only $9.99 on Steam, this game is a must-have for all simulator fans, and a good play for others.. This game is by far the KING of Combat flight simulators. Though a little old it is still the best by far and it surprisingly has little or no bugs in it aside from a few minor compatibility issues. This game however is only for people who are fans of this genre due to the fairly steep learning curve. You are basically thrown into the **** of the plane and forced to fly. Aside from this, IL-2 Sturmovik is the finest WW2 flight sim you can get, with a heap of flyable planes, many ridiculously huge maps, mission builders and pre-made missions to fly, giving you plenty to do.. Actually, this game needs two scores: one as purchased and one as patched. As purchased, it's about a 5 by modern flight sim standards. I know the IL-2 fanatics will disagree with me here, but truthfully the flight model isn't really as convincing as, say, Aces High 2 or Rise of Flight (my two fav prop sims). Patched, the graphics bring this about the AH2 standard, and the game deserves a 9 there--- BUT you'll either need a friend to point you in the right direction, sift through forum posts, or just suffer trial and error. For example, it took me forever to figure out how to integrate TrackIR, whereas any state of the art game just is plug and play. Before everyone gets snotty about the guy who gave it a 0 for lack of tutorial, imagine if you came to this game with no previous flight sim time. Not explaining controls isn't a badge of honor, nor does it make those who figured it out better people. Bottom line, although its age shows, as played probably the best WW2 flight sim out there. But expect to put some work in-- not in learning to fly, but in futzing with patches and such. Then again, at $10, you can't beat the price (AH2 is $15/month, and while it has a better FM, the graphics are just painful). Before you get this, you need to know what to expect. A lot of people who say it is ""boring"" perhaps went in expecting an arcade style game. This is no ""H.A.W.X."" Oleg Maddox said that his goal was to produce a simulator and not a ""game"". The axis and allied aircraft are not ""balanced"" and often players do have advantages/disadvantages due to different types of aircraft. Before buying this game, make sure you have a good joystick. I've worn out numerous sticks on this sim! You might like to look for something which has pitch and roll (forwards and backwards) as well as ""yaw"" (from twisting the stick). Without a joystick, this game is pretty much useless. While the single player missions are fun (for a while) this game comes into its own in multiplayer mode. There are servers online where you can dogfight, bomb, torpedo, strafe... the list is endless, all with other players as both allies and adversaries. You can also partake in closed missions/simulations where several people crew one aircraft as gunners/bombadiers etc. I have spent many evening/night on teamspeak to online friends while flying with them in game. Since joining the IL2 scene, I have learned a lot about aircraft and world war 2 and I've started going to more airshows!!! In short, if you want instant gratification, this may provide some but not a lot. If you want something to sink your teeth into, then this is for you. Be prepared to invest time and learn. World war 2 pilots had to learn about their aircraft and (seeing that this is a simulator) so must you. Oh and the mods... so many to choose from (provided you have a non-steam version) if 1946 didn't have enough flyable aircraft, people have made the Ai aircraft flyable now as well as ""scratch"" building aircraft for the game! 10/10 gameplay 10/10 lastability 10/10 multiplayer 5/10 graphics. If you even fancy yourself a fan of flight sims, you need this one. There's no real way around it, you need this flight sim, it is simply one of the finest combat flight sims you can find.","IL-2 is more or a semi-sim between arcade and a real simulation . it suffers in the Boredom Simulator (flying around doing nothing, feeling like a commercial pilot unless that’s your cup of tea) but this can be overcome by time compression and best of all TimeSkip which skips you to the next waypoint ."
"1,020.XCOM: Enemy Within Expansion","XCOM on itself is a great game a solid 10/10 but this explansion ? Dials fun to the triple!. this is not the most gargantuan colossal sized expansion ever but it's still a good expansion and i would say the game is not the same without it here's what to expect from it (mostly spoiler free): - a new resource that can be picked up during abduction and ufo raid missions - two new mutually exclusive side-classes based on the resource (one focusing on small improvements to regular soldiers, and the other focusing on turning your soldiers into cumbersome but powerful behemoths) - an additional enemy faction whose operations revolve around sapping your own operations and gaining some of this oh so sweet resource (you can launch infiltrations to slow them down and get intel on their base's location) - two new alien units (one focused on ambushing soldiers and another focused on head-to-head combat) - a new side campaign called Operation Progeny that works similarly to the Slingshot DLC - a new key mission that appears a little under a month after clearing the alien base - extra tanky sectopods ... and a plethora of bugfixes, balance tweaks and improvements to make the game the best version of itself that it could possibly be. Small additions to a great game, but I wouldn't have paid separately for this one though.. To this date, still the best XCOM. Have reinstalled it (don't have Chimera Sq) and it is still relevant today despite XCOM2 being released. Now to be fair, I got the most out of this game because of the Longwar mod, but that was back in the day. Vanilla play will be good enough for most people even today. It loses points because it has obvious problems, little bugs, QoL is not as good as it could be, etc. There are a lot of small problems that will get in the way and upset you a bit, but no showstopper or anything like that.. Epic game, thank you ................ Don't know why so many bad reviews .... xcom enemy within long war is probably the king in the turn based strategy games. unparalleled stategic and tactical options, a ton of mods and a magnificent soundtrack. highly recommended for the genre fans. Amazing tactical game, with great replayability value, great graphics and immersive story, a lot of pseudo sci-fi technical stuff and researches, which i LOVE!! very fun! There are some caveats here and there, UX is not well thought, a little bit disbalanced soldier types out and few bugs here and there, but i forgive it, as it's the first game in franchise.. Would reload savegame again. ............................................... Metacritic forces me to write a seventy-five character review so that I can have my notes listed without searching game by game.. Amazing game, so many great and different elements coming **** gets a bit boring thougn once you become really good at it.. This game is overrated. Every mission is same essentially. You have to inch your way forward, Otherwise you run into enemy and lose soldier, which is very bad. Most of the time, you meet no one But than one time, if your soldier is even little bit in front and you don't have everyone on overwatch and covering each other you instantly lose. Just because i order one guy to reload. Hits are complete rng, even if you have 85% chance you miss sometimes and whole mission is over, so you have to replay 30 minute mission again. Also there are bugs and qol issues in the game... Also it is one of these games, which are unplayable without wiki, a lot of things is missing specific description and it is unclear. You have to find tech trees and how stuff works, Othewise you will play inefficiently. It is not that hard, but you have to know how things are, so game is unplayable without wiki, which is not fun to google every 5 second something ! These things should be in game specified, so you can easily learn them on the go. Cmon devs it is not that hard... There is in game wiki, but that is just basic info... These things are so obvious from player viewpoint. But devs don't play their own games. So they have no idea about frustrations player face, or other problem in the game. Also it is strategy game, yet a lot of things are rng and some decisions are completely random, because you don't have information: like how hard mission will be, because you want to exp more soldiers, if some die, or become injured. You have no idea what you will face.... The early game of this game in much difficulties, could result as a headache thats result of the unbalanced enemies and the only early strategy, meanwhile you advance on the game, is everytime more balanced and with good path is even easy on impossible. But, the game contains a lot of bugs and errors that wasn´t fixed, and can ruin potencially a challenge like the i/i, much like invisibles shots, teletransportation of the enemie, or the horrible aiming system deployed on the game. The good thing, is an amazing story about supervivence, and action with custom cutscenes that make the game more interesting, also the varity of enemies such as ablitys to our heroes.. Really interesting game on release date which takes strategical izometric games on different level. The story and writing is very weak and if fails in making any relationship with your soldiers, they are all generic and pretty much the same.. A decent expansion for one of the greatest strategy games of all time. Doesn't completely revolutionize the experience like XCOM 2's War of the Chosen, but anyone who plays XCOM 1 would benefit from owning this.. Very good DLC which add some new mechanics and options to the game. Shame that campaign don't change much comparing to the original.. When I started playing this game for the first time, I didn’t really like it. But after some time I tried to play it again and this time I really liked it. Work and arrangement of the base, upgrading and supply of the team, global choices, and most importantly, turn-based tactics on the battlefield itself. All this is on par with, albeit banal, but very interestingly made story. This game deserves its ratings and reviews.. I played both XCOM Enemy Unknown and XCOM Enemy Within. The games are 80% the same, same plot, same events, same actors, same stories, with the only difference in Enemy Within there are a bit more of new events, the human enemy Exalt, and few new enemies. There is no reason to play both since i see the second more complete and vast. If you want to play, just play the second. For the game, i appreciated really, even if it is not at the high level of the original X-COM. But is well done and made modern. I had anyway the feeling that the authors tried to make more commercial and accepted by a wider range of gamers, exemplifying the gaming. For example, I found less researches es to do, and also the combats are made easier with less commands. So i say 7 for the first, and 8 for the second.. Basically this was my first turn-based game since the original Fallout and i love it. Spent so much time playing it that i can call it hands-down one of my favourites. Instant classic, no doubt about it!. To be fair, the novelties introduced in Enemy Within contributed to make the game fresh, exciting, deeper but also more complex and less accessible. It took me some time to explore some possibiliies offered by the Meld (genetics and cybernetics) on top of regular or psi soldiers ; and I ended up betting on mobility (especially jumps) to get cover or flank enemies, and additionnal defense ; since you are rarely pressed by time (except maybe defuse bomb missions). Since I player XCOM Enemy Unknown, Enemy Withing and XCOM 2 in a row ; I finally prefered the way XCOM 2 was designed, even on the controversial parts.. I'm generally not a fan of the genre but my friend insisted I try XCOM: EW so i did and I was pleasantly surprised, I ended up putting 40 hours into and finishing it on normal difficulty and I'm definitely interested in jumping into XCOM 2 now. I enjoyed the mix of combat and base building, this is the first game I've played that melds these genres together and they do it really well. Other than a few of technical issues like the cut-scenes being hard locked to 30fps, your character customisation being reset randomly and the Berserker causing frame rate drops whenever he moves I can't fault the game too much. It runs, plays, sounds and looks really good. Overall an enjoyable experience that I can recommend to even those who aren't a big fan of the genre like myself.. You should play XCOM Enemy Unknown with this addon. The campaign will be much better: The graphics look better and not soooo old, like in Enemy Unknown, the new missions are looking much nicer than the old one. In addition they improved the variety of the missions, because they offer you new tasks. The addon gives you more possibilities in the gameplay, so it is a bit more complex. Unfortunately the game is very easy, even in the normal level, especially the last level could be a bit more difficult. So in the end they changed a lot of weaknesses, but one weakness stays: Because you dont know many informations, you need to look in the internet or load a lot, or both.. add Long War mod and you have an almost better game than the original X-Com. totally worth the 5$ tag on steam. expect a campaign to last around 200-250 hours, challenging. the only downside is that the missions are quite many per month (15-20 tac battles / month).. Enemy Unknown was a brilliant game and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. That one I played all the way on classic and without ironman, so for EW I figured I was ready for ironman. Well, frankly, it takes about 3 playthroughs to be ""ready"" per se. Wanna know why that is? Because EW surprises you with random **** that is guaranteed to be fatal for your campaign. Let me explain how my classic ironman campaign suffered a sudden death. It all started with a terror mission in the police station map (the one consisting of a large open two story building with a pillared facade, a one-story side room and an alley to the right). Now I've had difficulties with this map before, seeing elite mutons, chryssalids, floaters and all kinds of crazy coming out of that building, but this round was rather special. There was nothing but chryssalids. Just 18 civilians and an estimate of 16 chryssalids. I would never in my wildest dreams have imagined such a scenario, so consider me shocked when I saw three chryssalids storming out of the side room and taking about 5 steps from the door, ready to land insane crits on 3 of my guys next turn. One already got pierced at the door the moment I ended my first turn (which also makes me wonder: this was the first time an enemy that was not triggered on my turn was able to attack me - the chryssalid who killed that unit was triggered by vision provided by the three chryssalids who barged out of the side room at the end of my first turn and enabling sight into the room that contained two more). As if the events in front of the side room were not bad enough, I had three-four more chryssalids jump down the walls and running out of the front side of the building. I barely managed to kill all 6 or 7 chryssalids that appeared on my screen there - only thanks to the heavy firepower from two of my colonel heavies. Guess what happens next turn. That's right, about 6 more chryssalids deicide to ignore the civvies in the building and just dash outside and in front of my units. Couple of turns after that I lose one corporal and another colonels who had been with me since the beginning. I'm forced to dash to the evac and abandon another colonel, Zhang, who ended up being surrounded by 3 zombies because I needed his rockets to blow away the hordes of chryssalids coming at me every single turn. Fun mission, but I deicided to get over it and push on. Next mission I get one of those advent evac missions. As usual, I'm very careful with my positioning, but with missions like these they matter jack **** Not only am I told these exalt troops are genetically enhanced (which is ""great"" news after just losing two colonels), their snipers can move and shoot at the same turn, despite otherwise playing on the same field as the xcom troops. But that's not the issue, the issue is the sheer number of those **** coming at you. Not only does the game drop about 10 of them at the same time, they are also dropped in BEHIND YOU. That leaves you with two options: you somehow blast those flankers or you risk getting wrecked by multiple overwatches trying to find better cover (in my case going to the only other cover revealed three more exalts camping out at an alley...). Basically exalt had every single position covered and death ensued. But what I loved ABOVE ALL about that evac mission was the intel given to me by Central. BRADFORD YOU BASTARD. I **** you not: twice did he have the occasion to tell me ""That should be the last of their reinforcements."" BRADFORD U ALREADY SAID THAT AND I JUST FINISHED DEALING WITH THOSE PREVIOUS REINFORCEMENTS!!! The result of that mission was total wipeout and 7 xcom operatives dead - couldn't even evac because the evac zone was on the opposite end of the area I was supposed to defend. And the evac area was also out in the open. It didn't get any better from there - the game is so good at mercilessly punishing you for failing. After that failed evac mission I am approaching the end of the month. As I'm researching the advanced interceptors I am once again surprised with three consecutive large or very large UFOs, which I all have to ignore because frankly there isn't much you can do with those figher jets, even with items. Month ends, I lose two funding nations. Ironically the month started with 666 currency with a monthly 666 income. In total I now have over 800 currency. Two days later I get sabotaged by exalt, who take FRICKING HALF OF MY MONEY. I'm now left with just 400, which is not going to get me through the next month considering the number of recent setbacks. I'm not even going to mention all the bugs I never saw in EU. I suggest you don't try this in ironman the first or second playthrough. In my case it's the surprises that ruin the game entirely. It's only very late into the game that you can get some intel on what you're going up against, and even that is only in ufo crash missions. Otherwise you're going in fingers crossed. Normally not a big fan of turn based shooters, but XCOM: Enemy Within may have just made a believer out of me. Superb combat, even if RNG makes you rage impotently sometimes (missing a 94% shot... FUG). The meta game involving base building is pretty in depth as well, and is a large part of the fun. I highly recommend everyone give this game a shot, regardless of whether or not you like turn based shooters.. This game is very good in its genre . Graphics are good. Tactics and creating strategy is good too. Creating soldiers and the improvements in your base is good too. The idea in total is well. The AI is acting well too. BUT, after 40-50 hours of gameplay, you feel that something is missing and you fall apart from the game, things are getting repetitive and it starts to get boring. Need improvements in the gameplay, if done it will be more addictive and can play for several hours. If there was more successful games of this style in the market, i would rate this game 7 but; because its some kinda unique in its genre, it worth 9 from 8,5. If you like these kind of games buy **** wont be sorry. And hope for improvements.. This expansion has all of the problems of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and doesn't get the game closer to the original XCOM UFO Defense. So, if you didn't like Enemy Unknown, you won't like this expansion as well. Yet it does offer new stuff (like medals, genetic mods for your soldiers) and minor fixes/improvements throughout. If you haven't played Enemy Unknown, you can safely skip it and start with this expansion as it has the same campaign, and more. Apparently they listened to feedback and fixed issues which were easy to fix. Like, you will now see how many hitpoints an alien will lose after your shot. Or, there is a button to take off all gear from soldiers in the barracks so that you could easier equip the squad you are sending on a mission. The multiplayer is fun (your team of soldiers fights vs another team, you can even play as aliens), yet I disliked that there is too much randomness - and this can't be changed because randomness is the core of this game. When you shoot at the opponent's mob with 75% accuracy and miss, and then they shoot with 80% accuracy and miss, it reminds a circus and not a strategy game... Though such events happen not very often. This expansion isn't worth to buy for almost a full price ****. However, I got both Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within in a bundle on sale. If you get it as a bundle, it's a fair deal.. good successor to the legendary xcom series and it looks like the series will be in good hands going forward since 2k is pretty good with strategy games (except for the beyond earth trash). game graphics and music are top class, with the chilling music really **** u into the game and making u jump when a sneaky alien jumps out from a corner. gameplay is solid with some thought required if u don't want your squad to be killed and turned into zombies; however it is still a little on the easy side as alien movements are predictable and they appear to be unable to shoot straight even when u are standing in front of them. AI clearly needs more work. the story itself is good with unpredictable twists along the way to make gameplay fresh. a nice recommended game if u are keen on sci-fi strategy games or an old fan of the xcom series.. This game is a copy paste of it's predecessor, yes they put some new feature but honestly IT'S the same game. I hope not begin to do as EA with fifa, that every year they get out the exact same game with some minor changes. To make a game as it should be a software company need al least four years, so, to finance themselves they foisted a heated soup.. It worths every penny! I'm a massive fan of the old X-COM games. I played them through billions of times. When I first saw the new XCOM game, I was less than thrilled. No AP, no thanks. Then I tried it for some reason. At first I didn't like it all that much. It was weird and restrictive, but by the time I completed it, it grew on me. It is not the old XCOM for sure but the updates and improvements are working really well. The new XCOM is extremely fun and addictive on its own. This reboot was risky, but Firaxis pulled it through perfectly, Big Thumbs up.. Xcom is one of my all-time favourites, so obviously I wanted more. Still, I felt a bit ... maybe not cheated but disappointed. EW brings in some shiny new units (some of which really adds to the experience!!), twists the story a bit, brings in new maps, a new resource, etc. But, all things considered, the game did not change much, my impression was that I replay the same game (which I never do... for those who don't mind replaying, my problems might be non-existing). On the other hand, the new units make beating the AI much easier, in the 2nd half of the game you should not face any challenge at all (I played normal or hard, I don't remember which). Should I have not played Xcom before Xcom EW, I would easily give 9, maybe even 10. This was not the case, however, so my judgment is 8.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Get XCOM and This expansion Enemy Within. Whilst I don't particularly like the direction that EW took (would prefer normal non-modified humans vs aliens), the game is taken to another level by installing the superb 'The Long War' mod. XCOM + 'The Long War' = the game I keep coming back to over the years.. Very good made game, graphics, story, gameplay, everything . It just becomes a little bit repetitive in the second half of the game . It is always the same - you go forward, spot a group of 3 enemies which then hide and you kill them . You need to be cautious not to spot another group of 3 enemies until you did not kill the first one . Like the enemies are not moving at all before you spot them, they are just standing there. In previous XCOM it was not the case . This is the only flaw i found - the repetitive AI .. A stupidly brutal game. There is nothing quite as unrewarding as watching a guy you've somehow managed to groom across a few rounds die to a coin toss. Is this supposed to be a tactical game, because it seems like the random number generator is more in control of the outcome of the match than I am. I reinstalled it today to give it another go. Couldn't get past the first map. Squad seemed to miss every single shot it attempted, even when the odds were seemingly in its favor. Frankly, this is a truly horrible game. I don't understand why the reviews are as high as they are. Maybe my computer has a RNG bug or something. This game fundamental mechanics of losing units to baffling randomness is just not very appealing.. Xcom Enemy Within is an updated version of Enemy Unknown. Enemy Within greatly improves on the somewhat simpler version of Xcom that was Enemy Unknown. The series, for those unfamiliar with it, is based on leading a secret covert operations group, known as Xcom, as it attempts to secretly defend earth from an alien invasion. The game does allude to all of this being top secret, which seems a bit ridiculous as you play through the game, but that doesn't really matter to the gameplay. You act as supreme commander of the Xcom project, managing and building up a base of operations, sending out satellites to detect alien presence, managing the happiness of funding countries, researching and leading squads of up to six soldiers into battle that can then be leveled up as they gain experience. The game, like any other game, has evolved with its modern iteration. It is a sharp, fun and responsive squad based strategy game that has streamlined a lot of the annoying micromanagement features of past games, but has also simplified things and put a cap on squad member leveling up. It is a more accessible, but simpler game than past generations. The game, in the most basic sense, plays like this. You have a base that you expand with various modules that you can build into your secret mountain hideaway. As you research new technologies new modules open up for upgrades or more efficient research. You launch satellites to gain funding from the various nation groups across the globe and to spot alien incursions. When incursions happen you deploy a squad of soldiers into a tactical, squad based ""seek cover and advance"" type gameplay that dictates a methodical approach to combat. As missions are failed or ignored panic will rise. Victories reduce panic. There are a handful of main story missions for advancing the game that are unlocked by certain milestones in the game, but the vast majority of missions are procedurally generated battles with aliens. There are basic research items, but as you kill aliens and do autopsies, capture and interrogate aliens, or shoot down and capture alien ships more research items are unlocked to gain better weapon and armor and new gadgets. There are four basic classes. Assault, heavy (machine gunners), snipers and support (medics) which each have their own skill trees that you can utilize as they level up. All four classes are needed across the game to face different situations. Medics to stabilize downed squad members, snipers to provide cover, heavies to deal huge damage in short bursts and assault troops to act as front line combat soldiers.. Later in the game psionic abilities are added which add some more variety to your soldiers, but psionic abilities are rare and only have three tiers. In Enemy Within a new addition is Meld which can be used to upgrade soldiers genetically or cybernetically. This adds a lot more variety to the class structures, allowing you to turn your favorite soldiers into cybernetic MEC's or upgrade them genetically to improve their abilities and durability. Personally, I found MEC's not terribly useful and fairly resource intensive in terms of Meld, which is a very limited resource, but the genetic alterations had great affects and were well worth the cost. The Enemy Within expansion also adds a good variety of missions if you count the smaller addons with it. There are new covert operations to locate and eliminate a secret organization known as Exalt that is out to hamper your efforts. There is also another series of missions focused on a Chinese criminal orgainization. Overall, they are nice addition of scripted, story missions. The aliens you face are variations on a few base models, but the variations offer enough change that the game continually changes and evolves as you proceed. New challenges are thrown at you every few missions that force you to think more carefully about how you combat the alien menace. The game looks good. It won't blow anyone away. It has its own style, but nothing that really sticks out as uniquely distinct. The technical side of the graphics are good enough and slightly better than your run of the mill top down game. Sound effects are well done and add to the experience and the voice acting is well done with squad members reacting to the battle. The controls on the PC are very easy to work with. Consoles are also surprisingly good, though moving the cursor around with the joysticks can be slow. The iPad controls are cumbersome and you can end up moving soldiers to areas you don't mean to because you have to press an area twice to move there. Enemy Within is a much improved version of Enemy Unknown. It adds additional complexity, options, missions types and squad improvements to the game. Ultimately, the game is still on the simple side, but the added content really pushes the game into the replayable multiple times enjoyment level. I would recommend for strategy fans who may have been turned off by Enemy Unknown's simplicity.. A surprisingly deep expansion to an incredible game that gave me a reason to go back and play it again. That alone is reason enough to buy Enemy Within.. Honestly i don't think i would have enjoyed enemy unknown nearly as much without the expansion, mind you I bought it when it cost much less so that does change things. is it worth 30? no. not a big enough expansion. is it worth 10? yes. MEC's are awesome. The extra missions/maps are fun. Definitely worth the buy at a lower cost.. A decent expansion for XCOM. It adds a good amount of content, but i can't say it's worth $30. You get new maps, missions, allies and enemies. It's all good fun but it really doesn't feel like it reinvents the game. Still worth it for any XCOM fan.. This is a brilliant strategy game that no fan of the genre, especially fans of turn based games, should pass up. The easy and normal difficulties make the single player portion of the game new-player friendly, while the classic and impossible difficulties, combined in the Ironman (autosave only) option transform this game into one of the most tactical and challenging experiences ever created. But i dont like that they dont support mods very well and force you to play the game their way. The game is still XCOM: Enemy unknown (this one is a DLC) and so it can't be bad, but I have to say this expansion doesn't add much depth to game mechanics, it just adds stuff. The additions make the game a little bit harder at start (because of additional attacks and sabotages) but quite too much easy toward the end of the game, mainly because of genetics. The whole ""fusion"" idea is interesting though. To make things short I mean exactly this: if you happen to find this at discounted prices like €5 or less, buy it, you will enjoy it, otherwise wait, because you will regret it.. Overpriced but good DLC full of content... new soldiers types add twists to the solid base game, which i love. Now the price dropped and you can find it for 5-10 euros online, totally worth it.. I would put this game in the pantheon of strategy games, without question. SCORE: 97/100. I loved this game from start to finish and everything about the tactical gameplay is amazing and engaging. There are a great variety of classes (with upgrade paths, ranks, and different equipment) and enemies, diverse maps, good base technology and items, and just a complete package that is fun and replayable. This is a game that you will play again, and you will be glad you did.. The expansion is pretty decent. I love using the MEC's and augmenting my soldiers. I do regret that they didn't add an additional story arch to the game, however. While the addition of a rival organization was a nice touch, it was pretty well the only portion of the story that was added. What it boils down to is if you have beaten Enemy Unknown, you've beaten Enemy Within.. While this game is fantastically fun, well balanced, and easy to learn (though difficult to master), it is also not worth your money. Unfortunately, this game is plagued by several game-breaking bugs which tend not to make themselves apparent until you have invested at least a dozen hours into it. One bug in particular happens during a mandatory mission, wherein the game goes to a black screen during the mission's beginning, and stays there. The only known workaround is to not install the latest patch. 2K has been made aware of the issue (months ago, in fact, and by dozens of users), but no further information has been forthcoming. With this in mind, and though I do love what little of the game I HAVE been able to play, I sincerely cannot recommend it. Do not waste your money.. This game is the definition of the AAA title. Fun all the way through, great visuals, sound and nice plot twists. Saving the earth has never felt that good before :). The game is good, graphics are wonderful, action is fast paced even if it plays in turns, weapons are many and various, the story is intriguing and long lasting... It IS a good game, and that upsets me, somehow. Call me extremist, but I really didn't think to appreciate a new, action oriented x-com clone. When I see the name X-Com, I cannot avoid to remember the original one and all its beloved features, features that aren't entirely here. This game recalls the original one, but nothing more. It is a modern, console oriented, arcade mode of the original X-Com: Enemy Unknown and its early successors. It is fun, it is good, it is maybe too easy but still engaging. If it had a different name I would give it a 10.. Its a good 8 imo, but to many ppl giving it 0, cus they have no clue or dont understad the game or how computers work. So i gave it a 10 to compansate a little!. This added on soo many great additions to an already great game and I added on over 50+ hours to a game I had already played for 60+ hours. This content was perfectly integrated into the already almost perfect game. 10/10. This game is trash on PS3 (may be better on other platforms) I'm sorry to say. I mean it is the most fun game I've ever played in my 43 years of life but only when it's working properly. Most of the time the game works ok but when playing a supply barge mission or a terror mission the game crashes like 70-80% of the time. I have to restart system to continue playing. It's gets very frustrating after doing so many times. However, as frustrating as that is it's not nearly as bad as the base defense mission messing up. Base defense mission goes black every single time at beginning of mission after Bradford finishes his speech. It's impossible to continue. It ruins an entire game. It was working well before last patch but now it messes up every single friggin' time. Exalt missions go black at beginning sometimes also. Also, MP mode is 100% broken. I haven't been able to even connect for an online game in 3 or 4 months. I've finally given up on trying. Even when I could connect, there were certain bugs that made game unplayable. Like floaters b","this is not the most gargantuan colossal sized expansion ever . but it's still a good expansion and i would say the game is not the same without it . to this date, still the best XCOM ."
"1,021.Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward","Pretty amazing. It was my first taste of an actually well written MMORPG, that also provides a decent amount of customization options and stuff like player housing. The overal graphics however could be better and look kinda washed out in the overall world.. Amazing expansion with a deep story and great characters like Aymeric, Haurchefant, Estinien and a few more. Also the music was just fantastic. It still has a bit too much filler stuff in the msq, though. Would prefer some quests as optional side quests.. kind of boring, i’m not into fantasy knight stuff so that’s probably just myfault. better than are, but my second to least favorite.. This company steals from **** you pay for a subscription and then cancel, they will take your money the next month even though you cancelled. They took my money and then refused to give it back. I was a loyal customer of theirs for many decades, occasionally buying games and services but after this experience, I will never buy another game or service from Square Enix ever again!. God I wish this was it's own stand alone Final Fantasy title. It is truly amazing in Final Fantasy 14, but imagine how good it could be if it were a stand alone title?. - one of the best Storylines ever - a heavenly soundtrack for the ages - masterful worldbuilding and a lot of lore HEAVENSWARD IS A true masterpiece. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fourteenth game in the series. this expansion is breathtaking!. The music, characters, storyline, locations, dungeons are all excellent. A truly memorable final fantasy game.. An excellent first expansion to an already wonderful game. The Heavensward storyline keeps you hooked for its entirety, with a lot of twists and turns. The characters will carve their place into your heart, and you can be assured, you will never forget them. The music is stellar as well, with a mix of soft piano pieces and more ""techno"" ones.. This expansion does what both JRPGs and WRPGs have been forgetting to do for a very long time: Tell a good story. It improves on everything from the base game: locations, classes, customization, abilities, content, and so on. On top of that, it gives you a story that is easy to understand yet has so much nuance to it, sometimes even letting the player interpret it themselves, something uncommon for JRPGs where everything feels very stiff and ""this character will say how things are supposed to be!"". An expansion that, without any surprise, will stick to the memories of any players, and it keeps constantly being mentioned as the best or second best story in XIV. Characters also feel important as they end up being mentioned later on, some of them sticking with you on your journey while others becoming pillars for characters' morals. With the free trial, there's no excuse not to play this expansion now.. If you don’t like the Trial / “Realm Reborn” take my word, you won’t like any of it… New players hope you are ready for 200+ hours of MSQ which is mainly reading text. I fell for the recent hype. To all the people who says “it gets better” seriously, what is wrong with you? This constant insincerity is what kept me going. IT DOESN’T GET BETTER (a least to the point it serves as a valid argument). I just finished Shadowbringers 5.5 MSQ, and let me tell you, this is an “interactive Novel” more than it is a video game. Sure with each expansion the game (novel) gets a little better, in terms of graphics, animations, storytelling, but the CORE of the game doesn’t change, it is still this outdated mmorpg tab targeting, with its main FOCUS on MSQ, which is basically walls of text. Your quests in order of occurrences is: talk, travel, click objects, kill NPCs, do dungeons/trials/story instances. They added one different mechanic in Stormblood lol, which is to “click stuff in FPS mode”. I can count the EPIC moments of the story in one hand! 3 of them were in Havensward and 2 in Shadowbringers (forget RR and SB). The main focus of this game is the MSQ, but the problem is; the MSQ is 90% fluff pointless writing and storytelling, you could cut out 80% of this writing and still get a concise accurate description of the story, albeit just more on point. What Square Enix is doing is inflating game time content with more and more text and sloppy animation screens, which I’m not kidding stretches the MSQ than it really needs to be. I’m not even talking about important background build up, I’m talking about content you won’t even remember because it served no purpose in the grand scheme of things. (Anything you wont remember a month from now isn't worth reading about). Because the MSQ is mainly storytelling, and single player orientated, why not just play better solo video games that are much, much better technically advanced in gameplay, like GTA 5, Witcher 3, red redemption 2, and hundreds of others titles? There were times I was so desperate to just “play” the game, because there is so few dungeons/trials and killing quests in-between all the walls of text. One could always pay a story skip potion, but the fact is MSQ is the focus of this game, the endgame is extra stuff. Players and Square have both said that MSQ is the focus of the game, and the more casual player base. WoW = focuses on repeatable endgame content after a short introductory (and often crap) storyline. FF14 = 200 hours of MSQ (at minimum) at which point you can cycle through some endgame content and get max ilvl gear fairly easily. But levelling others job/crafts, which has its own questlines seems be one of the most popular things to do. I won’t be buying Endwalker. People who enjoy reading fluff for hundreds of hours to see one good cutscene here and there, you do that, enjoy! I’ll watch it in a recap YouTube video and do more productive things with my life than read FLUFF MSQ content, which is intentionally used to extend game play time. “You can always make more money, but you can’t make more time” think about if you’re really enjoying that 200 hours or if you’re only enjoy small amounts of it. Whilst the epic moments were epic, the pain of going through so much unfun content to see it was not worth it. The balance is definitely not there. Even most fans think the post RR quests are so bad, yet square hasnt fixed it by just removing it for new players by using a short narration cutscene to bring players up to date for havensward. (And i heard it was even worse, oh dear God).. The first of the three excellent expansions to FF14. The storytelling is strong with very good writing and the overall additions to the game are really good.. After my extraordinary experience with the main game of FFXIV, A Realm Reborn, I decided to purchase the complete edition of the game. I was eager to jump into Heavensward after the cliffhanger ending of A Realm Reborn (which I will not spoil), and I came out starstruck. Heavensward is a high fantasy tale that involves a war between the city of Ishgard, and the dragons of Dravania. The setup is so simple, yet the story as a whole is so well written, and so emotional that I'm positive it would've won at least 2 Oscars if it was turned into a movie. While the gameplay is mostly similar, there are new abilities added for all jobs, and there are 3 new jobs that are introduced. Each one feels unique from each other, which is true for all jobs in the game. The characters have much improved in this expansion, and they feel a lot more relatable than in A Realm Reborn. Alphanaud, for example, has turned from a snobby teen with much power at his fingertips, to a runaway who's disappointed at himself for being fooled. More characters like Estinien and Haruchefaunt, who have only appeared but briefly in A Realm Reborn, have made a return here and have been built up quite nicely. They both have an impact on the story and are characters that I won't soon forget (especially Estinien, as he appears in other expansions as well). The last thing I should mention is the new areas. Regions like Dravania, land of the dragons, and Abalathias Spine, an area in the literal sky, have been added. Flying through these areas feels like a dream, and thanks to the catchy soundtrack, sightseeing here and there is fun on its own. This is easily the best expansion in all of FFXIV (well... almost the best ;] ).. Dragons. Many cool Dragons. Dark knight, Dragons and some steam-punk. This is insane and cool combination. My advice:do not skip cutscenes in this expansion!. It took a long time to reach this point, but the quality of the game soared and as I continued playing it just got better and better. Now that Heavensward is included in the free version of FFXIV there is no reason a Final Fantasy fan shouldn't give it a try and experience one of the best Final Fantasy stories of the modern era.. This game is a love letters to the original FF series, the best MMO out there. Still more FFXIV fun. Little grindy, but opens up to some fun dungeons and all around more stuff to do.. As far as expansions go, Heavensward easily stands as one of the best out there and I don't know but this doesn't feel like an expansion at all but more like a full sequel or something like that. Everything that ARR did good, Heavensward does it better even greater, so long is the sloppy story with a lot of boring diversions and subplots, here you feel like the story and every character are getting somewhere, sure you have to be introduced in certain scenarios and plots that aren't that great, but they never get that long or boring. The gameplay maintains, with a few tweaks and upgrades but the challenge was really good this time, the dungeons also didn't feel boring and the new skills were also good, there is everything for everyone. As for the real challenge that comes with the endgame, here's where things get double great, the extreme battles are so intense that you'll need a lot of skill and maybe luck (because other players) to conquer them, but they are some of the finest that I have ever played on a videogame. Going back to the story, I really liked that the story is simpler and focuses on way fewer characters, something that works for the best because in ARR sometimes it got really convoluted, here you will find an amazing story of journey, love, despair, and hope, themes that I really like, and speaking of characters, the main cast is just fantastic, my favorite above all is Alphinaud, I don't remember the last time I was so invested in a FF character like him, is that good. The music still is very good, and it has a lot of diversity as before so I don't have an issue with it, the graphics are also good for an MMO standard. I have some issues but there are so minor, like in order to use the new fly ability to soar the sky through the maps, you need to find certain ""thing"" in different parts of the map, and also do some sidequests that for the most part are OK but not that fun, I get that it's to slow you down but it can be really boring and bothersome, so I hope that this can disappear in future updates. Heavensward is a magnificent story, filled with amazing characters, plot twists and challenges that every FF fan should have.. The best MMO currently available. I will not list all its features, just say it’s great. And I recommend everyone, who love mmo, play in ffxiv.. One of the best if not THE best expansion for any mmo that is out there. They improved the story a lot, and the gameplay and dungeons are great too. 9 out of 10, great expansion. Heavensward is an expansion that provides exactly what it should, which is a large chunk of content and hundreds of hours of gameplay. The new areas are vast and inspired while communicating a sense of wonder that feels right at home with a lot of the games other areas. The new Au'Ra race coupled with much more gear, an ever growing number of dungeons and 3 new jobs to explore, there's little to say that's negative about this expansion. It does exactly what it should, it expands your experience well beyond the original ARR. Not to mention the voice acting is finally raised to a standard that's not utterly laughable like much of the base game was. If you're invested in this MMO and want even more, then this has what you're looking for.. the 2.0 series or ARR were decent, there were a lot off problems with it that they were just unwilling to fix and not listen to their playerbase. now with heavensward at this point we are in the last cycle of this expansion, the game has just gone from bad to worse. yoshi P and his dev squad ruined the community and are bleeding subs, most servers are a waste land at this point; basicly everything released in heavensward has been very poorly implemented to say the least. the only thing that hasnt changed is them not listening to the majority off there player base, that is also why they are bleeding subs. everything they do to try and fix it, they just end up making it even worse. i have played since early access in 2.0, and i have personally seen that things they destroyed and just refuse to change it for the better. at this point they are putting all their hopes in the new expansion, with total remakes off classes, but it wont help imo. the damage they have done to the player base is to big, at this point SE has got to look at what yoshi P and his dev squad have accomplished and take actions, but they wont. for most off us it is to late and are just waiting untill are subs run out, so more people will leave. so it is going to get even worse. From amazing visuals to fantastic combat, Heavensward has got it all. Building upon the success of A Realm Reborn, they've opened a few new zones in the form of Ishgard, Dravania, and the Sea of Clouds. I'll be boiling down the key points of my review with Story, Additional Content, Gameplay, and Visuals/Music. Story: While A Realm Reborn kept the story fairly safe, drawing many parallels with the first Final Fantasy, Heavensward flips that on its head and goes for something very new. I'll not go into detail as it is better to experience it fresh, but suffice it to say that this different approach has solidified an identity for Final Fantasy XIV as an MMO that can draw in the player on their story as well as the gameplay. Additional Content: While other MMOs may struggle to develop substantial content to keep players engaged (looking at you Warlords of Draenor) Heavensward releases new patches every 3-4 months that are loaded with additional raids, dungeons, trials, and several quality of life features. From adding new crafting features and recipes to entirely new game modes in the form of Palace of the Dead, the development team pours all their effort to keeping the game fresh and enjoyable for their fans. and let's not forget the three new Jobs added to the game in the form of Dark Knight, Machinist, and Astrologian. These jobs add further diversity to the already unique roles in the game. Gameplay: If you're already familiar with the combat from A Realm Reborn, you'll be happy to hear that the depth of combat has only gotten better. Fights such as Ravana and Bismarck add a new level of mechanics and challenge to test your coordination and skill within the game. Visuals/Music: It goes without saying that Square Enix is known for their striking visuals and great music, and Heavensward is no exception. From the beautiful city of Ishgard to the incredible design of their brand new primal: Ravana, the art team has been hard at work to create a game that looks and feels great. On the musical side tracks add an extra layer of atmosphere to zones and dungeons, and tracks like Dragonsong are truly fantastic to listen to. In conclusion Heavensward is an expansion that nails it on the head in every way possible. Any fan of good MMOs should certainly give it a try.. Final Fantasy XIV Heavensward is the perfect example of what an expansion should be. The new areas are massive. The story is one of the best stories in any mmo ever. The music is some of my favorite from the entire series. This is good work on all fronts from the developers. Going into Heavensward you will get a lot more of the same from A Realm Reborn. That said ARR was well done, and this content feels just as good. The expansions only real shortcoming is the extensive grind toward the end of the roughly 60 hour story (pre-patch now about 75 hours as of 3.3) The story masterfully makes you feel helpless and unable to comprehend just the scope of the insurmountable hatred the dragons have for the people of Ishgard. The story is just the beginning, the end game offers some of the best content the game has to offer. Currently there are 8 segments of the long term 8 man raid ""Alexander,"" and 2 segments of the 24 man ""sky pirate"" (not official name) raid series. Beyond that there are lots of dungeons to do, daily missions, new beast tribe quests, new classes, and much more. Be prepared to lose literally thousands of hours to this soul **** amazing game. Definitely recommend this game to any fans of the mmo genre.. i believe this is an excellent mmo. it has amazing graphics. i feel that they do not produce as much content as they did in their first expansion thus not being as great as they used to be. you almost feel no need to attempt the harder content. If you wait 2 weeks you can achieve the same goals as you would if you were to try the hardcore side. I do not know what the issues are but heavensward content did bring the final fantasy aspect as well as a realm reborn content.. I started playing ARR back in a couple of months ago. After all the countless hours it took to get to heavansward, I was still ready to keep going. Being introduced into the incredibly massive worlds like western coerthas, Dravanian hinterlands, and the floating islands was one of the coolest experiences in my video game career. Plenty of dungeons and trials, the raid Alexander, and countless things to farm to keep you interested. The only major thing that I deduct points for is the duty finder. The duty finder ****. God only knows how long it will take for me to get into a stage in the raid, or do my daily roulettes. The duty finder for me takes away a lot of the fun that I have in the game especially when I'm trying to farm for various objects in dungeons or raids. Some instances it takes 15 minutes just to do a trial that will take no more than 10 minutes. How this was countered was letting you play like normal in the regular game while you are waiting. Although this takes away from the hype of doing some awesome content, This feature helps lessen the boredom. All in all, This game can at times leave you speechless by how cool it is and the concept is amazing, but the duty finder and many smaller inconveniences take away from much of the excitement. Why Square Enix thought it would be a brilliant idea to lock the entire expansion behind a years worth of content before players like myself who left after running out of things to do in the vanilla game is beyond me. I completely wasted my money buying this DLC as I never even reached Heavensward because of burning out waiting two to three hours in que for the blasted dungeons that they so annoying force onto the player by locking the story lines progression behind them. Simple to much effort to reach the new content to be worth the money I spent. I keep the game as a reminder to never buy into another one of this franchise's expansions again.. Very good game. I really enjoy the world and atmosphere of the game. Now, people say the game is a grind. What mmo isn't? I mean, one of the criticisms of mmos is that they're too involved. They begin to feel like a job after a while, and there is no real way to break away from them. If you break away for a couple of weeks, when you come back, you have tons of refreshing to do. So the argument that ""It's a grind,"" doesn't really wash with me. ALL mmos are that way. They can be overwhelming.. this feels like someone take world of warcraft and blow some life in a dead game . good game if you search for an mmorpg this is a great one . such an original game. Couldn't even get the thing installed on the computer after numerous attempts with support staff, my internet support staff. After numerous headaches, e-mails, and problems this game is just not worth installing save your money, go with a more user friendly game. I spent well over 24 hours of my life just trying to get it installed because I enjoy mmorpgs but man I'll never get that time back. Patcher/Launcher has major issues, just lookup all the problems people have with patching and installing, I literally had to change msconfig, do port forwarding, and all the other fun stuff and it still didn't work. Steer clear.. I want to love this game, especially since I have put so much time into it already, as I have been playing since 2.0. However I feel disappointed lately, as I feel not much is being added in terms of innovative, fun content. I'll start off with the games strongest point. The story comes immediately to mind, I never skip any of the cut-scenes as I find them very entertaining. I did enjoy leveling my first class to 60. Another thing I love is the community is for the most part very helpful. Yes there are trolls and elitists, especially when you run dungeons, but overall, compared to other MMORPGs, I have had good experiences with other players. And finally (since I play the PS4 version) I find playing this on console very smooth. You are able to map so many abilities to the controller, which in a sense proves that you can play these types of games on consoles. You can have all jobs on a single character, which is listed as a plus by many other reviewers. Personally I think it's a minus. For example, to make high quality gear as a crafter, you're forced to learn and level all other crafting professions so you can use cross-class skills. For battle-oriented classes, all healers are forced to equip 'Protect' as cross-class skill and all tanks are forced to use 'Provoke' as a cross-class skill. It's the fact that a job can't stand on it's own that bothers me. Also most tanks and most healers and even dps are to similar to other jobs fulfilling the same role. This doesn't make sense to me as the game is not tuned at all for PvP (which is an afterthought in this game - this is primarily a PvE game). But what bothers me the most is the endless grind when you reach end-game content. First thing to note is that you don't really need much skill. It's all about the gear rating. So whenever a patch is added, new gear set with higher potential are released, and to get this gear, you are forced to run the same dungeons over and over again. Also dungeons are linear, so running them after a while becomes a chore. Recently in patch 3.15, the new relic quests (Anima weapons) have just been introduced. To get these, you are forced to run old content for months if you are a casual player. No new instances was added or anything to make it interesting or at least less tedious. Another concern is that I have no idea when the next major patch is coming out or what it will be about. It's as if any innovations/additions to the game have been put on hold for a long time, and I'm seriously considering unsubscribing at this point.. The monsters in the new areas are just huge HP bags. The gear threadmill at level 60 is exactly the same as the one in ARR Fates are still as uninteresting as they were in ARR.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Only giving this a ten to combat the zero's. This game is not a ten, by any means. But it is an extremely viable expansion to an already thriving game. I had ESO for awhile, the game is just TERRIBLE. Grind, grind ,grind, can't do this quest because you're not cool enough! Ok let's go into PVP where people have far, far higher skills than you since your level may sync but their skills don't sync down! In FFXIV:H, well in the first rendition, they do, PVP is always balanced, instances are always balanced, and while the PVP system may not be as good as, say DaOC or Destiny, it's there and it's always improving. For those who say it's grind grind grind **** back to WoW! Takes 2 days played to hit cap and then easy to get gear etc! As like FFXI, it's gonna take awhile! Get used to it! 2 months is nothing compared to MMO's back in the day! Impatience is ignorance. Please don't listen to these ignorant imbeciles. This game, plus sub, is worth every penny, especially if you've got friends to play with.. First of all, the game s beautiful, and loaded with content and a great story. With that being said, the game is the same grind over and over. Max your character level, working on maxing your gear and item level, and as soon as you do that or get close,they release an update. In that update, there is a new currency every time, the 2 months of grinding you just did is now all futile, and you need to start a new 2 month grind to get said currency, exchange for higher gear, and then get an item to once again upgrade said gear.. The expansion has you continually experiencing new and exciting twists in the game system, and the amount of things to do and experiment with is simply mind-boggling. This is a testament to just how passionate Naoki Yoshida and his team are about this game, and how willing they were to make things right after the original Final Fantasy XIV MMO launch turned out to be a catastrophe. This appears to be reflected in the player base too, with ARR being one of square Enix’s highest grossing titles. I have dabbled in many MMOs over the years, but Final Fantasy XIV still remains my favourite, and the new world of Heavensward takes everything that has made the title so good over the past two years and dials it up to eleven. If you are prepared to invest a lot of hours into a game that continually rewards you, I can’t think of anything else out there right now better deserving of your time. ****. FFXIV as a whole offers a great story, beautiful world, great music and production values. By gaming standards it's very good. By MMO standards, it's actually quite bland and really offers nothing new, and fails to even rehash anything that made the genre great. From a veteran's perspective (10+ years playing various MMOs): Jobs are overly balanced to the point where they don't differentiate well within their trinity (Tank,Healer,DPS). Everything in the game has been designed around equality, which is odd seeing as how, like FFXI, all jobs are accessible on a single character and players are encouraged to level multiples. Character progression slows to a near standstill at cap with virtually no options for how you build and play your character. Unlike most other MMOs there are no talents/skill trees/ branching or specialization in either skills or equipment. All skills and abilities are automatically learned along the way, and for equipment It's simply a straight vertical climb up the iLVL chart which also offers next to nothing in terms of choice. Raid content is repetitive and heavily reliant upon dodge and enrage mechanics. While raids can be difficult, it is generally because people fail to execute a very mechanical formula such as failing to meet DPS checks or remembering phase changes and specific positioning. Dungeons are simply a means to level and gain tokens to exchange for the basic pre-raid iLVL requirement gear. There are no valuables or collectibles (besides glamour items, furniture and minions) to be obtained. No usable rare and unusual items exist at all in the world. Crafting provides almost no advantage to character development as equipment is, in 95% of all cases, sub-par to raid and token gear. It can be used to earn an equally useless income by crafting consumables and glamour items but ultimately provides little to be desired. Both of the above are done in an overly cautious means to prevent RMT (Real Money Trade). Despite the recent news and reviews, open world is no more dangerous than in 2.0. Players can still take down 3 enemies at a time with literally no open world danger aside from going AFK. The most glaring issue is in all of the limitations imposed by SE that prevent people from continuing to grow at their own pace. Nearly everything is gated by timed lockouts and access. Even gathering jobs can only obtain the most important resources at specific intervals. These serve the purpose of delaying content consumption between the patch cycles and to balance the progression levels of the player base. Although the attempt to level the progression of the player base is likely done to prevent elitism, it's backfired in a sense. Instead of being judged on their progress in the game, players are more often ostracized for lack of coordination, response time and general skill. Overall, Heavansward offers almost nothing new to the genre. The largest changes made to the game are a graphics refresh (DX11), open world flight, new dungeons, new jobs and a level cap increase. In other words, very standard fare for an MMO expansion. Once the world is seen, story played through and dungeons crawled it leaves very little for veteran MMO players to enjoy. If you're new to the MMO genre, looking for a casual place to hang out online with friends, really into role playing or just have a very limited amount of time to play, FFXIV may be hands down the best choice. But if you're a hardcore MMO player, raid junkie, or want to become a PvP god we're a little out in the cold right now. Hopefully 2015/16 will bring back some of the great sandbox MMO features many of us miss.. The best Final Fantasy since Final Fantasy IX, a great main quest, an awesome soundtrack. The developers are really listening to their fans. the graphics could be better though.. My story, my personal relationship, with FF ARR ended after two years and during the release of the first expansion: 'Heavensward'. I just think I came full circle with the game. I have loved it, since the beginning and devoted countless hours and days (and nights!) in this very immersive and addictive game. The expansion just made the game bigger, better, with more beautiful landscapes to explore, more things to do. But, for me, it gave the confirmation that it will simply never end. I know this sounds naive; all MMOs are 'endless', I just never grasped this thought in a realistic way. Before the expansion, I had pretty much everything capped; from jobs to gathering and crafting classes. Had tons of rare stuff that took me hours to achieve. Once the expansion arrived, it felt like I had so much to do, like I was back at square one; I was lost, overwhelmed and, in my mid 30s simply (and finally) realized I just don't have time to devote almost all my free time to an mmo. All of a sudden, it was as if I lost the appetite for it. And I just decided that I should use my little time outside work to do something else. Take better care of myself, invest more in my social life and play games, yes, of course, always; but a more reasonable amount. Heavensward is 'more of the same' in a bittersweet way for me. I don't know. It's like a lover that you 'love, but don't like anymore'. And, as I say this goodbye, I stick with the thought that my beloved character will carry on, in Eorzea, the rest of my adventures. I just won't be there anymore to see it. I will forever love this game. But, for me, it's time to go.. This is the continuation of the A Realm Reborn story arc. This directly follows what happens next after the great finale of ARR. Story is even better than what it was before the **** addition of the new jobs has expanded the ways of players to run through content and the new abilities included in ALL jobs are giving us the change to reimagine our rotations and create new ways to play. The new areas are really really large and they make you work to be able to fly, it is a bit of a pain at first but as soon as you are allowed to fly, Oh, man you will LOVE it! the story is amazing ag","the music, characters, storyline, locations, dungeons are all excellent . the music is stellar as well, with a mix of soft piano pieces and more ""techno"" ones . this expansion does what both JRPGs and WRPGs have been forgetting to do ."
"1,022.Wildermyth","A must play for D&D fans. Great to play co-op and recommend. Character events are awesome moment and can completely change the makeup of your build and character completely. The addition of the Steam Workshop support makes it super simple to add countless hours of new campaigns, quests, and character customization.. Wildermyth is a tactical role-player in which the characters and events are procedurally generated each time you start a new game. The combat is solid enough, and the procedural system works pretty well to allow players to develop their characters and relationships as they see fit, but without any scripted story beats it starts to feel a little repetitive before you reach the end game.. Pretty fun story generator with solid turn based combat and a lot of different ways for your character's stories to branch out and change. Overall it never feels anything other random and procedural, it doesn't compare to a more deliberately written RPG, but it isn't trying to do that either. It knows what it is and offers so much content that it'll be a fair while before you start double-dipping character events, and you'll be seeing new ones for a long time. Overall a fun game with a cool concept but not engaging over long periods of time.. It's fun for like the first eight hours, afterwards it's monotonous and repetitive. A lot of scum saving to really make it through as well. Ironman mode is painful. Not sure where all the love for this game is coming from.. Simplistic and cute. Some of the stories are really deep. This is a rare example of the game with a soul. ""Something in the woods is very strange..."". The art for this game is gorgeous. If only the gameplay could back it up. Turn based combat feels so empty in this game. See X-Com for where turn based combat can leave you screaming in joy or pain at the screen. I never once felt that level of emotion with this. Procedurally generated characters leaves them feeling empty and lifeless, like they were generated by an algorithm. Probably because they were generated by an algorithm. I saw through this facade so easily, because it's right in your face when you encounter the next procedurally generated character option, six hours into the game, that you've already seen. The art for this game has so much life and creativity. Why is everything else so lifeless?. I have finished the first 3 parts of the game. About 13 chapters. Adventure difficulty. Enjoyable turn-based strategy. But it repeats itself a bit. The storytelling and variety of the game is nice. It's good to see the characters we created especially in this story. I didn't like the inventory system very much. There could have been a wider bag system for items. The game generally has a simple gameplay in adventure difficulty. If you want a comfortable gameplay and are new to turn-based games, I recommend this game.. AAA publishers should look at this game and weep. To be quick about it: this game is a triumph. The writing is bittersweet, goofy, and surprisingly deep in equal measure. Seriously, after suffering through the cringe-worthy writing in FF7 Remake, this game is food to a starving man. The storytelling is fantastic and at a quality level that I thought would be impossible. Interesting concept spoiled by a very boring storyline and extremely verbose characters! A time came when I just couldn't care about the story or dialogues. Started skipping through them. The only other remaining gameplay was the turn-based ""strategy"" which I found to be dull and boring. Also, recruiting a hero seemed impossible because the game didn't give me that option more than once. Overall, a very unsatisfying game!. No game has ever gotten me so emotionally attached to randomly generated characters. It also evokes such amazing feelings of adventure, that I've only previously felt while playing pen and paper RPGs with my friends.. The first 10 hour experience is phenomenal. After that you will find events become repetitive and less and less enjoyable. Fun game, and a fresh take with the comic book style making it feel like you are writing your own story.. Wildermyth is something special. Not all about looks, but about stories. Stories that the players makes, with their own choices, building up their characters over time. Your characters will not live the same adventure as mine, nor will they react the same way. If I could wish for something more from the game, it would be a larger diversity of events, and a larger diversity of skills. Just.. more of what is already there. So that the feeling of mystery, of adventure, that it so greatly explores, feels fresh for a very long time.. This is worth picking up for fans of turn based strategy who can get past the visual aesthetics. If you are a fan of turn based rpg's this game is very good if you give it a chance. I was initially turned away by the appearance of the game (which seemed childish), but after playing it for many hours the gameplay kept me coming back. Also worth noting that there is a degree of challenge and reminds me a little of darkest dungeon with having to replace lost characters. The only things that bother me or I believe would improve the game is a change of visuals and some changes in the main story. In the end a fun game.. In the world of small indie RPGs, Wildermyth is a standout. Certainly a lot of major studio releases costing four times as much have been less satisfactory. That said, if you need something that stresses your equipment, brain, and reactions to the breaking point, this isn't it. But the stories are interesting, the relationships complex, the battle tactics rewarding, and the replayability outstanding. The game bends over backwards to give you all the help you want, so your energy goes into figuring out what to do rather than puzzling over how to do it. For the money, it's hard to beat. Following are comments from a relevant reddit thread: Is Wildermyth actually deep and replayable? I’m thinking about buying the game, but I’ve noticed something kinda strange about the reviews for Wildermyth. Most people are saying that it has amazing procedural storytelling and you can play it endlessly. But then there’s a handful of official reviews saying that it gets old after a single campaign, and some of the most upvoted steam reviews are saying that you’ve seen everything after only 10 hours. Just wondering if there’s any truth to the latter opinions. Edit: Thanks everyone. Sounds like most of the negatives I heard weren’t as bad as I thought. Definitely gonna pick this game up soon. In the sense of Civilization being deep and replayable or a roguelike being deep and replayable. Each campaign has a similar high level arc and foundational strategies. The events that happen are random, with each campaign experiencing only a fraction of them. The evolution and stories of the characters are random, though somewhat guided by you. I've played through most of the fully scripted story campaigns and a few fully procedural campaigns; there are still several major possible events I know about from this community that haven't happened. There are a few others I've seen 3+ times. In my second campaign I saw a bunch of repeated events, which led me to think I was rapidly seeing everything there is to see. But I think I just got unlucky - in the several campaigns I've played since I have seen almost all new events. I do think that the combat gets pretty stale rather quickly as there is really just one dominant strategy - move forward, kill everything in range, new monsters advance in but weren't close enough to attack, repeat. BUT this is mostly due to playing on too low difficulty AND there are a ton of mods by Smoker which greatly expand the items, abilities, and re-balance the combat a bit. This has immensely improved my enjoyment of the combat system. And I'm sure there are more mods coming to continue this process, adding new events or even new entire campaigns. You should only buy it if you like playing amazing games. I’m not sure what your expectations are for a $25 game but I’ve played about 30 hours and when I consider the value **** I compare it to a $10 two hour movie. Given that, I definitely think it’s worth it. I’ve been playing RPGs for decades and I found a lot of the narrative to be really heartfelt and the experiences very original. Events tend to repeat now and then but I wouldn’t say it takes away from the game enough for me to review it negatively. I’m really looking forward to some of the fan made content (and DLC?) and will probably try my hand at making some myself :) I have 50 hours and have done 5 or 6 campaigns. I am someone who hates repetitive gameplay or stories, but in this game it hasn’t gotten old. Even though events repeat, a. I’m still getting new ones at 50 hours, and b. the ones that do repeat are still interesting because it’s happening to new characters, or with different interactions or choices made. I think it is a perfect secondary game. Something you don't binge, but rather play though a campaign every couple of weeks. I usually play I in between games or if I need a break from my primary game. I've got nearly 40 hours and I've only seen a few repeat events happen so far. Thing is, for those events that repeated, the dialogue wasn't the same because the characters either: had different personalities that changed the dialogue, or they were rivals/lovers that also altered it as well. You definitely could play it 'endlessly', but it won't be 100% unique events every single time. But different choices do change the outcome of the event, especially if you fail an event's roll which also has a different outcome for your characters. [I would have just given you the link, but apparently Metacritic won't allow that]. The writing is bland and doesnt make much sense. The graphics are cardboard cutouts that bounce up and down. No voice overs or much in the way of sound effects. Very little in the way of initial customization. This could have been a good game but there are much better indie titles out there in a similar style.. Was a hard game to purchase despite the reasonable price tag. Paper Mario art style does not appeal to me at all, but I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. Quite a fun distraction in a form of RPG. Characters grow and develop their own stories through randomly generated events under an overarching nemesis. I did like 3 campaigns and did get bored, but those campaigns are quite memorable! I think this is a great concept for a game, and only way it could be improved is maybe having a more interesting artstyle (16 bit?) and more variety in the random events. Just keep making more and more events to make the fresh campaigns more engaging!. AAA publishers should look at this game and weep. To be quick about it: this game is a triumph. The writing is bittersweet, goofy, and surprisingly deep in equal measure. Seriously, after suffering through the cringe-worthy writing in FF7 Remake, this game is food to a starving man. The storytelling is fantastic and at a quality level that I thought would be impossible in a procedurally generated game. The combat seems simple at first, but it is surprisingly deep. It plays like a really good tabletop strategy-RPG board game, which is saying a lot. Those types of game normally far outstrip the quality of strategy video games. Overall, it is a game that must be experienced. The art style, the music, the writing, the gameplay, the plot lines, the **** all pulls together in a brilliant way. I am as impressed by this offering as I was when I fist picked up Hades.. This is far away from my usual type of game, preferring Simulation and Management games. I saw it on Steam and thought i'd give it a chance. I haven't stopped playing since purchase. Music: Non-Invasive, adds to the atmosphere of the game and gets intense or mellows at the right parts. I'm working from home at the minute and have played this during quiet times, however have just left the game running when things pick up and had the music playing in the background and it didn't get annoying. Graphics: Simple, customisable characters, reminicent of Fall Out in someways. All the skintones you need to really put yourself into the game and with Workshop access, the skys the limit. The characters are endearing, the worlds solid and the foes interesting but not grotesque. Story/Writing: At times snarky, at others emotional, overall you can tell the writing team (or person initially) has put effort into their work and curated it to be ""just right"". The game is dialogue heavy at times, however combined with the gaphics and the engaging stories and the multiple-choice outcomes, it doesn't feel like a slog. Overall: If you like TTRPG's, if you enjoy a more gentle approach to your gameplay but with exciting elements (akin to ****, but more action heavy), if you enjoy (customisable) storydriven gameplay...heck if you played Neopets way back when and were obsessed with KeyQuest, you will enjoy this game. Just under £20 on Steam at the moment, not heavy on storage (2GB atm, developers are planning DLC in future), well worth the price for the amount of fun and engagement you'll be getting from this game.. Your characters grow on you. You start with a party of a warrior, a mage and a ranger and from there their character evolution is a mystery. Will they get to the end untouched? Will they bear scars that never fully heal? Will they fall in love ? Every player will have a unique experience, this game is simply a masterpiece and I'm hoping to see future updates.. What a great game, the best rpg I've played since Disco Elysium. I did not believe in the game premise, but it works pretty well. This game is not for everyone and it can take 2hrs to get exciting when more stories, equipment, combat/strategic elements get introduced slowly. I'd describe the story as similar to Duck Tales. It is not a very serious story but it can get as epic as your imagination. The transformation system is very fascinating with the results sometimes character build-breaking in a bad way. They are very interesting and there are some strategic planning required as your party will get old and retire so you need to train up new party members to finish the campaign. min/maxing stats and gear farming are not the focus of the game. It is more of a choose your adventure RPG. The combat can be brutal as your the guy who has been with you for 3 chapters can get 2shot and mained. don't expect Divinity 2 here but this is a unique fun RPG experience. I didnt get invested until about 3hrs in after my waifu got turned into a warewolf, my best friend transformed into a rock and my son got turned into a crow for talking crap.. Easily my favourite game of 2021 so far. The story building is incredible. You will start with generic characters who you will grow to care about as their story develops, which will be unique depending on their two key personality characteristics they start with, who else is in the party and the relationships they form with them (rivalries, friendships and romances), as well as what happens to them or others in combat (friends or lovers dying, or being maimed and losing a limb). There are also opportunities that come up that can completely transform a character into a magical hybrid creature amongst other things. The combat is great if you like turn based tactical gameplay, and there is meaningful skill progression which unlocks a wide array of abilities. Overall I couldn’t be happier with this game.. Maybe missing some variety in TBS battle part. But still probably will be a game to remember for years to come.. its a story of love n friendship n rivalry . story of fallen soldiers story of epic battles its wasteland but a D&D rpg 11/10 masterpiece no doubt. Sluggish gameplay. It’s got it’s elements but I just can’t get into it. It’s not for gamers like me who look for a Zelda type story and gameplay in games.. One of the best games I've played all year. I never would've imagined that I'd feel such attachment to procedurally-generated characters, but the combination of leveling up, gearing up, and gradually evolving your character through random events creates a brilliant uniqueness for each character, one that feels much deeper than it has any right to. I've faced moral dilemmas when forced to sacrifice a prized veteran to win a seemly impossible match. I've felt incredible relief landing a winning blow with my last standing character when failure seemed all but certain. I've felt incredible highs when luck turns my way, and I've felt dreadful lows when an unlucky event maims a key character. After three campaigns and 30+ hours of gameplay, I'm still learning new strategies, discovering new events, and facing new enemies. I've played with dozens of characters, no two the same. And I know I have hundreds more hours of adventuring to complete. As insane as it sounds, this may be my game of the year. I doubt any other game will grab me like Wildermyth has or make me feel all the feels quite the same way.","""wildermyth"" is a tactical role-player in which the characters and events are procedurally generated each time you start a new game . without any scripted story beats it starts to feel a little repetitive before you reach the end game . the art for this game is gorgeous.

"1,023.Luigi's Mansion 3","Lots of charm and simple fun in the first half of the game, but the game-breaking controls and some curious design completely spoil the 2nd half (e.g. the unplayable B2 boss fight). Lots of potential let down by some very un-Nintendo like gameplay and design at times. Highly overrated.. Positive: + Good humour. + The animation is nice, but unexpected animation and the 30fps frame rate make control stiff and often frustrating. + Ghosts have more personality than those in Luigi's Mansion 2. + Some floor have interesting puzzles and are fun to explore. Negative: - Controls are more complicated and less intuitive than in previous entries. - Puzzles and boss battles can be extremely confusing even for veteran players. - Exploring the game later on for gems and hidden boos is not funny because all the regular ghosts respawn. Because of this, all the stages of the playthrough feel like a constant chore. As soon as you're having fun with something, the game will ruin the experience somehow. - How worthless E. Gadd Hotline can be. - Unforgiving level design limits experimentation. - It's not as magical as Luigi's Mansion 1 and not as playable as 2. - I found a glitch during the annoying floor 11 boss battle that forced me to restart the game. - More unfair than challenging, more torture than fun and less enjoyable than both 1 and 2.. A game that starts as a 9/10 and gradually becomes more irritating. I wanted to love it but it has three main problems that really take away a lot of the charm (charm that's actually there!!). The first problem are the controls. God they are clunky. Some parts of the game, like the final boss fight, expect the player to have a level of precision that simply can't be achieved with the controls offered, which leads to a lot of frustration. It must be said that Luigi controls in this game are the best they have been in the entire series but there's still a long way to go before calling them actually comfortable. My second issue was how, specially during the second half of the game, I had a hard time understanding what I was actually supposed to do. Level design is amazing and really good (the game has a LOT of variety in each floor) but it's quite easy to miss a specific thing in a boss fight or level that's not obvious. This led me to actually abandoning the game for a couple months as I had to check a YouTube guide more frequently then I'd wanted. Last but not least, the Polterkitty and lost Toad dynamics that forced backtracking in the game were completely unnatural and irritating. I don't know why they were included. If I wanted to go back in a level I'd play a Metroidvania. This is not a Metroidvania. Luigi's Mansion 3 has wonderful graphics, amazing technical performance, and really fun gameplay ideas. It has a lot of potential. But by the end, I was glad I had finished it.. Really liked the design and characters. Liked the boss fights and puzzles especially.. This is for sure the high water mark for the Luigi’s mansion series and is far and away better than 2 and in many ways 1 as well. I would also go as far as to say this is one of the best looking, most polished, and most well crafted games on the switch in general. Level 5 killed it with this game and I can’t wait to see where they take the series next.. Luigi's Mansion 3 is a visual showcase, arguably boasting the best graphics on the Nintendo Switch. This slow-paced action-adventure title focuses on exploration, environmental puzzles, and ghost combat. While consistently presenting clever ideas, the core gameplay loop suffers from occasional control imprecision and a somewhat uneven rhythm. Despite its inventive moments, a pervasive monotony in the game design may test players' patience and discourage them from seeing Luigi's spooky escapade to its conclusion.. Masterpiece. One of the GreatestVidro Game Experiences of all time. If itwasn'ta third game within a series and if it wasn't a spin off character being utilized, it probably would have been received better by mainstream outlets. The IGN score infuriates me. This game is a love letter to video games.. This game was SO good I loved it very much the graphics were beautiful and the gameplay was really fun and I was just so happy to see my boy in green get a full fledged out game the likes that rivals even some Mario games. Game has great production value and enjoyable gameplay at times. Two big detractors are the finicky controls with the vacuum and the horrible movie set board. The movie puzzle is awful and the cat ruins the game. Coop also should have been available from the start.. Luigi's Mansion 3 is an amazing game but the reason it falls under a 7 is because I'm used to the original Luigi's Mansion on GameCube. Luigi's Mansion 3 is my second favorite in the Luigi's Mansion series. Luigi's Mansion 3 is definitely a must play for any Luigi's Mansion fan, but your thoughts might be on one side or the other. I personally like Luigi's Mansion 3 but it lacks that creepy factor that made me fall in love with the original.. While a cleanly presented and slickly animated entry, gameplay can be monotonous at times and bosses vary in quality (in terms of both difficulty and fun). Still a charming experience nonetheless.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ransack, money, vacuum, puzzle solve, ghostbust. That’s what you’ll be doing this entire game. It’s extremely fun. Graphics are great for the Switch, especially the cutscenes. Gooigi is a great new gameplay mechanic, and this game’s main character is Luigi, the most charming and full of personality video game character ever. Also Polterpup. Polterpup easily makes this game a must-play.. A weirdly forgotten title on the switch. This a perfect evalution of the Luigi's Mansion franchise in all the best ways. The highlights are 100% how fun and polished the puzzles are. We also get to here the Mario Bros language - Mario will say ""Hey Bro"" and ""OOOH Doggie"". This is by far the best Luigi's Mansion game. The level of detail and design put into this game is really quite incredible -- from the secrets, to the graphics themselves. There are a multitude of different levels to progress through, making it feel like you really got your value out of the game.. Played with my girlfriend and it was a fun game. Sometimes the cutscene was funny, sometime the puzzle is a bit tricky. But the whole game was very relaxing and enjoyable.. interesting game of medium length, full of puzzles to solve and fun but not memorable boss fights. the game is very simple and this I think is its biggest flaw. while its strong point is its graphics and settings, which are really beautiful despite the fact that it is all set in a single hotel. Strong start, but I couldn't bring myself to finish it by the end. It's just far too one note by the midway point. The regular enemies are all too samey and some of the bosses end up being far too obtuse to be interesting. The slow puzzle element didn't really hold my attention, either. I still feel like the first game, as much as it might have been a tech demo, was perfectly paced and a decent length to showcase variety without wearing out its welcome.. 1st half is good. Visuals and atmosphere are great with nice characters, however the quality significantly drops from there on, becoming much more obtuse with frustrating bosses that can quickly kill you due to a lack of clarity on how to beat them. I repeatedly find myself trying to for my way through levels and will definitely not replay it Disappointed overall compared to LM1. This is not a game worth full price. Excellent game. Gorgeous visuals, a great soundtrack, and good mechanics. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great Switch game.. Great game. Played it on theNintendo switch. The main story was cool and interesting, mostly not that hard and flowing, except for 2-3 bosses and the final boss. I recommend it.. Love the game but it's not quite on the level of the original Luigi's Mansion. Luigi's Mansion has leaned more on the comedy side ever since Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon. And to be honest, removing the horror factor devalues the game in my opinion. Great game, way better than dark moon, and I'll say it, Luigi's Mansion 3 with the inclusion of Polderpup made me respect Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon even if just a tiny bit. However, the lack of the spooky factor really devalues the game a bit for me. Could have been a higher score if it had that balance but unfortunately that wasn't the case this time. Had Nintendo nailed the balance between comedy and horror then we would have had possibly a true successor to the original Luigi's Mansion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really don't like this game. It's okay but I really just don't see why anyone should play it. I can't see what's really special about it.. I do not like as Boo voices from SM64 is not on the game. Story and characters are fine. A great story, great graphics, and most of all fun to watch and play. If you want entertainment, look no further, this game is definitely one to add to your collection.. Pretty and fun game, exactly what you'd expect. Alhtough the controls are a bit messed up.. After Punch-Out!! Wii and Luigi's Mansion 2, Next Level Games managed to keep their rolling momentum with pushing out technically and graphically incredible games for their respective consoles. The creative themes from Luigi's Mansion 2 combines itself with the open-world-yet-linear design and the arcade-like aesthetic of the original that many people begged to return after Dark Moon. Plus, with the amount of puzzles in the game, this was the first game in a long time that actually made me use my brain. Trying to find out how to tackle an objective with only but a few visual clues and combatting ghosts that get in your way; sometimes both, and sometimes even on a deadly time crunch! So much life was put into this game, and I can't wait for NLG to tackle their next big project after the somewhat meh new Mario Strikers game.. While its fairly simple and easy, its such a nice polish product that its hard not to enjoy. Lots of fun themed floors and variety. Easy recommend for anyone with a Switch.. A high 6 for me, The core gameplay and exploration is good, graphics are nice, It's quite an all rounder **** in that it does everything it tries to do well, but there's nothing that special about it. Don't see myself playing it again, but am glad I gave the series a shot.. Amazing music, great visuals, and good gameplay. I just dislike the backtracking.. A decently cozy game; however, it becomes a bit boring over time, and there’s nothing particularly special about it. The controls can also be a bit challenging at times. The graphics are nice, and there are some fun moments along the way. Overall, you can easily spend several hours on it, but it’s probably not a game I would play again.. the Story is good game,multiplayer disconnection issues, and the mini games can’t be played online. Some of the story is a little repetitive but overall nice artwork #SaveSoil. When Luigi's Mansion first appeared on the Gamecube there was a certain gritty atmosphere to the game that made it almost feel like a survival horror game. It had a spooky atmosphere and fantastic music score that could often make the game feel tense. Luigi's Mansion 3 really doesn't do anything like that. Honestly it feels like a cheap theme park haunted house ride. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a Luigi's Mansion game, just done worse. The Gooigi game mechanic doesn't make the game any better. The game is very linear. There are occasional branches, but they generally just loop back around.. The history mode is good but the multiplayer is trash and with bad perspective.. Literally everything about this game is about taking what made Luigi Mansion 1 and 2 good, mixing them together and amplifying it by 10. The game is a wonderful challenge both in puzzles and mechanics, and rarely feels unfair till the very end. The only part that actually feels unfair is the final boss, but it just doesn't stop the game from being simply amazing.. Standard game and standard gameplay without suprise. One major complain is that some of the puzzles are quite obscure and ridiculous.. Extremely lackluster at the beginning, but gets better as you go on. Fun overall.. Had fun in the first 10 hours but then there were bosses that took 2 hours becuse how the f*** should i know how to defeat them. its boring and the only good thing is the graphic, luigis mansion 2 was way better, especially the multiplayer tower thing.. I bought this game because of its amazing graphics, but found out it was a very charming, intelligent and spectacular game. Searching for collectibles and gems throughout the hotel was very fun and immersive. The enemies are very fun and different, so the game never feels repetitive. I only have one ""but"" for this game, and it was chasing the cat on two occasions, only one would have been a nice touch, but repeating the cat mechanic felt a little excessive to me. Even with the cat thing, I totally think this is a must-play game, and definetly a top 10 game in the Switch console.. I was not a fan. In LM3 the gameplay is fairly simplistic where you stun and capture ghosts like a ghostbuster, but the boss fights can be challenging and often involve some puzzle-solving. Nintendo's usual quality is on display here. There is a lot of experimentation interacting with the environment that reminded me of the Lego games. There is a good amount of creativity in the various levels, alternating between different themes and mission designs. Yet I was only mildly engaged, and it's hard to articulate why I didn't have much fun playing this game. Ultimately it is because I experienced more frustration than joy. Targeting is a bit of a pain, since you control your character's aim similar to Resident Evil 1 where you swivel your character like a turret. There is an absolutely terrible level where you are in the water on an innertube that was more frustrating than anything I experienced in Elden Ring. This is my first Luigi's Mansion game, and I have no interest in playing another.. Perfect game some of their bosses are a bit tough but I'm pretty sure that's just a skill issue on my part the levels are amazing Nintendo really put a lot of effort into making this game perfect hopefully the next one will be just as good. Great game, combat is very different to any other game i have played however it can get repetitive, Great Visuals and an alright story make this an amazing Game.. boring and monotonous. the opponents are the same, the puzzles are the same. One of the worst Nintendo exclusives. Luigi’s Mansion 3 is the most fun Nintendo game I have ever played. Every level is such a joy to walk trough. It is like unwrapping an animated Nintendo Movie with an own identity on each floor. The boss fights are challenging and until the last level the attacks of the enemies are varied. At the wnd this is a must play for young and old Nintendo players! Pros: - Level design - Boss fights - Animations Cons: - Controls are not as smooth as the combat desires sometimes - Final boss fight is not balanced compared to the rest of the game. Playing time, about 10-15h Vacuum Cleaning is fun. It has some interesting mechanics, both in the vacuum cleaner upgrades as well as other skills of Luigi. Difficulty increases after a few levels/floors, rather too hard for kids. Many puzzles are fun, but some are hard to figure out on your own, which is a bit frustrating. The controls are rather poor, which could have been done much better.. Good looking game. Good ideas and level design. Unfortunately controls and mechanics are painful. Lots of enigmas are far fetched. Some clearly felt counter intuitive. You get new mechanics at every level, until it’s too much. I have two children who love this game but sadly can’t play very well and are stuck very quick and get frustrated. These games should be made to please children, not adults.. ooh, I love this game the visuals the game plays the soundtrack and it has MULTIPLAYER the boss fights are really fun and unique. I just don't get that from 2023, 15 May 21:24,34. 87 people gave it a negative review,. Best Luigi's mansion game by far. Improves on the last one in every way. Good graphics are the cherry ontop of the amazing gameplay.. Nintendo always makes quality games and this is no exception. Everything was perfect and better than the previous games. I enjoyed it a lot when i was playing it with my family back in 2020. 10/10 for me.. For me it’s a perfect game, except one flaw. Nintendo has this problem of handling combat - most of the time is too easy. Beside that it’s terrific - riddles, ideas, mechanics, even graphics and animations are beautiful, despite low resolution visuals are just amazing. It has been my first Nintendo game it and struck me as a great piece of fun. Just get this. Really fun game. Very good looking, fun puzzles and varied and really polished levels.. This game is really creative which is where I’m allocating most of its points, along with how good it looks and the good soundtrack. Each floor of the hotel is a different theme so you’ll always encounter something different and get to interact with things in different ways which makes you think. For me it loses points because aiming is super frustrating, most of the bosses are just annoying, and fighting ghosts is repetitive and boring. But all in all it is a good game and I spent 20 hours on it so I definitely feel like I got my money’s worth and enjoyed playing it for the most part!. My rating for it is actually age of target audience of this game. Poor art style, controls. Characters is not voiced, and you don't care about them at all. The game is not interesting. Dropped it after prologue. Will sell cartridge. Only for childs or Nintendo-slaves.. This games charm shines through the level design and characters, I found catching ghosts to be while repetitive, enjoyable. My issues with this game are that the middle section drags on for way to long, the water level is one of the most unenjoyable parts of any game I've played, and that once you complete the game you cant go back into any of the levels.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done!. A great Luigi's mansion game in a hotel with amazing graphics and gameplay, with a very fun atmosphere.. This is the better way to catch ghosts. The new technology Luigi has makes this game incredibly fun! After you catch one ghost, you'll be trying to catch more and more. It has the same addictiveness the other two game has and it's done very well in many ways. Luigi even has a partner to help him out with ghosts now! Playing scare **** is the same fun as the 3DS version except with more twists! This game is pretty easy for the most part though but doesn't manage to completely throw the challenge in the garbage.. Atrocious. It was very frustrating. Also felt very cheap, not Nintendo quality. Why does Luigi talk?. The graphics are some of the best for the Switch but I found the game a bit repetitive and annoying.. The game is certainly high quality: tons of detail, looking great even in handheld mode. however I didn't find it very enjoyable: it has limited gameplay, there's not much challenge and not much replayability.. This game is a great time. The visuals are amazing. The game length is perfect for short play sessions. The combat feels like a little mini game and is fluid and fun. The environment oozes charm and loot in ridiculous density. There is so much character in all of the levels and even the backtracking is enjoyable and integrated well. The cat is sort of annoying but it was manageable. The bosses toward the end are more on the difficult side. Overall this game is a treat and was super refreshing to play and complete in around 13 hours in 2022.. There is no way to invert the y-axis. The level B2 is incredibly annoying, look it in internet, the rubber duck controls are a pain in the ass, making it to difficult for a children game.. Everything about this game is amazing. From the graphics to the addicting gameplay, I couldn’t put this game down.. I would classify it as the same category with It Takes Two. Those two games are the kind that could make you sit in front of the screen for hours and bring you only the pure happiness. No compete, no higher score, no difficult boss. The only thing matters here is to play and experience the game itself.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Luigi Mansion is an ok game. There are some drawbacks here that makes me hesitant to finish or even completing it but I manage to finish it. First, the aiming mechanic is way too bad which mostly falls onto how the control responsiveness and direction orientation(?) which I'm not able to get used to that until I finished it. Once you are against some bosses that really rely on aiming, it becomes unnecessarily harder. Second, I don't feel any needs to complete the game or even I want to do it. It's different kind of feeling with Mario Odyssey and Kirby TFL. Luigi doesn't have any clear indication of how the completion process works. Is it just gems? No, there are several things you have to do to unlock a specific achievements which not clearly presented for players. There's also no bar or percentage or even a dedicated menu to look at our achievements, which makes me feels ""for what I'm trying to explore the mansion and look for all the gems?"" There's no even ANY rewards for collecting those gems. Third and the last one, the game almost has zero guide. If you don't experience this issue, then good for you. For me, I end up feeling lost and confused a lot in the game. I don't know how to reach certain room, I don't know what I miss to progress in that level to encounter the boss and most of it I'm confused how to beat the boss. The game is not consistent with its own mechanic in the game. You introduce us that sunglasses and shield are a thing to repel flashlight so you have to create burst to knock that off from the ghost. But for the boss at floor 6, he has a shield always intact no matter what I do and you know what? He is somehow vulnerable to light while charging even thou he still has the shield while charging. How I suppose to know that? All bosses are so random and didn't stick to certain standard with the game mechanics that they introduce to you. So many trial and error in the game which should not be the case if the game creates a clear mechanics and be consistent about it.. Very good game, games like that come put once every 4 years or so, fun for kids and adults.. The best game of the luigi's mansions. It has all the good things of the games before and add more. The best!. Beautiful game Cool gameplay Fun gameplay loop Love environment Stable work Unique game. Very fun but some puzzles are a bit too hard so hard that I had to use a youtube guide to beat it but the graphics are stunning and there is the **** which is excellent but if you are ready to use your brain or use a guide then I recommend it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Luigi's Mansion has great level design, a lot of charm, and was very relaxing to play. High marks all around.. I'd like to thank Nintendo for keeping Luigi to say 'Mario', wondering where is he. My father used to find so funny that luigi quote. Unfortunatley, he passed away and I couldn't show him that voice line. Overall the fun in this game is funny and keeps similar to the previous titles. The graphics are nice in contrast with illumination and light spots from the scennery. It's a must have!. I have to say that this installation of the Luigi's Mansion franchise is pretty lackluster. While the game does offer some new interesting gameplay mechanics, and the graphics look great, the overall game is ridiculously tedious. So many times, you're forced to backtrack to levels you've already beaten, chase similar enemies multiple times and puzzles that aren't creative enough to call groundbreaking. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll get your fill here, but this is easily the weakest of the trilogy, which is such a shame since the first one is so fun and iconic.. Luigi’s Mansion 3 blew my mind away. The Switch is very behind in hardware, and yet, Luigi’s Mansion 3 pushes the Switch nearly to its breaking point. How is a modern Nintendo game this good? I’ll tell you right now. Luigi and co. are invited to a hotel which is… haunted. What do you expect? He finds a machine called the Poltergust G-00 which helps him take down the ghosts. It gets a lot better, so to avoid spoilers I’ll shut up now. The exploration system is back! You have to solve intricate puzzles with our gooey friend Guigi, who can fit in spaces Luigi can’t, but disintegrates when he touches water. Eventually you find a room filled with ghosts, which at that point you must “**** and Slam” them. It is very satisfying, and a lot of the ghosts are different, and harder to take down. The bosses are a mix of puzzles, and “**** and slamming”. It has, overall, very engaging gameplay. Some people say the controls were outdated. Personally, I don’t think so, but they are different from what you’d expect. It looks like a movie. Everything is perfect about its look, from the detail to the lighting. The locations are stellar and there is a good attention to detail. Next Level Games really did their best. The main campaign will take you up to 15 hours. There are 2 bonus modes; the **** and ScreamPark. The **** puts you in a squad with other people, and you have to clear challenges and get to the roof to fight Big Boo. There are DLC outfits that can make Luigi and ‘80s dancer or a pirate. This mode was the one I played more. ScreamPark is a collection of mini games. The DLC gives you bonus games here. You can only play it local, though. This is a top-tier Switch game. I guarantee you will love it. I say this as a joke sometimes, but here I mean it; Nintendo really delivered with this game.. I'm late to this game, it is really fun and interactive. I really love the details and integration, and responses in between the objects and movements. 5 stars. this game is so good and has so many content here. i will love always this game. This game is definitely one if not the best looking games released on Switch. Lights, shadows, colors and most of the scenes are absolutely stunning. Sometimes it’s hard to believe that Switch is capable for that level of graphics. Also the amount of details the developers put into the level’s environment is crazy huge. Another very well thought part of the game is music. It helps to develop an atmosphere which is on point. The difficulty level could be debatable, however I enjoyed the game not being too competitive. This is an adventure that let’s you relax while laying in the bed. Moreover difficulty level combined with simple mechanics creates a pretty low entrance level to the game. This allowed my non-gamer girlfriend to complete half of the game in a few days. However this also introduces another side of the medal: simple mechanics results in overall gameplay being repetitive. The fight strategies for bosses differ a little, but eventually boil down to the same move set. Also the game makes you go back a few times to the levels you cleared previously. This stretches the play time in a really weak way. Another point is that the game raises difficulty not by introducing fresh mechanics or new types of enemies, but just by raising the number of last. It makes the experience a little frustrating and you just want to finish the fight as soon as possible to progress further. For me it took around 18 hours of relaxed playing to complete 100% of the game and I would say I have enjoyed it. Definitely a must play for every Switch owner. Even though the game does not have any replay value at all, the general experience worth your time.. I’m disappointed with the overall execution of this game. Graphics are perfect and music is great. But that’s just it. Story is not bad, but not a wow factor Cutscenes are way too long and can’t be skip. Gameplay is very repetitive and clumsy. The vacuum fighting scheme becomes old pretty fast . Sound is good but sometimes it weirdly goes off. But music is excellent and joyful. Clumsy combat and bad controls. Terrible target mechanics. Terrible!! Some Puzzles are senseless and tedious. Example, the Ghost Cat at the Botanical floor and the Fitness Center, absolutely annoying. I hate this creature. Bosses are tedious and unfair because of the crazy controls. Some boss fights are incredibly frustrating, specially at the end. The game becomes and feels longer than is supposed to. I worked myself to finished it a 100% Overall is not terrible but I will not replay it completely ever.. Amazing graphics, Luigi looks straight out of a Pixar movie. Great gameplay, with some fun new mechanics like the plunger. A must buy for the Nintendo Switch.. Great fun game that can be clunky to control at times but provides a solid experience all around.. Great game! Honestly, as a stand a lone experience, I had a ton of fun in it. It's definitely better than Luigi's Mansion 2, but I don't think it quite hits the same mark as Luigi's Mansion. The type of difficulty I came to expect from the original isn't really here, but in other areas I think it outshines the original. The bosses on each level wind up being really engaging and more difficult than what the original offered. It also has a bigger emphasis on puzzles. Overall, what's offered is great, but there are times where the puzzle focus gets a little old. The ghosts in between the bosses also takes a step back from the original. The new slam mechanic (while flashy) reduces the complexity of ghost encounters. To take down ghost health, you have to spam that move and after a certain amount of health is drained, the game unlatches you from the ghost. This removes the challenge the original offered of incentivizing the player to catch ghosts in one go. That said, the boss ghosts offer more challenge and the mechanics can get quite challenging on later floors. The difficulty it offers with these boss ghosts, the puzzles, and the challenge of scrubbing the place dry for money makes the game super fun to play. It just doesn't live up to the original but is far more faithful than Luigi's Mansion 2 ever was.. this game is so good and has so many good characters and choices i love it til the end. Fun game, nice story and also good difficulty settings. Gave me some nice hours :) (but Super Mario Odyssey was still better). a chill game that you can play without using your brain after work. just keeping eating coins as u wish in real life. Luigi's Mansion 3 not only has the best graphics on the Nintendo Switch, it has wonderful gameplay and splendid humor that makes the low difficulty not matter.. A great game, especially enjoyable if you like solving puzzles. However, it's not as finely tuned as Odyssey or nearly as exciting.. Eines der langweiligsten Spiele, die ich je gespielt habe. Oder evtl. waren meine Erwartungen durchaus viel zu hoch. Ich habe das Spiel im Februar 2022 durchgespielt. Optik ist ganz schön gelungen, auch wenn die Handheld-Version deutlich schlechter aussieht. Das können durchaus andere Spiele besser. Das ganze Spiel war für mich zu repetitiv. Die Aktionen, die man ausführt. Saugen, Stampfen, wegblasen etc. machen an sich nicht wirklich Spaß. Es gab für mich auch keinen Anreiz die Bu-Hus oder auch die Edelsteine, die auf jedem Stockwerk versteckt sind zu suchen. Insgesamt war ich froh, als das Spiel vorbei war. Leider. Ich hatte mir wirklich mehr erhofft. Die Bosskämpfe waren für mich in der Regel auch langweilig gestaltet. Des ",lots of potential let down by some very un-Nintendo like gameplay and design at times. Highly overrated . clunky controls and unplayable boss fights ruined the 2nd half .
"1,024.Dance Central 3","Certificate of Masterpiece. Great game, it encourages you to have fun dancing with the Kinect, making you stay stuck in the game for hours and burning calories, the game has the best songs for you to enjoy dancing, as well as having a story mode that encourages you to dance even more, unlike Just Dance, this game has incredible characters, it would be great if this franchise continued.. It's pretty average compared to some of the other dance and fitness games out there. The song selection is a bit lame, and the graphics are pretty mediocre.. I always playing this game on my Xbox because the graphic is nice,good music and the dance move in this game is very nice but there is something I don't like is music got shortened. Still a good game to play and worth to buy,I give it 10/10.. Dance Central 1 with replaced tracks for the same full price which should have been dance central 1's DLC, thats all it is, overpriced DLC unreleased for DC1 and 2 and repackaged into DC3. Dance Central still stands as the best Kinect-based franchise to date. Dance Central 3 improves the formulas already laid and shows a little bit of something new. The franchise promises to turn those willing it invest themselves whole-heartedly into choreographic whizzes, something you might take interest in if you're into the club-scene or just like moving around with great flourish! Of course, you can't succeed in this genre without a good setlist, and Dance Central 3 gives great beats to move to (mostly). It's the DLC that makes the game feel flexible, as not everyone will love every song, thus not wanting to learn the dances. So as long as you're willing to drop a few extra dollars here and there for the songs you'd really want, you're in for a lot of fun... and some exercise, too!. I am not a dancer per say, but I did enjoy playing this game more than the others in the series. I enjoy the range of music, which is why it is getting a 7. It's like taking a part in the history of dancing music, but still needs some tweaks. I'll explain in detail on the Podcast. Hear my full review on the show, ****. it impresses as a game only because there aren't a lot Kinnect-required titles that are as fun as the Dance Central series. among the 3 Dance Central titles that Harmonix released, this one has the most number of recognizable tracks despite already having an impressive list of songs that can be exported from Dance Central 1 and 2 (including some DLC's). as an exercise tool, adjusting the difficulty of the songs to at least Medium and keeping up with the moves offers a steady cardio workout. i also noticed a Beginner difficulty in the DC3 songs that even a senior citizen can do. hard core dancers will appreciate trying to imitate the harder moves as well as creating their own moves with that ""Make Your Move"" mini-game. photo-sharing on facebook is quite limited as it only lets you pick one image, either the finishing move or snap shots from dancing freestyle with the score at the bottom. all in all, Dance Central 3 is the only reason why people should buy a Kinnect (or an Xbox 360 for that matter)... because it's well worth it.. Definitely a must-buy if you liked Dance Central 1 and 2. Improved menus, more voice commands and better voice recognition, terrific track list covering songs from the 70s through present day hits. Story mode is a welcome addition as it improves on Dance Central 2's Crew Challenge mode. Alternative outfit unlocks, secret characters, hidden modes. Lots of replay value. Dance Challenges from Dance Central's Facebook app has been added ingame as well and is another mode that will help the online social aspect further. Party Mode and 8 player Crew Throwdowns is for local multiplayer and is definitely an improvement over Dance Central 2's Dance Battles. Minigames like Strike-a-Pose and Make-a-Move are also nice additions to add to the variety in how one wants to play. If you are one of the few who have held out on buying an Xbox with Kinect, Dance Central 3 is one of the reasons you should pick one up now. Dance Central 3 showcases Kinect's capabilities in a fun and addictive way and sure to be a staple of the Kinect stable for a long time to come.. It's such a fun and addicting game for what it is. I just hope they conisder adding Bee Gee's, Abba, and Gangnam Style DLC. I also hope they'll create a character customization mode in the future. Other than that the songs are pretty good, but it's not my personal favorite. However, everyone has different musical tastes. I like how it's so diverse bringing back the classics. The Dance moves are great, and I just love this game. So, yes this is THE BEST DANCE GAME EVER!!!!","certificate of masterpiece encourages you to have fun dancing with the Kinect . the song selection is a bit lame, and the graphics are pretty mediocre . dance central 3 improves the formulas already laid and shows a little bit of something new ."
"1,025.Shatter (2009)","This is probably the best Arkanoid game I played on PS3. It takes the spirit of the original brick breaker games as a basis, but then Shatter is imaginative and well-designed on its own. Besides, it poses an interesting challenge for hardcore players, since some of the trophies are quite difficult to get.. First it was really fun, but after some level it got boring. In my opinion it is too repetitive for a normal game and too complex for a mini games. Sort of sitting between two chairs. It is not that in would be always the same thing with only changing backgrounds. There are many different special blocks (rotating, exploding, rocketing, floating…), game modes (normal, hold 3 balls as long as possible, Tetris-like survival) and different areas (rectacular, circular), but always you end up doing the same: You a paddle and attract or push away blocks (and the ball) by a weak gravitational force from the paddle. If you like doing that for hours, the game is for you. Otherwise look out for something else.. What a weird... well crafted... Okay, I'm dazzled. This game is awesome! Maybe one of the best OST ever! Don't even hesitate, this is a must have. After one hour, you'll be addicted. The gameplay is brilliant, clever... But I stop right there. For me, that's a new Tetris.. Simply love it ........................................................................................................................................... i must admit i like shatter a lot... its a great game... unfortunately its up against better games right now so i gotta backlog it... but it is great... and i love u shatter","the game takes the spirit of the original brick breaker games as a basis . it poses an interesting challenge for hardcore players, since some of the trophies are quite difficult to get . it is too repetitive for a normal game and too complex for a mini games ."
"1,026.Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn","How this game got so popular i have no idea. Its just a menu game designed for people that love nothing more than menus. The combat is repetitive and boring, this is squares dying cash cow, the company is slowly dying and this is the only thing keeping them afloat - pathetic really. As for the communities well its full of lgbt cringe and weeb cringe who have no life and clearly dont have jobs. Do yourselves a favour and go touch grass. Very, very slow start und way too many filler quests. World building is important, yes, but this game does way too much or rather, does it in a rather tiresome way in a lot of cases. The game has it's awesome parts inbetween and the final battle during ARR against the Garlean soldiers like Gaius, Nero etc. is really cool, but it takes way to long to get to the good parts. I wish they would make the leveling expierence more interesting. Apart from that, very solid start.. Recently replayed A Realm Reborn for the first time after three years. While the story is still very long-winded, you can clearly tell that there's a build up towards a greater narrative and a lot of world building going on. I recommend everyone to get through it, even though it is slow, it'll be worth it. There's no shame in skipping some stuff here and there if you really have to, so long as you keep track of the greater plot points.. I do not know where to begin. I gave this game a rating of 5 because its not great but its not terrible. This game has been a really big disappointment. I had high hopes for this FF XIV MMO for two main reasons. I really like the subscription pay model (I dont support free to play business models)that square enix uses as its legitimate and avoids all the issues that free to play games exhibit in recent years. And 2nd I had read that this game is more single player friendly then almost any other mmo available. Well both hopes were dashed. The subscription pay model while legitimate does not really raise the quality of this mmo to the standard I was expecting. I was expecting a great game but what I got was a mediocre game with mediocre writing which lead to a mediocre story. I expected much better from square enix as this pay model is much more stable then free to plays. Its also much more expensive for the end user. It didnt make since that this game could be so mediocre on soo many levels. For context, expansions cost extra $, are not cheap, and there is a monthly subscription on top of that which runs about $15 a month. That is just to play the game. Why is this all important? Because it means square enix has more funds then other developers to improve there game. In theory anyway im not sure where the moneys going but its not going into making this MMO better. I played long enough to make it to Heavensward which is the first expansion before I quit in frustration. The monotonous, tedious, repetitive questing style storytelling gets real old real quick. The characters movements and subtle gestures are all very robotic and not authentic at all. The voice acting is disingenuous, incomplete, and makes you gasp in frustration. On top of this the story and overall theme of the game seem to be made with tropes and more aimed at a immature younger audience. I can only imagine who actually stayed on board and made the game profitable. Is there any credit due to its creator? Well yes as this is an older game (2009) its engine is just as old and limits squares ability to really improve and innovate the character interactions. But there is still no excuse for this company as profitable as its been to just not do anything about it. Its even more frustrating when you realize this is a story driven mmo more so then its competitors why wouldn't they want the best character interactions. What remains is very rigid linear interactions between characters that feel more like robots and is immersion breaking. Which says nothing of the writing quality. The msq (main story quests) which drive the main story arc is where the best writing comes into play but it never really feels as good as you would like it to be or should be. It feels very much like a soap opera. Its definitely better then the generic quests which shouldn't even exist in a video game at all. And when a character dies and come s back to life somehow miraculously later in the story well that is a red flag for me. Great writing never relies on that trope. Enough about the story what about the action? Well there is action and this is the part where I say this game was not for me. I enjoy single player games. I like fun and excitement and dont really want to sit around and socialize with others when im gaming. I want to enjoy the game. To Square Enix credit this game is for some people buts its not for me. This was my 2nd disappointment that FF XIV didnt live up to. The singleplayer experience doesn't really exist. Its still tried and true mmo at its heart. Most of the dungeons, most of the action, does require you to play with other players. You can play with AI for much of the msq dungeons but it takes away from the fun. This is where the action is mostly at. But the action falls flat or is non existent. Which brings me to my point: you never really know what's going on in battles and before you know it the boss is dead. Rinse and repeat. Its not fun. To bring this to a close. There are things I wished about FF XIV would be, I wished FF XIV, 1. Had more masculinity or masculine elements. This game is heavy on the feminine elements (which I am not against). 2. I wish the theme of the game was much darker and grittier. The game is very bright and cheery even with villain cutscenes. 3. I wish the battle music made sense! Why is the battle music soo bright! 4. I wish the solo content and story were more difficult. Its soo easy you wont flinch. 5. I wish the writing made you want to like the characters. You never really feel immersed in the story. 6. I wish classes and jobs had been more immersive. Lastly the graphics are very pretty! Which is the one nice thing to say. FF Xiv is very pretty game and a lot of the music is very good but it needs to be darker and music needs to make more sense.. Do you like Final Fantasy games? Then you would probably like this one. What makes an FF game? Moogles? Primals? Chocobo? Slow story that gets better an the end inexplicably? Well it's got all that! Enough of the jokes. This is a decent restart and (according to some) retelling of 1.0. It's not really bad so much as the cut scenes are kind of long and often unnecessary for the future of the plot. They have cut out a lot of those scenes and tried to trim it down, but in some spots it is still not quite enough. The game explains some things to you, but not everything. Sometimes the things it explains are something that apply to every MMO (like bag space and quests) while leaving important side quests or how the job system works up to content creators or guides to suggest. It's still a bit of a mess, but it's not horrible. It's not as bad as a couple of the future expansions at least. It's definitely worth it if you are okay with that slow burn that Final Fantasy games typically provide. This time though that slow burn lasts quite a few expansions.. Literally a Speak to Someone Simulator, quests pre DLC are basically this, Filler after Filler.. Best MMO I've played, Respects your time, no FOMO or BS MTX. Amazing story, arguably the best in the FF series. Put 500+ Hours into this and still have EndWalker to get through. Amazing experience.. I have 900 hours in this game Please help. My favorite section of the Final Fantasy 14 story. Sure the next expansions expand a lot the world and the gameplay, but story wise A Realm Reborn it still able to hit more hard than all the other expansions, for different reasons.. This is honestly the very best MMO on the market. The community is sooooooo friendly and welcoming! This game respects your time, you barely miss out on anything when you take a break. It's so worth to get into! This is also the most expansive, feature complete free trial that you can soon play until level 70 and it includes two critically acclaimed expansions with all content for absolutely free!. Trial version up to level 70!!! It's very nice to gain skill with the quest, Story is amazing Crafting is nice. The length of the quest is sometimes boring. Music and cinematics are good.. Reviewing after 500 hours over 8 years from the perspective of a casual player who has played 1k hours of Wow (also casually). This game is amazing fun as a huge fan of games where players need to socialise and or cooperate to overcome challenges. The community is mostly quite positive and fun to interact with. There is so much freedom of how you want to play. And this isn't just in combat style either. You could just spend hours playing with friends at the in-game casino. Huge amount of hard content for those who love punishing themselves and truly working well as a team. Huge story to chew through too. If you love Final Fantasy and MMOs then I recommend giving this a try! Played on PS4, PS5 and PC. Thank you for reading. Enjoy Gaming.. I'm going to start this off by saying that when I first decided to try this game, I didn't think I was going to like it. I'm not a fan of subscription models, and I had yet to ever enjoy a single MMO before playing it. I could not have been more surprised. It's true that ARR has a slow start to it, but they had to make enough quests to fill it all the way up to level 50. Don't listen to anyone saying that it's boring, though. I enjoyed it immensely, especially all of the post ARR patches leading up to HW.. A realm reborn is a great title with tons to do and explore. A great game to enjoy with friends and there is always something to do together. FF online isn't just a game it's a community full of great players who are all fun to engage with. It's great that the devs destroyed the previous attempt at FF online and then tied it into the lore behind a realm reborn. It works really well and it's now become a mark of history. It shows that we can all make mistakes but its how we bounce back that matters. I do think it's strange how they didn't just call it Final Fantasy Online. Why the Xiv? I think level balancing for zones are annoying. Why doesn't it have a count down before restoring your level. I sometimes walk out of the zone and it stops me attacking till I select the option to sync again. The trial and game should be tied together. You pay for the game and a subscription? It's wrong to charge for a product you cannot use unless you pay monthly. Even if you have played the trial to level 60 you would still need to buy the game and subscribe to continue. Just make the game the trial. And offer the subscription when you complete the trial. I got the complete addition for half price which gave me all expansions and 30 days subscription which is a good deal. But if I had to buy a game and subscription and the expansions I probably wouldn't have continued past the trial. It just feels like so many different things to buy for 1 product. Speaking of trial I think this is a great move. Offering players an option to try the game shows they know this is a great product. Any company who is willing to give you something 1st before taking your money shows faith in a good product that they know you will wanna purchase when you try it. It's rare to see companies happy to do this because so many games get boring after the 1st couple hours. FF Online actually gets better the longer you hang around. You are constantly learning something new.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fourteenth game in the series.. I've never liked MMOs... but this one has it all. It's cheap when you account for the fact that you get the first 250 hours (or more if you do side quests) for FREE. You get to decide if you love the game enough to pay after you complete Heavensword. I've actually saved money playing this game since I buy many fewer games. Then, the graphics are great. The support for the game is great. The gameplay is the least repetitive of any MMO I've played... and chief of all, the story is phenomenal. I don't know why I wouldn't give this game a 10. There is nothing wrong here at all.. Final Fantasy XIV is a must play for all fans of MMORPGs. Especially, because it´s very beginner friendly and takes every new player by the hand. A very important point for casual players, because you can jump in and play some rounds. Graphics, gameplay and story are just on point. I can´t wait to play all the DLCs!. Everything about A Realm Reborn feels dated: graphics, animations, content, story, and so on. The music is still on par and iconic with all the other Final Fantasy games. However, comparing ARR to other MMOs, there is so much love and passion in this game that keeps evolving and improving, and when you compare it to things like WoW or GW2, come on, ARR is clearly superior in almost, if not, everything.. The best option for MMO fans today, it has a free trial that will guarantee you +100 hours of vast content, keeping the graphic quality and outstanding music of the Final Fantasy series. The game offers a dozen varied classes with different gameplays and many combo options this shows the recurrent quality in FF XIV the freedom the game leaves you free to have as many classes as you want to be possible to vary the gameplay whenever you want we are also free to increase the level our characters as we prefer doing the main side missions or world events without a mandatory path. The choice is yours on how to fill your time as the game offers several options, of course, the high point would be your main mission which has a story that gets better and better until its epic ending so and you like a badass story will have a lot to do. In addition, we have several Craft options that just as the classes do not limit you to a number, being possible to have them all, so you can participate in all stages of building your equipment or decorate your house and undertake in the game market, we even have dungeons with very varied mechanics that can be done in groups of 4 people to larger groups of 24 or 48, yielding very cool mounts and minions. As you can see no how to summarize FF XIV shortly after all the game offers you countless possibilities so if you are a fan of final fantasy or you won't find a way to have fun in the game, then enjoy the free trial and invest some time to spend a little slow start that will be worth it.. Other than slower battle system than WoW. Contents are top notch. Currently with unlimited time trial up to Lv60, this game is priceless. Lots of quality cutscenes, housing and change to any class. Just buy after you are done with the trial.. Review with the new trial: unplayable. 8 hours sunk in, haven't even gotten a fight yet. Ryzen 5950X - RTX 3090 - Connection 750-ish down 85-ish up. Not my system's issue.. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.Housing. Housing.. Before I came across Final Fantasy XIV, I had no interest in MMORPG's, but I already had amazing experiences with Final Fantasy games before, so I decided to try this game out. Long story short: this is my number 1 multiplayer video game now. I had tried out the free trial at first, and played until level 35 (which was the trial level cap at the time). For the first 10 levels, I thought the game was boring, and I had no idea why I had seen so many good reviews for it. Still, I wanted to play more, and I was holding out for the game to get better than it was early on. I'm glad I did. I leveled up more, play more story quests, did dungeons and trials and all that, and I realized how fun and interesting the game actually was. The story was easily the strongest part of this game. It felt like a roller coaster, going from generic, to interesting, to depressing and melancholy. The gameplay is also complex yet simple to understand, using the classic WoW style of abilities that you use that have different effects. The open world has various areas that are all different from each other. Eorzea as a whole is beautiful to explore, whether it's the luscious green forests of the Black Shroud, or the harsh frozen wastes of Coerthas. Even though the story is the best part of FFXIV, I just have to commend the multiplayer aspect. Running a dungeon or trial with friends was fun, and the high level raids that are available at level 50 require strategy and positioning that made beating them all the more satisfying. My only problem with this game is the monthly subscription. It costs double to play this game for a year than what it costs for PS Plus and Xbox Live for a year. Other than that, this has to be one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played. Nay, this is one of the best games I've ever played, period.. Great game with loads of activities that will keep you busy for hours on end. I would recommend taking your time on the main story because it is well written and plenty entertaining. i would recommend using a keyboard to when playing for better typing than the on screen typing. I personally play with a PS4 Control and Keyboard.. Perfect MMO in 2020. From year to year, from patch to patch, game still better. Even Base game, without expansions still get little improvments. Very cool. Over 1000 hours here and i want more and more!. Now available in it's entirety for free, along with the first expansion, the absolutely incredible Heavensward. While the base game is not as interesting as it's expansions, it sets the stage for the best Final Fantasy of the modern era. Once you reach Heavensward it is truly a gamechanger.. I tried getting into it a few times but couldn't , but this time it clicked and i like played 100 hours in a week, which i never do that anymore , the gameplay loop was very fun and the world of the game with tons of activites to get lost in and i liked the a lot the diversity of the classes and jobs oh man its like real life in there, the community is really nice too i l wanted to get into the game to join them because i liked them online thought the ffxiv fans were sweet, the story was ok it was world building type but i didn't get any feelings tbh and felt like a spectator not the protagonist im supposed to be, which is ok but i hope going forward into the dlcs i be more involved i guess. I'm convinced that this game is as good as a MMORPG can ever hope to get. Not to say it is the best MMORPG ever (which is arguable) but it is up there contending with World of Warcraft which is also a great game. FF XIV offers outstanding music that rivals other FF games, satisfying gameplay along with very unique and fun dungeons, top notch lore and passable story line that you can enjoy if you don't skip scenes. You should note that along with purchasing it, game also has a monthly subscription fee which you need to pay to keep playing.. I spend with this game more than 3000 hours. Every new expansion are better than previous one.. Amazing how this game was turned around. Tons of fun. If nothing else, worth playing the free introduction month and see if it is just as fun for you. People playing this game are very easy going.. Game is fun, but the customer support is terrible. Had a gamebreaking bug that could be fixed by a GM, instead the ""development team"" had to look over it before giving me a sub lvl30 quest item that hindered me from advancing. Going to lose at least a week of gametime for no reason, all because of the bureaucratic mess that is SE customer support.. the the startup content is lack laster. the interface managment is bad and made for pc but **** on PS4 the interface is badly adapted it adjustement with gamepad work very badly. the combat feels lazy 4 button combo. that it becomes boring the payment option is credit cards euro only the sounds are missing on important content. the mouse support that they use for managing he interface is horrendous. this is the forced start up expierence on ps 4 and the account link system feels bad as well seriosouly just play it on pc, due its bad port to PS 4 and its launcher feels like a crashing flash game and the start up quest text after 20 min became repetetively boring that it just became no read and click click click move on. compared to the PS 4 elderscrolls online version it feels like walking threw a sewer. due to this bad port. feels this game is stuck in playstation 2 era. .due to wrong curency for subscribtion its overpriced. please devs fix the issues and give the consoles version some love and make it better. and bring it into the year 2020 where the content does not feel like an uninteresting grind skip for the start up at level 1+ for pc the current system is accept able but for console it needs some needed polish and love.. This game is beautiful but is much more fun playing solo because of some toxicity within the community. As for gameplay, i just don't understand setting up a menu based rpg as a button-masher. The text-based story is compelling but for whatever reason the print is really tiny, and fighting with the absurdities of the menu will never end.. Is kind of hard to rate an MMO because my experience can be significantly different from everyone so I'm going to focus more in the ""Single player aspect"" and not the social aspect. As you may expect, ARR is a massive game with a ton of quests and jobs to do, the first hours may be overwhelming with all the menus and options and skills, etc, but once you get the gist of it its more or less easy, the control scheme its very good or at least to me felt nice, so instead of buying a keyboard and mouse for my ps4, I stuck with the controller. So let's do the bad first, the main story its at times and mostly in the first and mid half really slow, its no surprise tho' because Square needs you to take things slowly and take you at least 2 months of subscription but it can be very punishing, the thing goes more or less like this: you accept a quest in some town, you need to take care of some enemies or search for something or someone in another town, then you go to another specified point and then you go back to the requester, this procedure is going to be your best friend for at least the next 30 hours so you better like it or accept it, the main cast is serviceable at first but it develops nicely by the end (more of that later), the dungeons have interesting mechanics but are easy and slow to take, so sometimes it can be boring to do grinding. Speaking of gameplay, there is a lot of positioning and role mechanics that are very fun and interesting, also if you already have friends in XIV or want to invite new ones, the dungeon system has a syncing mechanic, so everyone can join the fight and be rewarded, so that's a good feat, obviously the thing is more fun if you have friends, but if you're a lone wolf like me you can also have some fun, because you don't need to know or speak to any other player in order to advance, it can be played as a single player. For the main quest, the boss battles are interesting and sometimes kind of challenging but never too much, so you need to wait a little to get the good of ARR, which takes to Pros of this game, the music is really good and different from one another, some boss battles are your epic fantasy stuff and others are more like rock or electronic, and everything works very well. The story goes to good with the first ending to really really good in the endgame ARR patch, which I won't spoil but serves as founding ground for the next (or after?) expansion, that ending was like a solid punch to the gut. As for the endgame, is when things get really good, you unlock new and totally cool gear, raids and hard and extreme boss battles of the bosses, the extreme battles were the ones I enjoyed the most, you need to be in full sync to your party to get things done, like a synced dance where if one **** it up, there is a big chance that you'll be killed, it maintain the stakes in the sky and gives you goosebumps when you fnally make it. It's kind of hard to sell this game to anyone since you need to invest a lot of time and money, but I think if you look for a good FF challenging experience, please look no further, this game contains one of my favorite fights and characters of the entire franchise, it can be that good.. A bad port from PC to console. The UI is clearly meant for M+KB, and playing with controller is a nightmare. The quests are run of the mill, so is the combat. Nothing to write home about other than it being a final fantasy game.. It's an MMORPG on your PS4, a premium, massive MMORPG, with outstanding graphics, endless content, lots of classes to play, thousands of players to interact with, fully compatible with keyboard and mouse, with cross play with PC users and 4K, higher resolution and graphics on the PS4 Pro, constant updates with new content. Please, get this game and enjoy it as much as possible, there is no better game in the PS4 at the moment. Simply, there is not. There is a 11-14 usd fee, but you don't have to pay PSPlus. It's absolutely worth it. Really.. Too much Fedex between the good parts. I stopped caring about the story pretty quickly and of the three months I've got to play, I did 120 hours which were mostly a chore with a few nice dungeons in between. Every time I think I'll play a bit with friends, I find something else to do : washing the dishes, taking a nap, playing a game that is challenging interesting and fun, ... I've been told it will be better once I'm level 70 ... but i doubt it's worth the pain going there.. game designed specifically to be a colossal waste of time character expressions that give you goosebumps weak story and characters boring skills system stay away...there are better games to things to do your time. A great MMO RPG that gets completly destroyed by the last (or one of the last) quest of the game. While u want to watch the story the other players which are many levels above u rush it and u wont fight for a whole hour (its realy around a whole hour) and the end gets completly destroyed. ty square enix for the worst quest of the game.. Final Fantasy 14 is a really beautiful game. Yoshi-P and his team did an amazing job at reviving the game, across the board it is by far the best mmo out on the market with an amazing online community. Dull start at first, but stick it out and you're in for an amazing experience. Well worth the subscription. Story 10/10 Graphics 10/10 Combat 10/10 Endgame 10/10 Music 10/10 replay ability 10/10 open world 10/10. This is a very good MMO RPG for consoles, it's even better if your a Final Fantasy fan. I didn't think they would be able to make it work on a console but they surprised me with this. Well worth a purchase on PS4.. There are a number of things that hold this otherwise fantastic MMO back from being what it should be. What this game shows is that there's a lot of untapped potential that can only be fully witnessed if one is willing to jump into the excellent expansion for this game. With a myriad of truly unforgivable bugs at launch (which I did not have the misfortune of experiencing but have heard legends of) and a sloppy presentation in the story, there's too many missteps to ignore. Knowing all of these things, is this a bad game? The answer is a resounding no. The graphics are gorgeous for an MMO and the areas keep you wide eyed and give you that sense of awe which is so appropriate to games like this. The gameplay is standard fair for an MMO which is no small feat but does nothing to differentiate itself too much from the pack. There's always something to do here and it's easy to lose yourself in this world, which is what MMOs do best. But the biggest flaw in this experience as it currently stands is in the story presentation and the voice acting. You will often find yourself doing menial, uninteresting tasks just to get to the next bit of interesting content or to the next story point. While this is not unheard of in MMOs it does stick out since the story itself, until the end at least, is not particularly compelling. This lack of depth can be attributed to some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. There are so many moments where I got invested into the story only to find myself laughing uncontrollably to the horribly bad acting in some of the most important story moments. These moments ripped me clean out of the world, broke my immersion and reminded me that I'm playing a video game. This is not why somebody plays an MMO. MMOs are designed to get lost in and when the game takes you right out of the world it's a fairly big disappointment. Now that the expansion has come out, people in the community laugh and look upon these earlier, cringy moments with endeared affection. But if one were to experience this game without the expansion or anything to look forward to after ARR, then the flaws could leave one feeling a little disappointed. If you do happen to pick up this MMO, power through the base game to get to the expansion and enjoy the game for what it gets right. The atmosphere, the mechanics and the positive community that it puts a lot of effort into maintaining. Underneath it all, FFXIV is an amazing game that I've put, literally, thousands of hours into and wont stop soon as the new expansion looms on the horizon just a few months away. Just be prepared to skip a lot of dialogue and cut-scenes as you go through the story missions. Trust me, you will be eventually if you play this long enough. But if you want to get lost in a beautifully rendered world based on Final Fantasy, then this is the MMO for you, flaws and all.. Learning from the mistakes of the original version, FFXIV: A Realm Reborn has become quite possibly the best MMO in existence, there is a lot of content, the soundtrack is phenomenal, memorable characters are plentiful, my only criticism would be the controls take some getting used to and on occasion some quests feel like filler asking you to run errands when you would prefer to progress the story, despite these the game is a masterpiece and well worth buying.. By far One of the top 5 MMORPG's of all time. For those who care my MMO history I started on EQ, and have been playing a new title every month or two since. For those looking for WoW GO AWAY. This game is not for you. With a job system not class system one character can literally do multiple ""classes"" (big props to FF XI for doing that in the MMO World. and Tactics for introducing it) Strong gameplay and a decent world make this game extremely playable.. THE TWO BEST things about this game: ** (1) the variety of scenery. It looks great, it sounds great, it's highly immersive as a result and progression means unlocking more of the theme park. ** (2) FFXIV rewards and enables cooperative play far better than many MMOs. ** THE TWO WORST things are: ** (1) the PvP is a toy: there is no impact on world state, so there is no player-driven storyline. ** (2) the market is as rudimentary as you can get, supporting only global sell orders with instant delivery. You can make money gathering/crafting/trading, but forget about any economic sophistication: being a merchant isn't a first-class role. ** THE MOST CHALLENGING thing about this game is the sheer number of game mechanics and things to do and learn. However the game is pretty good at helping you keep track. ** THE MOST PECULIAR thing is the sporadic voice acting. A handful of key cut-scenes in the main storyline have voice acting, everything else is a silent mime.. Im going to keep this short and **** 14 A Realm Reborn is by far the best console experience on the markt today.Dont be scared away by the negative reviews which all mention lag or bad ","the combat is repetitive and boring, this is squares dying cash cow, the company is slowly dying and this is the only thing keeping them afloat - pathetic really . i gave this game a rating of 5 because its not great but its not terrible ."
"1,027.Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon","Graphics 7/10 Difficulty 5/10 World Design 8/10 Level Design 7/10 Fun 9/10 Nostalgia 10/10 Playtime 8/10 Extras/Collectibles 8/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I got my 3DS a decade ago from a family friend with two games on it. The first game I ever bought for it? This. I think this may be my legitimate favourite game of all time.. My second-favorite Luigi game of all time. I replay it every year around Halloween.. Luigi's Mansion 2 is clearly a must-have for the 2010s, successfully improving on the gameplay of the first instalment while still delivering an enjoyable adventure. Luigi is extremely expressive and funny. You almost feel sorry for Luigi, who has been given the difficult task of saving the world and repairing the Dark Moon. All in all, an excellent game.. This is just such a great game. The game has awesome new and easy to understand mechanics, as well as being a good sequel to an amazing first entry. My only con is the different mansions thing. It kinda takes out the whole mansion ordeal for me. It wouldve been better if it was like the first Luigi's Mansion; Just a big mansion for you to explore. But I can't blame them for doing this. I mean, it IS a sequel, so it has to have something to make it more different than the first one. One final thing, I love the replay value this game has. You can hop on in any mission at any time, and you probably will never get bored of it! There's also the tower multiplayer, which is a great mode for friends to play on. In the end, I just really love this game for what it is. And it was my first luigi's Mansion! And I'll always will love it.. This game is really good! Its just oozing with personality, and brings some awesome new ideas to the table, I'd definitely recommend checking this out if you have a 3DS.. I find it much more entertaining than the HD version, dark and poorly detailed settings make it my favourite. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Boo voices is regular here. Just i missed its Super Mario 64 voices. Story and characters is fine. Compared to its predecessor, there's a substantial enhancement in visuals, and in terms of gameplay, it stands strong, not yielding to the subsequent sequels. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is an exceptionally delightful ghost-hunting adventure.. One my favourite games of all time. Pretty nostalgic to me. Good story, great dificulty, and charm. Must play!. + Different Mansions provide different atmospheres+ Standard enemies now have more personality+ Luigi's personality shines better in Dark Moon- Boss enemies feel repeatitive- level / mission based system ruins the magic the original set- Game constantly interrupts levels to bother you with information you can access on your own.- No special ghost(s) or puzzles with said ghost(s)- ""powered up"" enemies just feel like padding having to wait for their weakness to show- Game focuses on missions rather than exploration. This is literallyall my childhood. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Music is pretty good, gameplay is decent, art and animation is great. Overall a pretty good and fun experience. Definitely recommend it.. So the level design in this game is amazing. The variety of mansions was also very good as well. All of the dungeons are equally amazing but the best one might be the final mansion. The bosses at the end are all very well designed as well. My favourite one is the ice boss where you down a hole and have to shoot the ice off the ghost. The combat was very basic and did get somewhat tedious near the end but was still alright. The variety of ghosts was also nice especially when they started holding different items or were in a mummy costume. Overall very fun game.. Replaying this almost 10 years later just reminds me how iconic Luigi truly is in the Mario universe. The animations are stellar, the controls work so well and its such a good follow up to the original gamecube game. My only gripe with this game is how Nintendo changed the original Ghost models and made their own unique design with them in this game. This is annoying to me because the original Luigis Mansion ghosts looked like dead Mario characters which is part of what made it special. Other than that, its so good and would recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While the gameplay does drag on sometimes, this game is still a great experience. All 5 mansions are unique and there's a little secret that the letter than each mansions starts with when all the letters put together , spells out, ""ghost"". The music is strangely good, the gem collecting is cool and fun. The mission structure works, though I wish it could have been more open like the original on the game cube. The story is cool and the calls to Luigi from professor E-gad coming through an old ds lite is a pretty cool detail. The multi player is a blast and the tower side missions are fun. The ghost differentiation is cool as well. 9.5 out of 10.. I like it, I like it a lot but... Who did decide to delete the exploration to make levels? A deception. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Luigi Mansion 2 (Dark Moon) is in my opinion one of the best dp 3DS games and for me it's the best game I've ever played in my entire life This Game is extremely special to me since I played it for the first time in 2017 and until the year 2022 it continues with the same note and it is one of my favorite games of all time and even with a lot of good game I think neither Super Mario 3D Land surpassed it and it has a score of 94, Luigi Mansion Dark Moon It marked me a lot with those beautiful graphics that still impress me, I really wanted to bring this game on my Youtube channel but unfortunately I couldn't Continuing the graphics is beautiful, the soundtrack is incredibly good to listen to, the missions despite being some are annoying and big but some are very good, the duration is too good and the story is a little strange but good Luigi Mansion takes the highest score of 99 and as one of the best games of all time. I have played LM3 a couple of years ago then moved into LM2. I feel this entry was weaker of the two games. On a positive note, I am impressed with the graphics delivered on the 3DS. The animations is great and the detail is great. I like how every room has a little bonus to find in a variety of ways. I also really enjoyed there is a variety of mansions each as diverse as the other. Boss battles are varied and interesting The main objection that makes it the weakest LM game is the gameplay structure. Prof. E Gadd seems to call you too often which is quite annoying. The mission structure takes away the immersion as you can constantly pulled out when you explore. Sure the mission structure helps in the plot but sadly the constant interruption from E Gadd as well as being taken out of the stage/mansion can be annoying as you want to continue. I found the music is good but there is a very limited number of tracks repeatedly played. I enjoyed the mechanics, the controls are tight and the game never overstayed it's welcome taking about 15 hours to finish. I recommend for a different take on the formula of LM1 and 3 even though it is not the strongest entry.. Mediocre design if compared to its peers in the franchise in my opinion. Still a solid game overall though.. As a child I loved this game so much, It was presented with the Nintendo 3DS XL, it’s sad that I recently sold the console and lost the cartridge. This game looked great, the game was 9-11 long from which I was shocked in a good sense, I love Luigi's Mansion 2 because of the atmosphere. If the third part will be the same as the second (I'm talking about the atmosphere), I will be frustrated, and unfortunately, I will not be able to play this game anymore, on the emulator the game works bad, if this game is ported to Nintendo Switch I'll scream at the whole house. Thank you Luigi's Mansion 2 for nostalgic feelings :). One of the most captivating titles on the 3DS! Despite the original feeling much more sinister and nailing that eerie vibe, in terms of gameplay, puzzles and even the music, I can definitively say that Dark Moon is my favourite!. My favorite game of all time, so I don't think I can write a neutral review on it. I will try anyway. The game invites the player with an incredible atmosphere and great video sequences and immediately casts a spell. The increase in difficulty over the course of the game is also incredibly well implemented. The puzzles and the ghosts get more difficult from villa to villa, the story comes to a head. The story is of course not a masterpiece, but it is very suitable for what the game is supposed to be. Each ""villa"" also has its own story, the collectables are never become too many and you can see that much time has been taken for the locations, every single detail is suitable. Plus, each location has its own soundtrack ... the game's overall soundtrack is incredibly good and adds to the atmosphere. The online / multiplayer mode is also great. You can play locally with up to four players and only need one cartridge. You can also play online with up to four players. The game is highly recommended for everyone.. 81% I think this game took way too long to make. It’s a lot of fun but not as good as the first I think.. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is well rounded games with a unique reimagining of the original game. It has both pros and cons that may vary depending on the audience. There is a lack in the variety of ghosts and adversaries in comparison with it's predecessor. However, in a vacuum, this game is still well rounded, fun, and challenging. Being on the 3DS it maximizes it's capabilities and brings in features not available from the beloved GameCube trailblazer. It is one of the only games I really love to play in 3D. With the color palette and great sprites it really pops and shines in 3D. The use of gyros with the 3DS is just a sprinkle of flavor to add to a perfect recipe for the second Luigi's Mansion title. Just like salt, too much can ruin a dish, just enough brightens the flavor. The stages in different mansions makes for shorter play times and not sprawling areas to explore like in the first title. Does this take away from the game on its own, it doesn't. It may not match the recipe of the first game, but mobile platform for on the go play in short bursts of time, it satisfies the appitite. This is how I play it, on the go, in short bursts. I continue to come back every crack of time for just a few more ghost and puzzles. This leads to puzzles and gameplay. The puzzles are not too challenging but not always that simple. Using all your tools and abilities and noticing little items that catch your eye will often gain you a silver two star rating at the end of the stage. Controls and game play don't differ too much from the previous game. Simple and elegant, don't fix what is not broken. In conclusion, I find this to be a great title, reasonably priced at both retail and used markets. This is not a direct sequel for those expecting an exact cookie cutter image of the first game, but instead, a game that makes a mobile experience fun and challenging. A solid addition to any game library. If you have one game in your library and it's the GameCube Luigi's Mansion and you look to add a second game expecting greatness and a continuation exactly where you left off, this isn't going to bring that expectation. This will bring fun puzzles and game play to a pocket near you. Mabuhay! Pixel Pino #pixelpino. i really wanted to like this game more than I did, but the mission structure really brings the whole experience down. it's still good, but not as good as the original or luigi's mansion 3. Nice second opus, the gameplay is wider than the first opus, the global ambiance is still fun and we have a nice level design. Though, the choice to make a progression via a succession of level rather than a metroidvania scheme is an error for me. Nice game overall though.. Whilst still a really fun time, Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon lacks the atmosphere and feels like a step back from the original. This is basically a fishing game that set in different fun environment, my only complain is that the toad may get stuck in some place in the game, and it takes long time for game to reset the toad's position, I almost restart my 3DS one time thinking the game is stuck for good.. Not a bad game. But it doesnt want you to play it. Exploration is fun, but there really isnt much to get into ~ because you'll revisit the same areas A LOT. The enemies arent... well, they really arent good. You have, basically.. a very short tutorial to teach you what you already know. Catch the ghost. But you'll have to chase him or look in every place to find him. Again. The game has a horrible habit of throwing really easy enemies at you in succession. If you dont get the guy trapped within a 'soft window' of so many seconds, the next one will float over to you and 'tap' you. You'll lose the ghost and have to get back into the flow / the timing / see what pattern they're using now that you took out two of 'em / good lord this game makes you HURRY UP AND WAIT. And JUST when youre actually enjoying yourself, Professor calls you up on your 3ds-within-a-3ds. This wouldnt be bad if: 1. He wasnt so annoying 2. You turned the sound up to hear the audio cues, but BOOM ringtone city when he calls 3. HE ****. 4. The game really doesnt understand that a jump scare ringtone totally ruins the atmosphere. I was walking down the hall, taking my time, watching my back... actually kinda spooked and then BAM THE GAME RUINS THE PACING! Professor **** loves to overexplain and make dad-joke-tier pun, and laugh at luigi. 5. You didnt put yourself in this situation, and the professor constantly laughs at you. If it wasnt for teh game stopping itself, the bad pacing and TONS of repetition.. this would actually be great. It would be like the first game: Just explore. Capture. Enjoy. As it stands, I really cant tell you how old it gets to retread the same areas with even more interruptions.. For me the visuals just don't cut it, the lighting is super flat and the environments fail to capture the vibe of the first game. I find most of the tracks in the game to be boring after a few minutes, but the sound design is definitely serviceable. The mission structure restricts any use of creative level design and ruins exploration, plus pulterpup is a menace in all the wrong ways. The ghost capturing is now super dumbed down and not fun at times. The story feels a lot more in your face and not in a good way, and it just doesn't have the same unique vibe the original had. Towards the end of the game the frame rate tanks making the game even less fun. Overall i'd say this game is mediocre at best and cannot recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the original, even if your not, it isn't that great.. Almost as good as the first one. This sequel is a must have title for the 3ds. 3d effect is beautiful. Game is difficult... specially final stages. but is a joy to go trough. the world variety is nice but is kinda annoying you are pulled out the level every time yo reach the objective. instead of you deciding when to leave and keep finding crystals and boos. thats my only complaint.. The year of Luigi gets it's long awaited finale with the second Luigi's mansion game. it's good, not great but good. The story (although you are saving just Mario again) is quite good, the game would have been a lot shorter had they not divided the levels into sections, but the separate mansions are all unique and interesting. The bosses are so underwhelming though, I didn't like a single boss until Secret mine, the second to last level in the game. The gem collecting is a fun little side quest but not enough to make me truly like this game. It's worth playing at a low price, but isn't amazing.. This game is a fantastic game for what it is meant to be. The areas have their own feeling that makes it original. This game was a fantastic sequel to the first one and improved a lot.. He is MY MAN, Linguini. That's all I have to say about this MASTERPIECE ****. 10.. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is nothing less than an absolute triumph for Nintendo. Everything about it from its glorious visuals right through to its in-depth, incredibly fun gameplay just oozes high quality. It almost begs the question why this game wasn’t developed for Wii U; it's a home console quality experience and proof that on its day the 3DS can deliver above and beyond its competitors. The multiplayer mode is slightly disappointing, if only because it could have been much more, and the control setup is a tad awkward in places. Nevertheless, don't let these minor **** stop you from enjoying everything else that Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon has to offer; namely its superb single-player adventure. It's one of the best games yet for 3DS, and evidence that 2013 is very much the ""Year of Luigi"".. Worthy Sequel This is a decent Transformers sequel, oh wait, wrong Dark Moon, This is a terrific and worthy sequel to the 2001 GameCube Classic.. this was a highly anticipated sequel for many gamers who loved the first one on Gamecube. some of the first things you notice playing the game, are it's impressive visuals. they look really nice with lots of detail and some excellent lighting effects. this game is easily on of the most impressive-looking on the system. there are some downsides in my opinion however, and they affect the gameplay to the point that they unfortunately drag the whole experience down a bit. the first game was much more about exploration, and you could more freely explore the Mansion at your own pace, while this game is much more based on a mission-structure, where you'll constantly be brought back to Prof. E.Gadd each time you perform a task. that unfortunately creates a more restricted kind of gameplay, and is also a bit annoying. but overall, the game is quite fun and you'll be amazed at some of it's clever puzzles, challenging boss-fights, and excellent visuals. in my opinion, not as good as the first game, but a really fun experience nonetheless..

For those of you who love the original ""Luigi's Mansion"" on the GameCube, or for anyone who has just picked up a 3DS, you're all going to love this charming, action-packed adventure game. The story takes place in a world called Evershade Valley, where thanks to a powerful gem called the Dark Moon, the ghosts are peaceful and calm there. However, a mysterious villain has **** the Dark moon, causing the ghosts to become hostile and aggressive. The old professor who lives there, Professor Elvin Gadd, run away to his bunker after the ghosts went mad and called a ghost catching specialist you all know: Luigi! Equipped with his new ghost-catching vacuum, the Poltergust 5000, Luigi sets out to recollect the pieces to the Dark Moon and restore order to Evershade Valley. That's just the story, now for the gameplay: Anyone's who's played the first ""Luigi's Mansion"" will know that Luigi must explore the mansion and clear the rooms of ghosts. ""Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon"" expands the list of tasks needed to be done by separating the games into levels (which means you won't be able to explore the mansion freely), but this isn't entirely a bad thing like most people claim it is. By making separate levels, each mansion feels like it's own story, again, rising the stakes of the main story. Catching ghosts is even more fun the last game, as the Poltergust 5000 has a new feature called the Power Surge, which a bar that when filled to a certain amount, Luigi can **** up a large chunk of the ghost's health. This makes it easier to catch ghosts who have a ton of HP. The Poltergust 5000 also features another new feature called the Dark-Light Device, which allows the player to see invisible objects to solve puzzles and find hidden passageways. The game makes great use of using Luigi's new tools without one feeling left out nor over-used. The game also contains more cut-scenes than the previous entry, and all of them are entertaining and hilarious to watch, so replaying missions makes it worth it to watch gut-busting action from the ghosts and Luigi. Aside from the Dark Moon Quest, the game has a fun multiplayer mode called the ****. Team up with 3 other Luigis online or locally to catch ghosts together and make it to the top! It's not only a lot of fun but it also sharpens your ghost-catching skills for the Dark Moon Quest. Overall, ""Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon"" is not only an excellent sequel, but it's also an amazing game in general. It's got to be the best game on the 3DS on my list, and I recommend this game to anyone who owns a 3DS and loves hilarious action-adventures!. For the worse or the best, I didn't play the original LM so I don't have that background, that being said, I struggled a lot with this game, not because it's hard but because it can be so annoying in several ways, first of all, I think it reuses a lot of its mechanics way too often, like you have to get to point A to point B see that you need or have been stolen an item which is now in point A, finish the level, then start a new level and repeat, sure you have several ""mansions"" but as this repeats a lot, by the third mansion you are kind of annoyed. It also doesn't' help that every mansion has this mission to track down a dog that stole something important, so you have to re-do the level from start to finish again. Another thing that bothered me a lot were the puzzles, some of them are really clever but a lot of them are very clumsy made, also I don't know if some of them have bugs or else but I was often trapped in them because sometimes they didn't register the correct solution so I ended doing wrong things. As for the boss fights, the first one was nice but after that, every single one of them has a really irritating element to it, like using a target mechanic that is broken or luck dependant and (surprise) being repetitive, the major offenders of those things were the snow boss and the last boss, god damn. As for the good things, the game looks beautiful and the atmosphere is great, and as I said before, there are really clever puzzles and some fun things too, but in the end, the negative aspects felt way too heavy and manage to outshine the good ones a lot. I think its episode nature (being a portable game) hurts it a lot, if it was you wandering around the mansions Resident Evil style I think the experience wouldn't be or feel so scripted and repetitive.. Luigi’s Mansion 2 might be a sequel, but it’s one that shows Nintendo at its inventive best. It’s an essential game in the 3DS’ increasingly impressive line-up, and though I sometimes wished that it would leave me alone to explore more at my own pace, it’s otherwise difficult to fault a game this detailed, absorbing and masterfully made.. toad gets stuck on ice level. actually toad in general is just buggy as hell.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply put, a fantastic adventure game. I has a lot of personality, the main story is fairly long, and the environments have a lot of secrets to discover. There's also a multiplayer mode that can be quite addicting. If you like adventure games and have a 3DS, I strongly recommend buying Luigi's Mansion 2.. So great. this new take on luigi's mansion is really refreshing. The multiplayer is great and addicting. I truly had a blast playing and watching Luigi's personality was so fun there's just something charming about it. While I consider the gamecube original superior, this is a good sequel it that found ways to differ a lot, but still being fun to complete all the missions.. Certainly not as good as I expected. The missions are sometimes a bit repetitive, and the controls are a bit... frustrating at times. Also I noticed my circle-pad is more stiff after having played this game. The music is okay, and some missions are pretty fun, so... I think it is despite the flaws a decent game. Graphically it looks very good, too. Of course the goofyness of this game is something to be enjoyed as well.. The original luigi's mansion was one and still is one of my favorite games of all time, the game manages to master controls, graphics, and atmosphere so well. I don't know if any other game will replicate the scared feelings I had for this when I was a little kid. The original game was actually scary and each ghost had a specific look and creepy backstory. This game however, did the exact opposite. They made the ghosts' look like charlie brown sheet ghost and didn't allow for any small details that makes them stand out. The ghost just seem like blobs and the levels just feel boring and uninspired. The controls aren't bad and the multiplayer is fun but the singleplayer is nothing short of dull.. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a fun sequel to a fantastic game, that transferred well into a handheld game. While the transfer to handheld is smooth Dark Moon feels much less immersive than its predecessor, adding to the stale mansions and sadly Dark Moon doesn't live up to the standards set by the original. Luigi's Mansion took place in one single mansion, however; the mansion had character. The location was really well done each room felt like it had something new to offer, and it felt much more open then the areas in Dark Moon. The missions make Dark Moon somewhat of a bore because it creates a linear feeling that Luigi's Mansion gracefully avoided. The exploration in Luigi's mansion felt much more atmospheric and the ghosts designs were much better. Boss ghosts had a bit of unique character and some type of specific way to take them down. The ghost in Dark Moon just feels like they lack the same amount of character as the original games ghosts. One thing Dark Moon definitely does improve on is its difficulty. While Dark Moon is not an overly difficult game it adds a slight amount more difficulty then its predecessor which was too easy for most players. Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is by know means a bad sequel, it's still a quite fun game but compared to the original the game just feels like it substituted difficulty for a less atmospheric and immersive game. Cons Game doesn't feel as immersive as the original Ghost lack same amount of character as the original Exploration of the three mansions feels too linear, and exploration feels less open.. Only thing I didn't like is mission base structure and the last mansion wasn't really special. Overall great game, with best 3ds graphics and attenion to detail.. In all honesty this game is not as good as the original, That doesn't necessarily make it bad. This game has nice graphics and a good multiplayer mode in the ""****"" but it still falls short. The bosses are dumb and confusing and while the game is longer than the original it doesn't make it better. The saying the originals are always better apply's here very well. If you want to have some Luigi's Mansion fun with your friends then pick up this game, that's all its good for.. This game is probably the best Mario-themed game released since 2010's Super Mario Galaxy 2 (after which the franchise started its decline). In this game you control the younger and overshadowed brother of Mario, Luigi, through several haunted mansions in order to restore the Dark Moon and return peace to Evershade Valley. This game has very interesting mansion designs, and you will always find new hidden collectibles (gold, gems, boos) in every single mission. This game also has a decent sense of humor (but not to the levels of Kid Icarus), decent graphics for a 3DS game, very precise controls, good multiplayer and some surprise scaring moments. But it also has a very low difficulty most of the time, the music is very forgettable, getting gold becomes pointless once you get all the upgrades, when you die you restart the missions (which are very long), the story is weak and the Polterpup missions are a pain. But Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon's flaws are not enough to keep me from giving it a 9/10, since it's a very enjoyable experience.. Giving Luigi the spotlight was a great idea, this game is charming, and really fun to play, the story mode as well as the online mode. This was a much needed a sequel, and Nintendo have made an excellent job with this game, the best 3DS game for me.. Really enjoyable game for 3DS. The level design and the gameplay is satisfying and the difficulty is just as it should be. The game takes about 10-15 hours but you can dedicate more time for collectibles. I'd like a little bit more variety in levels (it´s only 4 worlds and al mission of each word take place on the same map). A must have/play in the 3DS catalogue.. I don't understand why this game doesn't have perfect reviews. This is by far the best 3ds game and features Luigi, who doesn't, love Luigi? The ghost hunting is extremely fun and varied. There are 5 mansions this time and they are all excellent. The boss fights (especially the final boss) are amazing. This is one of the 3ds gems. If you own a 3ds and don't have this game yet, you must have it.. One of the best games for the 3DS, with a really nice gameplay and graphics. I found very original the way you use the vacuum cleaner (aka Poltergust 5000) for everything from catching ghosts to solve puzzles by moving steering wheels and propellers, inflate balloons.. etc. I have spent around 10 hours to complete the main missions but the game is replayable for some more hours in order to catch all the hidden Boo's and unlock extra missions. The online mode is funny but a bit repetitive after playing it for a few times.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gameplay: Luigi's Mansion's gameplay transitioned beautifully to the 3DS, where it's gameplay and control scheme are perfectly suited for this system. Gameplay consists of using the poltergust-5000 to **** up ghosts and clear different areas of poltergeists. Carefully inspecting the environment to find hiding ghosts is a key element in this game. Puzzles are also present throughout the campaign and it can become challenging from time to time. However, boss battles were disappointingly easy and provided little challenge. The ****, the multiplayer aspect of Luigi's Mansion, requires teamwork with others online. There's a small variation between the different game modes and they can be customized with floor amount and even difficulty. It provides extra playability once the story mode has been completed. Story: Luigi's Mansion takes place in various locations within Evershade Valley. King Boo has destroyed and stolen the Dark Moon and scattered the pieces in different locations. With the Dark Moon gone, all the ghosts have become dangerous and aggressive! It is up to Luigi to find the pieces and restore peace to Evershade Valley! Graphics: The art direction of Luigi's Mansion should be applauded for their use of different color schemes. Dark rooms with dark color schemes indicates the presence of ghosts while empty rooms are bright and full of color. The use of 3D also adds immersion to the game and shows how 3",i got my 3DS a decade ago from a family friend with two games on it . i think this may be my legitimate favourite game of all time . the game has awesome new and easy to understand mechanics .
"1,028.DJ Hero 2","A masterpiece of a rhythm game. I thought Rock Band and Guitar Hero was the **** until I tried this.. To me, DJ hero 2 was decent yet the replay-ability is just not realistic without the continued purchase of new tracks. It is fun for a group of non gamers to pass around for an hour while drinking among a party but I can honestly say i've taken this game out of the cabinet only 4 times, and one of those times was to control a dvd menu with the turntable because I couldn't find my controller. Not to mention nobody will buy this game for resale so i'm stuck with brief memories and an awkward remote control that kills batteries.. This game is simply amazing. I do think the actual graphics menu and stuff was not really as artistic has the Dj Hero 1 one, but that's a minor detail. The music on this game is simply amazing for most of the tracks, I love the minor story add they did and I love some of the new versus modes they came up with. I'm so glad i pre-ordered this game and i love playing it.. it is better in every way from the first game, the one bone i have to pick is the tracklist us much more mainstream than the first, personally this is a downer for me, and the fact they dont feature as many real djs like in the last game. but still its awesome!. I totally agree with what Moss4life says. DJ Hero 2 is great, but the only thing it's missing is the classic oldskool hits from the original. I think the boss battles and megamixes added are incrediable and the graphics have a bit more shine to them than the original. Don't think I'm ever going to touch the ""sing-a-long"" microphone option though so Freestyle feel free to drop it off of DJ hero 3. If you have the original def by this now (Best song. 1st Megamix with Informer vs ABC) please please dont ever make the sequel 3D either!!. This game is leaps and bounds better than the first DJ Hero. I loved the first DJ hero because it was a breath of fresh air in the music genre, and DJH2 does not fail to disappoint. With the new added features of the freestyle scratches, cross-fading sections, it adds to the familiar solid gameplay that was so solid in the first one. Are there areas of improvement? Yes. The empire mode could have better, the experience could feel more like you are an actual DJ playing in new areas. It still feels like all they did was change the club, the experience of being a DJ feels lost. Another thing I that was lost from the first was the use of older rock songs. In DJH2 it mainly consists of rap and pop songs, which is not a bad thing I wish they would have had more rock songs mixed with pop songs. All in all this game is what the music genre needs. After DJ Hero 1 came out and shocked everyone by how fresh the gameplay was, DJ Hero 2 did not fail to live up to expectations, and far surpassed my expectations, and I cannot wait till the next one so it can improve on the few short comings that DJ Hero 2 has.",DJ hero 2 is a masterpiece of a rhythm game . the replay-ability is just not realistic without the continued purchase of new tracks . the music on this game is simply amazing for most of the tracks .
"1,029.Dragon's Dogma 2","The concept of open world action where you can choose your own combat type was interesting and exciting.However, compared to recent games, I feel that there are many aspects that are lacking.There are few means of transportation, and fast travel requires rare items, which I must say is inconvenient for an open-world **** important means of attacking the dragons became all about clinging on to them, and there were many times when it felt monotonous.. 50 hours in to the game. The story, characters and dialogues are sub par at best. Capcom put little to no effort in script writing and voice actors. The combat is repetitive, though fun and on occasion epic, but partly imported from Monster Hunter, so little effort in development. The quest progressions are often non-intuitive and straight up tedious. They’ll have you googling every other time and walking across the world back and forth one time too many. Since fast travel is very limited, I’ve spend many hour long travels for 1 sentence of dialogue in the lines of ”come see me where you just came from”. Most of the budget seem to have went into the pawn system and character creation, both of which are great. But, the game is in many aspects not more advanced than TES:Oblivion, which came out 18 years earlier. The core game is similar to small studio projects like Mount & Blade in jankness and inconsistency. Still, the game is like a low-budget movie that is so bad that you can live with most of the flaws. I just don’t see why anyone would put 10/10, besides the ones who feel obligated to justify their purchase.. Loved the first Dragon's Dogma, absolutely despise this one sadly. Graphics looks washed out and ugly on PS5, combat feels clunky, story is just weird and cringy. They should have gone for quality over quantity.. The story of Dragons Dogma 2 probably can't be beaten in terms of genericness. Every stereotype of a historical hero is served and everything is very predictable. I love the pawn-system though. It's really innovative and something completely different. The open world is also interesting and is beautifully designed. I had a lot of fun with the game.. This game is so weird to me. The story is mid like no other, literally the most basic low hanging fruit character lines ever, would skin every time however the gameplay was actually really fun! I love how the mage feels in this game,I dont think ive ever played a mage class that feels so mage-like and original! Will definitely be playing this again and again and some more. Dragons Dogma is an average RPG in my opinion. The story is predictable and the classic „world saver“ story. However the world design and the gameplay itself are a lot of fun and the pawn system is really something different. I don't regret playing it. One of a kind, no replacement of this genre. Only problem is too short, content is not enough.. An amazing game that gives a true sense of adventure. A great day night cycle that actually impacts your game play and a great companion system.. Having played Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen last year (and loved every aspect of it), I was hopeful for this one - and 40 hours in it's amazing! World - It's huge and a lot of fun to just explore, one can spend hours exploring and stumbling into hidden areas. Fast travel is difficult which adds to the challenge, as you need to think and prep prior to leaving town Vocations - Played 7 and they've all been a lot of fun, even warrior which was the worst in DD1. Likewise each boss battle is different as you'll either snipe as a ranger, climb/stab as a thief, spellcast etc. Since you change vocation so often the combat always feels fresh Quests - a lot wider assortment than the 1st, many of which are timed which adds to the urgency and fun. Overall I'm loving the game, excited for future DLC. Dragons Dogma 2 is a grunchy walking for hours simulator with copy/paste enemy encounters to fill until you find unique enemies in a overextending map. Characters pop-up right in front of you. The saving game is badly structured. Fast travel is very badly designed. Not a fun game to play.. All in all I think that dragon's dogma 2 is a wonderful game painstakingly made to try to update all of the great formulas set up in the original title. That being said I believe it fails in almost every possible regard. The bugs can easily make this a one out of 10, I am currently playing at 9 months after release and still there are tons of game-breaking and ridiculous super easy to fix terrible issues. The story is okay 7 out of 10 maybe. The gameplay can range from anywhere, I have had exciting moments and I have had literally some of the most childish moments of BASIC video game bs. If I had to be completely honest with myself and somebody made me play this game without me asking to do it I would easily give the Gameplay a 2 out of 10. I think the world might be the best part of it and for that I'll give a decent 7 out of 10 because it truly does feel alive and really entices the player to explore. I don't want to waste any more time on this review but without giving any spoilers there is a thing that happens in this game at any possible particular town that 1 of your characters can become afflicted with. THAT THING IS THE WORST THING ANY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED DOES. Story: 7 Gameplay: 2 Sound: 7 Visual: 7 Bugs: 1 4 (Fun But You Have To Delude Yourself). I'm having an absolute blast exploring the world of Dragons Dogma 2. Never played the first one. The 50 bucks I gave for it on sale was worth every penny. The world is very well crafted, the combat and leveling is engaging and funand the story is neglectable. The many side quest are much more interesting.. How to delete this rating.... I wanted to give to PC platform not for stupid PS. Really good start, but I maxed out the class I wanted to play early in the game and from that point there wasn’t any more character progression that I found interesting. I had no interest in switching classes so the game lost all interest to me.. Great game. Huge open world. Combat is fun, great graphics. A must play for dark fantasy enthusiasists.. Defenetley not a game for everyone. Played it on PS5 Pro with the enhanced mode and the performance is not perfect but ok. The frame rate in the capitol city vernworth or in animation intensive fights with lots of magic going on is also stuttering here and there. Outside of the vassals system this game is an really classical oldschool rpg fantasy game which I liked. I just like grinding, improving your equipment and skills... But what I really really disliked was the fact that your charakter cant swim and climb and immediatley dies when falling into water xD On the one side, the developer offers no fasttravel, so you have to explore the map more BUT then on the other side, the exploration gets frustrating or complicated because you cant swim or climb. Means you walk walk walk, see river, search a bridge or something, walk walk walk a **** detour to the bridge, then walk walk walk back to the other side of the river for example. Just add swimming damnit! This plus the fact that your endurance is suffering really fast just lowered the fun experience alot for me sadly. Otherwise it would be an 8 or something.. The worst save system and ai I ever seen in my whole life after 20 hours in and going into the new area all my pawns decided to **** me in the ass and dying for no reason and when i though oh i will just go to the new city and get new ones the road had all kind of enemys i could seen from ogers to lizard to a dragon following me the whole way i could not make it to the half way of the road when i thought i just will turn down the difficulty and make it through nothing changed i really hope that i just had some bad luck with the game but i will never play it again i really loved the game and the world but the whole thing just turned to **** for me. Wild game, unlike any other games of its genre. Sure it can be a little rough around the edges in places but to be fair, most people complaining about this game don’t realize how to play it and if they did, they would mention those mechanics which they don’t thus my only criticism is the game could’ve perhaps done a better job making the player understand those mechanics early on.. This one caught me by surprise. I've tried the first one a few times but always bounce off as the world feels so small and the adventure aimless. Playing the sequel though... everything clicked. It's a massive upgrade on the first in terms of its world. Setting out with a destination, tackling enemies, suddenly a massive gryphon swoops down to attack, you make a run for it and endup in a network of caves... the game systems come together in some really cool ways making the world feel alive. The story was mostly a bit underwhelming. Characters appear and then disappear. Quest objectives can be confusing or hard so my progress with certain story threads seemed to hit walls quite often. Plus the run up to the final boss seemed very short and sudden. The last section of the game though is where the story picked up for me and became much more interesting. I think what really stands out about this game though is that it doesn't talk down to you, hold your hand or play it safe. Characters don't go on an on about the story infinitely repeating themselves to make sure you know what's happening. The content isn't spoonfed to players in a super obvious way so it's entirely possible to miss a quite a lot of stuff. Dragon's dogma 2 feels like a weird rpg from a previous generation and it'll rub some people the wrong way I imagine. But if you want something different it's a must play.. A great open world experience. Unfortunately didn’t enjoy the last quarter of the game but all in all would recommend. The graphic is poor, old school. Tha gameplay is vague. The battle of beginning is bored. It looks like a generic RPG from 2013. The graphics are outdated, the character mechanics are unnatural and the gameplay is mediocre. There was a lack of attention to detail. The game is boring.. If you want to get the feeling of adventuring, this is the game for you. With 3 pawns you can form a party and enjoy the journey. They will help you along the way. Pawn system is an upgrade to DD1. Graphics is amazing. The best character creation system I have seen so far in gaming. I don't enjoy the weigh system and losing stamina when running outside of combat. It just too tedious. The initial weigh you are allow to carry is so low even you build a super tall character. Mobs/boss get repetitive quickly after 30 hours of play. The unmoored world is so cool and they should give us more monster like that in the beginning.. It’s fun but nothing to crazy. It will scratch an inch but won’t hold you for the longest time.. Thw game world looks great and the storyline isnt bad. Combat however is boring. You have just a few abilities to equip at camp. And combat basically consists of spamming one or two of them till the healthbars goes down. Theres no good fastravel system making travelling really long. I remember spending about an hour to go to the elven village for gear and back. There are love interests but not much happens with them. At the end if their questlines theres a cutscene and thats pretty much it.. Lackluster story and very poor enemy variety. Put 15hrs into it and have now given up out of boredom. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Chill and relax adventure game, open world is quiet good, you can choose what you like to do, but just one save file, realitic factor is so good. Dragon's Dogma 2 is about the journey, not the destination. The destination is just a justification for the journey. Dragon's Dogma 2 is a good game that could have been the best of all time. Quest in DD2 is to get you to explore the open world other than that they are basic. Limited fast travel to the Oc cart between towns will force you to explore the world they made, which is great and a lot of fun. Until you have been to some place 3 times. So make sure to go to the spot get everything and be done with it. Pro - So the combat is supper fun and my favorite part about the game for the 1st 20-30 hours Con - At some point, you going to get so strong that you just melt bosses, and even when a new mob shows up with a different move set it won’t matter cuz you’ll just melt it. For example their 6 different harpies in the game they have different skins and different move sets and attacks but it won’t matter if you can hit any new mod. Mixed - The game doesn't care if you're a ""murder hobo."" The easiest way to play is to do whatever you want: walk into people's houses, steal everything, and sell it—all without anyone stopping or caring. **** tells you that you can’t go somewhere, just walk past them; they won’t mind. The reason this will make sense by the end of the game becomes clear once you reach the conclusion, or if you've played DD1. Until you get to the end of the story this is not going to make sense. After the performance patches, I would recommend it to pretty much anyone just play it at the hardest default. Even with mods to increase the difficulty you will get OP without trying.. Decided to finally jump into this after wasting time and money on Dragon Age. I am surprisingly happy with the first 20 or so hours I have into it. A few things that the first game did better like class selection, but over all a fun game. The movement is much more fluid than the previous game and the combat flows well. It’s not dark souls level combat by any means, but it’s entertaining enough. The pawns dialog has been great, they say some seriously funny stuff. I would recommend it, maybe on sale unless you are a diehard of the first game.. Extremely generic RPG that disrespects your time. It genuinely felt like a single player MMORPG. Quests will have you walking for miles back and forth, through a bland world, fighting through dozens of camps of the very same enemies. Even the stronger/bigger monsters you rarely encounter get old because there's no variety. My biggest purchase regret in 2024.. Mediocre combat, couldn’t figure out how to fast travel so had to run everywhere, quest design wasn’t great since if u fail one of the stealth missions once the guards keep detecting you even in disguise and even if you haven’t done anything wrong since the game doesn’t explain that there is a reputation system, wouldn’t recommend. The first part got better and better over time, the sequel could have been great from the start - if it weren't for the frustrating performance that always gets in the way, especially on consoles. And yet, Dragon’s Dogma II, with its fantastically implemented minion system, offers an irresistible reason to take a closer look at the game. There is also an exciting story, great fights and a varied open world that invites you to discover. What criticism remains is at best small things. And although the topic of unannounced microtransactions is in many aspects hotter eaten than prepared, CAPCOM still has to put up with accusations of poor communication. With something like that you can sometimes do more damage to a good game than you want - and Dragon's Dogma II has definitely become that.. Good game i really like the world of dragons dogma 2 the fighting style and everything on the game is on point i hope won the game of the year. Dragons Dogma 2 expands upon Dragons Dogma and improves it in every way with perhaps one exception (so far). Dragons Dogma added some additional postgame content to continuelly improve your character. I hope we eventually see that here as well. Beyond that you have a well crafted open world where incredible things happen, seemingly, dynamically. If it's not dynamics, they fooled me well enough. I have had some epic battles in the open world that just happen because I ran into the monster that decided to spawn and roam there at that time and I was ready for it. It's an action adventure gameplay with a number of jobs with varying gameplay, but they do not grow too much. Instead, the game is built around your ability to switch your job and level a knew one and then adjust your party composition. You also unless additional jobs through the game via quests or other finds or events, similar to Remnant/Remnant 2. So expect to enjoy the job of your choice until you start to max out and it starts to get a bit bland and then BOOM you unlock something cool to keep you going. That's how it was for me and I really enjoyed it. There story is somewhat basic, but so was the first. They have an intersting world premise that is a bit interesting as it is revealed. Beyond that, I don't think you'll find the characters or writing very memorable. There was some initial controversy about this game regarding in game purchases on the steam store for items that at least appears to allow for fasttravel in a game that didn't have much fast travel. I think this is somewhat overblown from people who didn't play the original. All of the items in question where in the original game as well and they were rare items that you could find and were given direclty in quests in the game. These were not unique store purchasable, pay for a feature items. I don't think these should've been there on the store, but they didn't detract from my experience because I didn't get store advertisements in game and the features and functions of the game were in line with a dragons dogma game. It was true to its vision otherwise. If most of your concern was around this contrevery, I'd check out this game. An adventure awaits you.. Genuinely one of the top 5 games I have ever played. Sans having blk people in ****'s pretty much perfect.. I personally loved the gameplay and I can play it over and over again but definitely it's not better than the first one. They had the opportunity to improve and fix the fails of the first title but unfortunately they didn't. A lot of content was cut off like holy/dark types, less variety of monsters, no meaningful quests, etc... which is sad.. I've finished this game and omg there ending was beautiful this game is my goty. Its really good game. Actually the game was finished only when they got the graphics problems fixed. Its a good game, but there were problems at the beginning. Right now this is my favorite game.. This game could have been a masterpiece. Looks quite nice, and the npcs are incredibly lively and well animated, as are the monsters. Main and side missions have good variety to them, and interesting stories, reminding me of Witcher 3. And the main cities are interesting to explore and you can buy house in each to live in. Plus, the countryside is littered with masses of treasure, and monsters drop gratifying amount of loot as well. Trouble is the game world design. The wilds are basically a huge labyrinth of narrow canyons and cliffs and bridges. You cannot travel anywhere in a straight line, but have to walk thru a confusing paths that go this and that way and you have to keep calling up the map every five seconds just to make sure you are still going the right way. These narrow paths also make it very difficult to dodge big monsters as you explore. You can run past them, but your pawns, despite commands to follow you, have annoying tendency to stick around and get killed by the big nasties. Aand these big nasties also have tendency to chase you across the whole map, unless you manage to find shelter in a village. More open map would have made the game so much better. These labyrinthine pathways just make me claustrophobic. The other fail is how monsters do not leave lasting mark on the countryside. You see griffon rampage thru farms, killing all livestock, and the next day, the livestock is back there like the griffon never happened. Loss of immersion right there.. I wanted to like this game. The character creator and the pawn system are interesting. Unfortunately the game is either not finished or complete garbage, it's wasting your time either way. Horrible quests and worse sub quests. Combat gets Boooooring in a very short amount of time. Not playable without an online guide and that is infuriating in 2024; abysmal systems design. This is a product from a time in gaming that no longer exists. Maybe if DD2 released around the time Skyrim was it Could be looked at more favorably. No one voluntarily purchases epic trash. Reduce scope, FINISH MAKING THE GAME, DLC. $$$. Make the quests about the main story and advancing your party. Ditch the rest. ""I don't know what to do, bring me two bunches of flowers."" ****, deleted.. It is one of the best Worlds and Combat you could ever expect in an RPG it builds on its strength from the first game but that is also a curse. It lacks in story characters and so many other factors the first one surpassed this game which makes it for us an 8. It is still a great game but not in my top 10. This is the most fun combat I've ever experienced I believe.. It's definitely an improvement from the previous Dragon's Dogma game. When I was travelling all across the map, it really felt like I was on a real adventure, planning ahead for my travels. The part that is really painful is the pretty awful story and bad enemy variety, the ""romance"" system is also terrible and should have either just not been included or at least have been an improvement from the first game. Even with all these negatives, I still thoroughly enjoyed Dragon's Dogma 2 and thinking back to it I really had a LOT of fun. Especially considering the fact that the new beastren race made it possible for me to recreate my cat as a pawn in the game.. For best game 2024. I waited a long time for a game like this. A good rpg in a detailed beutiful forest with castles and detailed monsters lurking around.. It's more 9.5 because the later part of the story/game feels rushed. (Otherwise, I'd give it a 10.) I really hope Capcom will release a DLC to fix it. In short, this game is in my top 3 RPGs, together with Baldur's Gate 3 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. It's so unique, fun and addictive.. Kinda like a baldurs gate 3 but in POV with ""souls like"" fights instead of turn by turn. Less content obviously. But I loved every minute of it. (loved baldurs gate too). The game is beautiful and manages to capture the vibe of exploring the world of Vermun and Batahl. I really like the direction of the first game, and Capcom retained all the elements of the first Dragon’s Dogma (love the element and core gameplay introduced in DD1 but they did nothing to improve (Felt like there was very minimal improvement from its predecessor) Story: The story doesn’t click well with me. I feel like the story doesn’t really matter. The cutscenes and the cast in this game did nothing to explain the lore and the story. The cutscenes in this game felt like they should have been released in 2010. Gameplay : Improved from its predecessor, but the lack of a locked-in mechanism can be a hindrance. I guess they wanted to retain what makes Dragon’s Dogma, Dragon’s Dogma. The gameplay feels familiar and improved from DD1 (I used to play a lot of DD back in the day) but is not amazingly executed (typical improvement - animation, particle effects etc). Boring enemy types - I feel like 80% of the enemies I fight are goblin-like, which is weird because the game’s central theme is exploration and adventure, which is a bit contradictory. The lack of guidance and story in DD2 is pretty much expected, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t change. Performance : The performance on PS5 is annoying, especially in the cities and during chaotic gameplay.. Compare to dd1,now the game is a little Less chaotic and confusing(objective/map)better pawn conversation,but still have a very annoying temporary gray healthbar system,the world and area/cave looks so bland like a basic open world design,main story too short and not interesting enough,job system and skill too simple,game is nowhere near skyrim level,in fact far from it,mediocre open world with one of the most annoying gray healthbar system that makes me want to finish it asap and get it over with,based on the main story campaign/overall not so interesting event,those critics 100% being paid. The gameplay can be varied and fun. The world is fun to explore, I like the caves in particular. The game looks good. I love how dark and dangerous it gets at night time, it looks fantastic on an oled. The pawn system is interesting. However the story, quests and characters are mostly uninteresting.. A very epic yet solid 5. Lots of neat systems but they're not very flushed out, the UI leaves some to be desired and the movement and gameplay is clunky. My number one cause of death in this game are ledges the hero wants to vault at 45 degree angles to their doom automatically on a whim. As someone who very much enjoyed the first game, the sequel seems like an insult to its name and a large step backwards in many directions.. The Dragon's Dogma series is quite a niche series, designed firmly around survivalism, limited guiding, scarce use of fast travel and a strong importance on exploration prep and a balanced party. It's understandably not for the masses, is far from perfect on a technical side, and I admit the implementation of ferrystone, portcrystal and wakestones as add-ons is a scummy Capcom tactic, but it's a company-wide practice not exclusive to this game. Having said all that, I simply cannot put this down. I love Dragon's Dogma 2 like Dark Arisen before it, because these games give me exactly what I look for in fantasy RPGs these days. One with the strongest sense of complete player choices, a lively world with time-sensitive events and consequences, survival elements, rich in class variety and written in an artistically aesthetic old English tongue. It's not a perfect game, but it's a damn near perfect one for me.. Gameplay 8/10: Starting with probably the best character creation ever. Smooth gameplay with a variety of skills and classes to choose from. Spells are a bit tricky compared to melee skills but are really nice once you get used to it. Nice movement around the map. Interaction with other npcs reminds of games from past decade. The party creation is for your journeys is really nice. Graphics 7/10: It's not what you would expect from a 2024 game. During the day there are a lot of nice details especially in cities with nice environments out of them. During the night it's way to dark and even with lantern it's hard to release where you going. It's nice looking tho. Open World 3/10: Once you get inside a city it feels nice and well organised. When you get outside you feel like it's way too empty. Some mobs here and there and some ""bosses"" in random locations. More walking and exploring random buildings than fighting something Story & Characters 3/10: The story could have potential but it gets boring way too fast. The characters around it are nothing interesting to talk about. There are some good parts and some nice cinematics and that's it.. Nothing especiall Normal graphics,weak story, bad level design,it was a waste of time and money for me. I actually really enjoyed it for what it was, but if your expecting Skyrim or an actual open world RPG with good exploration, you'll be very disappointed. The open world is basically corridors with nothing but monsters to fight and level up your character/class. I just found the concept of having a party of NPCs with their own abilities and personalities really fun and a different take as an action RPG. There are some dynamic things that can happen with environments or creatures, and AI seems pretty advanced at times but awful at other times. The story is pretty pitiful, not going to lie. The game also feels unfinished, with lots of dead ends in caves, and some of the quests are broken. It gave me a feeling of adventure with my party that I was looking for in an RPG, and the player customization is really well done. The endgame is terrible; it seems like they ran out of budget. It's not a game I can recommend wholeheartedly, but a game I enjoyed mostly because there is nothing else quite like it.. Too boring after 20 hours of gameplay. Still playingit because I've paid 70$. Also really bad optimization.. The 1st one was one of my favs they have butchered EVERYsingle thing in this sequel it trul is an awful embarrassing disgrace of cobbled together code absolutely sickening they had people wait 10 plus years for this utter half assed TRASH Z. No quest markers or fast travel make it difficult to enjoy the game. Also wish there was more customization for armor design/color options.. remind me of the lord of the rings and i do think they were try to make it close to that imagine.. What an adventure! You know a good video game when you don't realize how time flies when you are playing. 10/10 if there were a proper 60FPS mode. But even whitout it. Game is super playable right now. Good work Capcom.. While the story and questing are lacking, the exploration and moment-to-moment gameplay is incredible. It feels slightly unfinished so I'm hoping for some refining DLC.. Vietnamese - DetectedEnglish106 / 5,000I have played it for over 200 hours, a masterpiece with high interactivity and a truly open world.Send feedbackTranslation results available. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The basic design of the game is good, and the optimization patch improves the frame rate problem. I have enjoyed many hours exploring the world of dragons dogma 2 and the combat in this game is refreshing and new. The pawn system works extremely well and when you spend your currency to get an over leveled pawn they will carry your party to success. I really enjoy the ability to switch vocations any time you are in a town as it adds a variability to the gameplay you don't see in many other games.. Fighting experience is really good. Also brings immersive experience for me to enjoy the world. However everything else is not good enough.. This game is magnificent in every aspect, from the graphics, to the gameplay and the story itself. The pawn system is very good and helps a lot in combating certain enemies. for me this game is as good as dragon age inquisition, the witcher 3, baldur's gate 3 or final fantasy rebirth! 10/10. If you can look past the technical issues from launch( most were ironed out by now) and the sometimes time consuming travel system, this is an absolutely memorable experience. The game really wants you to explore every corner of the map and left no stones unturn. Combat is flashy and have pretty good depth overall. Story is a bit short for my taste and pacing is kind of messy but it makes up with the world building and atmosphere.. l really want to give a high score cause there are lots of designs in the game are inspiring, but l couldn't cause most of them are poorly excuted.I would enjoy its combat and it is the highlight of game, but it mhas only a few types of enemies. lt's a shame that after presenting a series of excellent products, Capcom presents something that should become a strong candidate for GOTY but it just couldn't at last.. This game has so many great qualities and so many bad qualities. I’ve had 3 Griffons fly away with no health and the same has happened with Dragons. It becomes Monster Hunter but you can’t actually find the creatures afterwards because they fly up the mountain. The pawns get stuck a lot and walk into walls. I’ve lost a pawn this way and all the materials and equipment that I gave to it. The quests are often confusing as well. I’m playing this game and trying to figure out the point of it sometimes. I’m genuinely curious if the game will inform me that I’ve beaten it. The game is still very good. But it’s hindered in so many ways.. This game is magnificent in every aspect, from the graphics, to the gameplay and the story itself. The pawn system is very good and helps a lot in combating certain enemies. for me this g","the game is in many aspects not more advanced than TES:Oblivion, which came out 18 years earlier . graphics are washed out and ugly on PS5, combat feels clunky, story is just weird and cringy . the story is really innovative and something completely different ."
"1,030.Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Stressful gameplay. It should nit be called a game because it takes the fun out of gaming.. Speaking purely for PvE It has its great moments, enough to have me beat this game three times to get all three endings, hunt all the battle logs and get all the hidden chests. But for the most part it's the typical FromSoft trend of pushing faster and faster combat with a system that can't keep up, and imo FromSoft don't always do fast combat well. I have tons of missed inputs that constantly mess my game up because a weapon refused to switch, or my AB refused to turn off etc. Storywise it's standard FromSoft fare. It's essentially just the Dark Souls story in a different universe. Lots of customisation options but really, most of them aren't that special. It's really just making a cool looking mech with the leg type/FCS type you want to use. The stats are barely differentiated enough to make a huge difference. Boss encounters are alright, enough variety in encounters but too many gimmicky bosses that definitely push you towards using a certain type of build. Definitely worth a try with an open mind, just don't expect to be blown away. Edit:having replayed through some choice missions and experimenting with even morebuilds - this game is just outright lazy. Balancing is terrible. FromSoft,since Dark Souls has grown even more lazy with their game balance.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An unexpected gem, never thought I'd get so wrapped up in the game and it's story to platinum it. Absolute masterpiece.. Introduced me to the AC franchise, and it was quite hooking the first 10 hours or so. Then the hype i had suddenly dies, and the game felt kind of repetitive, with the all the arena battles feeling the same and the main quests kind of boring at given points. I won't say its a bad no boring game, but i expected a bit more coming from From Software. Great mech customization, campaign is very enjoyable but sometimes feels a little repetitive, storytelling isn’t the best, multiplayer features are a little confusing to use at times but worth getting for the campaign alone. The difficulty of this game is totally related to camera and controls, they are terrible!. This is an amazing game. I got into AC rather late with AC4, however, I did look up some gameplay of older AC titles just for better reference. I pretty much love every aspect of this game. One thing that stood out in particular to me was its story. Granted, the way of telling it through voice messages and written lore can be a bit tedious at times, but it goes insanely hard IMHO. The customization (stabilizers, bespoke radars, etc.) is a bit tuned back from previous titles such as AC4 and 4A, but I didn't care as much. The ACs still feel unique and there is plenty of room to build cool robots. If you want a hard game with a great story and an amazing atmosphere (and robots!), this is the one.. I've been a fan of the Armored Core series since I first played AC 3 on the ps2. They've had some pain points over the years, but this modern iteration is smooth as silk and fun to play. I do think that the menu based mission select is a bit archaic, but I can't really think of any other way to do it without going open world and truthfully that isn't what I want from the franchise.. An incredible game with fantastic replay value, customisation and the variety of builds to be made, I didn't go into the game expecting a great story but I loved what I got to experience and it might be one of the best games I've played this year with definitely the best gameplay.. massively underrated! in my opinion it was the game of the year 2023 outclassing all the other games that year. best sound design period. best gameplay IMO, very VERY good Story, best replayability (actually replaying is must for this one) Niche title that deserves to become mainstream just like the soulsgames before. Please Fromsoft more of that pure Gold, the believers will surge im sure!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While I think the gameplay is fantastic in its customisability and presentation, with a story that does feel engaging too, the game suffers (like Elden Ring) from a massive issue of balancing. I enjoy the customisability the game offers, however my issue is that it is VERY clear that some weapons are massively better than others, which becomes an issue when some bosses are so outrageously hard that it forces you to use solely the ""good"" weapons, even if you may not personally enjoy the playstyle that comes with that. It takes a lot agency away from players who simply want to customise their mech to whatever they personally find as fun. Instead of FromSoftware trying to fix the inbalance in weapons, they decided to scale bosses in difficulty around these higher tier builds (just like in Elden Ring). I pray that FromSoftware does not fall into these pitfalls of balancing in future games.. Its hard to explain the mayhem and epicness of the final battle. The f^%ing planet was exploding in the background while I was falling from orbit on a spacecraft fighting the final boss fully geared, maximum damage maximum skill . EPIC. One of the best games I played in this generation. Highly dynamic, lot of personalization for many different play style and playable up to NG+++. Superb!!. Just a very fun game with an interesting combat system. The customisation is also one of the main strong points of the game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love all the fromsoft soulsborne stuff but everything in this felt like a chore. It was way too easy except a couple of random battles that took hours to beat.. This is the best game of 2023 after the **** stain that was shadow of the erdtree it made me lose all hope for future fromsoft games but man this game is seriously good anyone who says this game is hard needs to learn how to play the game and get good. absolute blast! The mech customization is incredibly detailed, and the combat is both challenging and exhilarating. A must-play for any mech enthusiast!. By far one of the best mecha games to be released in a long time. Despite some minor balancing issues between different gear and builds, Armored Core VI is a blast from start to finish.. The best mech game I have ever played! It has a good combat system, excellent painting workshop (player can also share paint with each other), the storyline itself is decent (with multiple endings). The game encourage me to try different builds, and the best part is there is no best build, different players have different tastes for what work best for themselves.. it should be 0, because I was soooo disappointed, but I give 1 point for the music during Balteus fight. 1. Visuals - disgusting. 2. First boss locks you in the aerial area with invisible walls and continue bashing you from the distance, despite you don't have enough tools at that moment. It's idiotic design. 3. Too many places where your build should be changed to the one the game wants it to be. In this case, what is the sense of build system at all?. The biggest boss is the controller. L3 comes into play when you don't want it to, and god forbid you touch the right stick if you are locked on - then its a scramble looking around to try to get the lock to work again (spoiler, it doesn't most of time). Combat and missions are repetitive and bosses are a chore (I rather fight other ACs). What is the point of custom builds if bosses and missions are designed with only certain builds in mind? Graphics are not next-gen (may high PS3 quality) and the story is meh.. It gave me all the fun of the originals with updated graphics, like usual for fromsoft, it's a bleak but beautiful world. Fast paced combat with great customization.. The game is solid and has tons of difficult action, music, and immersion you'd expect from From Software. The game pushes you to build different mechs to achieve certain rankings and it keeps you on your toes the entire time. It can get repetitive at times but overall, this game is a really good buy. Definitely recommend.. The review is now out of date, but this is my first Armored Core, my first FromSoftware, which I bought and played through on release day. I cleared the game before the update and almost cried at the difficulty level, but I improved and enjoyed playing it through repeated playthroughs. The story and characters were good, and even without perfect illustrations and backgrounds, it was a fascinating game that captured the imagination. I played through the game until I had completed all the trophies, wanting to know everything about this world. Thanks for a lovely gaming experience.. There's nothing like playing an OP build in a From game and demolishing hard bosses. Wow, a great introduction to the series and so much fun and replayability. I will definitely pick up the next installment.. The game is real good for whoever loves mechas. However if you're new to the genre like me, you might not like one minute missions which are very common.. I was not into mecha games before Armored Core series. Something in it just clicks right. The story and hidden elements in it is interesting. Even if characters have no faces in this game, they felt more alive than in other games, even than those with fully rigged characters. Even english voice acting is absolutely amazing- as much as japanese which I find rare in games. The visuals are fit for this game. Even if lacking color, (which is to be expected from the game setting), in some missions there would be a small pop of light and colors in the sky which makes it just beautiful. Every weapon and part has amazing amounts of detail in them. The sound design really perceives the weightiness of objects- be it sounds from chunky metal grinding, explosions, objects being destroyed and etc. The enemies could be harder but on the other hand it is expected- as sometimes you're just fighting in a war machine against work equipment retrofitted with some weapons. When fighting against other ACs I feel like the difficulty is just right. The tutorial boss could be a bit harder. It would filter out people with skill and enjoyment issues even further.. AC 6 was my return to the mech genre after a 20-plus-year pause. Having played MechWarrior/Battletech on Genesis and Mechwarrior 3 on PC, I didn't try anything else and only heard about the AC series. Well, I guess the Ray vs. Rex battle doesn't count. Clearly, AC 6 is not a mech game in the classic sense—too hectic and dynamic, relying less on tactics and more on reflexes. My impressions of the game are mixed. For every positive aspect, there is something holding it back from full enjoyment. Gameplay is one thing that I fully enjoyed, at least during the normal playthrough. Again, from the perspective of not having played Sekiro and having Elden Ring as my first From Software game, I really welcome the linear nature of the game, where there is no way to grind and cheese your way through. The game is generally well-balanced, tipping more to the difficult side, of course, where a boss fight is not only a test of skills but also an exploration of builds and tactics. By 'normal playthrough,' I meant earlier the campaign missions through all the playthroughs for all the endings. But things are a bit frustrating in replay mode for getting S-Rank. There's enough rant about that on the Internet - there's no defined per-mission or general criteria for S-Rank. I started with a few missions marked to be extremely difficult on the internet, where the first one took me some 10 minutes to get the highest rank, while I couldn't get higher than A for the other one, and all the tricks and tips out there didn't help. When it's not deterministic and unclear what should be improved, that takes the rewarding part out of being challenging. I ended up giving up on that endeavor and cleaned up the rest of the game. Graphics are also generally impressive and the game is well optimized. Mech design and especially boss designs are top-notch. The dystopian landscapes are artistically beautiful. The mission areas are often visually vast but limited by invisible walls, so there's always this confined feeling when playing the game. The sense of scale is also presented very well, at least graphically, though being an agile mech game by design, most of the mechs loose that sense of size and inertia. As for the story, well, it's there at least. The few cutscenes are gorgeous and sometimes epic, but it's hard to get engaged in a story, or moreover, get emotionally invested in an escape or rescue mission, when there is no single human character, only mechs. But the game at least tries, and the story is good enough for this genre. I preordered the game right when it was announced, as a gratitude to them for making Elden Ring, and I've enjoyed the 50 hours I invested into the game. However, I will think twice when and if AC 7 happens.... Nothing like the originals. Tries too hard to be difficult. There's also something similar to stun bars on bosses. That mechanic isn't fun in the slightest. Overall, skip this one unless you're a die hard AC fan.. Excellent fast-paced combat, trying out different load-outs was interesting. Storyline was interesting with a few good characters and twists e.g. Ayre, Rusty, Walter.. i was never into that kind of genre , but this game keeps me for so long stuck to it . it is really hard at many points , a thing that motivates you to keep going . the pvp of the game is amazing . it demands tactics and skill , as it is very challenging because of the fact it can be very versatile by using different weapon and piece's **** of the best games i have ever played.. I am new to Armored Core series, so the initial missions was tough as nail to me. But after reading online and understanding that the game design pushes player to experiment with their AC customization and play style in different AC design is key to enjoy this game, I had loads of fun since. I'm currently done with the game's NG and NG+, just started NG++ so I get the true ending of the game. Not often I replay games but the fun of replaying the missions and trying new mech setup makes the replays fresh. This further helped by NG+ and NG++ have varied missions andnew decisions that will change the outcome of downstream missions and ending. I have not try pvp online matches yet but to me even with its single player mode it's a solid 10. But looking at some YouTube videos of PvP matches, looks like lots of fun too!. Bought it to customize my mech and blow things up, not expecting much from the story. But for what it was and only being delivered via comms between missions, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. Gameplay was awesome, and had a ton of fun trying different builds. The customization and multitude of ways to take on missions was great. I eventually settled on 3 different mechs, but it was nice and easy to change it up depending on how I felt. Each of them had their strengths and weaknesses, but it really came down to preference as I was able to make them all work for various missions (which is a big plus in my books). That being said, if you bought this because you enjoyed Elden Ring and wanted to try other From Soft games, be prepared for a wildly different experience. Like Elden Ring though, every challenge can be dealt with, you just have to experiment and try new things, but find something that suits you, not what some guide says is good. Anything can work (almost anyways), so if you like it, go with it and have fun!. Not only is it a mecha game that offers the best action experience, but the heroic story development and lines are also moving.. If you clicked with Elden Ring you won't necessarily click with this one. I bought this to give it a chance but it didn't meet up to my expectations.. Loved this so much first armored core game fell in love with it deffinitly one of my favourite games from last year the combat style everything perfect. Nothing particularly shines about armor core 6 in my opinion. The overall design of the game is not very special and it doesn't even look all that great for it's time either. The weapons are very generic, just a bunch of explosions and lasers, nothing very unique with the game overall lacking of any kind of character or personality of its own. Just a game with big robots shooting big guns on one another and blowing **** up while some random people mumble about nonsense in the background. The over reliance of fromsoftware games being soulslike, being too difficult and focusing too much on boss fights here shows more than anywhere else. You have a mech shoot em up game which instead of focusing on being as fun as possible like a game of this kind should be, it tries instead to be punishing and throws you into a boss fight every 10 ****'s still a good game overall but highly overrated also, people have gotten used to rating fromsoftware excellent for anything it seems.. okok kind of game and visuals but something is lacking thats why i dont want to play this agian. The first boss after about 10 minutes of gameplay and it was such a difficult one that I had to quit the game. Sadly I had no chance to try out or see more of this game. So in the end AC6 has, in my opinion and with my experience, an absolut ridiculous game design which grants no fun at all. That's not a game for casual gamers.. The only real game for next generation at the moment, from software did again a beautiful work.. Armored core 6 is not amazing. Difficulty spikes are abundant. I think the baltius boss battle sums up my thoughts pretty well, so I was going with a sword build and I was doing pretty well but the second f****ing phase when he pulled out the fire swords meant I couldn't play the game how I enjoyed it. Fromsoft is often good with fair difficulty armored core 6 is not.. Hey, look at that: another garbage masochism simulator from Fromsoft lol. Really hoping their sales decline title over title so they're forced to make a game that isn't outdated, hyper-difficult, janky dog sh**. Hard to believe this is the company that made Otogi back in the day. Only rented this to see if it was playable. Its not. It's Dark Souls with mechs. Change the record Miyazaki.. One of the best fromsoft game I have played so far and the one with the best story and best combat.. More people need to give this game a chance. Its combat is intense and the customization is seemingly endless. Runs really smooth on the PS5 and is an overall great looking game, one of my favorites of 2023!. First of all if you love all Fromsoft games then you might like this one and this review isn't for you. If, like me, you don't enjoy the sadistic rinse and repeat nature of Fromsoft games, I think you can skip this one. Hard pressed to recall a game I had less fun with. Missions are usually brainlessly easy, with the only fun spikes being when enemy ACs show up. Boss fights are just awful and go on way too long. You'll keep fighting the same boss, tweaking your mech, googling new builds, etc etc. I like a challenging boss but I also like having fun and progressing with a game. As a fan of mech games ever since Metal Warriors on the SNES I had high hopes for this but it wasn't for me.. Great game. Exactly what it should be. Hard if you want to be fun, easy if you want to beat it. Going breakneck through a level on the third playthrough steamrolling everything feels like a deserved reward from the difficulty of the first run-through.. Just finished my first playthrough, Really like the game so far. Problem for me sometimes is that this game really jump on the difficulty spike inconsistently and out of nowhere. Story wise i would really like to see some human interaction but a bit disappointed there isnt any. Combat, builds, customization is awesome though. Just kind of wish this game isnt that soulslike because i feel quite a few times like that throughout but nevertheless still a good game in my opinion.. Combat is fast and can be really fun at times. Never really had to change much of the loadout, except to slightly upgrade some weapons and a few pieces of armor once or twice. A lot of fights feel cheap at times as you can just spam quick movements and the sword to make quick work of most bosses. Some backgrounds and scenery are interesting, but the actual arenas are brown and dull. Narrative is BORING as hell.. Controls felt janky and not very intuitive. Bosses way too hard. (Even the tutorial boss is stupidly hard) UI feedback on ammo and reloading are really bad. Graphics look outdated, but it is Japanese game From Software games have always been a hit or miss for me and this one totally misses the mark.. The game's very fun and gameplay focused. The story was enjoyable, but it takes a bit of a backseat to the ""big robots cool!"". It was so much fun! You can operate the AC intuitively, and the story is interesting. It is recommended!. people that give this below a 7 are just bad players or ignorant. there is no other game i've played in years that is like this. im still in chapter 1 but have done like 10 missions and killed a couple bosses and I thought it would be harder than it is from what other reviewers have said but I guess they just **** at games. Having never played an Armored Core, but having really enjoyed many other From Software games, I took a gamble on this far future mech-based action game. Aside from some inventive, brutally difficult boss battles, it’s not very similar to their dark fantasy Souls series (nor Sekiro, nor Bloodborne); just short-ish sequential missions, not a single visible person (just mechs and audio calls), and a focus on buying and combining mech parts. When you fight a hard boss, you’re supposed to take time to reconstruct your mech to meet the challenge. For me, some of them were just unfair rage-inducing hours-long bouts of frustration. I nearly quit at Chapter 4, but the PowerPyx strategy video I found worked. I’ve no desire for NG+ or NG++. Sadly I didn’t enjoy AC6 much at all.. High-octane gameplay and boss fights that will blow you away. Best action game of 2023, and such a wildly fun ride. Great customization and music too. Some missions come up short and the general structure of the game will certainly not be for everyone, but this is one of the most entertaining plays of 2023.. Fromsoft never misses. Another Slam dunk from the goats. The gameplay is addicting, the art style is fantastic, and the soundtrack goes hard. Epic in scale, level design, and boss fights. Gives you everything you could want from a massive, action packed, mech game.. The game **** rules. My first AC game as a die-hard Souls fan and I'm now a believer. The depth of gameplay is incredible and the challenge/reward ratio is so worth it. Balance is the only critique, but I didn't mind it. Game is not for everyone but it's definitely for me.. I love Fromsoft and came to know them through Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Sekiro, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne. Never played an Armored Core game until Fires of Rubicon. And let me just say WOW! I am blown away by this game. Let me give you a short list of likes and dislikes!Positives - Gameplay: I have played most the big games of 2023 and I think on a gameplay level nothing comes close to this. From the movement to the shooting and also the speed and verticality. No game feels this good to play. - Graphics: FromSoft isn't known for fidelity they are known for art style and this game is beautiful. When cutscenes started I immediately moved my finger to the screen shot button. Some shots in this game are just straight up paintings. Art direction and style > fidelity every day of the week. - Scale and Scope: this game nails scale and scope in the same way Gareth Edwards nailed scale with his Godzilla movie and Rogue One. Bosses feel huge, locations gigantic in a way that is hard to describe. How they nail huge bosses and keep the gameplay fast is beyond me but it looks great and feels big. - Story: this is easily a 20 hour game with multiple endings to encourage replay. The story is good the world and world building rock. Cutscenes are dope. Still has the FromSoft ambiguous flare too.- customization: the builds you can make in this game are so varied. You can make so many types of acs that move and fight very differently! Super deep and fun. Flaws - UI in the garage can be a but much and vague. - some level design that is so punishing that it reminds me of swamps in souls games. Stuff to know - Not dark souls with mechs. If you play it like that you will be mad.- linear mission based story, not open world. - nice 20 hour game with a lot of replay-ability Tips - if you get stuck on a boss change your build. - plasma guns lower shields faster. - explosives and kinetic weapons do heavy damage to the enemy especially when they are staggered. - Know when a boss should be fought close and fast or long range and patient. - Use the tank core if you struggle to evade or block. - replay missions to make money. - upgrade your os abilities that increase your damage resistance, healing, and damage output first!. Armored Core (hopefully) goes out with a wimper...like the quarterback that should have stayed retired. My disappointment is immeasurable. Been waiting over 10 years for an AC sequel THIS is what we get?! Where to even begin? Game goes from 0-100 WAY too fast. One second you're enjoying some simple ""Blow up x, destroy y"" type missions and the next BAM back to back bosses in a single mission. I've played every single AC game in the series and never had the difficulty spiked so hard. Worse still, you have no options on retreat. Beaten the 3 chumps currently available to you in the arena? Hope you enjoy replaying the same simple missions over and over again and...nothing else. To be fair, the game tries to mitigate this massive flaw by offering checkpoints and the ability to edit your loadout if you die, but this ultimately means little if you haven't already purchased the (meager) available parts. To that point, the number of parts available to you at this point is so slim, they may as well have removed the customization altogether. Even after completing the training for the free parts, the offerings here are slim at best. They also took out the kick from 5 and make you purchase it with extension point or whatever they're called. Lame. The game has unfortunately kept the animu-fast nonsense from 4, rather than the more tactical movements from literally any other installment. Some enemies are so pathetic, they may as well explode when you turn the (very janky) camera at them, while others are equal parts fast, resilient and hard-hitting. The button reading nonsense from Elden Ring (a vastly better game) is also back so...have fun. Ac6 somewhat tries to return to AC roots with classic core setup (back weapons, extension slots) and the story itself seems interesting, but that is all on offer here. Get it on a STEEP discount (50% off or more) if at all or just watch the story on YouTube and play a better game.. Another incredible fromsoft experience with amazing combat and a classic fromsoft story with less mystery to it than their other games.. An astonishingly good game. Some balancing issues when it comes to weapons and parts - dual trigger builds in particular are king of everything and breaks the game over its knee - but with some of the absolute best moment to moment action I've seen and some of the best boss fights in recent memory. This is handily my GOTY and has converted me into an Armored Core fan.. Great potential ruined by bosses that require specific builds in order to beat. It took me a day to finish the game, but I disliked most of it. I only continued on with it because I like FROM's other games. Some of the boss movesets were completely ludicrous.. My favorite game of 2023, it is a tragedy that it did not get even nominated for GOTY. My personal GOTY.. I've been a fan of games from FromSoftware for a while now. I heard about the hype about this game and decided to give it a shot without being too familiar with the AC series. My biggest gripe about the game is that you will reach some points in the game and you will have to scrap your whole mech idea to get past a certain boss or mission. You will have to grind previous missions to earn enough funds to purchase the parts. I've never had that experience in previous FromSoftware installments. Having to YouTube a certain mech build or strategy ruins the immersion for me, which was hard to gain in the first place because of the barebones story and any kind of character development. The combat is the one saving grace of the game, and weapons feel great to use overall.. A good game overall and held together with really solid combat, just a bit of a weak story that doesn't keep me engaged for more than a mission or two at a time, but the combat and gameplay keep me coming back for more.. Introduction: Like for many, I assume, this is my first AC game. After finishing the game and playing it for about 25 hours, I have a lot to say about this game. I would not call it a complete package, but certainly a good game for mech lovers. The good: The graphics and the visuals were pristine. I also liked the level and mission designs. The highlights are, as one would expect, the combat and the mech customisations. I'm glad to say these are outstandingly satisfying. Flexible in these two aspects. The controls are also great and intuitive. I also personally liked the UI, your eyes are constantly on the action (at the centre). What could have been improved: It is clear when you look at footage from the older games that from software have largely kept this franchise unchanged since the first game back in the 1990s. Graphical quality aside, it is apparent to me that the biggest difference between armored core VI and its predecessors is its OST. When I listen to those soundtracks I am blown away. The synth and dnb used in AC 1, 2, 3, arena, and nexus gave the games such charm and an identity. They seem so video-gamey and fun and experimental. I am sure they greatly enhanced the gameplay. I think the OST for AC VI was ok. Not bad, but it rarely stood out or amazed me. It is mostly ambient and plain. There are some exceptions: ""contact with you,"" ""cries of coral,"" and the track that plays while fighting IBIS/CEL 240 are bangers. ""New Era"" seems pulled straight out of Returnal and ""Unbreakable"" from doom 2016 or cyberpunk2077. In short: it feels like a downgrade, and I am confused by this change in musical genre, especially when the formula for the rest remains untouched. Two more minor remarks: 1. some buildings and desert/snow terrains looked quite glaringly undetailed. 2. i had some issues with locking on (i often had to spam the L3 button, also there are barely any indications on-screen to assure you that you are locked onto an enemy) and boosting towards enemies (i would sometimes boost by enemies then rather than to them, especially when i was already close to them) What I did not like: This story, or lack thereof, was massively underwhelming. In the words of Ranton (a Youtuber) : ""Voices can only take you so far"". You essentially only receive mission briefings. All game, you are a lap dog (literally) incapable of vocalising affirmations, objections, curiosities, or any shred of emotion whatsoever. One lady is a ""Raven..."" merchant, the other ""heh, not bad, tourist"". Nothing in AC VI is elaborated you know close to nothing about yourself and the people you talk to. It is NOT the lack of faces that bothers me. Putting aside its potential cost effectiveness, i understand, to an extent, the vision here and the potential of this kind of story telling. after all, in persona 5 or dark souls games you dont talk, and in some games, like in doom, you are neither shown nor are able to speak. Yet, these games have awesome, intriguing stories. I've s","it's essentially just the dark souls story in a different universe . lots of customisation options but really, most of them aren't that special . boss encounters are alright, enough variety in encounters but too many gimmicky bosses ."
"1,031.Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand","The last Playable and decent Battlefield game of the series. Everything afterwards is a dumpster Fire!. Disclaimer: Due to the behavior of premier servers, buying BF3 DLCs individually doesn't allow you to play on them even if you own the DLC of the map that is currently in rotation. In other words, none of the DLCs are worth buying over premium. If you want a specific DLC, get premium or don't bother getting it at all. New weapons: by completing assignments, 10 new weapons are unlockable to the player. Most of these weapons are excellent with the L96 being the best in the game. New vehicles: the F-35 fighter jet (Oman & Wake), BTR-90 APC (Oman, Sharqi, and Karkand), and the DPV buggie (Oman & Wake) all make a return from BF2 on these classic maps. New maps: 4 maps return from BF2 with the worst of these maps being better than the best of the launch maps. Gulf of Oman, Strike at Karkand, Sharqi Peninsula, and Wake Island. They're much more detailed than their BF2 counterparts but only Karkand provides a better experience than the BF2 version. Conquest Assault: 3 of the 4 maps retain their original Conquest configuration with one team controlling all the capturable flags but containing no friendly uncap. This provided an experience not unlike rush with one team being attackers and the other team being defenders. It was much more appealing than regular conquest and the excellent balance on the maps led to some very down to the wire end results. Overall, it's an excellent DLC that is infinitely better than the booster packs of BF2. The existence of premium doesn't make it worth buying though.. It's really interesting to see how different these maps play on two different games. They are still good maps but unfortunately they still have a major issue from their original version, they can be incredibly unbalanced (especially Gulf of Oman).. A nice touch from the EA, a reminder **** BF2, but imo original old maps was better than remake in BF3. Advantage of this expansion pack is the introduction of conquest maps in assault mode. Too bad that there was no legendary AK-101 in B2K.. Fine piece of art. Maps includes Easter eggs (ok that's not the point :p), but basically I love the Strike at Karkand -map the most, cos there's so many strategies to play in it. Gulf of Oman is also fine, because it's pretty big. The weapons also bring variety, tho' I've not found myself so keen on any of them. I think I should use them more often. So, the cheap prize of this expansion, which had so much variety and content was a fair deal for me.. The vanilla BF3 maps are a little cramped for 64 players, but these classic BF2 maps take care of the cramped problem. Oman is still awesome with all the tanks. I've never been spawn trapped on these maps unlike some of the bottlenecks in some of the vanilla maps.. An improvement on the vanilla game, of which I gave a six. The one point extra is for (edited) BF2 maps that provide a small escape from the inferior vanilla infantry maps. However, the strange filter is really annoying unless you get an FXAA injector (highly recommend), and the guns are not particularly interesting or different. Also, more BF2 maps would have notched this up to an 8. An improvement, but there is still far to go to 'a proper sequel'.. Untill you bring us back the previous way to play the game is COMPLETELY useless!!! Guys don't let you be blackmailed by the game dev. Simply because the wake-up one day and thought:""Oh, lets make some more money, from the gamers!!!"" Great game, ruined by its creators!!! TRAGIC!!!. Great addition of maps, new twists to familiar scenes. Stunning graphics as expected from Frostbite 2. Infinitely better than Operation Metro garbage.. These maps, sure they are well made but they should definately have been included in the base game. BF3 on launch had 9 (NINE!!) multiplayer maps... ffs, this is even less than had. This way, there is no way they can justify this DLC. Despite how good it might be. 9 maps is not close to enough content, Even with B2K ""expansion"" (its _NOT_ an expansion, its small map pack DLC ffs!) it is still not enough.. Not to mention that EA forces us to use Origin once more (yes i know they will do this for all upcoming releases, but i hate it i will point that out as long as they force us to use it.) and ""Back to Karkand"" dlc was a Day 1 dlc. It was developed AFTER the initial game. _do_not_buy_this_Â¨ ****/groups/ANTI-EA ****/groups/ANTI-EA. I've been playing BF3 now for over 250 hours, so it must be time to pin my opinion to the wall. I've been playing with mates socially, with my Gaming clan on our servers [BhR] in Aus, and we've been scrimming in a national competition, and having a ball. The game itself is brilliant. Seriously, i've been playing FPS since Half life was released (didn't like wolfenstien lol) and this games is the first in its league of wow. I love it, in fact i'd be a fan boi except for the constant drama's with connection issues and patches etc that PLAGUED this poor game when it was first released. That Said, (and enough has been said, and RAGED about - it truly was terrible) its pretty much stable now. (march 2012) We still have problems with 3rd party software trying to get servers to do what WE want them to do, but the Game is great. The realism is off the dial. The confusion in the middle of battle can mix you around when you first start playing but that's war i guess (never been, don't plan to). After playing for a long time, my experience is to 'slow down' your game play. Take corners slowly, wait to see where your enemies are, be deliberate in your aim. Find a wep that suits your play style, and when you've mastered it move onto a different one. Its been a love hate relationship, but this is a game I didn't give up on, and EA has got it to where it should have been at release, so go and safely spend your money on some serious FPS happiness. Rock on BF3 sealcomm. I really like this game. I can't quite put my finger on it. It may be the big maps or the vehicles, but it's probably just the fun of coming home from a long day at work, grabbing a M60 with extended mag and just letting loose.. Very cool game. Awesome graphics, probably the best around today. Swedish DICE did an excellent work on this, I can play it for hours! :) See you guys on the battlefield! :D. This should be a console-only affair. DICE bleats at how much they care about PC gaming. Only to produce this 'consolized' version for the PC. No Lean/prone? WTF?! Very poor gameplay.. This is what the gamers said ""splitting the community"" at its finest. I use to be clueless on what that actually means. So people who don't have B2K can't play with those who have. And until today, I don't see much B2K servers anyway, at least in my region. Kind of redundant. I didn't buy the DLC tho, I had Limited Edition which already come with B2K. Nevertheless, I rarely play B2K maps, Kharg, Metro, Seine Crossing and Firestorm are way much better than B2K maps. But expect these kind of practices from devs/publishers such as DICE, EA, Activision and Infinity Ward/Treyarch to all their future games. Encouraging the Devs doing these kind of practice isn't good idea in the first place. Tripwire interactive with their Killing Floor is the best of how DLCs should be handled. Sell non game changing DLCs and just give in the critical-game changing elements for free. But yet, I don't think EA and Activision really cared much about community since they've raked billions and people would buy their games anyway, whether it's original, fresh idea or just another iteration or expansion pack (MW3) sold as a full blown game.. Definitely not bad for free addition (if you preordered BF3 as in my case). But its cost is OK only in favor of BF3 game itself (as benefit for devs) not for DLC alone.. A nice little DLC package. Adds 4 maps that range from infantry heavy to vehicle heavy, while also adding a little nostalgia from Bf2. It doesn't touch the core game of bf3 by adding new vehicles/weapons that are overpowered or anything. It's the same Bf3 that you either love or hate, just with some more well made remakes of some bf2 maps! What they advertise is what you get, nothing less nothing more.. Epic map. Open, wide, no railrracks. liberty and freedom. Battlefield 3 is no doubt the fps benchmark for the next 24 months to come whith its incomparable sound and lightning possibilities offered by frostbite 2 engine. Enter war and feel it.. Simply put, this is the greatest shooter I've ever played in my life. The expansion adds onto the sheer beauty of this game's graphics. Wake Island is truly a masterpiece with its bright and colorful skies, then to the barren war-torn streets of Karkand. The new weapons and vehicles add onto the stunning gameplay that reels you in and keeps you playing. This expansion, if released by activision, would be known as Battlefield 4 and be priced at 60 bucks, but buying the Limited Edition (as I did) it was completely free. Nice one EA. Maps are very fun. Best Multiplayer maps ever. Love the new stuff. Still needs some more destruction, however; there is quite a bit, but only Heavy Tanks and Attack Helicopters can actually see the destruction due to the powerful guns. Map pack is great, worth buying for sure. 9/10 for the constant child-run servers. It is so annoying getting kicked out of my squads and the server it's self for literally ""Having a great kill/death ratio"". Also a 9/10 for the stupid jet ramming glitch. EA needs to fix this, because its annoying being rammed by jets all of the time. 10/10 for the epic maps (although Wake Island is pretty boring), Gulf of Oman is the bomb.. Pretty mediocre, all things considered. Not only is the install folder all kinds of screwed up (Battlefield-something instead of 'Abcd'), but they're saying it's an intended feature, too. I'd rate it higher but the problems listed before tax the score to just six.. The best Battlefield game yet. Highly ragequittable. Either incredibly fun, or incredibly frustrating. Don't see a lot of hackers. Way better for cheat free gaming, rather than say CODMW3. A must **** get it now.. I don't even really know what this map pack is about. I bought it out of annoyance of not being able to play with my friends online. Although BF3 is awesome and definitely the best multiplayer FPS there is, I still don't know what this extension brings to the table. Having said that, I could also be wrong about this, but the overall game launcher system is just too damn messy and I'm being lazy and just put on my gaming gear and get with the program. The biggest regret I have is that I wish I had known this was included in the limited edition which was on sale at the same price as the original a while back. In any case, I bought two limited editions to my friends, so they could also get with the program! Ahh, screw it, I'll give this an 8 simply out of being hooked to BF. ;). Very good expansion for a very good game. New maps are fun to play, and destructibility is even better. It reminds me of Battlefield Bad Company 2, where you could destroy whole buildings. New weapons are also fun to play, but I really do not like doing assignments to obtain them. Overall it is solid expansion for a reasonable price. Waiting for more.... It gave some problems at the launch but its a worthy addition to the game + the maps looks great + MOAAAR MAPS + free (at least for me) + Gulf to oman is great - The darker settings maybe not for everyone - 15 euro is kinda expensive (if you dont have the LE) - After all these years, i still hate Wake :P Damn it kids, stop reading this and buy it. Back To Karkand breathes new life into four of the the most beloved maps of Battlefield 2. Each map has been beautifully redone in the frostbite 2 engine bringing unrivaled visuals to these classic maps. As well as upgraded visuals, frostbite 2 brings titanic amounts destruction that gives these maps a true Battlefield feel. Also included, are 2 new assignments for each class and 2 extra assignments that allow the unlocking of 10 classic weapons from BF2. B2K is a must buy for any Battlefield fan.. Please do not listen to HET35 or Woopya. They are both trolls. HET35's last 8 reviews were given to good games, and he gave them all 0's. Don't listen to his crap. He is obviously only trying to bring down the average score. And Woopya, a review should include what you experienced, not what you didn't experience. So do me a favor. I GUARENTEE that your problem is fixed by now, so play it first to form your untroll, unbiased opinion of it. Now, onto the review. The maps are extremely big, and I can't help but feeling nice and remembering that I played these maps in BF2. Do not be fooled, these maps are not recycled. They are completely revamped. Many parts are different, but the basic general look is the same. All the maps are nice and big, and action packed. Just look for a 600+ ticket server because the matches can end quickly if there are only 300 tickets. The pack adds four maps to the mix, Strike at Karkand, Gulf of Oman, Sharqi ****, and Wake Island, for a total of 14 maps for the full game. 10 new weapons are also added, and as are three (four) vehicles, the BTR-90, the DPV (desert patrol vehicle), the F-35 jet, and the Skid Loader (which is merely a small bulldozer that allows three people, including a driver, mostly novelty). I enjoyed a function of the F-35 that allows it to hover, but the BTR-90 is really an IFV just with a new look. I highly recommend getting this expansion pack of these revamped maps. BTW, the weapons you unlock can also be used in vanilla BF3.. AWESOME. So far BF3 has become the new benchmark in FPS gaming. It is everything i expected and more. With this expansion it is just adding more goodness to an already near perfect game. If you are buying this expansion pack now you are dumb because you should have pre-ordered the main game to get it for free.... however I would gladely pay for it now anyways. The maps are not the biggest highlight... the fact that they have included something like 15 new guns to unlock is the real draw. I myself never played BF2 so this was the first time for me playing 3 out of the 4 maps. really the only disappointing map was Wake Island... Mainly because I played it to death in BF1943. OVERALL A 10.... BUY IT NOW... SO I CAN FRAG YOUR ASS :). Ah, the memories. BtK is different than it's predecessor, yet contains enough familiarity to generate nostalgia in BF2 vets. This expansion added 'assignments' to the game, when completed, unlock weapons found in the BF2 game. Karkand is a massive map with fewer choke points than it's BF2 predecessor. Sharqi Penninsula is amazingly fun as well: Who doesn't remember the TV station? This X-pac is worth picking up. Definitely not game-changing, but fun nonetheless.. To be honest, I don't know why people can rate it 0 , either they are on crack or get pissed on their own computer that can't play this awesome dlc.Seriously, the remake of BF2 is the best idea, wide maps with Freedom, with the destruction ability of frostbite 2, B2K is simply the most recommended dlc, at least not only remake of maps but also added new vehicles to the game . Though there is some bugs and glitches but it doesn't mainly effect the game. Good map pack , New assignments and vehicles, free for pre-order, worth any penny. This is pretty good for a map pack. Maps are very PC player friendly, with vast detailed maps as opposed to the vast barren maps with a smack of detail in the middle you find in the stock maps. The new vehicles are a let down though, a jet that takes the worst parts of a jet and a helicopter and merges them, and a dune buggy that's less armored and only as fast as the growler with less armament. The Russians now have a comedy super fast do-crazy-jumps-through-the-air APC like the Americans do which is actually pretty cool. The new weapons aren't very good, with an exception of one or two they're statistically worse in every way than the vanilla weapons they compete with so there's no reason to do the new ""assignments"" in order to unlock them apart from bragging rights. A pretty good expansion if you were looking for new maps like me, not so much if you were hoping for awesome new guns to pawn knubs with.. This DLC is a great refreshment and brings in better maps than the vanilla BF3 maps. They give the game more of a ""Battlefield"" feel which has been previously lost because of maps like Seine Crossing and Metro. Not only are the maps more open, but destruction has been improved significantly. Not to mention some of my favorite guns are included as new unlocks in this DLC. If you were unsatisfied with BF3's tiny closed maps, definitely get this DLC for real Battlefield maps.. Looking forward to this all year, the closest map resemblance is Strike at Karkand. However the 'destruction' isn't as good as originally made out. It's still plagued by silly spawn areas, CPU leaks which cause temporary moments of lag (even with an i5 2500k), and vehicle spam. It's not Battlefield i'm afraid, they have successfully ruined the franchise comparing it with COD too much.. Quite simple really. I own the expansion, my account recognizes me as an expansion owner, but the game will not let me play on any expansion servers. Therefor, until i can play the game for which I paid good money, they get a zero. Origin and EA are really ruining what is such a fun game in BF3.. Haters gonna hate. I find Back to Karkand (first DLC i have ever paid for!) pretty good as it gives you almost the half of the actual game at a... normal (?) prise. Having 4 new maps is sure nice, when you think about how many maps the game now haves. Maps are quite good, weapons too, vehicles same... Still only a DLC but a good one. Only for hardcore BF3 fans. But still nice.. 1.graphics=really bad,high contrast,blue filter,blinding lights,color ""art' style headbob and other constant screen shakes=headache,eye strain,epilepsy 2.a lot of 3d spoting visual in the game=it feels like you are a robot .MP=worse then SP mouse problems,basic functions missing from the game,no in game menu,you start the game with browser no ping in the game cant set different sensitivity for vehicles etc. bad maps no blood,gore,when you kill someone they just drop down bolt snipers nerfed,added cod style hold breath,scope sway ugliest scopes ever small scopes,just watch bc2 and then bf3=tunnel vision in bf3 prone=more campers OP spray guns broken knifing you want like this game if you like cod,cs,bf2,bc2 or any other fps game and constant crashes also. The pack is amazing. The maps feel like the maps we grew to know and love in BF2, but in their own way different. The added destruction and assignments add a new level to the game and make it even better to play. The maps are a definite step up from the vanilla maps, as they feel like true, battlefield maps. GET THIS PACK!. Epic map. Open, wide, no railrracks. liberty and freedom. Battlefield 3 is no doubt the fps benchmark for the next 24 months to come whith its incomparable sound and lightning possibilities offered by frostbite 2 engine. Enter war and feel it.",the last Playable and decent Battlefield game of the series. everything afterwards is a dumpster fire! 10 new weapons are unlockable by completing assignments. 4 maps return from BF2 with the worst of these maps being better than the best of the launch maps.
"1,032.Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age","The game becomes tedious and overstays it's welcome as it enters Act 3. Use nostalgia glasses to wade through the discomfort.. One of my favourite games of all time. Amazing value for money since the world is so big and there's so much story!. Dragon Quest is an under appreciated gem of a series. So much so that it really hasn't had a present in the west since Dragon Quest 9, thankfully though, not only did we get Dragon Quest 11, but voice acting attached to that. Yep, Dragon Quest 11 had an English dub first, and not only is the voice acting top notch, the gameplay is as fine tuned as ever, and the story is just the bees **** story starts out with our plucky hero, default named Eleven, as he goes on a journey to figure out what the symbol on his hand means, and to find out his past. As he travels around he meets up with a bunch of different characters that are all well developed in their own right. Erik is an absolute ride or die friend that is with you since the very beginning of your journey. Veronica and Selena are two twins on a mission to help you out and bring peace to the world. Slyvando is here to have a good time and is one of the best gay reps from Japanese developers. Not only a shining knight, but someone who is beloved by all. Jade is a wonderful older sister type that kicks ass, and Rab is the prevy grandpa of the group. Together they go around solving world problems, getting along, and basically helping each other out. While there are certainly times that are bleak, in the end, a lot of what makes Dragon Quest 11 is the friends we made along the way. This is especially turn during the 2nd and 3rd act of the game where things take some drastic **** those unfamiliar with this games structure, Dragon Quest 11 has 3 acts. While the first 2 acts are considered the main story, the 3rd act aka post game, is still given the same kind of treatment that the other two acts get. There is plenty left to do and say when it comes to 11 after the second act, so even when you beat the game, you still have roughly 20-30 hrs left of the true story. That isn't to say that the other two acts don't have enough to tell, and in all honesty the first 2 acts are quite self contained and fill a nice 60 hr slot. And if you happen to get Dragon Quest 11 S, you also get additional quests mid and late game that add onto the overall play time. Enough to say that Dragon Quest 11 has plenty to chew on.While the combat and skill system is as fine tuned as ever, allowing you to redo your points at any time as well as giving you plenty of customization options; the sad truth is the soundtrack does not live up to the rest of the game. Koichi Sugiyama is simply a terrible man, and unless you have the DQ11 S, you're not going to have a proper soundtrack. Comparatively tho, this isn't the worst thing Sugiyama has done, but consider that homework after this review is over.Overall Dragon Quest 11 delivered on my hopes of having a grand adventure that I wouldn't forget. The voice actors for both English and Japanese did a wonderful job, the game is meaty as heck, and there is just so much good to cover about DQ11 that it really isn't worth repeating if you can just experience it yourself. Please if you have never played or have been buy curious about the series the demo for it is 10 hrs. long and gives you plenty of an idea if you'd like the rest of it. Play Dragon Quest 11, it's worth it.. A very enjoyable game but my god is it long, i might try some of the older games next. One of the best modern JRPGs, very chill, but entertaining to play with traditional JRPG combat.. Never have I ever experienced such an engaging adventure, with such endearing characters and greatly structured story, one of the longest also. The soundtrack is amazing. The gameplay is really simple and turn-based but provides you with enough evolution and variety to keep you going for 100 hours of gameplay, since there are so many enemies and ways to defeat them. The only aspect I didnt like was the fact that your protagonist doesnt talk at all, no voice acting to give him some semblance of personality. When a NPC would talk to him with great voice acting, your protagonist would simply nod while smiling like an idiot. And also, I wish the game was not so ""grindy"" in the end in order to defeat the final boss.. The difficulty is normal and the monsters are cute. The map is large. Opening skills is tedious. Story is too long.. It's the same JRPG comfort food you come to crave after while, just as with the previous installments. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's a well put together world and cast that makes it way thru the typical RPG plot. All the usual creatures and gear is there, but with the current gen upgrade, everything has a colorful charm to it. It'd be hard to hate something like this, but you won't have your mind blown either. It's still the same RPG experience from twenty years ago. I give the western PS4 release a downgraded score since we apparently only got the lower grade music, not the orchestral version.. Absurdly boring and long game that repeats enemies and scenearies once and again just to add hours and hours of never ending torture, just when it seems to end, when you are already thinking of choosing a better game for the next few weeks, it goes on and on. And not in an enjoyable way. The story is ridiculously childish and the game mechanics are just dumb. At some point of the development, somebody decided that introducing NON DEFENDABLE altered status would be a good idea to artificially make the game harder, and nobody stopped him/her. The only good thing are the designs of Akira Toriyama, a gift for those longing for Dragon Ball. That alone, and nothing else. Very few games were less enjoyable to me in all the PS4 catalogue. Can't even figure out why it has a so ridiculously high score. RUN AWAY FROM IT.. I kind of understand why people can say this game is the best JRPG besides Persona 5 or even Fire Emblem Three Houses (which a bit different in genre). Dragon Quest XI has a massive world (probably the biggest out there), not like Persona which you only play on the deck of your house and Fire Emblem that only play around in the monastery. So you can explore the world and find lot of things which some of them are jaw-dropping due to the beauty of it. The Academy and Octagonia are my favorite place in DQ XI. The music, OST or BGM (whatever you call it) is heavenly. It's the truth, I play the game mostly only to dive into the world of DQ XI with the majestic yet soothing music. Japanese musicians truly never fails to set the tone for a game. Besides that, DQ XI is truly the default of JRPG. When we talk about JRPG, DQ XI is the closest game that can completely reflect what JRPG is which a good thing IMO but at the same time, they are lacking some unique selling point from big hit JRPG like Persona 5 and Fire Emblem Three Houses as well as the 1st Ni No Kuni. Besides that, the characters is DQ XI is perfect. I love Sylvando, Veronica and Rab due to their quirkiness. On top of that, you can play as your party member because all the party member will get separated in some point in the game which becomes my favorite part of the game because they tried to explore and do things their own after getting separated. The craziest thing is the post-content which act more like DLC for me rather than post-content and it's a big chunk of post content which basically it's equal to 1/2 of the main game. Completely loving the post-content. Overall I do enjoy the game as a die hard JRPG fans and I can say that DQ XI offer the best and the most beautiful scenery out of all JRPG game out there with another one of the best heavenly music to complement that.. To me, this game goes directly in my top 3 JRPGs of all time, together with Chrono Trigger and Tales of Synphonia, I loved this game to death and did the platinum trophy, looking for everything to do until there wasn't anything left, 160 hours of pure fun.. graphic and story are beautiful music is perfect story and citys 12/10 realy good game. WARNING! This game is too easy, and the only other option is Very Hard mode, and you can't change difficulty after starting. This is a huge core flaw that really ****, and is hard to understand the existence of. I don't know why this isn't talked about more, though it is talked about. I'm over half way through the game and I have to stop. While at first the characters were charming and the quest fairly interesting, the story is just meandering from reason for it to keep going to reason for it to keep going using anime power up tricks and such. In addition, Akira Toriyama's art design of monsters is extremely hit or miss here, with half or more of the monsters looking like off-brand toys for very young children. The game also feels very cheap in a number of other ways, for instance you get to a cool new area only to hear the same exact music for every other area, then you go in a cave and hear the exact same music for every other cave and dungeon. This game is doing as little as it can to make a profit, making sure to extend the playtime so people don't complain. This game is very disappointing, and I am appalled at the praise it has received by players and critics alike. If you are looking for a good JRPG experience, I recommend these; Dragon Quest IV for the Nintendo DS Pokemon Blue or the updated Leaf Green version Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest 1 Radiata Stories. What a grand adventure this game was! A total gem, I'd never played a Dragon Quest game before, I'd heard it was good, but was always skeptical about that. I was in for a wonderful surprise this game was a breath of fresh air in the JRPG scene. It's very tried and true, but it had just enough QOL features to show what a JRPG should be striving for in this day and age.. Not one of the better Dragon Quest games but it's still Dragon Quest so I love the traditional turn based battling. Oof, I was really looking forward to this game after seeing so many critics say it was one of the best JRPGs they've ever played, but after dozens of hours into it, I'm not sure we were playing the same thing. This is my first time playing a Dragon Quest game, and I doubt I'll return for another unless it was made by a different team. I have played other RPGs and JRPGs through the years, but even older ones tower over what is being offered here. The pacing is incredibly slow, mostly due to drawn-out conversations and cutscenes with the production value of something from the early 2000s. In fact, if you handed me this game and told me it was from 2005 I would have believed you. I didn't know exactly how many songs there are in the game, but you'll mostly hear the same 2 or 3 for the entire time you play. This includes the thousands of battles you'll get into. How did nobody see this as a problem? The monsters are cute, but it feels like that's where 90% of the art budget went. The towns look all have unique themes, but once you leave them it's the most generic open spaces with few interesting things to look at over and over. Seriously, it feels like there was a lack of inspiration in the overall art vision for this game. Everything is generic in the worst way possible. I finally called it quits about 30 hours in and can't in good faith recommend this for anyone to play.. A masterpiece. Story a little bit for children, but the game is a 10. More than a hundred hours. This was my game during pandemic.. While a good game in it's own right, I felt like this was a generic RPG experience. There were certainly those ""wow"" moments, and a handful of great characters, but for me personally, it was harder to connect with them and their journey. The strongest aspect of DQ11 for me was the combat - classic turn based goodness with great decisions to be made in mind battles, especially when fighting some of the the harder status inflicting bosses. The weakest aspect for me was the music - while there were a few standout tracks, I don't even think the orchestra version can lift some of these songs out of the mud (looking at you, Casino Theme). Overall, this is worthwhile game to play, just don't go in expecting the greatest RPG of all time.. Best japanese role playing game of the generation, without any possible doubt.. This game ist great, I cant wait to see how a sequel in this huge franchise would turn out. I must admit that I stopped playing after a fair amount of time. I wonder what they could have done differently to keep me playing until the end.. This game is really well designed. Each part of the gameplay is rewarding and exciting. The only downside is that the game overstays its welcome. I am about 60 - 70 hours into the campaign and am well into ""Act 2"" of the game, and its starting to feel like a slog. A lot of overworld content is reused, but it fails to strike the same sense of awe and change that Ocarina of Time achieved. You do revisit an area or two that changed drastically, but the vast majority of areas are exactly the same your second time around. The game kept me heartily entertained for about 70 hours, though, so Id recommend it. Unfortunately, I dont think I will see the story to its thrilling conclusion.. DQ XI is an ridiculously cute, happy, uplifting, fairy-tale like game. The world is so charming and the art is amazing. Sylvando was my favourite character. But yeah, what a fantastic story and the old school rpg roots are pretty fun as well. Highly recommend this game.. I've finished the first part of the game so here comes my impressions. Graphics are awesome. If in Dragon Quest VIII you felt like living in an anime serie now it just got better. At first I didn't like the soundtrack because I think it was made with a synthesizer but then I got used to it. I guess that make a game so long with real instruments (like in the opening) would have been too expensive. As I said, graphics are great, soundtrack is good as well, about gameplay it's turn-based so you can think everything. My main complaints would be: there's no autosave or a place to save when you are going to fight a boss after having been in a temple and this is a very big problem because bosses are very very strong compared with the normal enemies. I died twice: once at the begining of the game and another time in like a golden temple so I recommend you that when you find a chest with normally 4 PM potions teleport to a place to save the game and then go to fight the boss. I got so so mad when I died in that temple that l stopped playing that game that day because I spent two hours in that temple leveling up my team for nothing. Another complaint is that there are too many spells. I mean, is it realy necessary? I don't think so. About the gameplay you can use the auto mode in the battles against normal enemies but with bosses, unless your team level is very high I recommend you to take control of your team although to be honest I was so upset with the golden temple thing that before the final battle of the first part of the game I grinded my team exploring new places so I end up beating the final boss with the auto mode because the machine knows more than me about what to do (although from time to time they use some attacks that I wouldn't have done) because if I take control I'd lose turns casting spells for nothing. My team with this final boss was: The main character (level 56) and H, R, and S (I don't want to spoil) and I only took control of some characters at the end of the battle to use PM potions. My recommendations: spend all the money and potions that you want (damn I have so many that I didn't use!). Although keep at least 200.000-300.000 to buy some stuff for the second part of the game. Also, use the forge and improve your items. And one last thing: when you find a place where you can save the game and heal and the enemies give you a good deal of experience take your time to rise a couple of levels. The first part of the game took me 82 hours. Ok. After almost 120 hours I've beaten the second part of the game. After reaching the first ending I recommend you to take a guide so you don't miss anything because there are many optional things that you can easily miss and also to not waste time visiting places. Before the final battle and having done almost all the optional things I had the hero at level 70 and then I decided to rise the hero a couple of levels (although I ended up leveling him to 75 in a place easy to farm) and I beat the final boss the first time only taking control to fill PM and doing somethings. The rest I left it to the autoplay. To sum up it's a good long game with great graphics although I must say that I was eager to finish everything of the second part of the game and finish it. I hope the next one be shorter.. I don’t know how this game has received such stellar reviews. I can only presume that reviewers are either biased due to nostalgia or have only played the earliest hours for the best impression. The graphics in this game can be a mixed bag. Many of the backgrounds and environments are very colourful and vibrant, although nothing really pushes the PS4 to the limit. The game suffers from a bit of blandness, as enemy sprites become very repetitive and you can see swapping of colour palettes. The game could have benefitted massively from more customisation, including seeing the armour you equip cosmetically change the character’s appearance. Speaking of which, I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a more bland protagonist devoid of character and personality, making him quite unrelatable. Dragon Quest 11 also dropped the ball a lot more when it comes to story. It falls on the old cliché of the chosen one who sets out to save the world and bands together a pack of misfits whose narratives become intertwined with predictable tropes such as ‘she’s actually your long-lost cousin’ etc. There are two problems here. Firstly, the story is incredibly generic, much like the game in general. Secondly, the story and game are simply far too bloody long. Coming up to 30 hours I didn’t even seem to be at the midpoint of the game and found it hard to justify going any further as the game had been quite generic thus far. Being a long game isn't a problem when it's compelling, but Dragon Quest would have held my interest knowing I had a shorter time left. One thing of note is the severe banality of the side-quests. Most resort to tired mechanics such as delivering or fetching, which is quite sad to see in a game released post-2016. If the previous 10 instalments are like this then I’m glad I missed them. The gameplay is potentially the best aspect of Dragon Quest, however this brings with it some questionable design choices. I loved the choices for combat to proceed automatically, however this also highlights the heavy grinding necessary. There is a mechanic where you can gallop into weaker enemies on your horse, defeating them immediately. This would have been better served by accumulating experience points for this to save on grinding. The game unfortunately repeats the same basic cycles found in JRPGs of old; go to a place, get **** into a mini-story, conclude it, forget it and move on. Each town is hard to distinguish from the last. Despite boasting a wide open map, the game is essentially a series of small sandboxes and the sailing aspect is as irritating as it is liberating. The skill tree is an interesting concept but the execution is limited, gating off too many skills behind obsolete skills. Contemporaneously this is also a rather basic skill tree, superseded by games like FF12, which was released in 2006. Throughout the game, this theme of being outdated becomes more prominent. What is quite bewildering about this game is that there are at least ten games that came before it, yet Dragon Quest 11 feels more like the first JRPG a company makes. Everything is basic, generic and cliched. We have the Yakuza series, Zelda, Nier Automata and Trails of Cold Steel that have all shown evolution into modern expeditions, while Dragon Quest 11 feels like I’m playing a remaster of an old game or a trip down memory lane. It is a difficult game to recommend amongst the aforementioned company.. Great jrpg game , maybe not best graphics and sometimes music to repetitive but ig you like the jrpgs this is a must play game. One of the best JRPG of all times. Graphics: 9/10 - Beautiful, always nice to see Toriyama´s monster and character designs. Story:9/10 - Long story, good characters, twists, nice cut scenes. What an adventure must be. Music: 8/10 - Even if the music is really good, it can get repetitive at times. Gameplay: 9/10 - Classical Turn-based JRPG with touch of modernity. Tons of things to do.. The game was good enough for me to go for full platinum playthrough, I liked it, but objectively it's absolutely generic cookie-cutter rpg like houndreds before. Hero saving world, strong woman, pervy old man, delicate healer girl, it's full of cliches and typical jrpg tropes. It's enjoyable for fans of the genre, but if you hate typical stuff from jrpgs stay away. I also think it could have been around 15-20 hours shorter, at the end I was pushing myself to finish it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Spent around 100+ hours on DQ11, never played a DQ game before but was thoroughly impressed. Part 1 of the game didn't have anything new to offer to the turn-based JRPJ landscape but was great at telling its story with a lovable cast of characters, it set up a strong foundation of the themes and setting of the world, meeting new monsters to encounter was a treat. Part 2 and 3 take a darker tone and it is a little hard to get used to at the start but is worth it in the end. If you are a fan of turn based combat then you don't want to miss DQ11.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best RPGs in years. They transferred a classic turn based RPG from the nineties in our times keeping all that is / was great while avoiding the parts that would not work well today. It is the kind of RPG what fans wanted for years from Square Enix. While I must admit that they use tropes or staples of the genre they also made twists, challenge your expectations in a good way and have some unique ideas. The story is really good. Your hero / protagonist did survive an attack that destroyed his hometown as infant and was adopted and raised in a small village. He bears the mark of the chosen one and after participating in the coming of age ritual the truth is revealed to him. Like I said it sounds pretty generic but you will soon get the first surprising twist. As the story progresses you get new party members, explore a fascinating world full of good characters and with enjoyable stories. The twists are good and I was always engaged in the story. What impressed me the most is what comes after you thought you finished the story. Be careful this is considered by many as spoilers! “Spoiler starts here”: You get a chance do undo the past. While you won the world suffered heavily. Basically you return to the half-point of the game and experience a new scenario, story and events. It felt like a second game for free. “End of spoilers”. Then there are the team members. One of the best cast in years because I struggled to pick my favorite team. All have their own stories, baggage and goals. Be it Erik the thief with a troubled hearth of gold, the twins Veronica and Serena, Sylvando the all should follow their hearths and everyone should be happy guy, Jade the female martial artist with depth and character and Rab the old man who is more than meets the eye. There is a character that I cant name because of spoilers. Then there is the graphic. As recommended by Dragon Quest standard the artworks are from Akira Toriyama who is most famous for Dragonball. The characters, monsters and world look gorgeous. They go for the anime look and I think it is fitting. The soundtrack however is a mixed back. They did not made an orchestral soundtrack and sometimes the music does not fit. However I will still say it is good but less than expected or what could be. There is a system to develop your characters. As you level up you get skill points that can be used to learn new abilities on an ability grid. You have often multiple approaches per character and you should not mix except for synergies or you have learned everything in your current role. For example Jade can use spears that are really strong weapons or claws that are weaker but have two attacks per action. Both variants have unique abilities and effects. Mostly it depends on preferences but there are of cause abilities that are more useful and if you are lucky you get some bonus skill points for unlocking abilities on the grid. Side note: Some abilities are locked on the grid until you acquired enough skills around them. There are a lot of side quest and some optional mini games. You can participate in horse races, collect medals for the academy, find weather cows, play casino games and more. I like the humor and some quirks for the characters. There is a robust crafting system in the game where you can make new equipment and / or improve your current once. What I felt is a missed opportunity are the pep powers. Your characters power up Super Saiyan style from time to time. However it is too unpredictable to use except you switch them out immediately and stop using them until you need them (Even this is not that usable). There are pep powered team combos with some good effect. I think the most useful is a combo from the protagonist, Jade and Sylvando. You can summon metal slimes for immense amounts of experience points from defeat (Erik has one attack that instant kills one because it has a guaranteed critical hit). Overall this was a surprisingly good game with lots of nostalgia and a world I liked to explored filled with good content / stories. Bonus: The Switch version is even better.. It harkens back to 80s JRPGs and the combat should be familiar but it never really feels like it's holding it back, if anything this is the boldest Dragon Quest game ever. The graphics are very good for its cartoony aesthetic and you'll be drawn into it not for the thrill of battle but for the cute monsters with dumb pun names. The music is okay, it gets repetitive. The combat is easy to understand. On normal mode as long as you face any enemies that look unique to you, you'll be fine, there are no random encounters. I love the versatility of equipment swapping and character swapping in battle. Every character fills just the right niche and you'll use all of them of your own volition probably. It's a bit buff and debuff heavy once you start to understand the game, with dedicated support characters. It doesn't punish being experimental with its skill tree as you can easily reallocate skill points. I guess my biggest criticism of the combat is the turn order being completely random with a dash of it being influenced by the agility stat. The generic set up of the story can be a turn off but you get in a episodic groove once the story really takes off. And then it goes really full gear in what I consider the 2nd act. The character development in that part of the game is great and it really shows how hard the developers tried to make every detail matter. The post-game has a storyline which is interesting lore wise but honestly I do take issue with some of the basic premise of it. But it does offer some more difficult combat trials. I think the main party of characters is great, I initially had negative perceptions of some of them but they all reveal themselves to be far more wholesome and troubled people than you initially believed. How I felt about characters such as Erik and Veronica drastically changed, I honestly thought Veronica was awful at first. It's a light-hearted affair but there are a couple moments that get a tad depressing in the game. One thing I thought was really cool about the North American version was some of the liberties they took with town dialogue. Every city featured some type of caricature like Spain, Italy, Hawaii, etc. but it's all very cute, the VAs are accented and have much more elaborate lines than the JP VAs, and there's this village where everyone speaks in haiku and then sometimes the kids break haiku for effect before stopping themselves. This is the kind of thing that happens when a localization team actually loves the product they're translating. It's easy to make a big massive JRPG map and just have it be point A to point B but Dragon Quest doesn't half ass any areas of the map. It has small but noteable flaws but I remember it as an endearing experience and that's what matters.. Beautiful, but a slog. + Really pretty graphics + decent story + interesting characters - that MIDI music holy f*ck! (you, can mod it in the steam version, but I rate the vanilla stuff here) - extremly slow game. Everything is slow. The story, the combat, even fights against low level monsters take forever, due to long a*s animations - dumb menus, almost everthing is hidden under Misc. So click, click, click, click until you get to see what you want - You lose all your fast travel points after a certrain event. Sea and land. Biggest joke ever. And you won't regain them, You'll need to revisit them. Serioulsy f*ck that. - Played it through and it took about 80 hours. At least 10-20 hours taken by the weak menu and inventory system and revisting all the places I have been before. - No idea how this game got such high scores. Besides from a tiny amount of mountable monsters there no new features and improvement compared to the last main games. Everything is the same! Critics are m*rons, cause that means we will get another PS2 game with nice graphics. Thanks for that, I guess!. This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I am in love with JRPG thanks to DQ 11.. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the game. It introduced my to the franchise and I was surprised by how much good quality content it has, will be a fan for all next releases. Now the low score is because of 2 things; combat system can be improved and Im nore of a action RPG kind of guy AND MAINLY because of the totally broken casino system which doesnt work and it requores you to deal with it to complete centain secondary missions (not even cheating exploits helped the 6+ horrible hours I had to struggle with that). Awful! Its forcing you to play longer for levels up. The game is like no ending also, mechanics are awful. DQ XI is the most beautiful JRPG so far. The only bad thing is the hair style of the main character.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of those games that I loved the first 40 hours of, but by about 100 hours in, when the story and gameplay started becoming tedious and repetitive, after I had fought the same re skinned enemies for the 8th or 9th time, all of its flaws became overwhelming. The game employees a lot of unnecessary padding, and takes the idea of grinding in a JRPG and cranks it up to 11. The characters are shallow and boring and their voice acting is what I would expect from a 4kids anime dub in the early to mid 90s. The music is also repetative and becomes obnoxious after several hours in. My playthrough of this game was the definition of a sunk cost fallacy. I was just ready for it to be over, but progression is hard locked behind mindless tedious grinding. This game is why so many people actively avoid JRPGs. Every trope is there.. Nowadays, while RPG now shifting toward action based, this game redefines and states that turn-based RPG can still be brilliant! What a masterpiece!. Really great game. Does everything you ask for in a JRPG really well and had a beautiful game world to explore. Definitely worth it!. No free upgrade to XI S, it feels so greedy from SQEX. Don't buy this game anymore and wait XI S if you really want it.. I give it a 8 only because the music wasn’t t","a lot of what makes Dragon Quest 11 is the friends we made along the way . the gameplay is as fine tuned as ever, and the story is just the bees **** . a lot of what makes Dragon Quest 11 is the friends we made along the way ."
"1,033.F-Zero: Maximum Velocity","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Variety in a racing game is a must. Courses need to feel unique, and maintain a steady difficulty curve throughout the game. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity seems to be aware of this in full, but chooses to ignore it at points. Some courses in this game feel unique, standing out in a sea of other courses that blend together. There's certainly a good game here, and I'd recommend giving it a go if you're into F-Zero. However, I would stress that later entries in the series such as F-Zero GP Legend manage to do a far superior job on the same original console, and this game feels a little more dated than perhaps it should, especially when comparing these games side by side.. Impressive version of the SNES classic that works well on the Advance. In fact as a one player game, I'd say it's a little better than Mario Kart.. Very solid and under appreciated F-Zero game. The game is addicting once you get used to the controls. Also, the music is great (especially Tenth East Zone). This game definitely stays true to the excellence that is the F-Zero series revamped to suit portability. This game is definitely worth a buy if you own a GBA.. When I first got a GBA as a kid this was the first title I got for it, I remember liking it a lot but I'm not sure if I loved it exactly. Going back to it over the past couple of weeks I can see it's a very good game, that makes the most of the GBA's hardware to create an experience that still feels fast and enjoyable, but it isn't without its faults. On the presentation side of things it doesn't feel that much like F-Zero, there are no character models and Captain Falcon is nowhere to be seen (although a ship referencing him does come as an unlockable later on). The music, likely due to the GBA's lack of audio ability, fails to reach the driving levels of the F-Zero X and GX soundtracks and there's rarely more than 2 or 3 racers on the screen at once which is a world away from the hoardes of racers on the aforementioned games. This is all likely due to the GBA's lack of horsepower however. Where this game excels is in the most important part, the feel of the racing. The sense of speed is still there, particularly when you use your boost. The cars handle well and taking corners is a joyful challenge. The tracks are surprisingly varied considering the limitations of the mode 7 engine it's built on and there's a decent amount of them once you unlock everything. The game is a little light on vehicles though with only 4 to start with and a few more to unlock. The only complaints I have with the actual gameplay are that I wasn't a fan of the random yellow cars that seem to be driving on the track really slowly for no reason whatsoever other than to annoy you and get in your way and the strange system where to get past a race you have to be in the top certain amount of racers after lap one, and further up each lap until you have to finish in the top 3. If you fail to meet this threshold after any of the laps you automatically lose. There's no table at the end of each race to see how each player is doing and so you have no real rival, you essentially get the same reward for finishing 3rd in every race as you do 1st. The table and being able to smash up your rival to get ahead of him on it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the other F-Zeros I've played for me and their decision to not use this here is a strange on in my eyes. On the difficulty front I think it's definitely challenging and the hardest difficulty is only recommended for the really hardcore out there (I got frustrated with it pretty quickly). There's definite rubber-banding going on as always although it seemed a lot less obvious (at least to me) than other racing games I've played from this time. Overall this game excels in the feel of the racing, which is essentially the most important part. However it fails in some of the other areas and does things which I didn't entirely enjoy. It's a great game to pick up and have a race at and I'm sure I'll be doing that often with there still not being a newer alternative for portable F-Zeroing many years later. I just wish there were tables after each race, Captain Falcon was actually in the game, and that the cups didn't take longer than my average bus journey.","F-Zero: Maximum Velocity seems to be aware of this in full . some courses in this game feel unique, standing out in a sea of other courses . presentation doesn't feel that much like F-Zero, there are no character models ."
"1,034.Destiny: The Taken King","this expansion is what got me into Destiny 9 years ago on my PS3 everything it added was good sure it wasn't busted as y1 but it was much more polished and the game finally delivered on its vision the friends I've made the endless nights spent raiding will never be forgotten its truly a once in a lifetime memory only replicated by forsaken the franchises best villain a great story one of the best campaign final missions only beaten by the final shape and top 3 raids along with huge content like factions sparrow racing league and so much more after forsaken this is the best destiny expansion and it's not even close. *The Taken King* is widely regarded as one of the best expansions for *Destiny*, bringing a substantial amount of content, improvements, and new mechanics. In this expansion, players face Oryx, the Taken King, who arrives to avenge his son Crota’s death. The story is more complex and cinematic than previous expansions, with missions that provide genuine narrative depth, making the adventure fully engaging. The addition of a new explorable area, the Dreadnaught, introduces a dense and mysterious setting filled with secrets and **** expansion also introduces three new subclasses—one for each class—that enhance gameplay options: Titans gain the Solar *Sunbreaker* subclass, Hunters acquire the Void-powered *Nightstalker*, and Warlocks unlock the Arc-based *Stormcaller*. These abilities add variety and strategy, offering players fresh ways to tackle content.*The Taken King* includes one of the most acclaimed raids, *King’s Fall*, known for its complexity and excellent design, requiring coordination and skill from the team. New missions, strikes, and PvE activities keep players engaged over the long term, supported by endgame content and an increased Light level cap. PvP also sees updates, with new maps and modes expanding the competitive experience.Visually, the expansion stands out with the dark, ominous design of the Dreadnaught, effectively conveying the threat posed by Oryx and his corrupted followers. The soundtrack is another highlight, featuring epic and dramatic compositions that elevate key story moments and **** summary, *The Taken King* offers a rich blend of story, challenging content, and expanded gameplay options, setting a new standard for *Destiny* expansions and delivering a memorable experience for players.. The Taken King is a fantastic follow up to the original Destiny and made it 10x better with better graphics, an excellent story, intriguing characters, and overall a fantastic expansion to Destiny that was actually great.. that dlc is the reason why destiny is from 5/10 to a 10/10 it was huge the best dlc in game history id say. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun PvP, decent campaign, fun raids. So much grind but it felt good. Some people hated this game but it was a great time sink and a lot of fun. Huge step in the right direction. Bought the expansion cause of the good word of mouth even though I hated the base game. But I ended up getting an completely new viewpoint on this game! Could not stop playing it for months. It’s basically how the base game should’ve been. The 3 new subclasses were intriguing, the raid was addicting and adding infusion made loot become way more interesting (because of the fact that you could make your favorite gun/gear even stronger). Adding new strikes, missions and stuff to the crucible made this game responsible for the electric bills becoming expensive.... Destiny: The Taken King is a big improvement to the original Destiny and it's first two DLC packs. The sheer amount of content and quality of life improvements, make Destiny feel for the first time, that it may someday reach it's true potential.. i never liked destiny when it first came out, but the hype before actually having the game was really high. The story was lame, the multiplayer was ok and the shooting mechanics was all it was worth. then they gave extra lame content with the promise of giving new fun stuff in the near future. And now that i've played the taken king i can say nothing has changed and that this game is the same crap. Please bungie stop ripping us off asking us to buy something that could've been included in the original game.. Best dlc of this game! So many content, great raid, strikes, bosses, swords, interesting exotic quests and more importantly new subclass. Hundreds of hours of fun. Looking back a year and half (when the Taken King expansion launched) I was hoping Bungie would get their act together and really put effort into making the game it was meant to be. While there were still problems with it, the Taken King period (from its release until Rise of Iron) was a very well done year. It had a decent story that was passable and at least something to care about. It reworked its quest and stories and made them more clever. The raid was not as complex as Vault of Glass, but not as simple and exploitative like Dark Below, making the middle ground work well and having a blast sending Oryx back to hell. The reworks and changes made from the first year dramatically bumped up the quality of the game's overall MMORPG-like nature. It carried alot of the old problems first year Destiny had, but made more far more optimistic for Destiny's future. It was a good time and I enjoyed it the most of Destiny's first three years.. possibly one of the best dlc's ever (that i have played in gamehistory) pluspoints + a lots of content if you compare it with the dark below and house of wolves + a masterpiece raid + some good multiplayer maps came with this dlc + creative strikes + grinding is way better then in year 1 now negative points - you still have to grind strikes over and over - some bad multiplayer maps came with this dlc+ always the same maps so a very good dlc but for people who hate repetivety it will still feel boring. A masterful DLC that's worth the cost, this DLC turns Destiny from a good game to a great one. The game feels very polished, and the story goes from meh to wow. Honestly, if they had released this with the base game, it would've been a much better game.. I first played Destiny on first release of year 1, played for about 6 months and have to admit started to lose interest. TTK completely renewed my love of the game. Whilst I understand some of the criticism around Bungie and greedy cash grabbing I must say for the amount of time I've played both year 1 and year 2 I have had excellent value. The game play is incredible, and although I'm not a particularly brilliant player I absolutely love the PVP. I would prefer better matchmaking, I don't have many friends that play and I think it would really benefit for a looking for group option. If you like both the PVE story side, and the PVP you will get months of gaming out of this. Great game hopeful that the new DLC will bring even more depth. OK, now its a game worth playing with enough story line mission and variety to justify the effort of buying it. Mind me, boring grinding its still part of it BUT there a major improvements in all areas. It can be intimidating at first (I started to replay after one year stop since i was disappointed as many about the first year edition) because everybody is level 40 however its easy and fun to reach it.. I hated Destiny when it first came out, the only draw was its similarities to Halo. The Taken King has elevated the game to something I can actually play full time, like a lot of MMORPGs from a decade ago. The new subclasses are also a great addition, especially the warlock's. You can feel like a real mage now!. Very poor, same old content, same loading screens, full price. Load of tosh. Grind, Grind, Grind lets see how much money we can make. You even have to pay real money to make your character do a different dance. Destiny has a 10 year plan to rinse as much money as they can out of you.. This game is one of the most disappointing, if not the most dissapointing game in the history of video games. Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this game. Do not listen to the critics as they are payed actors who will get black listed if they mention anything negative. The owners are not trying to create a fan base. They don't give a **** All they care about is money. If you buy this game, it will only a few a months before a new DLC will come out and you will have two options. Either buy out of necessity or get thrown away and get half of your usual content cut. Please do not support this company, because they're what's wrong with this industry nowadays. Thank you.. Literally the greatest video game ever made. A true masterpiece in every sense of the word. Destiny makes other developers look like they aren't even trying. i cant understand why people dont see how great game destiny is . i find impossible why there so much hate for this game . i mean open your eyes , destiny is a really promising game , it is the future finally found us . no other game is exactly the same with destiny and i found that is nearly a masterpiece and it has marvelous dungeons countless enemies to defeat , and the multi player i find it good enough as well . people open your eyes ! the times are changing and you are still so back in the past . even minecraft has better reviews than destiny , for god sake in what world are we living ??. I have mixed emotions in this game. The game play is great and there are more activities to do. I'm also glad that Bungie is starting to have some character development. In the end, it gets boring after all of the useless grinding.. Don't listen to those who are saying there's not a lot of content here. There is a ton of new content in this game. After completing the main story line, there are at least 6 new quests that open, continuing on side story's that were hinted at in the first year and providing a lot more playability. The story telling is vastly improved, both in the new cutscenes (of which there are a lot) and in the voice acting. Nathan Fillion and Nolan North provide great dialogue, which is funny on many occasions.. I've been playing for only a month now. I enjoy the game but it isn't the greatest setup for a MMORPG but the co-op is fun. With that said the amount of issues I've had with Bungie over this month has gotten ridiculous. There have been outages three out of the last four weeks. With several outages happening during each week. I understand that updates are needed but there should be no need for this considering how much money they have put into this game and how much we have paid as gamers. On top of the many updates and outages. The fact that one can't play offline is a terrible feature that should be changed. Also Bungie will kick you out of the middle **** no matter where you're at without warning. Unless you subscribe to their twitter feed... Overall with Destiny being an overall good game I would have given an 8. But since I can't play the game I paid money for because Bungie can't get their act together drops my overall score to a 3. Added points if the capability of playing offline is added. I'll give it another week or two and if things don't get better then I'm going to burn this game and never come back.. The Taken King is definitely an improvement from the vanilla game but work is still needed. It was a great effort to avoid making people feel alienated by opening multiple routes to getting the highest level gear, you can do raids, strikes or even bounties for a shot at this stuff. At this point, the game has become more suited to PvP players who play the Trials of Osiris or Iron Banner - The presence of unpredictable challenges as a way to keep the game fresh however PvE has experienced a massive drought for almost a half year which has seen many of my friends move away from the game. The content itself isn't bad but the quick lack of it is, and Bungie's inability to make this content prevalent/ not coming up with new ideas is taking the game downhill. The April Update definitely came as a refreshment but it wasn't a game changer. I view the game positively because it has bought me into competitive PvP and helped me meet other gamers like myself, However if you are looking for a diversion here, it may or may not last you long. The Kings Fall is definitely a raid to try out but the Vault of Glass in the original game was such a good raid that I can only wait till September to see if the new raid outdoes the fantastic predecessor. 8/10.. Quite frankly my favourite game of all time. Love everything about it. Never get's boring, and just when you think you might be tired of it something new comes along, and the multi-player strikes are endlessly entertaining.. Vanilla destiny is very bad. The taken king portion however is good. The mission are way better than the original and there's a few game modes/event that if they weren't there, the game would not be the same. Since April they changed a little the game to let you find max leveled gear doing things you like the most which was not the case before that (you need to be either really good at Osiris or doing the last raid on hard) and that,s a good thing. However i kept wondering to myself why i was still playing that game. Overall the game is good but the only reason to come back is because you become addicted to finding better gear. I would not see any reason to play that game once you're on max level.. I got this game for free at Best Buy, and was the WORST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED, even that i didn't payed for it, so bad, boring gameplay, borring story, even if you play with friend will be annoyed by it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. (i have played 60+ hours) Destiny is an amazing game with beautify graphics an amazing sound track but very little story.... the game is in its prime when your in a fireteam of 6 doing a raid with mates and the PvP has really improved from destiny (year one) if you like grinding out games for multiple hours on end you should buy it if you have not already. I got this game bundle with my limited edition Taken king PS4. The game came bundle with the original destiny and the DLCs. From the perspective of a new player to the series the game is really good. The story, graphics and shooting elements are fantastic. The game looks amazing unfortunately you are limited to following a certain path and can't freely explore the planets, another bad thing is that the game feels a little short in content and I also wish there was an looking for group LFR option like wow to do the raids. Even if you got items with lower light lvl.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A huge improvement on the Destiny that we got at launch, The Taken King is finally the Destiny that people expected. A boost to the story, as well as new sub-classes for each class, new missions and new raids, everything about The Taken King expands and improves on the lackluster original Destiny adventure. The voice acting, particularly from Nathan Fillion, is much more charismatic and has much more energy than in the original 'story'. Though still not particularly fantastic, the story added by The Taken King is solid and provides incentive to keep playing on and on. The gameplay is still as flawless as ever, and the levelling system is much simpler now the better equipment you have will dictate how high your level is. The lack of matchmaking when it comes to raids is still baffling. Raids are the best part of Destiny, and will provide a much more purposeful end game for everyone if matchmaking was there. In fact, the end game content is the only thing preventing The Taken King from getting higher than a 7. All in all though, a huge improvement, with even more potential.. Easily the best co-op FPS experience ever in my view. Let down by a lack of in-built ability to find people to play with. If only matching support was there for raids this would be a 10. Granted the SP campaign is a little dull for me co-op is where the action is at.. I've had the game for less than 48 hours and I'm already at lvl 32. All story missions are way below my character lvl and the story is incoherent at best, utterly meaningless at worst. All strikes are way below it too. There's no easy way of joining a team to do a raid. The crucible PvP is fun and feels like it's the main game. That say s a lot really. What i really DON'T get, is why people dis this game. I didn't start year one, but I did play taken king, dark below and house of wolves in the legendary edition, and my mind was blown. Sure, the main destiny storyline **** balls, but the real experience is the social game and the DLC, the taken King, along with dark below and house of wolves. The game isn't perfect, many improvements could be made here and there, but overall, I like the game.. AMAZING GAME!! A great FPS game. Graphics are good. The only problem is the game can feel really repetitive at time i feel like i'm doing the same thing every mission or at least something similar. But still when you play this game with a couple of your friends its AMAZING. It is one of the best games in 2015 hands down.. Not your same old boring Call of Duty game. So if you're looking for something like COD this is not it. By the makers of Halo This feels ""KINDA"" Halo-ish. Gun play is great, supers feel great ""superpowers"" (if you're looking for something thats more based in ""reality"" this is not for you at all.) This is a Sci-fi, Fantasy, MOBA-Lite. The BIG problem is the story very open ended and not very detailed. Another problem is the repetitiveness of the game play you'll be playing the same missions over and over just to level up. You almost have to play with friends to get the full experience of this game. I had tons of fun because i really didn't care about the story (i don't play games for story) and I had friends who played the game. And i'm a **** for leveling things up. (From pokemon to RPG characters) I gave it a 7 because I know not everyone can get over those flaws.. This is what Destiny should've been. Design variety, and intriguing story, fun multiplayer. I could probably say that The Taken King is the true Destiny. While it's a little too short in my opinion, it didn't feel like it need to be longer than the length it already was. It's still longer than the previous DLC for the game, though. However, for a DLC in this length, it's a bit too high priced. $40? That's beyond EA's standards! However, I was still able to look past it and enjoy The Taken King's massively improved gameplay. Way better firefights, less walking around the barren wasteland they call an open-world, and the best raid in Destiny (in my opinion). Overall, The Taken King fixes every major complaint that made the original game so mediocre. I highly recommend this expansion to anyone who likes Destiny (for some reason) and people who wanted to see more out of the game.. One of the best games I've ever played. Its so addictive with superb graphics. and Its getting better and better with every DLC added. The multi-player is astonishing, you can spend hundreds of hours easily with this game.. Destiny The taken king, is a flawless and extremely fun for a first person shooter. While the Destiny universe itself seems intriguing, the storyline is told in such an incoherent manner that it's hard not to be turned off by all the technobabble. Fortunately the co-op shooter mechanics are absolutely perfect. The loot system can be maddening, but in a way it adds to the game's addictiveness. Love It!. A bad expansion to a bad game. There are few area that Destiny Taken King don't disappoint. Gunplay is great but the rest of the game is a boring grind. The only real new area to the game get boring after a couple hours of play. The raid is fun the first time but becomes a complete grind if you want to get to 320. Bungie should really be ashamed of how poorly the expansion was implemented.. the most unfairly I have ever been treated as a customer. I've enjoyed this game a great deal. But I cannot continue playing unless I pay money. And the things I work for get removed, and this company wants me to buy a new game to continue playing. How can your remove essentially all features from me, unless I pay $40? It is unfair, and honestly I do not know how a mass-market game like this game can be operated as such legally. It is, to me, the most unfairly I have ever been treated as a customer.. It's not good at all and not worth and ALL THE MONEY JESUS CHRIST. They added microtansactions, nothing fun and absolutly nothing better. And if you didn't pay the expansion, you can't PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They lock away content that you even pay for !!!!!!!! Shame on you bungie, shame on activision, shame on you, LUKE **** ARE THE DEVIL OF GAMING!!!!. Simply put, there is no game on the market that comes anywhere close to what Destiny does. As a game design enthusiast, I feel they just got so much right in this title. - The three weapon load out is a golden triangle. Switching between primary, secondary and heavy weapons in pitched battles feels clutch. You have options, but not too many. The power level for each feels highly appropriate. The available combinations to experiment with are numerous. They pioneered this tight + controlled weapon loadout concept in the original Halo and the design language remains strong in Destiny. - To continue with the point above, the gameplay and pace for an FPS feels perfect to me. Having the gunfighting component complimented with melee, grenades, and super we see that another golden triangle emerges. Tying stats to these skills was smart. Most all of they make your guardian truly feel *powerful* and unique. The RPG component of this game really has merit and doesn't detract from the FPS elements in the slightest. The skill trees remain fairly balanced between and among classes. - While the story was definitely...lacking in plot and exposition, the level + world design has been consistently spot on. Every area feels textured, detailed and respectively thought out. So many beautiful vistas. Travelling through the world on your sparrow can be a pure joy - providing a welcome break from the fettered pace of combat. Another beautiful and under-appreciated design feature. - The sound design in this game is the best I've ever come across. No title matches Destiny my honest, humble opinion when it comes to sound effects. Certain exotics are just sound addictive. Sparrows sound amazing. The hugely varied enemies all have amazing triggered sounds upon death and it compliments the FPS mechanics perfectly. You just want to keep popping off enemies. - They finally added meaningful multiplayer to an FPS. Competitive PvP is great and all, but what really makes Destiny sweet is the strikes and raids. These are the bread and butter of Destiny and really what make it stand apart from other games on the market. I've been a huge proponent of cooperative gameplay ever since Halo 1 truly pioneered split-screen play. Playing with other humans against AI just makes it so much more involving and fun, it's hard to put a finger on it. The loot from these activities is a huge draw that keeps you coming back for more, reminds me very much of Diablo 2. Completing your first raid feels like a huge accomplishment in teamwork. The feeling is really only matched by a handful of MMORPGs. Bungie deserves all the credit in the world for bringing this not only to FPS players, but to console users as well. - The lore is captivating and the entire premise of the world is highly alluring. I love how this is a science fiction title based in our own solar system, not some randomly named star-system we could care less about. The combination of familiarity and wonder really comes together for a backdrop that is truly unmatched for the vast majority of game titles. This is a game I willingly invest myself in because it's just so damn cool. Coolest game I've played in the last decade. This is obviously a highly subjective opinion but I just had to say it.. If you enjoy gameplay more than story, you will enjoy this. I cannot remember having played any other fps that felt this good. As a person gaming now for more than 20 years I really don't understand why the game gets these low user reviews. Maybe it is too expensive? Get a job. Enjoy story over gameplay? Watch a movie. Get your ass kicked in the crucible? And you call ****. Pfft. Great game!. yeah don't bother with this game. bungie seems to like giving the players as little content as possible, for as much money as possible. your money is better spent elsewhere.. Before the expansion, Destiny was an okay game. maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10. The expansions released before this were decent, especially House of Wolves, but this one blew both of those out of the water. The Taken King offers many additions to the game, such as new modes, a new story, new weapons and subclasses, and many more. Whether or not you've been with this game from the beginning like I have, or you are just chiming in, this is a great addition to your gaming library.. Hey it even has a new area now, let's totally charge 20 bucks. I'm amazed they managed to sell the first two DLC's with barely any content at all. I had 1 month of fun with this game because I got Legendary Edition (I was new to the game until then). I wonder how people manage to play this for a year playing even less content than I played. I don't get Destiny fans. The biggest problem with this game is that Bungie made some very dumb decisions that totally destroy the endgame. They ditched their old content and made people focus on the last DLC. A game that is already so small becomes even smaller. I don't know (and never will) any previous raids because there's no reason for anyone to run them since the loot is concentrated in King's Fall. Another aspect is that they limit the main quest (raid) to one run per week. So I just play the game on tuesdays. If they wanted to limit the progression they could find other ways to do that. That's just bad design. Positives - Good combat. It's a great shooter, when there's reason for you to actually play the game; - Good graphics, I guess. I was not amazed by any means, but it's competent. Enemies designs are nice. Negatives: - Bad endgame design decisions; - Crazy small world for a MMO-type game. I mean, WTF, it lasts one week (the whole game, all DLC's included); - Get's boring ridiculously fast; - Poor loot system (I can't even imagine how it was in vanilla times. I hear it was even worse); - Terrible story, just terrible. Generic sci-fi art style. I'm not too much into this sci-fi games.. overall, decent game. I got everything for 75 USD, a good deal. And I GRINDED and grinded till I was lvl 40 light 260. Then I hit a wall, I couldn't get better because the next raids were too hard and the previous didnt give enough loot. so then I grinded, (i know, I did lots of grinding, thats what this game is about) Then the reason I quit, was because I went to ZUR, and I spent so much time getting those strange coins, and I got a random exotic heavy gun, I got a gallahorn, hurrayyy, if it wasnt year 2. That thiing only had 175 damage. After I saw the damage and then read it again, I closed the game and played everything but destiny. I liked the game but it is going downhill.. Absolutely the biggest money **** of a ""game"". Cant even call it a ""game"" cause its so incomplete, over charging players, locking content that has been out since launch behind several paywalls. And the dumbest fan base ever, the sheep they have hooked will defend the game even when the original creators left and disavowed the company. So sad. Never buy another bungledvision product.. First off don't listen to the majority of the critics reviews for this game, they clearly have not played more than a couple of hours if any. As a player of 1200+ hours, having completed all the content of the game the two main thought's that come to mind when considering Destiny or Destiny The Taken King are Disappointing and Frustrating. As with all the 'expansions' including this one I had cleared all the content in less than a week. The only thing that keeps you playing is that they have a random loot system which either gives you no loot at all or more often than not requires you to grind the same content over and over, for example as I write this I have roughly 40 or more clears of the current raid and yet I have received only 2 helms out of 40+ chances. With this expansion they have introduced Light levels which make you stronger so with gear perks when doing any content you are looking at triple random rolls on any loot you get. Firstly will it drop the item you need, second will it be of higher light than your current one and third will it have decent perks on it. They removed the option of re-rolling the perks and infusing any lower item with a higher one only transfers 80% of the light level to the new item (70% in the case of an exotic). So if you got a 300 item you liked the look of and with the perks you're looking for you would need probably 1 x 310, 1 x 315 and 1 x 320 items (of the same slot) for infusion in order to use it a maximum. I drone on but what this basically amounts to is a huge waste of time. The gun play is great and the only real reason to play it beyond 40 hours. However they nerf everything continuously in order to create new meta weapons in order to keep you playing longer collecting the next one and testing your weapons out looking for an advantage. I could write a better point by point review but if you really want to know more just visit the Bungie feedback forums. Destiny has been compared to a hamster wheel or Skinner box where we are just play testing for them for Destiny 2 or how to rinse the most amount of money out ****. I'll save you all some time, do not by this game or any of the previous ones. When Destiny 2 comes out check reviews before buying it.. What was a mess in the vanilla Destiny was all fixed up in TTK. It's clear Bungie listen to the feedback they are given and we finally got the story we wanted, the gameplay we wanted and the overall enjoyable feel from playing this game that we wanted. It's easy to see a lot of time and effort was put into revitalising the franchise and I'm happy to say after not playing the game for a few months out of boredom, I am thrilled to be experiencing this great content. Even after finishing everything I still play daily now with friends as it has finally become the great experience for us that we originally wanted.. To help anyone on deciding what to do; buy or don't buy? Don't buy this if you don't want to risk feeling like your brain is being microwaved inside your own head. The game overall isn't bad in the graphics department or gunplay, but if you enjoy a good story and well written characters you will be left utterly disappointed. The games main problem is that it wasn't working correctly in the first place and was unfinished upon release, the DLC should have been free. I played it first-hand and it isn't anything to revel over in anyway. It is just like the vanilla game, but with ""better"" weapons and armor. Main issues are rooted towards specific features of the original game from the multiplayer are locked, so that you are forced to pay for the DLC. This game reminded me a lot of Star Wars Infinity and Star Wars Battlefront EA. You might have more fun if you buy the DLC's and even then you'll will feel like you are forcing your hand to find fun in a creatively devout game. The only way to have fun with this cliche Sci-Fi adventure is with friends, on your own you'll want to beat your head against a wall.. This purchase was a skeptic and optimist's mistake. After you get done with all of the missions and quests, you end up just going right back to the grind fest the game was before it. It was definitely not worth $40 some had to pay, or $60 for the Legendary Edition. It's a rip-off. I give this disappointment a three ou","this expansion is what got me into Destiny 9 years ago on my PS3 everything it added was good sure it wasn't busted as y1 but it was much more polished and the game finally delivered on its vision . the soundtrack is another highlight, featuring epic and dramatic compositions that elevate key story moments . players face Oryx, the Taken King, who arrives to avenge his son Crota’s death ."
"1,035.Heroes of the Storm","best gameof all time sad blizzard is such garb company and ruined it like everything. Almost 9 nine years since I started playing it and it still give me a lot of entertainment in every battle! There always something new to discover, mastering more heroes gameplay, maps and assets unnoticed details and more multiplayer fun!. Never in my life have I seen such a terrible matchmaking I wonder how people play this piece of crap game Trash game like league of legends. Far more fun than League of Legends. In LoL are only hardtriers and far to many toxic people. HotS is much better.. I've been playing Heroes since Beta, and let me tell you this game is the most addictive game I've ever played. I can't put it down, even though Blizzard doesn't update with new content any longer. I was sad to see it at this state, but I still overwhelmingly recommend all to try this MOBA. The game is very well made with great gameplay mechanics, variety of heroes and maps, sound/music, ARAM mode, and customization with talents. Overall, definitely a 10/10 game. The only game I've NEVER put down longer than a few weeks at a time.. Hots just best...........,............................best MOBA i have ever **** you didnt play it try it now. Blizzard do something..... For the future of a HOTS.. The game itself is amazing, but matchmaking is the problem. Every match is rigged, there's always a idiot who will play solo leaving the team behind making it 5x4. For a competitive game it should be at least fair, if the matchmaking decides who win, what's the point in playing this game? Report system doesn't work so bad players can keep the bad behavior without consequence. The day today is a complete failure, awful, waste of time, absolute garbage. Stay away till they fix the matchmaking.. By itself is not a bad game. The main problem is that your own efforts are ALWAYS wasted. You can carry a bad team, you can't makeup for other people's mistakes. You can even play greatly but it's just nauseating to lose a game where you played good and EVEN JUST 1-2 teammates played terribly, and sometime a single teammate playing poorly is enough to lose a game. It's just unfair to the player, making it an unfair game. You just have to hope the RNG-God to get a decent team when playing solo.. It is a shame that such a creative game was cut short on support after some time. It is such a refreshing MOBA without boring mechanics of lasthitting and gearing up. Different Maps are just unique and it has a refreshing game duration of 20 - 30 minutes that is just more interesting and relaxing than other games of the genre with maintaining the high level of competitiveness. The limited ammunition of the turrets was also very interesting, which was later removed due to some critics. All in all it is the best MOBA out there where you can really feel the difference of gameplay with all Heroes and not ever feel like their abbilities are copy-pasted.. Best MOBA ever made. Bring it back Phil Spencer! Do it! I know you want to!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best in it's kind of games,really a new word in MOBA. Big sad that Blizzard don't want to support it anymore. Hopefully Microsoft will change anything.. Great team co-op. It's really a disappointment that Blizzard sort of placed Heroes of the Storm on the back burner. The concept behind it was truly fantastic, bringing together these beloved characters from the Blizzard universe. Sadly, it seems that the game doesn't rake in the profits for Blizzard quite like Diablo Immortal does, which is why it's no longer receiving updates. It's a bit of a shame, considering the potential it had.. Used to have a lot of hype around this game when it first came out. Years gone by, not a single significant change to the game. Game is really easy and very little room for competitiveness. Also the devs/blizz probably gave up on this game.. Best moba out there! Lots of unseen mechanics added to the genre and you play with loved characters from blizz universe. Fast paced gameplay with a lots of teamfighting and not very long matches.. The best and most fun MOBA out there. It's sad that it's no longer being supported. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There are no words to describe how bad this garbage is. Spare yourself the pain and do something else, let this trash die the way it's supposed to. Best MOBA ever. Amazing community, great, lively and colorfull graphics, smooth gameplay, really addicting, original maps, ideas and heroes, LoL couldn't be ever as great as this game.. The only moba game on the market that I really enjoyed. I liked the familiar heroes and their catchphrases. Unfortunately, the matchmaking is the worst. QM is practically unplayable for some heroes and pretty unfair in team composition. Ranked play was the biggest problem what ruined this game. If one played with 5 friends you could win 90% games in a row. If you played alone it was an absolute misery where you could lose 15 games in a row.. I like the gameplay beyond other MOBA but sadly Blizzard abandoned it so I think it's better keeping it in good memories than playing the same patch without any new contents for years.. Despite the fact that it is original with well-designed characters and maps, matchmaking and the social system with reports is as terrible as possible. Of the many multiplayer games played, this is the worst game because of its huge lack of sociality. The developers never wanted people to play it. This game could have stole the first rank of the MOBA genre if it was release one year before. This game is so underestimated.. This game is a new experience in moba gameplay, a funtastic game. Go to battle net and enjoy!. This definitely was the best MOBA. But sadly they canceled the game. My biggest hope in gaming would be that Blizzard is focusing on this game again, and maybe even a console version. But rating the game, how it was back in 2015-2016. Then it was Legend and a clear 10/10. I love that the game is focusing on Team play, so all the team members have shared XP pools.. 2 random kids make dota in map redactor, big company make this. this is not okay. u know? try urself in another professions pls stop this u cant make games, okay maybe mobile, but its maxixum for u like company.. Even after thousands of hours of gameplay, it is still amazing to play. Even though patches and content are rare now, the game is in a great state and is a ton of fun.. This is easily one of the best MOBAs I've ever played. It's not too complicated, visually pleasing, and the various characters can be unlocked just by playing the game. The gameplay is so fun that I often wish the games didn't end up in a steamroll situation where your team is at a lower level and you can't keep up with the enemy team. Sadly, the game has been ignored by the developers since around early 2020. There has not been any new content, and it's currently on life support.. Yet another abandoned game by Blizzard, no major updates for 4+ years, a very toxic community, and the worst league system I've ever seen.. I actually really really liked it! And I would not hesitate saying this was the game I played best!. I'll give it a 6 because I had a blast playing it, but as time goes it get worse wnd worse. The game removed unecessary and boring stuff like last hitting/farming from another mobas and made a team-oriented moba, where you have no chance 1 v 5. Additionally, different maps provide more variety, where various compositions will excel, but some players still can't use this to their advantage. Edit: while playing unranked our tead did not know what to pick and therefore we were knocked out of the picking phase back to menu and got banned for 1 game from unranked/ranked - had to win 1 game of QM, but after 2 matches of **** quick match provides, we uninstalled. Nova/deathwing/genji/tracer every game. Why can't heroes like this just be deleted? **** all of you guys who main these heroes On the other hand, quick match was and still is the biggest flaw of the game where you get idiotic compositions. You either stomp or get stomped. Sounds like fun, eh? Yet I am not suprised because most of players want to carry and play assassins. Nobody cares about a good team comp on QM. Reconnecting system is bad too. If you lost connection, you may just wait until the match is over because you will not rejoin in time. Ranked is far from ideal too, people are clueless about positioning or draft, even in diamond/master. Trollpicks such as nova/gazlowe/murky are a common thing. Blizzard could take instalockers, afk players, and people picking multiple roles more seriously since matchmaking is the core handicap in this game. My account is banned for chat violation and you know what I've been through if you played this game. Yes I got really mad sometimes because of the toxic profile you get matched with. If you can put up with cancer players go for it and download. Terrible matchmaking and drafting mechanism only awards bad players and pushes dedicated good gamers out of this space. I have wasted my years to play with troll players that pick heroes that can be easily countered or the same roles already picked by the other teammates. Matchmaking system is just terrible. No cooperation, no communicaion, no help, players that don't know what they do etc. This game has a lot to go though but its already dead anyways.. The ban system killed this game and the community. It harmed thousands, if not millions of players psychologically. They didn't implement anything that makes it fair and doesn't actually favor the reporter. There is no relief for very old bans, you will get the next one staggered. Automatically by reporters who can report as much as they want. In a game, which also has a mute/ignore button! This game suffers from toxic reporters who got and get support and high invested players who got and get banned without any need for a reason. The remaining playerbase is has the perfect comparison to hipocrits in the new political situation. E.g. arguing for climate change and co2 reduction but also flying twice per year into holidays.. Best MOBA! No more bad game mechanics of last hitting. No longer do you have to compete against your team in a team game.. The game is fine, but is so simple and is hard to find a party to play. The game is dead now.. This game fails in every aspect. Terrible balance, terrible matchmaking, terrible UI, and they don't even let you surrender.. If you are not spending real money they will nerf you. Your damage will register but it will not effect other players as much. They will also team you up with other nerfed players. This will improve the morale of money spending players and cause them to spend more money. Don't be a victim to their money **** agenda.. No teamskill balance in quick matches here. 95% of games are either super-easy walk or are impossible to win. Feels like they enforce 50% winrate and not with quality matching but with ""wow, u are above 50% and u need to lose immediately"" rule.. **** piece of **** without matchmaking without any comeback mechanics. Ok. We dont have comeback mechanics why they don't added simple button like surrender i dont understand.. I have been playing Blizzard's game Heroes of the Storm since the day of the game's Alpha launch. This was around 4/2015. Around 5/2021, I was permanently banned and an account valued at well over $1000 is no longer accessible to me. I have been reported numerous times for abusive chat. And this is completely understandable as I have been silenced on multiple occasions for it. Understandably. I have a bit of an issue with expressing my irritability verbally and pressuring people to play correctly. In many cases, however, it was not a matter of straight up crude vulgarity. Although early in the game's life it certainly was, over the years I matured a bit and stuck to more specific claims of other player's performance. Addressing such issues play by play, as many neurotic players do. - My biggest argument is that if Blizzard's matchmaking service was effective, then there would be less frustration displayed by players of their teammates in games. Blizzard, as do all other competitive games developers, provide players with a mute/block button. It is the thin skinned player's responsibility to use such features. - My secondary argument is that if blizzard cannot create a perfect match making system, then Blizzard cannot expect perfect player conduct. To expect either is irrational. - My third argument is that players should not be permanently banned for conduct. Perhaps silenced for a year, perhaps temporarily banned for a year after so many cases. But mental issues are a thing and they are widely possessed in many forms by gamers. Some are offensive, and some are fragile. It is no place of a developer of any sort of software to try and dictate the behaviors of it's users using outright banning of an account as the consequence of not upholding said predefined behaviors. - My final argument has to do with a game's lifespan. If a player displays toxic behavior, be it outright vulgarity or simply the revealing to other players of their individual faults, it is likely that behavior is not going to suddenly disappear. It likely may become toned down over time, especially after numerous and increasing chat restriction penalties, but it is unlikely that it will fully disappear. So the longer the game is up, the chance of the company eventually banning the player increases drematically year by year. Blizzard and other game's developers should be legally restricted to a year-by-year rule where you can impose a penalty for the remainder of an annual cycle that restricts them (up to completely) from a game due to conduct, but never indefinitely - at the very least without a complete and total refund of that player's money. And offenses cannot be gray areas. Threats of violence, for example, would be a zero-tolerance example of how a player could be outright banned and refunded their purchases. But disrespect should never be considered a bannable offense, especially considering that in society disrespect is sometimes endearing and a, perhaps poor, desire to help improve the overall player-base's ability to perform, or weed out those who refuse to improve. Thereby improving the efficacy of the matchmaking system and in turn reducing the degree of toxic behaviors in individual matches. Lastly, this genre of game, specifically. One that originated as a mod on another of Blizzard's games, Warcraft III, is riddled with toxicity. It always has been. And it is toxic players of this genre that ultimately lead to the genre becoming independent of the mod it originated on. Blizzard has in recent years become an absolutely terrible company and I caution anyone even talking about them as it simply gives them more publicity. The company is on it's way out for their abhorrent business practices and general disrespect of their player base and those of us who have been here since the very beginning. By all means make your own decisions, but take it from someone who has been playing blizzard games since the beginning, they have turned evil very quickly.. TL;DR - The game is fun, but unlocking heroes either requires an irrationally large chunk of time, or a few bucks. Not P2W, but definitely Pay-2-Progress. Heroes of the Storm is a MOBA by Blizzard/Activision that blends together properties of Blizzard's games such as WoW, Overwatch, Diablo, etc. into one universe and even adds a few new characters to the pool. The gameplay (aside from the novelty of Blizzard characters in a MOBA) is fairly fun. There are some balancing issues for sure, but it is essentially a watered down MOBA that's good fun for casual and serious players alike. The issues I have with this game, however, are with 2 major things that personally break a game. Poor matchmaking - Don't expect to get paired up with players equal to your skill level. In my first match, I was paired against players hundreds of levels higher than me. You will either get absolutely stomped, or carried by your team. If you're the type that gets really annoyed when you feel like you can't contribute, play a ton of AI matches first. Now for the reason this is a 3/10 for me. The gold and $RL system. Unlocking heroes in this game will cost anywhere from 2,000 - 10,000 in-game 'gold'. Gold is obtained by playing matches and leveling up heroes. I was getting an average of about 30-50 gold per match and after days of playing match after match, I finally reached 1,000 gold. After all of this, I am 10% of the way to purchasing Lucio (or any other 10k hero). Lets give a very generous estimate of 50 gold per match. To reach 10,000 gold you would need to play in 200 matches. Each match is about 20 minutes long on average. You would need to log 66 hours of actual in-game playtime to reach 10,000 gold. Even spread across the week, that's more than a full-time job. I would argue that maybe even 10% of that number is too high... But I'll let you decide that on your own. But don't worry, you can pay a few bucks and buy any hero you want and don't have to worry about the irrational grind. This is why I've rated this game a 3/10. We cannot keep allowing giant companies like Activision/Blizzard to essentially bar all progression if it doesn't give them a few bucks. I've seen this get worse and worse as time goes by and I've become less forgiving about it.. I registered to write this review. This game is a piece of dried s**t. Blizzard is a greedy, mercantile company. You are given one of three heroes and forced to farm 7-10 thousand gold. But this is the path for only 2 heroes. I tried to play as heroes in rotation. They are extremely weak against those in matchmaking. They have a small radius of attack and use of skills, poor escape.Absolutely everything in this game for a beginner comes down to what you need to endure and watch. No competitive interest whatsoever. It looks like Blizzard decided to kill this game 1/10 1 point for concept. A garbage game by a garbage developer. Spend 1 dime and they will ban you for trying to tell the horifically incompitent teammates to just pay attention. Hero balance is absolutely terrible, sometimes they oneshot you sometimes they heal %100 in seconds, sometimes they are god-like. Matchmaking is unfair. Buying heroes is like buying a house in real life, Blizzard is money hungry as always. Everything about this game is terrible, unfair. Do not waste your time. Zero fun.. I like the game but its very meh because its more casual than LoL. I only played because of the Overwatch characters lmao. Hello everyone, just a few words about the reason for this assessment. Dynamics -7; Graphics -7; excitement -3; variety -6; community - 6; ESports -4. The game has its fans, but being too late does not correspond to the present. And it should be noted a complete failure with unique content and monetization. The feeling that the developer initially took on the role of an outsider without investing money.. I've been playing game since alpha. It's almost 6 years. Banned this year for chat. Couldn't stand moronic players broken MM provides. And CAN'T IGNORE THEM with leaving game. They report you or system just gives you penalty for leaving. And you get EVEN WORSE PEOPLE with who you must win to get rid of penalty. Also, I don't believe that have same MMR with such people that even don't know damn basics of game. Donated. Had many things unlocked on account. Ofc, no refund. Blizzard cares nowadays only about money. I played student league. Really liked this game. Now it is a trash can with SJV bio-waste, which even the indefinite article in your message offends (so they can use the punishment system in their favor, even if they just don't like you). Do a favor for humanity, don't play blizzard games. Or they will continue to keep the level of their games at the bottom for the sake of the SJV scam. All you find just farming in a beautiful wrapper. They don't even respect their own employees and pay them a bonus with play time in Warcraft while Bobby Kotick gets millions in bonuses. Lmao.. This game is dead. Blizzard does nothing to improve it's gameplay, just trying to dig a bit more gold out of it. New heroes (paid) one stronger than another, makes the game unbalanced as any other game is. Example is pretty simple: they release a new hero, which is rly OP so that ppl buy it and use it, while Illidan, which was in game since it's launch, is now a piece of trash, and noone wasnts to rework it, making this hero unplayable. this game is not about the strategy, teamplay and good pick combination, it's a competition of who's the dumbest of our players to buy and own each and every new powerful hero, that guy will be leading. i've been playing it since beta, got myself trapped in it and couldn't leave it for another game bcuz i've learned each mechanic to play it, so i've seen enough in this game to tell you right now that this is an abandoned piece of trash, noone in Blizzard cares about it's own child and i'm pretty sure this won't change anytime soon. I finally deleted it. What you see is what you get - MOBA mechanics that are quick, fun, and easy to learn (but difficult to master). No convoluted item systems or min-maxing designs, just hop in and play one of your favourite Blizzard characters. Very satisfying to this day. I have never used the cash shop and never will - I like being restricted in what I can play, making the best out what's available, and taking advantage of the free hero rotations to learn new abilities.. Simple, fun, great ... the best game in this genre ! No items just Hero power and Teamplay/Map mechanics ... and thats the problem 90% Braindead ppl. in this game .. and i mean BRAIN DEAD they have nothing in there... completly empty. (LIke the players of most Activision/Blizzard games) and no its not a question of the age ! The rest is 5% Cheater and 5% Pro Player.. Nice game killed by greedy Mundus' corporate greed. Still alive, gets new releases and balance batches regularly every 3 months. There are so many reasons to avoid this game like the plague. In late 2018 Blizzard scrapped the Heroes Global Championship (HGC) league and gutted out the game's development team without warning. They claim to have ""set the game up for long term sustainability"" but in reality screwed over its stakeholders. Playing Heroes in 2020 is a miserable experience. Most of the serious players left for better games. What remains are trolls, griefers and toxic players who will actively ruin your game experience. They will actively weaponise the game's automated report system against you. I was unfairly given a month long ban by Blizzard by people who maliciously reported me for calling out their bad play, all while they wished COVID, death and other horrible things upon me.. Almost like Marvel VS Capcom, you can play with your favorite characters from the games made when Blizzard was worth a damn. Otherwise: - **** matchmaking - prepare to face constant loosing streaks at time, thanks to backwater rejects and dumb cucks - **** balance - Blizzard does not give a **** like Valve they only like to add hats now - Don't make my mistake and avoid this piece of **** do something better with your life. The best MOBA mechanics, in my opinion. Fun, simplistic, team-based action (as opposed to lol or dota, with equipments and players going super strong solo, leaving the team behind). The only - and biggest - problem is its in the hands of Blizzard. YEARS passed since launch, matchmaking **** as bad as when it launched, TERRIBLE matchmaking, both in characters on your team and versus, and players levels. The Blizzard matchmaking throughout their games is horrible: if you start winning too much, the game will pair you in a team of people who are losing too much, usually against a closed team, to force your defeat and keep you in the 50% V/D ratio. I kid you not, if i play in a closed team with my friends, we win 9,5/10 times, but in random, is a downright fustercluck of terrible players, trolls, racists, xenophobes, mysoginists etc. Speaking of which, i had one account BANNED from this game, a while back, for speaking against FASCISM and RACISM, and refusing to play with the said racist player. So much for the CEO ""we want to be better"" mambojambo after the Hong Kong negative repercussions. What saddens me most, is that this company was my hands-down favorite, game-wise. Now, i am disgusted to see or touch anything they do, even if for free.. Heroes of the Storm is the next-gen of MOBAs! Different maps, different tactics, team fight is very important, no gold to spend, focus on talent instead and adapt them against your enemies' composition... simply amazing for me!. It would be fun if it werent for the fact blizzard has the worst.... absolute worst matchmaking of any game i've ever seen. Expect to lose 8-9 games in a row in absolute stomps. Just a trash company all around.. Basically - extremely poor user experience. The ladder is pretty bad. Too many heroes, too few bans. A number of heroes feel like they cheese the game. But you can't ban them all.. Fun moba with no useless and time-consuming elements like half an hour grind and shop management, just pure brawl. However, it is still a team game, and God, sometimes teammates are f awful: trolls, leavers and plain stupid. But well, which team multiplayer doesnt have such issues?. This is a very unique case. When it came out, during beta testing it seemed so new, so fresh, and so much fun. It was until about they brought in the 2.0 system with loot boxes major **** balance changes and whatnot... Then as I kept playing more solo and less with friends in a team, I just had to admit, that the games unique system, that i first praised and what makes this game unique, is the worst thing ever. By sharing all exp and basically with that your aka items/strength. You just NEVER have the chance to turn around a game with 4 casual teammates against 5 good enemy players. There were times when I was MVP, had both top damage, top heal, top exp earned, did most objectives as well and still lost. The reason? Simple. Lets take League of Legends for reference. You have 1 pro (S=5), and 4 casual (D=1) in TEAM1, and 5 average gold players (A-B=2-3) players in TEAM2. The pro will most likely carry the game. Here: the enemy team will most likely win. Why? BECAUSE everything is shared, TEAM1 with a total of 5+4*1=9 points < vs 5*2-3 =10-15 point. To put THIS into perspective, TEAM2 will have ults and even lv13 talents, while TEAM1 wont even have ults. This is just an example to give you an idea what I mean. Before 2.0 it was a solid 8-9/10, now its like a 4-5. Love the blizzard universe, but objectively it seems the game has already stopped development. Nothing happened for a long time since deathwing came in. Not so long ago they introduced Mei (tba). There is a FIX meta, where a selected 10 or so few heroes are a must pick/ban, the rest are only for fun or none existent. When was the last time you seen a gazlove? Who needs Specialists (old role)? How much Ranked you played were there was none of these picked and/or banned: Xul, Li-ming, Kael Tas, Deathwing, Mephisto, Tycus, Malthael, Garros, Diablo (exclude Mei, but a possibility) The game is playable, mostly for fun only, but can't be taken seriously anymore. Feels bad, I really wanted it to be better, to be good, to be the League killer... For those who are not familiar or very casual playing MOBA games, I can very much recommend this game as your introduction to MOBA-s. Since everything is shared, you will feel being as good as your teammates, and they will uplift you. Its easy to learn, and not so (/as) hard to master. It's the perfect stepping stone (sadly). For those with more experience, and to play seriously, competitive, NOT RECOMMEND it! (With friends only/premade maybe) 5/10. Heroes of the storm is , by far, better than league of legends. Game is far more beautiful, more intelligent , better thinked, better musics, better gameplay, better maps ... BUT the big problem with HOTS is incompetence of blizzard developpers: they have not any idea of how to balance their games, some heroes are just useless, others are over op, from YEARS, but no problem for blizzard ! and the second big problem, which makes the game nearly unplayable is matchmaking. I don't know if blizzard try to balance everybody to 50% winrate or if they are just really bad, but sometimes you will win 10 games in a row, then lose 15, with not a single good and balanced game. You will win easy or lose without being able to make anything. Such a shame, this could be the best MOBA, is Blizzard was just a little better !. After 2 years on lol this is just the best moba, not just farming on lane but action, so many different maps options e.t.c.. This game is pure garbage because it doesn't know what it is. It was obviously designed for tablets but runs on PC. Garbage controls (cause tablets design, garbage meaningless heroes, every game feels the same, garbage cartoonish visuals). Try DOTA2 instead, every game is unique and your choices matter all the time. In HOTS nothing what you do is actually matters.. It would be the best moba, if not its match making. Want to play in the evening or in the weekend, be ready to have a troll in your team in every game. In HL. You try hard, but who cares if someone wants just to have fun, while drinking some beer. The game was released 3 years ago, nothing changed in MM since then. Blizzard only talks. They fight with toxity, but that toxity is not the problem. The problem is what causes toxity - trolls. Almost every game lost in draft. Trolls want to play some certain hero, no matter what team needs. If Blizzard cared a bit about this game, they fired the ones who is in charge for this terrible MM. But they don't. Still, the best MOBA.. One of the best games I play! the characters are fun and a lot of thought is put into gameplay. some games just do what's cool, but that's not necessarily fun. This game is fun.. I am in love with this game. Thank you so much, Blizzard, for this game ! I have been playing this game for 6 years. This game has what I've always missed in Dota 2, for example. It's just a great game. I used to play Dota 2, but since 2015 I have stopped being a fan of Dota. I love the world of warcraft and I only play as heroes from WOW. Once I had a platinum rating.. The best MOBA game ever. why do people play LOL?? this game is much better.. this game so bad now feeders, cheater, afk , inbalance, toxins trying protect THIS. Make no mistak, this game is dead.. Very underrated MOBA. This is probably the only of it's genre that I genuinely enjoy.. This is a pretty average game. Nothing great. Just average. About as average as the come for MOBAs. Nothing special, just a Blizzard brand MOBA.. First and foremost, the game's dying, slowly but gracefully. Get your portion of AWESOME while it lasts, don't hesitate. It's free to play (and don't require 20GB+ sized download) anyway. What's good: - Simple gameplay which is master'able by average user. No lasthitting. No item buying. Just hero+talents choice and... - ...raw, robust action! Since there is no need in splitting one's attention between mobs and shops, the player can fully commit to dominating battlefield. - Non-intrusive paid content. What's bad: - 90% of lootboxes content is absolutely useless. There is no point in having 300+ profile icons since they're cheap to craft and can't be used simultaneously. Sprays? Same here. Yet, 1-3 sprays + 1-3 icons + 0 other iems from a lootbox is a common sight. - Playerbase is dwindling. So, longer time to reach the battle and... - ... permanent balancer hiccups. Just don't expect intense balanced action. It's you or them. No exceptions. What's neutral: - Plot: exists. - Events: n","the day today is a complete failure, awful, waste of time, absolute garbage . every match is rigged, there's always a idiot who will play solo leaving the team behind making it 5x4 . the main problem is that your own efforts are ALWAYS wasted ."
"1,037.Code:Realize - Guardian of Rebirth","I liked this game at first but the more i thought about it, the less and less appealing it became. There are more deus ex machinas in this game than there are raindrops that fall in a rainforest; Tension is almost always alleviated straight away from some miraculous event that occurs at the last second. And the characters are annoyingly smitten with the MC straight away - the romances just dont feel deserved in any way and especially in a certain character's route where the MC and him have the same chemistry of water mixed with oil. The art is the only redeeming factor.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is really good game. First of all I was not sure if I should pick otome novel (cause I am guy) but I tried and it was really good reading. Graphic style of Code Realize is very colorful and the game looks really good. A bit sad is that there are not talking animations but it is not a big deal. Gameplay is OK, you have to make several choices which led you to one of the five endings. Story was very interesting, quite simple but mainly very enjoyable - especially first part which is more focused on story than romance is amazing. Second part of game is good too, but there are included more romance dialogues and some of them are a bit boring. Otome or not, this is very good visual novel which I can recommend to everyone who likes this genre. Visual elements - 9 Audio Elements - 8 Gameplay elements - 8 Enjoyability - 8 Story quality - 9 Overall - 8,5. Well I like visual novels, I'm huge fan Steins;Gate, so I was really excited to try another VN with such great reception from critics and users. And I am in shock. Well, lets start with what I liked - artwork is really awesome. The steampunk england is nice. Well, thats about all of the good things I found in this game. Why this got so high scores is far beyond my imagination. Cast of characters are plain idiotic. I like fantasy, but come on! We got 2 female characters, one of them is protagonist which is NOT attractive, despite of that fact it seems every male in this universe is in love with her and willing to give their life for her. Not very likely. And when im on the male cast - they are a bunch of heroes, every single one of them is super strong genius, and the fact that they are far from being manly but plain gay looking isn't helping either. Damn knights on white horses. Special place among the cast has Nemo, Van Helsing and sisi = WTF are those.. things? Was they supposed to be funny? Cute? Dog with a hat and red heart drawn on its butt? Main bad guy who is some bizzare idiot-genius with so lame excuse to be bad in the first place? Come on.. Van Helsing is portraited as almost inhuman martial artist and godlike RAMBO/COMMANDO but looks just like your average nerd - really thats something i'd love to see in real life. The story itself is also just way to absurd for a mature human to bare. Who the hell is this thing adressed to? Who in their right mind gave those almost perfect scores and for what reason/purpose? Are You all 13 year old girls or what? I dont believe that any sane, heterosexual male would have fun with this product. Damn You all to seven hells, give me back my time spend with this... PLEASE, SAVE YOUR TIME AND DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE NOT 13 YEAR OLD GIRL / GAY / ****. Otherwise get it and rate it with another 10/10 ;P And yes, I got to admit that the first part of the game was a bit more interesting, but I got to give a score for the whole product, and it just **** big time.. Visual novels are certainly a guilty pleasure of mine from time to time, but this was my first otome game I actually played. From a storytelling perspective, the plot is actually quite interesting, mixing in a steampunk/19th century setting. The story, while cliched at times, does well in entertaining you until the very end, which is mostly due to the extremely likeable cast of characters and sometimes silly dialogue. The main character, Cardia, has some pretty deep character development, which isn't typical of other otome games. Also, the art is beautiful so that's a plus. Overall, it's a great pick for anyone looking for a good story or are already a fan of the otome genre.. I am a huge fan of tome games, so of course I was excited to see Aksys bringing us one in English. There aren't many available in English, so I hope a positive response to Code Realize will open the market for more games to be localized. In regards to the game, I was not disappointed at all. This was a great visual novel. The artwork is stunning. I constantly was looking back at the gallery of images and admiring each work. There are a good amount of images for each character. Every character had great, distinct personalities and stories. The voice acting was great; although it was in Japanese, the intonations that the actors provided always added to the story. The steampunk London setting was stunning; I remember beginning the game and wanting to share how beautiful it looked with anyone around me. The story itself was great. I have only played through one complete character route so far, but it had me so invested in the characters, and left me crying at multiple points due to the emotion it evoked in me. I smiled and laughed as well; the game leaves players completely invested. You won't want to put it down. Otome games and visual novels aren't for everyone; yet I definitely would suggest this game. It's not all about the romance, and there's a reason it is awarded #1 Best PS Vita Game of 2015. The localization was amazing, props to the team for there being an almost flawless translation. I hope more Vita owners give this game a try, because it truly is worth anyone's time.. While an otome game/visual novel may have somewhat limited appeal, this game is enjoyable enough for most individuals to have fun with. The characters, while somewhat goofy, are interesting and provide more depth than you might expect if you are not used to otome games. The art is beautiful and portrays the characters and setting very well. It certainly has some iffy aspects such as the main character exuding poison that is deadly to the touch, but the translators and writers make them work for the most part. Not the greatest game ever, but certainly one of the best otome games I have had the pleasure of playing. Would highly recommend to any vita owner, even if they aren't particularly interested in romance stories with a female lead.. The game is thrilling so far. Plenty of adventure and silliness to go around! Even though it is an otome/ visual novel it can appeal to a wide audience because of its funny story and use of literary characters.","graphic style of Code Realize is very colorful and the game looks really good . gameplay is OK, you have to make several choices which led you to one of the five endings . story was very interesting, quite simple but mainly very enjoyable ."
"1,038.Turok 2: Seeds of Evil","Another classic from back then, which was much superior to the first game. It was also rock hard and I remember it took me months to finish. The selection of weapons was awesome, with good variety in it's stages and fantastic music. The graphics and animations also hold up surprisingly well. Main drawbacks of the game were its sometimes horrible framrate and the controls were always a source of criticism but you could most get used to it. If you like 90s style FPSs you can't go wrong!. Back in the day, I thought this game was both brutal and challenging. Blasting the head off a raptor and seeing its body stumbling about or seeing a cyclops-like brute spasm as a projectile starts digging into its skull is just incredibly powerful visual stuff. You'll feel like a barbaric warrior shredding these enemies and I just love the variety in which the monsters try to bring you down. The feral beasts move about dextrously, evading your shots while they try to get close. The sentient grunts, knowing they have been fatally wounded, commence to blow themselves to bits, hoping to take you with them. This game had a lot of violent expression for its time. The creators knew how to give players the tools to have fun, whether it be a sick new weapon or the ability to ride an armed triceratops. Above all else, the music still slaps. Try listening to ""Port of Adia"" or ""River of Souls"", you'll know what I mean.. Huge, sprawling FPS with an RPG element in a similar vein to the Metroid games in that you gain abilities that enable you to access previously unreachable areas in levels you have already played. Attractive, detailed graphics and well designed play areas make for an absorbing first person adventure. The only **** are the slight lack of variety in your enemies and the fact that the levels are so large and sprawling that it's a little too easy to miss essential goals, which exasperatingly means going back to the very beginning of the level and starting all over again. But as a whole, Turok 2 is one of my favourite N64 games and the only real challenger to Rare's FPS crown.. One of the very best FPS games for the old Nintendo 64. Turok 2 really pushed the 64 to its limits, the game really was too much for the console.. A truly iconic masterpiece of awesomeness with one of my most favourite weapon sound effects ever (the Plasma Rifle). Very very good gameplay and outstanding soundtrack that still holds up today simply amazing.. In my opinion better than the first and probably the best in the Turok saga. Dinosaurs, knives, weapons .... If you like Doom-style games, this is for you.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. Amazing weapons, amazing graphics for n64, amazing enemies, amazing levels, amazing music It takes too long for looking a save point. Turok 2 was the sample that had no rival Nintendo 64 FPS creating. One of the most difficult games of all time, with a truly great gore, some beastly graphics, intelligent enemies (when they feel threatened by powerful weapons they run) a soundtrack history and definitely one of the best games ever created for a game console.. played this when it came out in 1998 Nintendo 64 so much fun astonishing array of weapons Grade A graphics and sound design Cerebral Bore ranks as one of gamedon's best and grossest weapons ever only EXTREME level length and confusing maze like level layout detract. The first fps I've ever played, and it's pretty damn good. The visuals for an N64 are excellent but at the cost of some bad frame rates at times. In the later levels, the game gets pretty hard but forgiving. Get this if you own an N64 (if they sell copies), if not, get it on an emulator (it won't ruin the experience).. Ultra Turok experience..!Enough said...also best fps of its **** extra memory made this game UNBELIEVABLY **** music was ahead of its time seriously..atmospheric to the bone..a GEM for the true hardcore N64gamers!!!. Turok 2 looks like an early PS2 title, plays like a refined Doom and has the arsenal of a whole army. Casual gamers beware, this quest is ""Nintendo-Hard"". It takes time to stack up from the starting bow and claw, to learn how to platform and to use the map properly in the vast, enormous labyrinths. The game will push you to the limits of your skills, patience and serenity. You WILL pray to get an extra life, specially after level 3, where you´ll die time after time, both cheap and honest, difficult demises. What I mean is that this game is punishing, so much that many cannot beat it without cheats even today. Fans of Metroid Prime should definitely play it though, as T2 has a lot of basework for the ""action adventure"" that would develop later on the gamecube. It will also push the n64 to it´s limits, so be warned that IF your console is not in top shape, the jumper/expansion pack may overheat and Reset the game (for real, look it up. It´s a common problem). In the end, this game is proof of why oldschool gamers look at ""Halo-generation"" gamers with disdain. While overlooked by many in favour of the popular Goldeneye, the cognossieurs know it! It´s long, it´s though, it´s manly!!! It´s ""Turok 2: Seeds of evil"".. Classic FPS game for N64. Huge arsenal for you to kill all the enemies (and there are a lot, certainly). Levels are huge and enemies are very dangerous. There are lots of secrets too. The music is good. On the other side, the game is very hard. Is easy to get lost and killed. Some maps can be tricky because you need to search for keys or hidden paths.. Probably one of the most underrated games for the Nintendo 64, Turok 2 was an excercise in originality, with original designs for weapons, levels, enemies, music, and almost everything about the game screamed ""originality"" back then in 1998. It was also most definately the goriest game up to 1998, with the ability to blow off heads, limbs, and even holes through enemies, the gore seemed almost limitless. But that's not what Turok 2 was about, Turok 2 was about traversing surreal environments fighting enemies which seemed completely foreign to us. They were all fought with different tactics, had different weaknesses, and were even excluded to specific environments. Besides the amazing gore and atmosphere and diversity that the game provided, it also had an extraordinarily dark, creepy, thrilling, and even mysterious soundtrack, one which alluded to the grisly setting the game took place in while also sounding mystifyingly deep. The game had few faults, one being poor a framerate at many moments in the game due to it's excellent graphics and because of how many things can happen on-screen at once and the larger view range. This game rightfully deserves a place amongst the top 100, no, top 50 FPS games of all time, it was extremely polished and had massive amounts of replayability.","huge, sprawling FPS with an RPG element in a similar vein to the Metroid games . graphics and well designed play areas make for an absorbing first person adventure . main drawbacks of the game were its sometimes horrible framrate and the controls were always a source of criticism ."
"1,039.Path of Exile","I’ve now played POE 2 for over 90 hours, and I’m completely disappointed. The only aspects that make the game remotely interesting are the graphics and the skill tree. The regular mobs on the maps are generally no challenge at all. Bosses simply spam countless AOE attacks and throw trash mobs at you. There’s no noteworthy mechanic or significant challenge behind the boss fights. They just deal massive damage and have an endless health pool. When it’s supposed to be “especially difficult,” the boss room is artificially shrunk until you’re forced to fight an AOE-spamming boss in a tiny square, or they use damage types against which it’s nearly impossible to have sufficient **** 1 is far more entertaining and enjoyable to play. In this case, it feels like they tried to create a Dark Souls **** my opinion, POE 2 doesn’t deserve any attention, and the price for early access to a free-to-play game is outrageous, especially since you’re not really getting anything special for it. Sure, let the test players pay for the privilege of being test **** sum up POE 2 in bullet points:Boring mapsAbsurdly stupid boss fightsZero innovationExtremely long farming due to almost no useful gear dropsMindless grindAcceptable graphics but poor performanceThe game isn’t worth a single cent! If you’re considering buying it, I can only advise against it. Wait until it’s free to play.. POE fanboys will defend this shiny, polished turd to the death. Fact of the matter is this game is badly designed in so many ways, that GGG should strongly consider firing whoever came up with some of this. The skill tree is a disaster and needs to be completely reworked. Map bosses need fixed. Loot system needs fixed. Endgame needs a total overhaul. Endgame has no viable builds, you are gridlocked into one of the ""templated"" builds because experimentation does not work. Overall, these types of games are supposed to enforce risk and reward- this game has no reward. They tried to copy the dark souls formula and dropped the ball. POE fanboys will say ""ph well i had no problem sinking 12 hours of my day into getting a weapon that does 4-12 more dmg than my current one"" as if that's anything BUT bad game design. Skip this one.. Beautiful game, it has a great story. This an ARPG game, that makes you rage quit once every hour. Defiantly need a **** ton of balancing. The game makes you run for 10 min, then kills you, and you have to run the same 10 min over and over again. Needs more checkpoints. BAD - Lazy balancing and instant death boss fights. Drop rates are insanely low and will drop gear for all classes which makes getting any upgrade for your class very hard to come by. The only way to progress is to stock pile items and switch classes when you have enough good items for the other classes because you won't be finding upgrades for the class that you are playing. Level ups feel worthless as STR, DEX, INT no longer provide major stat improvements. Skills no longer level up. The only character they seem to have balanced the game around is the Warrior, ever other class dies so quickly it's not funny. Performance wise the game stutters a lot and floats between 40-50 FPS with a 2080 on medium. I'm so tired of devs labelling their game dank souls because they are too lazy to balance their game and then to top it off throwing in instant death attacks to further ruin the game. There is no cool gear or skills that you will find while playing. The players that look amazing bought their skins. Your character will always look like you are wearing a bag of potatoes. Seriously this is not worth your time and it doesn't respect your time.. Path of microtransactions trash!!!!!! Fan boys have the nerve to bash and disrespect diablo 4!!!!!!! Path of microtransactions trash has microtransactions over $500!!!!!!!!. The game is overrated by bots, empty, buggy game without any set, vibe or setting. Not working mechanics and game systems, hardcore is pointless, since the game is buggy. And softcore is a tutorial, just like in Diablo.. Aside from the Early Access server issues, once I got in I immediately loved this game. Have never played POE1 so this is all new to me, still found learning curve great, but understand so much to learn at same time.. What an incredible game, difficult, action packed, skillfully crafted with a complex but never boring progression system. One of the best games ive played in the last decade. Loved the Closed Beta. Monk4L. i give this a zero because it lacks an offline mode. really don't like the always online requirements.. I think people that like playing with excel as fun might enjoy this game immensely. But I genuinely have no idea why it appeals to anyone except that's it is ""free"". Problems: The interface is clunky and uninviting. The skill system allows for customization but needs guides to make anything formidable. (a problem with Diablo as well really) The gameplay is absolutely terrible and not fun. Jumpy and terrible animations. So many horrible types of currency. Non-existent documentation. Boring story (is there a story?). Overall, I had zero fun in this game and I tried it several times over the years. I can't imagine the same people will make POE 2 any better, but I'm dumb enough to try it for $30. Hell, at least they tried and made a game. What have I done with my life?. I miss a Story in the Game and AAA Approach like in Diablo. Diablo is the big Game. PoE makes the same in worse.. Genuine good game, if you like D2 and think D3 & 4 deviated from their own franchise...then this game is for you Better news POE2 is even better and releases soon.. Path of Exile is nothing short of a masterpiece in the action RPG genre, offering players an unparalleled experience that combines depth, complexity, and engagement. The game excels with its vast character customization options, particularly through the intricate passive skill tree and the unique skill gem system, allowing players to create truly personalized builds that cater to their playstyle. The dark, immersive world of Wraeclast is rich with lore and filled with challenging enemies and epic loot, making exploration feel rewarding and exhilarating. The frequent updates and expansions demonstrate the developers' commitment to constantly evolving the game, introducing new mechanics, leagues, and content that keep the community excited and engaged. Additionally, the game’s free-to-play model is executed flawlessly, offering a fair experience without pay-to-win elements, making it accessible for everyone. Overall, Path of Exile stands as a benchmark for what an online RPG can achieve, combining deep mechanics, a thriving community, and an expansive world into a consistently rewarding adventure that sets a high standard in the genre.. The only downside of PoE is the barrier of entry for new players. Being such a complex game, with years of deep complex, and meaningful systems accumulated, the game can be quite intimidating for new players. But I can guarantee that if you like the genre and keep playing past the initial learning curve, you will not be disappointed. The character progression and build creation potential are honestly almost endless, and this paired with a solid campaign and an AMAZING (and almost a bit addictive) endgame array of options, makes this my all-time favourite game to play continuously.. this a game against humanity, a game company that plays tricks on players, is also preparing to launch Path of Exile 2.. The game is over due to the season, experience points will be deducted when a character dies, and the level difficulty is targeted at the player's weaknesses.. The game is poorly optimized, the difficulty is skyrocketing, and the punishment mechanism is quite discouraging. I don't know why I want to play this game, and I don't know why this game is being compared to Diablo IV. But what I am sure of is that this game is a waste of time at the end of the game.. The game is unreasonable at the end of the game. In the later stages of the game, Maps' mods target the player's weaknesses in every way, with restrictions on teleportation and penalties for deducting experience points. It is a game that is hostile to players.. This game is so bad it doesnt deserve more than 20 minutes of play before uninstalling it .But its free, there are alot of people who will take anything if its free i suppose.. The games is not a masterpiece but it's pretty demn close. Gameplay, complexity, overall feeling in building your own hero (both equipment and skills), market (player2player trading, recently added market house), community, developer transparency, business model, continuous development cycle, MUSIC... So what's bad here? Not so much. Some may claim graphics feels old but for game released over a decade ago I would say graphics is decent enough. Others could complain about complexity and high entry-point but again - this game over last ten years received new content 3-4 times per each year, with most of it still present in game mechanics. And all of that is F2P - that is, if you are mastermind of stash micromanagement, otherwise for 20-30$ you get a bunch of stash-tabs (+ equivalent value in points to spent on mtx). So far this is one and only true heir of Diablo 2, the Ultimate ARPG game which can only lose its crown to upcoming PoE2.. - Sep 30, 2024 After trying for a few days, I’ve had enough. My previous comments were already polite, but now I have to tell it like it is. First of all, not only does the game completely fail to responsibly teach the mechanics, but the company behind it is utterly **** entire game is designed to work against the player. The map mods always target the players’ weaknesses (and they dare to call this a sense of achievement—it's an insult to the players!). There's a 10% experience penalty, only five portals, and the skill tree, which seems expansive at first glance, is a total lie. Skill Gems? Whether they're usable or not entirely depends on the developers’ whims!This garbage game is as repulsive as Blizzard. With a company like this, I seriously doubt that their upcoming PoE2 will be good game. - Sep 9, 2024 Overall, the game cannot be considered poor; however, it is undeniably frustrating and infuriating.First, the game features a highly complex system. Unfortunately, many explanations of the game mechanics are provided through player-created websites, such as those detailing skill trees and equipment crafting, rather than being offered directly by the developers. The developers should have provided instructional resources to guide players on crafting equipment and understanding skill trees and their combinations. Instead, the official game website remains unchanged and simplistic, while the game’s mechanics continue to grow increasingly complex. Consequently, only players with an in-depth understanding of the game’s mechanics and calculations are able to excel, leaving newcomers at a loss, forced to rely on **** game’s content is inherently challenging, and with experience penalties upon character death and limitations on late-game map access. new players have no choice but to depend on player-created websites for game information. Unfortunately, these sites often lack the latest updates and sometimes contain outdated information. For an internationally promoted game, the language barrier further exacerbates the issue, making it even more difficult for new and returning players to access comprehensive game information and mechanics. These are aspects that the game developers should have addressed, but they have yet to take any action in this regard.finally, I think this game company is most likely to be of the same nature as Blizzard, so don’t have high expectations.Finally, regarding the experience penalty and my personal feeling, when the character is about to level up by the amount of experience (approximate experience: 50% or more), there will always be monsters that can kill the character immediately in the map, this phenomenon will always occur regardless of the difficulty of the map, and then 10% of the experience points that have been worked hard to increase are forcibly deducted, and all the time invested is wasted in this phenomenon.. One of the best games ever made. Best modern ARPG for **** a constructive criticism I would say there is a bit of bloat related to game mechanics, it has accumulated over the years. This might scare new players and tire old veterans sometimes. But Path of Exile is still the most enjoyable experience I've ever had in an ARPG. Many of the mechanics are not needed to enjoy the game and it can be played casually or in a very very hardcore way. If you are going to try PoE for the first time or want to return to it and give it another try, just take your time and do what you find interesting it's going to be enjoyable no matter how deep you want to delve into it. PoE is the true Diablo 2 successor.. 1, if not the best ARPG around today. And it's free, with no P2W Micro-transactions. Path of Exile (POE) is such an awesome experience that is difficult to pull yourself away from, after getting hooked. Every last detail has been thought out. Even those smallest quality of life improvements, that normally get glossed over, have been solved in a way that make the user experience better. Then all of these little improvements together, just make the game feel so natural and smooth to play. So the best part of ARPGs is the character building freedom, and that is where POE really stands out from the croud. The developers at Grinding Gear Games have really made every single style feel like the possibilties are endless. This has came at the cost of the new player experience feeling overwhelming. So if you are new, I recommend copying someone else's build for your first character. This will allow you to become familier with the massive skill tree before tackling your own build. Campaign wise the game is fairly sized. How ever I personally never took much interest in the story and lore. But the gameplay is so good that it didn't bother me that I didn't have a clue what was going on. I have heard from fans that the story is really good if you bother to learn it. But my ADHD doesn't allow me to listen to a voice over the top of a text dump for each part of the game narration. Its like Audible but your looking at a screen with nothing intersting going on. The enemy and boss mechanics are the best you can experience in ARPGs. With enemy attacks being well telegraphed. At times can be quite fast paced. With all sorts of flashing effects that gives you that sweet, sweet dopamine. The looting is also fun. Something that Diablo hasn't been able to quite capture since D2. POE makes you feel like no time is ever wasted. The currencies in this game are items to which do various things. Like change item modifiers or gem slots. So even items you don't want can be exchanged to NPCs for some of these currencies. Making everything carry atleast some form of value to the player. Rather then having 1 universal currency, that you end up getting so much of that it ends worthless. There is a player trading system. Most people tend to want Chromatic Orbs for items. These orbs changing the colour of gem slots on items. Gem slots are what grant you your abilities which you use in combat. POE being free. Whats its monitization like? The only thing that you can buy that alters gameplay is stash tabs. These cost around $5 each. There is a variety of different kinds. Other then a currency tab (Allowing you to stack each currency, way higher), you don't really need any of the others, but they are nice to have. You could easily play through the game and get the full experience without dropping a dime. But I personally recommend spending around $20 on a few stash tabs so you don't spend as much time micromanaging your bank. My 1 gripe with this game. ADD LEG ARMOUR!! All the characters walk around almost half naked. You do get full armour later in the game. But for hours you will be walking around in near enough your underwear, from the waist down. You can get cosmetic overrides, thou. Changing how each slot appears, regardless of what you have equipped. These are on the prices side, I think each bundle is like $30 or something. They do have discount sales on for a selection of stuff. It's more there if you want to show extra support to the team and get a little something in return. It's not ever rammed in your face. Throughout your hole time with the game, you will never get ads pop up asking you to spend money. Only a small button saying ""shop"" which clearly states that it is a microtransaction shop. So you know, this is where you spend real money. POE is proof that you don't need malicious or deceptive techniques to be a successful FTP game. You just need to make the experience enjoyable and the money will come. That when developers do these annoying FOMO techniques, that it is out of greed and not because ""They need to or the game will die"". If you enjoy ARPGs with fun looting and unlimited character builds then POE is definitely a game for you. And its free so definitely give it a go! The new player experience does have a bit of a learning curve, but I highly recommend sitting through it because once you start getting hooked, you won't regret it.. The game itself is great, steep learning curve but its great. The devs are great people. BUT the support of this game good lord. Dont ever have any kind of problems with this game. If you do you should just stop playing the game. This game has the WORST support ever, HORRIBLY inefficient and its literally like talking to a braindead AI on the other side. I had my account locked and then muted for have a name that they considered inappropriate. I repeatedly tried to explain to them the context behind my name and why it was not what they thought it was but they didn't care. Its like the person on the other end had a huge ego and simply refused to accept that they may have made a mistake. Also the account recovery process is the WORST of anything out there. Recovering your account even if you have all of the proof that its your account will take days if not weeks because they have no sort of form for you to fill out. You have to send emails back and forth forever until they can do anything for you. I am not kidding when i say that EA support is better than this, and i despise EA as a company.. I recently started playing the new season of Path of Exile on July 26th and was enjoying the game. I was so excited that I immediately purchased the most expensive supporter pack, spending $90 to support the developers. However, just a few hours later, I was suddenly banned for “3rd party software” (botting). The only other applications I had running were Riot’s client and the Mobalitics app on Overwolf. Neither of these interacted with Path of Exile or made any changes to the **** a complete beginner, I was simply following a leveling guide from Maxroll, trying to learn the game. Despite this, I was banned without any explanation or investigation. The support team refused to look into my gameplay to verify if the ban was justified and only responded with pre-generated, copy-pasted answers. The ban is permanent. I am not alone in this experience—many others have been banned for no apparent reason: 1. ****/forum/view-thread/3247788 2. ****/forum/view-thread/3240146 3. ****/forum/view-thread/3247169 I am sharing this to warn everyone to be extremely cautious about purchasing any microtransactions from this company. They can revoke your access to the game at any time and for any reason, as outlined in their policy rules. You could be banned for simply having unrelated applications running in the background, even if they have nothing to do with your Path of Exile gameplay.. I have not finished the main game yet so I will be updating this. So the game is really good, the best thing about it is that it offers a huge, very comprehensive passive skill tree which can make a difference. The game plays great on my PC on max settings, it feels a bit clunky at times but rarely. The game looks pretty good on a good PC especially on areas that are not very dark, the textures are really solid, unfortunately most of the areas I've seen so far are dark and gloomy which it doesn't help for the game look better on modern hardware.Dark is the tone and theme of the game though,a land ravaged of all kinds of horrors. The gameplay is nice with a huge variety of different enemies and spells you can use to destroy them. I am not sure yet if the game is the king of the genre like many people are saying but it sure is a great game, better than Diablo 3, Chaosbane or even victor vran in my opinion. Definitely not better than Hades though they are incredibly different,haven't played Diablo 4 so no opinions there.. Less the game more the company behind it. I was a customer of theirs from 2013 to 2022. After a very disconnected launch designs starting with 3.15 many of us were upset. We voiced our displeasure with the game changes. We were also routinely muted in chat for very harmless criticisms. Even some nuanced history without being offensive to anyone. I had enough in 2022. I told them to delete my account after a back and forth with support. Out of curiosity I saw that Tencent had fully acquired the company. So I thought that perhaps their leadership and attitudes had changed. I was wrong. I reached out in April 2024 during Necropolis league if they would reinstate all the supporter pack microtransactions associated to the account. The very same email, with the dates and transaction ids of each purchase discussed. They simply said they couldn't do it. This is just corporate speak. It's not like I asked for a refund on a served dinner or a physical product. These are digital transactions. With proof of purchase. They simply refused. So you see nothing has changed with them in two years. The way support treats customers is simply the tip of the iceberg. They hate you. _________ Update: Support got back to me and today fully restored the deleted account. They went the extra mile when they didn't have to. So they don't hate us. The future will tell the verdict of GGG. Not the past.. Not sure why this game is hyped as much as it is. It is very hard to pick up with out referencing a ton of external stuff. It has too many systems and feels very clunky. The game is truly showing its age, graphics wise it is very dated, lot of screen clutter.. Max score means I consider it to be the best for its genre. Depth, customization and scale of the end game are like never seen in a game before. The game was inspired by Diablo2 and GGG took it to a whole new level. Really feals that the game is made for gamers to enjoy and not for the company to make a profit, they (GGG) go all in with that by keeping a very close relationship with the community and really listening to their feedback.. Recap on Path of Exile play, staff and community in 2024 is simply this: Game play is ok but has too many options/paths for a build with confusing & pointless stats in gear & accessories that make building and game play bad, specially End game playing. STAFF of GGG (was TenCent) is simply this: The GM's are abusive with muting & banning ppl for minor little things, (Unless your a real old paying player) then it is ok for them to troll/give wrong info & abuse new players causing them to not want play the game at all. Reporting abuse to a GM on old players only get you muted for simple little things that DO NOT break the TOS, because if it did they would mute all the players who constantly troll/abuse new players making new ppl not want to bother playing PoE at all. NOW the Crux of the matter, Community simply is this: Everything I explained above about players being abusive above is just a fraction of the horror that is PoE, asking a question or asking for help with making a build result's in being given false information that makes it harder for you to play/build a character, they give info like PoE.ninja which does not help you, they give fake/trash 3rd party program & websites for build's & filters that do not work & waste your time. But I regress, GGG (was tenCent) does not care about any of that, but if you are new & have ANY kind of opinion/concern trying to help new players you are muted for any little thing as I was muted for 10066 days for my warning of reddit being bad information as I descovered by trying to use it for many things & find only hatefulness/trolling & wrong information. I tend to be bluntly honest but I never do it in a way that breaks any TOS as they claim it does.. If THAT breaks the TOS then why are ppl allowed to cuss at ppl, insult ppl and troll/abuse give wrong info to ppl messing them up & making them unwelcome?? As toxic chat goes, PoE is worse then WoW (World of Warcraft) LoL (League of legends) combined x 1000 because the GM does not seem to care that they are destroying PoE making there PoE 2 a real waste! P.S The Score you see at 86% is botted/paid for reviews (Fake Reviews). Despite all the hype in ARPG circles., Path of Exile has to be one of the most overrated games I've ever played.. This game is the best ARPG I have ever played hands down! It doesn't get a perfect score because of the complexity of the skill system and skill tree, as well as the Mana reservation system! I hate the reservation system in the game!!. I have played this game since there was 1 act, and i can honestly say its only gotten better over the years. Looking forward to PoE2.. What for a horrible game.gameplay is clumby and zero skill required. only luck and a good skilltree. Its Boring and the Endgame is always the same. The developer are creedy, graphics are bad, server laggs like hell and the campaignis ther worse I ever have seen. Boring Story, boring zones - not sure why this game is so hyped. Play Grim Dawn - is much better and only costs one!!!!. + Insane amount of playable characters and different content to dive into - very hard to play the game without doing some research on what is suitable for later content, but doable. The best ARPG ever made. Takes everything that made D2, and builds upon it. Amazing customization, and so much to do and learn and have fun with. If you want something you can really dive deep into, and spend a lifetime playing and learning. This is it.. Best thing ever happened after Diablo II. The definition of perfection for the RPG games. Long live the exiles.. Completely deserved 1010 from me. The game is absolutely filled with content, you have an immense amount of options and no similar game even comes close to what's on offer here. Developers are very quick to solve issues and respond to criticism. It feels like they play their own game professionally contrary to majority of modern titles. There's a steep learning curve, sure, and my only criticism is probably the lack of full tutorialintroduction to the vast multitude of mechanics for newer players which might be off-putting for some.. An amazing game, tons of content and so many different ways to play the game; overall just an amazing game. It only lost a point because the story was slightly forgettable.. Absolute beauty this one. Not even Metacritic can silence me here. Get wrecked.. A phenomenal action RPG that has proved to be so much more than the ""Diablo"" clone that many accuse it of being. Path of Exile rewards you for learning its intricate systems and diverse combat systems with consistently enjoyable gameplay that will carry you through infinite playthroughs! How is this game free!?. Unplayable new league on ps5 freezes and disconnections. First time i see that. PoE is easily the best arpg on the modern market. After the latest new AAA releases, its position just got stronger. You can try Titan Quest, Torchlight, Grim Dawn, D4, but none of it will even come close to the huge content PoE has as well as the most important things: Itemization, builds, progression and endgame content. This is a arpg for life.. Not new player friendly. The game does not do a good job of explaining its mechanics to new players. This can make it difficult to know what to do or where to go, and can lead to a lot of frustration. Requires research. In order to play Path of Exile effectively, you need to do a lot of research. This includes reading guides, watching videos, and experimenting with different builds. This can be a lot of work, and it can take away from the fun of the game. Requires 3rd party guides. It is very difficult to advance in Path of Exile without using 3rd party guides. These guides provide detailed instructions on how to build your character, what skills to use, and what items to equip. This can be helpful, but it can also take away from the discovery aspect of the game. Could use more in-game guides. Path of Exile is a very complex game, and it would be helpful if there were more in-game guides to help players learn the basics. This would make the game more accessible to new players and would reduce the need for 3rd party guides. Overall, I would not recommend Path of Exile to new players. The game is simply not new player friendly. If you are a fan of complex ARPGs, then you may enjoy Path of Exile, but be prepared to do a lot of research and experimentation.. This site wont let me post an actual review I get a 403 error for some reason.. Bloated game with extremely outdated graphics. It's hard to understand the cult like following it has.. + Replayable + Constant learning + Free + Passionate devs - Toxic community - Some nerfs may feel unwarranted at times - May be too complicated for new players.. Reasons I quit. Console needs all of the PC features. Additionally, CONSOLE ISSUES IGNORED by Devs even at EXILECON! Zero love for console players! 1. No party finder (lonely) and buy/sell doesn't have enough filters (major issue). They should offer mods other than loot filter. No battle Royale either. 2. Endgame: crafting, maps, builds, delves, and the weird mini games are incredibly confusing for new players especially if on console. 3. Too easy to ""brick"" your character. Propper socketing is a nightmare. Respec too expensive. Console economy too expensive with low active player base & currency/item farmers. Unable to trade for build dependent items at reasonable prices (unlike PC). This makes farming kind of pointless & crafting exponentially more difficult. 4. Too easy to get one shotted by random mobs and not know why. 5. Video build guides entirely for PC and not console. 6. Not new player friendly. Even after 350 hours I kept feeling lost. I hope POE 2 addresses these issues. Overall, game is far superior to Diablo 4. Try playing POE on console. Lack of players & gold/loot farmers makes many trades cost prohibitive. Which kinda ruins farming & requires way more ctafting. No group finder. No mods (except loot finder), limited build possibilities due to crap economy & controller. No Battle Royale. It **** ballz.. One of the best ARPGs out there, a must try. It has a large learning curve but if you’re okay with skill trees, you will be fine.. There are too many things that ruin the game: 1.Trading: No trading system, items are offered via trade chat (about 100 per minute). Impossible to compare offers for a single item you are looking for. Furthermore, about 95% of these items are pure junk and overpriced. 2. Leveling: Leveling up a character becomes boring if you have to repeat the same areas 3 times before you attempt what they call ""end-game content"". 3. End game and rewards: That is running maps (with map levels from 66 up to 79) with a Bossmonster at the end of the map.That looks fine because we all know that Bossmonsters hold special rewards like cool Uniques or currency or even more maps. In fact, they drop crap. I ran lvl 77-78 maps with a guildmate who had an 400% increased chance to get rarer items for almost a week and got nothing valuable. 4. Par","i've now played POE 2 for over 90 hours, and i'm completely disappointed . the only aspects that make the game remotely interesting are the graphics and the skill tree . the price for early access to a free-to-play game is outrageous ."
"1,040.Returnal","I really didn't expect to like this game, but ended up putting 90 hours into it and chasing the platinum trophy because I didn't want to stop playing. Rarely does a new type of game peak my interest, and then grab a hold of me like Returnal did. One of the most fun, and rewarding games you can play on PS5. I'm desperate for a Returnal 2 (Re-returnal?) announcement.. If you're a completionist I highly encourage you to skip this game, because getting trophies that depend on luck is quite frustrating. But anyway I got my platinum. Gameplay is not as tough as everyone says, and bullet hell was made enjoyable. IMHO, downsides of some upgrades should be less than they made it, because I played my runs almost every time without picking up maledicted items and parasites. From all the weapons there are 3 that outperform others, so at some point you'll start using only them. The plot could be more friendly to the player, because I'm sure that most of us after playing the game were searching explanations in the internet. But everything else is good: gameplay, sound, graphics, atmosphere.. A good roguelike, with an intriguing storyline filled with symbolisms and metaphors abou pyschology,tight controls, fun gameplay,however the story is the aspect stands out the most, One of the best playstation games in recent years,. ......so that's all ? A ""game"" which looks like more a tech demo ( launched with PS5 ). Plot is terrible, boring and messed up. Gameplay is frustrating because there is no permanent upgrades, even tiny ones.... no nothing ( weapons upgrades doesn't count since you lost them aswell and you have to gain again every time ), with a pinch of ""feminine power masculinity mixed"" propaganda, which is so fashionable in """"""modern"""""" society. At least, they could've addeds some TRUE shortcuts near the ****, not even that. So you try try try, until the luck will be on your side and eventually beat the rooms / bosses. No, that's not the right way to do videogames, which should entertain first, difficult games are fine, but LUCK on games is another thing. The only decent thing? The graphics engine... the rest is to be forgotten. Absolutely does not deserve more than 6/1 votes, as usual reviews most of the time are not true.. They don't make a new formula. Standard rogue-like game. Gameplay is fun but content is not enough.. I was not impressed when started the game, but after finding out a bit of the story and playing through the events of the house and various bosses I was greatly surprised. This game has simple combat mechanics and is really entertaining. The only thing I didnt really like was the way to get the true ending for chapter 3. Still a good game.. Brilliant third-person roguelite shooter that is a tremendous showcase for the PS5. The mystery at the core of the story is deeply unsettling. The alien planet is terrifying and seems to run on nightmare logic. The enemies are tough but fair. Bad luck or one wrong move can ruin a long and good run, but there's always incentive to keep trying due to how satisfying the gunplay is and how gripping the story is. This game rules.. It's tough,frustrating and fun. The combat style and storyline is truly excellent.. I rarely ever give a 10 rating, but this game really shines for me. Over the years since it's release it has become one of my favorite games of all time.. Game was fun at the beginning, however it started to throw overpowered enemies so often at some point. I mean what's the point a mini boss on ""reward room"". Challenging games are fun but this game just another one that makes it unfair. Even though game tries to make random map, after couple of cycles, it just clicks that you see same rooms in different orders. And character progression is just so poor. After 10 cycles and you don't feel any permanent upgrades that would help you is terrible design choice. It took 18 hours to beat it but almost 10 hours of it was so bland and boring.. THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED, It makes no sense, the weapons are useless and the enemy is ridiculously overpowered, DON'T BUY IT you'll regret throw your money on it. The game is top-notch in every aspect, from the atmosphere, gameplay, graphics, to its responsiveness. It takes some time for players to master everything and understand certain intricacies, but persistence is truly rewarded. The biggest downside, in my opinion, is the unnecessary requirements for obtaining all the trophies, which involve a lot of replaying after completing the main game. During this period, the perfect impression the game leaves while completing the core missions can somewhat diminish.. I feel quite fooled by Daniel who really hyped this game to me. Not my taste and I hope he never gives me recommendations like this again. It's quite possibly the best shooter on PS5, combining the action mechanics **** like Doom or Control with the new technologies of the PS5, but it has far too many RNG mechanics to make it an enjoyable game unless you can play it for excessive amounts of time. It requires a ton of practice, and to play it well, you must replay EVERY part of the game except for the bosses you've beaten, while making no real progress in between. It's not a roguelite, it's a true roguelike, where dying really means starting completely over. If you don't practice regularly like an instrument, there's no way you can eventually stat grind your way through, such as in a Dark Souls game.. This game shocks me, I was not expecting to be this good, i only buy it because it was a super cheap bundle it with my PS5. I'm not a rogue-like player, i only played DeadCells and Moonlighter before this and i drop those game in few hours. But this one feels so good, so **** gameplay is perfect, its fast, fluid and **** music is awesome, it totally get you in the mood and the sound design is top. Biomes and enemies looks good.Boss fights are **** everything is seasoned with a space mystery/horror **** the Difficult is excellent, right on the point, not impossible but challenging.This is one of those game where everything works together just perfectly, every gear fit: gameplay, visual, sound and story works in harmony.I got some complains:First one is a personal thing, i'm a physical games dude, i want my games on disc/cart, i always buy physical and i always play the 1.00 version (the one on the disc) first. And this game 1.00 version is quite buggy, even game breaking bugs, i was not able to finish this game without update it because of 2 key items not spawning on the map.Also the 3rd act of the game is kind of cheap grinding, but it's only for unlocking the True Ending, so I forgive it. So my real complain with the game was the story, i like the ambiguity and mystery throughout the game, BUT, i want to finish the game and get answers... I achieve the True Ending and i still don't know WTF was going on. Way too cryptic, i'm not even sure the whole thing is not just a dream induced by Selene's ****, It would have been nice to have a good explanation at the end, I would have given it a perfect grade if that were the case, but anyway... The rest of the game's aspect are so good that i'm ok. Very underated game.. I like the fun gameplay, visuals, atmosphere and sound but rng and roguelike mechanics ruin it for me. I beat the first two bosses in 7 hours and biome 3 just killed my enjoyment. Having to rely on rng for a good build and spending 10-20 minutes just getting back to where you died is soul **** and not fun. If it had soulslike checkpoints and no RNG i would rate it 9/10. A bit of fps drops too. ABSOLUTE GEM! Its 2024 and still the best game in this generation! The HP.Lovecraft inspired atmosphere is ""beautiful"". You feel every tenctacle on your arm. And that noises.. just phenomenal. Even the story and the gameplay, controls are amazing. For a Lovecraft fan it a must have journey. The best rougelike game out there. 10p!. This game is unique, it's a masterpiece, the first game where I finally was saying ""this is next gen, NOW I'm on the ps5"" - It put me in the same states I was after watching ""Mullholand Drive"": Obssessed. I could not stop trying to put the puzzle of the story together I was hooked. The gameplay is nervous and challenging, the hardest part is the beginning of course, then you get better, and it feels perfectly balanced. A nice ratio between challenge and reward. I will never forget: Climbing the tower and hearing the ""hyperion"" music getting louder the more you climbed. And I will never forget the adrenaline when I was falling more and more down in the abyss , about to fight the final boss; I was as scared as if I was diving in real life. I highly recommand this game, but it's a challenge, don't come back crying here because it's too hard. Hyperion theme will haunt me for ever, in a beautiful way, good job Bobby Krlic. Conclusion: It's a Masta'Piece, can't wait for a new game from those humble developpers. (All the 0/10 here are cry baby that can't handle a challenge).. WAISTE OF TIME. Overly punitive. It's a shame, because the substance is all there. If the progression wasn't interrupted every time by the roguelike mechanics, thus making every run frustrating... it would be a lot of fun. Roguelike isn't my thing, that's why I didn't buy it on day one.. I shouldn't have bought it after that either. Never again a roguelike of any kind. /// As a HUGE fan of every Housemarque game, this is the first one that disappoints me.. I'm not exaggerating when I call ""Returnal"" the biggest piece of crap I've ever played and a complete waste of money. The game is so incredibly boring that I had to uninstall it and was upset about the 29 EUR I paid for this rubbish. I was expecting a difficult game that would challenge me and have a well thought out combat system, what I got was just the exploration of the same empty and depressing worlds that look like a better textured PS3 game. The game gives you no indication of what to do, the enemies within the stage are undemanding, the boss is brutally difficult. I have no problem with learning the pattern and starting over after a lost battle, but that means another hour of ""exploring"", which is nothing but boredom and takes away any momentum from the game. Housemarque should be stripped of their licence to ever develop a video game again.. 10/10 game. No debate, no discussion. If you disagree you're just admitting you found it too hard.. Way too repetitive and difficult. I had a kind of fun only in the first 10 hours, then it started being work and frustration. That's not what a video game should be. Make more games for casual gamers, where you can, for instance, change te difficulty - I would have loved to see more of this game than the first two and a half levels. But dying all the time isn't funny. And I don't have the time to play more than two hours each day (and I play more than one game).. People complain about progression and death. Yet, this is a rogue-lite. Personally, I love this game. As I dove a little bit into the lore, which is totally my genre (science fiction and ancient civilization), I really enjoyed it. It helps us understand the story better as well. The story is very intriguing at first and have a lot of very nice plot twists, that I love, even if sometimes, I shay myself during the house sequences. Finally, I Love the gameplay and replayability brought by the FREE DLC. The bosses are awesome and brings new mechanic each time, which is great. Music is top tier. DLC is top tier as well with an infinite mode, sadly ruined by cheaters at the top of the leaderboards but it’s a fun challenge and a nice twist to the end of the story. I recommend this game as it is in my top 3 games of all time with THE TALOS PRINCIPLE 1 and BLOODBORNE.. A good game, ruined by its own nature unfortunately. It could be great if it had checkpoints and a real progression. Shame.. Fresh approach to roguelite / bullet-hell style games. Everything starts as an exploration of what this hostile planet is all about, but ends in being unable to escape the emotional hell of our own creation forever trapped.. As someone who beat Dark Souls games and having played video games for 30 yearsI can say that this game is just so unfair hard that all the fun is gone after repeating the same **** over and over... Could have been great but not everyone is a hardcorepro gamer with tons of time... Gave it a retry on PC and made it to the last boss and even though I was overpowered I couldnt make it... Why not include a story mode... Dang it was all there why make it so hard only a handful can complete it.... Frustrating ""die and repeat"" type of game. It's just a waste of time. Graphics and everything else is ok.. When ""Returnal"" landed on the PS5, it promised an exhilarating blend of roguelike mechanics with third-person shooter action, set against a richly detailed sci-fi backdrop. While the game undeniably delivers on its atmospheric visuals and sound design, scratching beneath its glossy surface reveals a core gameplay loop that's as frustrating as it is monotonous. Graphics and Sound: A Lonely Highlight First, the positives: ""Returnal's"" graphical fidelity is stunning. The dark, foreboding landscapes of Atropos are a sight to behold, and the game's use of the PS5's hardware to create immersive environments is unparalleled. The sound design, too, is top-notch, with the 3D audio effectively building tension and enhancing the alien atmosphere. Gameplay: Where Promise Fades However, the sheen of the visuals and audio can only carry the game so far. ""Returnal"" falls into the trap of many roguelikes - repetition. The cycle of die-and-retry is expected in this genre, but here it feels more like a punishment than a learning experience. The high difficulty curve might appeal to hardcore gamers, but for many, it translates to frustration and burnout. Progress in ""Returnal"" feels painfully slow. Each death can erase significant progress, sending you back to the beginning with little to show for your efforts. While this is a staple of the roguelike genre, ""Returnal"" does little to innovate, making each run feel less like a fresh start and more like Groundhog Day with aliens. The story, cryptic and intriguing at first, quickly becomes lost in the game's repetitive nature. The snippets of narrative and world-building are fascinating but spaced too far apart, making it challenging to maintain interest in the overarching mystery of Atropos and Selene's plight. User Interface and Controls: A Mixed Bag The controls in ""Returnal"" are tight and responsive, a necessity given the game's demanding action. However, the user interface and inventory management leave much to be desired. Navigating menus feels clunky, and the game does a poor job explaining many of its deeper mechanics, leaving players to fend for themselves in understanding the complex systems at play. Conclusion: Not For Everyone ""Returnal"" is a game of contrasts. Its visual and audio presentation is among the best on the PS5, yet its core gameplay loop is likely to alienate all but the most patient and masochistic of players. For those looking for a challenging, atmospheric sci-fi adventure, it might be worth the plunge. However, players adverse to high difficulty and repetition will find little joy in the endless cycle of death and rebirth that ""Returnal"" offers. In the end, ""Returnal"" is a testament to wasted potential. What could have been a groundbreaking title is bogged down by its adherence to the most punishing aspects of the roguelike genre, making it a game that's easier to admire from afar than to love up close.. While this game looks really nice and plays well, I do not think it works as a rogue-like. First off, the runs/loops are entirely too long and I believe they changed this, but when this game came out you could not save and suspend the game and would just have to enter rest mode on the PS5. Also, the abilities and ""upgrades"" you get, even after 10 hours in, never feel good or cohesive with one another. Some of the later zones are also extremely brutal, so after an hour into a run and feeling good about it, you could get easily overrun in the matter of seconds which feels like ****.. Way too much RNG to make progress and only 6 levels, if you die in the third phase of a boss you have to play through two whole levels again to try again because nothing is carried over to the next run. It has great graphics, audio, and controls, so if you want an arcade style space shooter you may love it, but progress system and wooly story are just average.. So happy I didn't buy it. I like to have fun playing games, not getting frustrated. A roguelike third-person shooter, Returnal begins with astronaut Selene crash landing on mysterious planet where she soon learns that she is trapped in a time loop. Some of the runs can be a little too long, especially when combined with the high difficulty which can see death strike at any moment, but it’s hard to think **** with more satisfying shooting and movement. Returnal is without doubt one of the best shooters, and best rogue-likes, you’ll find on any console.. Great game. Fun and not a lot of investment required for short gaming sessions. Action packed. This was my first “bullet-hell” and I liked the balance of punishment and power is a metroidvania style kind way. I think $60 is overpriced, but I got a key on sale for $30 and it was definitely well worth it.. This game is exceedingly average. The gameplay is fun and offers a challenge but it is so mind numbingly repetitive. Whatever you do in the first Biome you repeat for the next 4 Biomes. The Boss fights were a lot of fun but that was the only real thrill the game offers. it basically plays like a 3rd person shooter version of Dark Souls. Also if you played this on the PS5 during release date this game was incredibly buggy and constantly crashed your PS5. I can't remember the last time I played a game that crashed my PS5 so often. I had to wait months to actually play and beat this game just to make sure the game isn't constantly crashing on me.. The game seemed beautiful and pleasant to play the very first time I had ran it. But after 5-10 hours I thought that I couldn't finish it because of it complexity. Now I have 40-50 hours played, finished the main story, trying to reach the hidden finish and playing from time to time in the DLC's contetn. So my advice to all who didn't like the game in the beginning - read some guides and practice more. After you understand the whole mechanic of the game, you can get a real pleasure from this game. Only a few moments disappointed me - the plot and the ending of the game are blurred in places and sometimes the locations and the enemies there were too similar to previous runs.. So very good and addicting , when I first played it, it had a few bugs so I'm deducting 1 point of it. A difficult bullet-hell FPS. An evocative journey through a ruined eldritch civilization. A surreal mystery surrounding the main character. And the best rogue-like I have ever played. It's hard, but it's also not. I managed to get the normal ending with 6 deaths and 16 hours played. The game has a lot of complexity you can take advantage of, and being as prepared as possible and taking your time are key.. I’ve played Soulstyle games before but Returnal’s difficulty is extra hard, it feels punishing to the point of **** the fun out of it. The fact you start from the beginning any time you die with no weapons and zero saves is annoying and gets insanely repetitive. This game had so much potential but fails because it wanted be a Souls type game but even harder and instead is just annoying and repetitive.. Hard games are great. But only if the gameplay is interesting or varied enough to enjoy the learning, exploration, and progression. Returnal's only payoff as you sink countless hours into runs with no meta-progression are poor attempts at suspense/thrill. MC has Zero personality. Very few guns, and none of them unique enough to change the playstyle. Alt-fire is the only real variation, but eventually that gets old. The pacing might be fine for the rare few that are virtuosos at these game mechanics. But 90% of players don't finish this game because the designers made zero attempt to appeal to anyone but the elite. There are countless brilliant game design techniques in other roguelites that would have smoothed the progression. Or they could have made the items you find more impactful than the boring shrug-fest. Then i would want to keep trying. But instead they did neither, and I find myself among the majority that isn't enjoying the repetition enough to see it through.. Sometimes a game comes out and receives high scores, leaving me scratching my head. Returnal is one of those games. It’s a Metroid-inspired, third-person bullet hell that quickly became too tedious, difficult and repetitive for me to have wanted to continue playing. The movement controls are also awkward for the game it is. Dying and restarting a level with some changes every time is kind of a neat idea, but with the sheer amount of lost progress, frustration, repetitiveness, boredom and tediousness, it sounds to me like Sony paid a lot of money for reviewers to give Returnal good reviews. It’s sad that that is what the gaming industry has been reduced to. We saw the same thing with Naughty Dog’s garbage games. As someone who has been a gamer for many, many years, I am genuinely confused as to why anyone would think this is a good game. I think a 3/10 is generous for Returnal.. Gameplay and game itself amazingly fun but losing the progress and whatever I got then it’s terribly frustrating I got the game cd and it was a mistake to do checkup on it on YouTube before I actually play it but mistake is a mistake , I’m not recommending anyone to buy it. Atmosphere, environment, gameplay, mechanics. The whole idea of the game is new and different. I didn’t like it at the start but the more I played, the more I got addicted to it. No difficulty setting forcing the player to always get better. The plot twists are on another level.. Great game with each boss being interesting probably the most rewarding I've ever felt beating a game. good game, but...would be great if they add checkpoint mid level & before boss. Normally I'd say it's a 6/10 or 6.5/10 game but after I see that overrated journalist scores and average 86(must be a joke),scoring it a 5/10.. i've played like 60 hours and I'm very disapointed play better MassEffect or DeadSpace honestly.... ""Returnal"" is the first game I've played from the Finnish game developer studio, Housemarque, and it certainly won't be the last. ""Returnal"" is a rogue-like third-person shooter with a unique atmosphere. I must admit that I initially had difficulties falling in love with the game. In fact, it wasn't until my second attempt, nearly three-quarters of a year after its release, that it truly clicked with me. But when it did, the game completely captivated **** boss battles are a real highlight, and the sense of accomplishment when overcoming them, whether after just one attempt or many, is incredibly rewarding. The gameplay is fast-paced and addictive. The enemy design is refreshingly unique, and the biomes are thoughtfully crafted. Additionally, ""Returnal"" offers an enigmatic and intriguing storyline that leaves plenty of room for **** my opinion, ""Returnal"" is an all-around excellent game that more people should give a try.. I would like to put 7.5, but unfortunately there is no such rating) I put 8, the game is great, but not for everyone, the tactile feedback on the dualsense gamepad is incredible, this is the first game I played on PS5, and at the expense of the game itself, it is just a good 3D roguelike, with good graphics and cool gameplay ). Technically is really amazing. Amazing visuals and sound. The game at times feels a bit frustrating taking out the joy of playing. I recommend trying it out.. Just Awesome. Man this was a %&@#! to platinum. But it had to be done, Bloodborne of this console generation. 10 out of 10, nothing touches this. This is what sequel to metroid prime games should be if nintendo weren't second rate devs for decades now. That ugly face on the cover cost them sales I bet though. This is the worst game ever, you basically doing the same thing over and over and over like some sort of **** round about, basically in the same area fighting the same type of monsters over and over, again and again. ****. This game is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it is getting bad reviews because this is not a very easy game. And let's be honnest, by reading the reviews here, most gamers are clearly just not very good. But if you are decent at games and like Roguelike games, I strongly recommend this game. The bosses are the best design I have seen in any recent game and this is the most fun I had in well over a decade with a AAA game. Without spoiling anything, I am currently near the end of the game and only died 5-6 times because I was being stupid. Don't listen to reviews and try it for yourself !. very entertaining to play, a very interesting story and very good scenarios and bosses. Great .... incredible game with incredible story/gameplay!. The Graphics, Sounds and atmosphere are fantastic. I got the point of dying and starting all over again at the beginning, but running through every biom again and again to reach the previous point is so boring and I dont have the time for playing a game with making hardly progress in the story. I played every souls game and there you can see progress although you die a lot of times. On the other hand the game-play is very good. After I died the 10th time at the first boss I quit the game and never played it again. Total waste of time and money although I payed only 25€.. Dualsense with all its glory and potential. Now i realize how good the ps5 controller really is. In general, i trully believe that Returnal is one of the best third person action games out there But, it is a roguelike and that alone ruins the experience. Sadly, it becomes very repetitive after a while. It is a pity, because it could be a masterpiece.. It's easily a 9, gameplay is awsome, under appreciated, deserved way more than it got. Interesting. This game is perfect. It's really fun and the co-op system is great. I spent countless hours playing it with my best friend and we had a lot of fun. For me that's what a game should do!. I just couldn't get into this game as I have with other roguelites. Runs felt more like extended boss runs with very little improvement. An utter grind and a disappointment, though the gameplay and visuals are outstanding.. Great gameplay, I actually hope future games borrow the smoothness and mechanics from this Returnal. The story is wack or I don't get it, I should watch an explanation video because its very jumbled and metaphorical. This game hit all my needs tho, I can't think of a single thing it was lacking and maybe going forward they can expand it to 4 player co-op with wider maps or something.. This game is great with PC cheat mods with one hit kills and no reloads unlimited health best for PC.. I can see why this game might not be everyones cup of tea but to me this game is a freaking masterpiece. I’ve been dying to see what Housemarque does next after beating it. The soundtrack, the bosses, the gameplay. Everything about it felt like a true work of art. All of its shortcomings were well outshined by everything it did so well. 10/10 hands down.. Phenomenal Flow and Gun Shooter Gameplay. Nice Graphics and mysterious Story to let you die over and over again with so much fun to finally have a good build and feel invincible. You have to be frust tolerant (as in every Rogue like) … but it‘s worth it!!. The game is award-winning and very neo-odd. Sony took a huge risk with the release **** in this genre, but the game turned out great. Boss fights and just a class, there are three stages each of them is completely different. How bosses are drawn is worthy of individual praise. Great game, I recommend it to everyone!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Beautiful but so annoying. You feel no progress by dying again and again in randomly generated locations. I really enjoyed this game at first, the graphics are amazing and I loved the sci-fi atmosphere. All this quickly wore off on my 100th play through of just the first level. This game is way too repetitive and difficult to enjoy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My review isn't gonna be life-changing in any way, I just wanna chime in- though late to the party. If you enjoy rogue-likes, and maybe this isn't completely fair but I'd actually say tough combat like in Nioh or Dark Souls (I understand if not everyone's gonna love that comparison, it's not one I'm willing to die by either), then holy cow this game I'd say is for you. Oh, and creepy games. Goodness this game is creepy, if you read item descriptions it'll be normal stuff and suddenly the descriptions say obscene stuff that'll creep you out, in-game nightmares. You're basically on an alien planet, and everything ACTUALLY feels alien. Most games when you're on alien planets it's just ""ah it's a shooting game, and things here are named Bobblebloop and Bozzlepop so they have five legs instead of two"" or whatever. The sounds, the atmosphere, weird random noises and visuals, ugh it's SO CREEPY and alien lol, and I say that in a really good way if that makes any sense. I don't know why I fanboy over this game so much, it's just been tough finding a good repetitive'ish game to mindlessly (but concentrate hard in) play the last few months for me, and Returnal was it. Super-frustrating in the first cycles, but please believe me when I say it gets easier down the line, without me wanting to spoil how and why :P. Returnal is such a fun and challenging game. Had a blast playing it. I hope we get a second opus cause this deserves more love !!. This game would be more popular if it had dropped the 'roguelite' crap and just implemented a fair and consistent save feature. It has things going for it, like good visuals, sound and satisfying gameplay but then flushes it all down the toilet trying to be something it shouldn't. 0 is absurd but there are too many 10s that do not reflect the value of this game which is still very low. If you really wish to try the game, buy a physical copy you can recoup some money on or return and don't support Sony's $70 scam. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. yes i understand its a rogue type of game, so of course you're gonna die and restart over and over again. the problem is i have no idea what i am doing, the map is constantly changing, and your weapons are underpowered and you barely have any consumables. did i mention you're going to die alot? Yes its pretty but after spending two hours and literally getting no where with no clue as to what to do, fudge this game. I wouldn't waste any time on it, and its free on ps plus.. For some reason i dont like this game .Its bit dark and gloomy. Its not my cup of tea. I might not want to play this again. This is one of the best games I have ever played. If you are a parent this will be especially meaningful. The gameplay is smooth and while the levels can be challenging the bosses are fairly straightforward. The only part I found frustrating was getting the three keys to unlock that one door, but if you strategize right even that isn’t too big a problem. This game left me feeling sad, a little haunted, and wanting more.. At first I despised this game. Overly tough at times until you realize it's just like a Soulsborne game. You need to really learn from your mistakes, and level up new weapon abilities as you find them. It makes each subsequent run much easier, and after you get used to the bullet-hell tactics this game bec","""returnal 2"" is one of the most fun, and rewarding games you can play on ps5 . gameplay is not as tough as everyone says, and bullet hell was made enjoyable . downsides of some upgrades should be less than they made it ."
"1,041.Braid Anniversary Edition","Braid has some of the most mind twisting and testing puzzles out there. I had never played the original, the reward for figuring out the tough puzzles is immense. I think some of them are very frustrating and can kind of drive you crazy.. A fun platformer puzzler hybrid game. It can be difficult but the time rewind feature helps keep it fair. Graphics look good for a remastered Xbox 360 gen game and it has really quick load times. Only downside I found was that I just don't have the patience for this type of platformer game.. I usually like puzzle games but I didn't like **** many times is kind of hard to know what the game wants you to do.I was about to drop it a few times. Maybe 16 years ago was a cool concept but nowadays I can name dozens of puzzle games that are way more engaging and fun than Braid.",braid is a platformer puzzler hybrid game . graphics are good for a remastered Xbox 360 gen game .
"1,042.Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2","A fantastic and completely overlooked fighting game, everybody should know and play. And maybe the most fighting mechanics in gaming. Overall rating: 8.9.. Visually spectacular update on the old 2D Neo Geo fighting game which was widely regarded as one of the ""best of the rest"" after Streetfighter, Soul Calibur and Tekken. Outrageous characters and spectacular special moves combined with pretty Anime style graphics make for a visual feast but it sometimes feels like a glorified button basher. Fans of the original and 2D beat 'em ups in general will no doubt love it though.. Amazing cell shaded anime fighter, great characters, easy to figure out controls for beginners and great story, best in the series to date.. Best fighting game ever. Awesome characters, awesome music, awesome gameplay. Maybe it lacks some game mode, like Survival... but is fine for me.. Late to the scene on this one but one of the best fighters round for casuals and extreme. Audio/visual is top of the class. Good mix of characters and gameplay choices and solid fighting action. Don't let the anime design put you off... Its a bloody good game.. Baiken is a fantastic addition to the cast and gave a lot more incentive to play. Otherwise, like the prior iterations great visuals and fighting mechanics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best fighting game avalible, its Has great graphics and a very polished gameplay .i found the 3D models and the animations very impressive because while you Play this game you actually feel like watching an anime.. The game itself is zany and wild and lots of fun to play with the kids, remind them that age and treachery will always defeat youth and skill... But I'm giving it a mediocre score because of the menus which are among the most irritating I've ever encountered. Maybe my copy is wonky, but just getting into the game is a challenge. Begins with a menu asking if you want to use an existing save or go on without one. Either option will usually land you back at this question again and it doesn't seem to let you through until you've answered it a few times. After that you're bombarded by other menus and menus within menus. It all just feels really clunky. That said, the characters are really creative and fun.. This is technically a new game because they have released another disk for this game but its basically a glorified patch for Guilty Gear Xrd. So if you’re a big fan of Anime Fighting games then this is a no-brainer to buy. Everyone is going to be moving onto the newest version so it makes sense to move along with them. For me personally, I like a more basic fighting game. Guilty Gear is one of those games where it starts to get a little too complex for me. The combos are very long, the characters are all very different and quite honestly the core game mechanic is, everything is cheap. Every character has unblockables and mix-ups for days and it’s a steep learning curve. I’ve always liked the more “basic” fighting games like Mortal Kombat, Injustice, Street Fighter or Killer Instinct. This game is more for the very serious fighting game scene. This will never be a mainstream fighting in American Culture. People who are buying this game are going to tournaments.. God damn is this game bonkers awesome. Even the very bonkers story (PUDDING!!!). Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2 is yet another expansion of an already vast and diverse fighter. Though there are a lot of mechanical difficulties to overcome, the game itself does a wonderful job of teaching new players the complexities of the game. However, due to these complexities, it does make for what I would consider to be an often overcomplicated fighter. If that's your thing, you'll love this, but some obstacles feel unnecessary.. I am not a big fighting game player and would say the only FG's I ever played heavily were SF2 and Tekken 3 back in the day. I had the itch for a good fighter and had been trying to decide between Tekken 7 and Injustice 2 but I stumbled upon this little gem and decided to give it a shot since I loved the art style and it was $20 cheaper than the others. I'm glad I did and I have become super into this fighter. The characters are all pretty unique with great designs and the art and animation is phenomenal. It has incredible depth and tons of mechanics for hardcore fighters but there is nothing to daunting and you can still have tons of fun and not be semi competent even with out mastering/understanding them all. The lobbies and rooms one of the coolest setups for online play I have seen in any game. The player base is not huge but it's enough that I have never had too much trouble finding people of my lowly skill level to spar with no matter the time of day. If you have even the slightest interest at all in this game give it a shot and you will not regret it.","a fantastic and completely overlooked fighting game, everybody should know and play . outrageous characters and spectacular special moves combine with pretty Anime style graphics . audio/visual is top of the class ."
"1,043.OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood","Very basic uninspired platformer that it more irritating than anything else.. Dull boring visuals and extremely repetaive gameplay loop.. This is my favorite game, ever. I've played a bunch of skateboarding games, snowboarding games and this game is the best. The controls are EXTREMELY precise which I love. The levels are designed very well and the music is pretty good. Most of the criticism of the game seems to be written by those who don't respect the game enough to get good at it. They fail to land over and over and instead of trying to master their timing the say ""the controls are unresponsive"". The controls don't respond to poor timing and a quitter attitude. I've put a couple of hundred hours into the game and I can tell you that the controls are phenomenal. You need frame-perfect timing for maximum scores which shouldn't be considered a bad thing. It should be considered a great thing because the developer is encouraging real skill and doesn't try to make you feel like a bad-ass for pressing one button. Making this game free on PS4+ was a mistake. It devalues the game in the mind of the player and I suspect many of those who pay nothing for a game consider it worthless before they play it and so are unwilling to put in the time required to get good. The only criticism of the game I have are the challenges. Collecting things is boring and it encourages a way of playing which doesn't increase the players skill level (no tricks, no need to land perfects) just go through the level over and over and over until you get the thing. This is only annoying in later stages when the player is able to do advanced tricks and is forces to play like a newbie in order to complete the challenge. I urge you to give this game a fair try. It's an absolute gem. Can't wait for Olliolli 3.. If you like indie games, skateboarding and retro aesthetics, you will love this game. I have to admit that I have personally become a bit difficult to get used to the controls since I am used to skate games like Skate 3 or Tony Hawks, but once you get used to it it is very fun since you can perform many tricks and the game is very Quick. Suitable for all audiences!. The game has great animations, and the controller works sometimes. If you are looking to get frustrated, this game is right up your alley. It is a breeze at first, but don't get fooled, you have to truly master this game to be able to finish it.. This game is by far the worst game I have ever played. The timings of the landings are completely unnatural and just reeks of a browser game done wrong. Even for free with PS+ it is utter turd. I am thinking I might let my sub run out so I can remove the anal discharge stain from my list of games.. I originally rated this a 2/10 after playing it for about 15 **** I've changed my score to an 8 after trying it again and decided it's a fantastic game. I have been playing it on my vita and it's super fun once you get used to the controls. Trust me, if you feel like there is a mass lack of skating games on the new consoles, then you're in luck, because this game will definitely fill you without disappointment. It's fast paced, very arcade-like. It looks great, the music is amazing, and it's just a whole lot of fun to play. There isn't too much variety, which is why this game is down 2 points for me, but it's definitely a whole lot of fun to play.. It's not like we are going to get skate 4 anyway. Shut your mouth and stop complaining. It is actually pretty good and has some sick ass music (aka my jam). Don't get me wrong, I **** love this game, but the game is broken BEYOND BELIEF. The controls are broken, I cannot even count how many times I tried to grind but the game doesn't register, or attempt to manual but instead just land. If you can get past broken controls, get it, if not, don't bother.. tried as PS+ game so had open mind, but gobsmacked at the high reviews for this?! I didn't play it for 5 minutes but cleared career mode on amateur before deleting in disgust. Side scrolling borefest with graphics that look like they are from an Amiga. The gameplay while admittedly slick is nauseating to me, as difficulty ramps up the only way i could play was letting your eyes glaze so all your seeing is the points u need to jump/skate **** exactly what i'd call fun of any description. Am sure I could find a myriad of similar quality free PC games which i'd never bother to look at. Not what I bought a PS4 for, terrible!. I recently bought this game after having an obsession over Skate 3 on my PlayStation 3. So i decided to look on the PlayStation store to see if i could download it on my PlayStation 4, unfortunately you cannot. However whilst looking i came across this gem ****. In one word its beautiful although challenging. At first i found it difficult to get used to the totally unique controls but once i overcame the learning curve the game felt sharp, yet fluid and effortless. Passing through each level can take a huge number of attempts as you learn when and when not to continue combos to eventually reach the end but the super quick re-spawn times means you never stop playing. I have one minor problem with the game though and that is some of the more difficult tricks for example double kick-flips and 720 flips are very difficult to pull off due to the fact you must move the analog stick in more than one direction as well as hold either R1 or L1 therefore making these tricks harder to preform accurately especially when you are mid combo and travelling at high speed. to conclude i love this game with its fast pace and seriously addictive game play but one thing stops it from being a 10.. I don't understand any of these low idiot user reviews for this game. They make no sense. Trust me, it's a great game - especially for fans of either the Trials or Tony Hawk series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It wasn't even okay for being a ""free"" ""indie"" game. It commits many of the indie game sins and because of that, it's a forgettable and boring game. This is something I would expect from a Java browser game labeled as a timewaster, not a critically acclaimed game for a current generation console, and costing money at that. CONTROLS: They're very basic to begin with, but the trick controls are real finnicky on timing (I have to push a button to ""Land""? Okay...) to where it seems more luck-based than actually skillful timing of the trick. Which tends to lead me towards button mashing than actually playing the game. I passed the controller off to two friends who were critiquing my gameplay, and found them falling into the same pitfalls. OVERALL? 2D Sidescrolling, Pixel Art, Minimalist Design, and Simple Gameplay. These are signs of an ""Indie"" game, and in order to overcome shortfalls in graphics, depth and visual experience, the gameplay has to be top-notch. Which Olli Olli 2 isn't. Better suited to wasting time at work in a browser game if you can't use your phone. Because I would rather play ""smartphone"" games like old Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games, XCOM, Shadowrun, or Baldur's Gate. Leave the ""nostalgia"" feel for the actually nostalgic video games.. The game is great to play, especially to eat up time. A side scrolling game where I often get confused with the controls. I failed tooooo many times, but I still love this game. I definitely recommend it.. I can honeetly say that this game was one of the few games I didn't even know existed until it was free on PS Plus. When I did get it, however, I thought it was a decent game. Its hard as hell, but that makes me love it even more.. If you were a fan of the ""Skate"" franchise or ""Tony Hawk Pro Skater"" ,OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood will be perfect for you. It brings back the stick controls of skate and the Fun/Addictiveness of the Pro Skater games. It's also a great sequel, It's pretty much a improvement on every aspect of the previous game. Each level has great flow to it with a mix of obstacles and bonuses to aim for, some doubling your points or speed but can also lead to you face planting into the ground. The quick and addictive game-play of OlliOlli is what keeps you playing for hours without realizing it, The controls are easy to learn but hard to master, but once you start pulling off even the smallest of combos you feel very accomplished. The level design is quite diverse with themes ranging: Cites,Ancient Ruins,Wild West and other things to experience yourself. But it's great to skate in more places then just a city, the more extreme feels give the game a fun arcade feel. If you have PS+ this month I highly recommend you give this game a try and even if you don't or miss the offer I still urge any skateboard fan to give this game a try, I can assure you will become addicted.. Absolutely great, satisfying, original skateboarding game. This game takes a lot of time to master and is so much fun. There are many improvements over the first game with new features such as launches, manuals, new tricks, grind switches and lots more. This was free on playstation plus in march. Personally, I think I should have payed for it. Also, the soundtrack is **** INCREDIBLE. Good job, roll7.. A nice minimalist look, but uninteresting, and very repetitive. I gave it a go for 5 mins, and lost interest and deleted. Would have been sorely disappointed if it wasn't free. Maybe should have played longer to get a better feel, but from reading description and other's comments, I would only have been wasting my time.. I'm quite surprised of the high scores this game is getting from reviewers. At it's core, the game is a simple side scrolling skating game, with limited amount of tricks, but a huge amount of maps. It's not a bad game per se, but it just gets very old very fast. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a strong proponent of retro side scrollers, and I used to devour Tony Hawk's when they were still cool. The problem I have with this game is multifaceted. The most important one are the controls. The game does require a very precise timing to land all the tricks, but at least to me, the controls don't feel crisp enough to achieve this. There's just something off with the visual cues, controller input and whether or not you're successful in landing a jump to a point where luck seems to be involved more than skill. This particularly frustrating with landing a manual, where half the time you're on point, and half the time not for no apparent reason. Secondly, while there are a great amount of maps available, it doesn't alleviate the feeling of repetitiveness in the game. Bottom line, like someone before me mentioned, this game is at it's best when I start to feel like rummaging through the old boxes and fire up a Tony Hawk's for an evening or too. Your mileage may vary.. This game is alright, the approach is cool to the skating genre of games, but if you're like me, and you are used to the Skate franchise and how the skating mechanics are in that game, good luck forgetting that and learning these mechanics, i often find myself grinding when i mean to manual, and manualing when i mean to grind. it is a huge learning curve to overcome if you're used to the Skate franchise's mechanics, not to mention you have to hit the X Button every time that you want to land, which gets annoying and trivial a lot of the time, because i'll personally have a great combo going and just because i forgot to hit the land button, it ruins it all in one unforgiving 'Sloppy' land, the level design and the art style are pretty great for a 2D Side scroller, but it does not make up for the extremely hard learning curve that you endure if you're used to controlling a virtual skate-board differently. i like this game, but i also dislike the way that you are meant to carry out the task of actually skating. which is why i give it a 5/10 it's fun to play, but good luck getting any high scores with out logging endless ours of failing miserably. The sound track is very good though i will give it that.. It's OK... but people are going seriously overboard about it. It's certainly worth downloading for free, and the challenge of mastering the mechanics of the game and getting the split second timing down is enjoyable. But is this game a 10? Absolutely not! It's not a masterpiece of gaming by any measure you care to use. It's not even in the top five skateboarding games I've ever played. This is a typical instance of people overrating something because they're desperate to justify owning it, rather than looking at it on it's own merits. It's an indie game, so graphics are unimportant to me, but to mention them quickly - they're functional. They get the job done. Controls are OK, sometimes feeling unresponsive at random points, which is strange as it isn't due to lag or anything I can see; the game just seems to ignore commands every so often. The soundtrack is bang average - actually, there you go, that's the review - bang average. There are better indie games on the PS4 already - this title is effectively a solid flash game that ported to a console. Enjoy it for 15 minutes or so for free, after that you'll know if you want another hour or so out of it or you want to uninstall.. It always amazes me that people rate games based off how it didn't meet their misguided expectations. OlliOlli is truly a delight to play. It's an entry in the endless runner genre with a skateboarding twist. The controls are actually quite complex and the constant negative comparisons to Tony Hawk games are absolutely silly. I didn't even think of Tony Hawk when I started playing this game, I immediately got a Bit Runner vibe. This game absolutely proves you can pull off a fun skateboarding game in 2D. The only reason I docked it a point is the music isn't very well selected overall. There is one track in particular that actually made me think my headphones were partially disconnected. It was absolutely dreadful. Other than that, awesome game.. I'm tired seriously stupid indie game. Similarly, seriously, how the game is going to give that **** to me? 15 minutes? Select the AAA games is more than 3 hours! Game is bad! Waste of time 0 out 10. The fact this got more than a 6 user or critic score is really making me lose respect for 'ratings' of PS4 games. It's like people give it an 8+ to validate the money on their PS+ subscription. How can a 2D skateboarding game be any more fun than those internet java flash games you used to play when you were like 10 before you had a console? I can't tell you why it's bad, just look at it and think. Or just play Tony Hawks.. Fantastic and addicting game. It takes a while to get used to the controls but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast. One of the best games to come out so far this year. If you have PS Plus (which you should) this game is free for March 2015!. It's a side-scrolling skating game. Pretty challenging and fun for a bit, but gets old fast. Mainly made me want to play an old Tony Hawk pro skater game.. I always had been curious about this game. I had seen my favourite Youtubers play the original OlliOlli, and I was quite interested by the gameplay mechanics. Fortunately, OlliOlli 2 is a thrilling game with a fantastic control scheme. Yes, the game is quite challenging however it can be genuinely satisfying and rewarding at times. I feel that these three words can describe OlliOlli 2. Beautiful, fun and challenging. The graphics and music of OlliOlli 2 are superb. The sound effects were also impressive. There is quite a bit to do in OlliOlli 2, however I think they should have added a level creator mode and an endurance mode. Apart from that, Olli Olli 2 is a fantastic game. I would definitely recommend you to get this game providing how cheap it is.. Terrible/unresponsive controls. Boring gameplay. I dont see why they even made a sequel the original was bad as well. Definitely shovelware for Sony's ""free"" game program. Im going to rewrite my review caz of my big ego.(i dont want people to think i **** at gaming) im the guy that maxd rayman legends the 3rd day had, and gets the occasional diamond cup in challenges. Platinumed demon souls and dead space 2. Master ninjad gaiden. Beaten 1000s of games. Ok thars the picture. Yes i can do a perfect run in this. So the controls are precise. They are however way too much work for nothing. Im with leventguller reaction time ****. maybe if it were on something else. It just isnt built for ps4 controller. it reminds me more of a platform game than skating game anyhow just throwing that in there. Oh yea i haven't played tony hawk in years but if remember right u Couldn't get away with mashing buttons. Idk just feel like i should of passed on this not really ripped off, just meh.. Good game and great music. This is extremely tough, though so be warned... The graphics are pretty nice and it is fluid. I doubt I'll be able to complete the levels on super hard, but that won't stop me trying.. This is one of the most addictive games I've played since I first played Trials HD and one of the better PS+ titles. I can't believe people on here saying the controls are unresponsive, and rating the game at 1 and 0! The controls are tight and work exactly as intended. Anyone who thinks otherwise and immediately writes the game off while coming on here to post a scathing negative review is a fool! If you take a few hours and practice the control scheme and get the hang of it, it is tons of fun. I highly recommend it! Don't listen to the numb skull people who played the game for 15 minutes and think they have enough knowledge about it to come on here and give it a 1.. A pleasant surprise for me, given that I have not heard of this one before I seen it available as a free game for PlayStation Plus members. A very good looking game, gameplay itself is amazing and very smooth. However, like most skating games, controls are virtually impossible to truly ""master"". Errors will occur often. Really my only complaint about this one, I am enjoying this one right now as a time killer and something to throw on and have some fun.. I'm kind of mind blow by some of the bad reviews that this game is getting. I'll just say right away if you're into button mashing games like tony hawk then this will not be for you. I would put OlliOlli2 closer to skate in comparison of controls. You use the Left analog to execute many of your moves. Triggers will control spins and special grinds much like skate. They blend some of the trick options from skate and have goals similar to tony hawk where you have to collect the items, land certain tricks, go for points ect. For 20$ I ensure you'll get your moneys worth in play time. For ps plus subscribers this is def. a must have for your ps4 or vita. I'm getting tired of writing reviews for poor games. Looking over my past history of reviews anyone would think I hated games. But that is not the case. I grew up through the 80's and 90's, starting out playing BBC micro games, Commodore, Spectrum and progressing to Amiga. Then NES, Master System, SNES, Mega Drive right through all the modern consoles up to PS4. I love games, but lately the games ps+ have been releasing have been utterly dreadful. OllieOllie 2 is just dull. I played for around 20 minutes before I was so bored I switched off and uninstalled the game. The graphics are bland, the music is plain and the controls are awful. The game is a side scrolling Tony Hawks (but no where near as good as Tony Hawks, take away all the fun from Tony Hawks then you have Ollie Ollie). -Side Note: Please ignore the last remark. This crap is nothing like Tony Hawks and I apologise for comparing this wet turn to a masterpiece. - So, you go along a basic tracks performing the same tricks and grinds until you reach the end of the course and really if there is anything to offer after that I don't care. The presentation is so bad I have no desire to turn on the game again. This is a bad sign. PS+ keep getting it wrong, this whole new generation have got it wrong. Many of the games are re-mastered ps3 games and the exclusives have been terrible. The ps4 has become an indie machine and many of the games that are given away each month are crappy little games like this. Sony really need to sort it out next month because I'm seriously thinking about selling the PS4 and buying a decent PC. This game is that bad that I am considering ending my gaming with PlayStation. It's that serious. Avoid this game at all costs.. I didn't know what to expect going in besides the fact I would be skateboarding. To my surprise, this is one of the best games I've played on a next gen console and by far (besides maybe transistor) the best free ps plus game. I found my self ADDICTED. Starting out thinking it was a challenging game, I noticed myself landing 70x combos hours later. Even without the ps+ free offer. It's worth every penny. A MUST HAVE.. Enjoyable game but reaction time and controls are awful. A good game for IOS or ANDROID but I think this game is just not suitable for PS4 controls. Apart from it, you can play it for 1-2 hours as a snack nad it is free in PS+. Gameplay is very strong in this one. While the game is immensely challenging, new tricks aren't hard to learn, so you rarely feel cheated. 'Career' mode's pace is awesome. You go from trying to land perfecty to doing entire levels in a single combo to doing so in crazy cinematic style, fitting a 'revert manual' or a 'grind-switch' in every piece of the level for that impossible highscore. Game is also a 2d treat to the eyes.. I had a terrible experience playing this free PS4 game for a few minutes. I uninstalled the game after five minutes of play. The controls were obscure and unresponsive. When you have played some Tony Hawk skating games, it's hard to go back to such experience. I am glad to see here that some people enjoy it. Good for them.. This is an amazing game, excellent levels, good game-play, beautiful graphics, excellent soundtrack, addictive and rej-oinable to try to get every challenges. No words. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]",the controls are EXTREMELY precise which i love . i've put a couple of hundred hours into the game and i can tell you that the controls are phenomenal . making this game free on PS4+ was a mistake .
"1,044.Assault Android Cactus+","Run nicely on nintendo switch and without bug. A not so easy game and hard to master !. I am usually terrible at twin stick shooters but really enjoyed Assault Android Cactus+ on Switch. Each level could be beaten in about 10 or so minutes which made it pick up and play. The difficulty was much more on my level. Game(s) like: Twin-stick shooters Pros: - Good difficulty (on normal) as I could actually beat this game - Like the different characters and weapons - Enjoyed the staged bosses Cons: - It is exactly what it is - a twin stick shooter. For me this means some quick plays and nothing in depth.. This a bit of a mixed bag. This is a amazing game, i've played only on ps4. Sadly the devs did NOT bring ANY of the changes or updates to older consoles (ps4/xbox) this includes all the Campaign+ content, Character balance changes, Score changes, enemy updates, Hard mode bosses, Infinity drive tweaks, basically everything the switch version is doesn't exist for previous consoles. This game is absolutely amazing but ONLY on Switch or PC. So if your reading this, then good job, you are looking at the Correct version to buy. Just be weary, they might abandon this version just the same as they did with their previous consoles. Still great, just wish they would be honest and give us a reason as to why the fixes aren't coming to previous iterations of the game. Switch version is cool though, new costumes. YAY........ Fast kill-them-all shooter. Can barely understand what's going on the screen but still good to play. For 2 players it becomes madness due to twice amount of players.. Assault Android Cactus+ is a fun twin-stick shooter that manages to hit a difficult sweet spot. Like most games in this genre, it's a hectic experience, with what seem like hundreds of enemies and bullets on the screen at the same time. Even amongst all that mayhem, though, this game somehow manages to be extremely accessible, even for people who're not accustomed to shooters. The mechanics are well designed, and they make the game intense, but almost never punishing, unless you're aiming for those elusive high rankings. This inclusive attitude makes AAC+ perfect for a night of casual co-op. I played through the entire game with a friend in a couple of consecutive nights, and we had a blast. Even though the game is on the short side, it enhances its own longevity by inviting you to play the same levels over and over, chasing a better score. I'm not usually a ""high score"" kind of player, but this game lends itself very well to it. We found ourselves replaying some levels for one hour straight, trying to gain those few extra points that would earn us a better final ranking. AAC+ is a game with a small scope–but it moves confidently within those tight confines. We can't wait to play through it again with a third (and maybe fourth) co-op companion. Just one suggestion for the developers: next time you make a great game (and I trust you will), maybe give it a name that's easier to remember. Even after completing it, we still tend to refer to it as ""Cactus""–and for the entire first night, it was simply ""that twin-stick shooter"".. I love this game. I created this account just to review this game. I played this on PC when it came out and it is a great twin-stick shooter, and now I am redoing it on the Switch! Controls: The controls are smooth, especially if you use both sticks. Do not sit still too long in this game, it will make you pay. Graphics: They hold up well in this port. The bullets start flying and I have no trouble finding my pathway through them, which is definitely needed. Gameplay: This is the shining star. This is my favorite game to introduce my friends to. It's excellent for co-op, and watching the sweat bead off their heads as the levels get more difficult is great. The SHMUP aspect of this game has a mixture of puzzle thrown in, so the levels are never static. Watch the videos of this game to get an idea, but I love this game, and I hope others will too.",assault android cactus+ is a fun twin-stick shooter that manages to hit a difficult sweet spot . each level could be beaten in about 10 or so minutes which made it pick up and play . sadly the devs did NOT bring ANY of the changes or updates to older consoles (ps4/xbox)
"1,045.Forza Motorsport 7","FM7 distinguishes itself as a remarkable track racing game, though its potential is somewhat diluted by the series’ penchant for releasing new titles rather than focusing on enhancing a singular, evolving game. Despite this, it delivers a high-quality racing experience.. Best simcade racing franchise by far! Gran turismo is not even close, this is the best FM game after FM 4 in my opinion, great ;). This review is about 2 years late, considering you cant even buy the game anymore. Anyways, logged A LOT of hours into this, always had a blast. This is not a sim racer, it has to be said, although don't confuse it with games like need for speed etc. I would call it a middle ground between sim racing and arcade. Overall the game had a really polished feel for me. The graphics on xbox one were great, the cars and tracks looked as good as can be expected for a last gen console. Although subjective, the rock based music in the menu's fit perfectly for me. The car roster was also pretty awesome, cant really ask for more.. This game so far is amazing. So their is a learning curve for me. I can't drive it like any other racing game. From holding down the racing trigger all the way down to accelerate to breaking on turns. It is a challenge but that's what makes games fun for me a ""challenge."". Not a bad game. The graphics are great, it’s well optimised and works great with my G29 but apart from that, it can be a bit unstable on PC. The online mode is kinda mid and the AI is very annoying. I mean, they completely ignore you and will either brake check you, cut you over and even ram you if they feel like doing so.. It is a game that is half simulator, half arcade and lacks content, full of errors with the drawing of lines. It's a soulless, $1 dollar game.. A boring and ugly sim that tries its best to compete with better sims like GT7 but fails exceptionally in doing **** graphics are horrible and is a testament to a failing brand and console.. The technical quality of the game is excellent. A very challenging evolution. Ultrarealistic graphics and sounds! Dubbing and subtitles, practically in all languages! You can see all the care taken with the smallest details. It's definitely one of the best car simulators!. missed out onsome classic forza tracks again but it was a fun game and what we asked for. It's a great game, tons of cars to choose from and really nice graphics. Loading times are a bit long but overall it's a great game.. I bought the premium version on disc for $100 and I am totally disappointed. I thought the game was going to be far superior to Forza 7 but it must be said that it is a good game but it is far below Forza 7 and being a Forza fan it is the most incredible. Microsoft and T10 flat out lied to us. They claimed the following items and then did not deliver. Shame! -next gen photorealistic graphics? No -60 fps reliably? No -ray tracing and amazing lighting effects? No because the game doesn’t even run well -next gen AI? Maybe bumper cars. -functional AI powered penalty system? No They KNEW that this game doesn’t run well and they hyped it up to be a smoothly run, polished experience. It is not. It is BARELY playable on my high end PC. To hold a solid30fps I have to run it on LOW graphics settings. This “next gen” racing game is a solid 10 years behind. Assetto Corsa and iRacing and even Forza Horizon 5 are WAYYYYYYYY better.. A true masterpiece what they did with the one x could have rivaled gran Turismo 7 for a next gen experience on old hardware. The game is superb and enjoying it a loT This game should be100 score not sure why is 85 I feel like people not honest rating amazing games Forza Motorsport is amazingly graphics compared to other racing cars , great engagement andgreat representation for racing car. It's a mediocre game in contrast with Gran Turismo saga.. Car models are sub par, they put more time in environments than their cars. One of the best racers on console and PC.. They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. The best Forza Motorsport. Sure, this game has a lot of cars and good presentation, but it's not near as good as other racing games out there. Carrer is broken and makes no sense, AI is weird and sometimes very stupid, there are still bugs present from release of the game, soundtrack is poorly chosen and load times are way to long. For me, this game was not fun at all.. What happened with this racing series? Not realistic, boring, not competitive online, i miss the FM4 times. Played this game straight after 6 and honestly had a blast it’s on game pass which if you own a Xbox and a subscription does not cost you anything extra to try it out. I played it finished a decent amount of the races and had a blast definitely not as repetitive as FM5 and I can’t honest my say much bad things about it am b out a Forza expert by any means only played 5 6 and 7 but this overall experience is fun honestly don’t get all the hate seems like today people just love to **** on anything.. **** this stupid ass game, the rival system is by far the worst ****ing thing ever, if you barely mess up and go off track, it flags your lap, im fine with that, but don’t make me do a whole extra lap to get rid of the damn thing. I was trying to do a challenge and it required me to get a fastest lap in a Chevrolet or Honda indy car on a random race track clearly not made for indy cars, as soon as i was about to go around the last turn, one tire hit the grass and it flagged my time, but then i had to do another lap without making a single mistake which is boring as **** all i’m trying to do is get a fast lap time, beat my rival and finish the challenge, took my 45 minutes and i finally finished it, and then it didn’t give me the reward, and i had to do it again, idk why but it did, and the same ****ing thing happens over and over, mess up, do an extra lap, can’t rewind cuz that’ll flag it too, it’s so ****ing stupid. **** this game, finished the challenge 8 times and i still didn’t get the reward, **** you fm7. It's pretty fun. I enjoyed it. I liked racing. I liked the drivatars. Not much to say, honestly.. Don't read what people rate, it easily deserves 9/10, great gameplay, playable with two people on real split screens (not with big black bars like in gran turismo), huge content (mini 50h of game). Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (7) Average. The game’s feature may work, but are nothing that even causal players haven’t seen before I loved the Forza Horizon games so thought i would give this a try. Bought it day one and fell in love with the graphics and weather but the rest of the game was a disappointment and average. Nothing sticks out of this game beside a few negatives. Why are there cards for me to pick each race? Isn't this a realistic racing game series compared to the Horizon series? Why can't i buy the cars I want? Apparently, I need to raise my collector score first. Just let me race what I want to race. Give me a better career mode instead of a checkmark races.. I have loved forza for years and get excited for every new release. I like how I think, thats it, we reached the peak, we aren't getting any better than this and then say that about the next game too. It stills looks nothing short of magnificent. Completion will keep you busy for many many weeks. It has a lot of content. Each track feels carefully crafted and a joy to race on. Its an easy game to learn to be good at without sacrificing the desire for a challenge from experienced players. Which is a thing too many games don't get right these days. I definitely recommend to anyone who is even a little bit interested in racing games.. bad ai, the brightness of the game is lacking, other than that this game is very good, i enjoy playing this more than gt6...... The handling is amazing I love the car roster. The upgrades for cars are good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The physics, graphics and simulation of the game are excellent with only minor minor issues. Best grafics so far in a racing game , behind Forza Horizon 5 ! Realistic grafics and steering with Cars , Simulation Mode Manually , much tracks and photo realistic tracks. Awesome game, It needs a slightly better progression system, but overall it's truly a gem. I had to return to these masterpiece after the gt7 microtransactions scam. It's incredible how it's still holding up to these days.. The best track based car racing game on any console. Best AI, Best racing. There are racing games with better physics, though the physics are pretty good. There are racing games that are more realistic, but the AI, is FAR superior to games like Gran Turismo 7 that has only just come out. It also has a superior campaign. superior.. 4k bad car design, same nothing new and bad handling, it was good but now is just bad. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 6 Story: 5 Total: 7.50. Loved this much better than the other motorsport games and easier to control. Graphics stunning. Played this on Xbox one X after downloading it on gamepass.. Ok, so I gave this a high mark. I could have gone anywhere between 7 and 9 in truth. If I am being hyper critical, the menu system and progression system is....kinda dull. The presentation is also dull. I'm not talking about graphics (which are very good) but I refer to the way the game transports arou d from menu to gameplay with annoying I'll timed cut scenes and a mod system that is just a bit 'meh'. **** all that sounds rough. BuT .. It's a racing game. It knows what it is. It does what it needs to do very very we. As the owner of a modest sim setup with racing wheel and gearstick and pedals, this game shines on the track. The cars feel distinct and have personality. The tracks drive superbly well. Forza Horizon gets many plaudits for all the things that motorspott fails on, but motorsport outshines Horizon wheb driving with your race face on. It gives me similar vibes to dark souls in that it rewards patience and time. If you turn off the assists and force yourself to learn the cars and the tracks this game just gets better and better. So I'm giving it a 9. Because 2 yeara later you, forza motorsport is the forza game that I still want to ****. Non interruptable long intro. PS2 resolution on Xbox Series S, even if console is set on 4K UHD. No italian Voiceovers. Rewind is fixed, not controllable like in MotoGP 19. Bought a car but cant select it in free race mode.. This is a fantastic game! Ignore the ridiculously low ratings and reviews. Sony ponies Actually come to places like this to lower the user review scores. They are actually that pathetic! It’s very sad that their lives consist of little else. This needs to be said! Notice the difference between the critics scores and the user scores. Case closed.. EN: Just as Horizon is the champion of arcade racing games, so is Motorsport the king of good racing simulations. Although I personally don't like simulations, I have to praise the exceptional physics in the game and the phenomenally done car models. Unfortunately, there are not many new racing stages, most of them are identical as in the previous part. SRB: Kao što je Horizon šampion arkadnih trkačkih igara, tako je Motorsport kralj dobre racing simulacije. Iako lično ne volim simulacije, mora se pohvaliti izuzetna fizika u igri i fenomenalno odrađeni modeli automobila. Nažalost nema mnogo novih staza, većinom su identične kao i u prethodnom delu.. This is one of those games that's fun for a bit but then gets stale. Still this is fun to play every once in a while.. Terrible experience for new players! Too difficult, car seems to drive off while cornering even after tuning the car for cornering, even in easiest difficulty the game requires you to time the breaking perfectly. If another car hits you then boom you are drifting! I am playing with abs,traction control,roll control on, driving assist on normal. I don't recommend any new players to play this game. Terrible, Terrible AI !. A nice upgrade from the 6th installment. Graphics on Xbox One is incredibly smooth and crisp.. Best Simulation type game i've played, giving the option to take it light hearted or hardcore. And the grafics... Oh the grafics!. One of those racing games that come around once in a blue moon especially on a xbox one x with 4k cables and a 4k tv. Do you like racing simulators? Do like being let into the game and not guided by the hand like babies first game? Do you enjoy the nice silence aside from the occasional bgm? Do love an organised approch to finding cars to have a good time driving? If you answered yes to any of these statement JUST STAY AWAY! First thing i would like to say to the developers is, shut up! All the talking! Who thought a weird tier map of cars was good for anything other than an arcade game. The controls are sluggish at best. You get talked to what seems like the whole time. This is an arcade game. I remember a time when forza gave Gran Turismo a run for its money. What happened?. It is...really anothee buy car game. Plus how bad and irrealist can it be!?? Well it is!! Pos Acura nsx peform like a boss when its a slow pos and gets beat by every other car in real life for 1/3 the price!? **** what is up with AI having nitro boost when first!?? It is a shame...dont spend a penny on. Beautiful game on every platform o 60fps. One of the best, if not the best car racing game this generation.. Looks INCREDIBLE, with awesome art direction and formidable technical prowes Studios have done an incredible job.. The Forza series has had a place in my heart. Beautiful game ignore the bad reviews it Sony fanboys reciew bombing I highly recommend this masterpiece 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game ruined by major bugs the developers won't fix. ""Please wait while we make the fixes""... Almost one year later. Still broken.. A driving Sim with Lootboxes to change the SIM into a Arcade game? Porsche is an obvious welcome, but considering Turn 10 is being run into the ground with biannual releases they can't truly innovate. Gran Turismo has been out since 1997, and they have released 6 numbered titles. Just food for thought. Not fan of this forza Online it's empty, no events Damages it's bad No local multiplayer. The best forza so far, really fun to play, AI players act weird sometimes and maybe they need to add more tracks to their games. The best racing game of this generation and one of the best racing games of all time! Is here! Great simulation, great experience! Recommended 100%. The game have been designed for microtransactions and since the lootboox fiasco they could not make money with this or gears, so now they dont even care for the dev of the game. This game is trash compared to forza 6 here is why. First of all they added rally cars but no dirt tracks so that doesn't make sense also Top Gear test track some how makes it into this game by it being Turn 10's test track. I wish it would be replaced by a dirt track and they have collection tier but it limits what cars you can get so if you want a Le Mans prototype and you have collection tier 3 you can not buy it. The ai have traction control so it's harder to turn them than if they didn't . The cars are basicly the same other than the rally cars but I thought there were more race cars, personaly I'm not buying the next one just go buy Gran Turismo Sport and get a PlayStation 4. I've been playing Forza since the beginning in 2005. I deliberately waited until now to render my verdict on Forza 7, thanks to a whole lot of misinformation and irrational hate floating around the web. I wanted to get the full experience for myself. After 2.5 years, what do I think? It's an absolute masterpiece, that's what. I've had more fun playing 7 than any other release in the main series, and that's really saying something, because I've enjoyed the heck out of all of them (even 5, which felt like it was 2/3rds ****). There's a completely ridiculous amount of content in the game, and endlessly customizable ways to enjoy that content. Whether you're a casual driver or hardcore competitor, you'll be able to dig deep into Forza 7. What's not to love?. Is actually the best racing game, not give a 10 because have MICRO-TRANSACTIONS, but the rest of the game is amazing.. [ ] Perfect [ ] Awesome [x] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. The good: Console exclusive. Glorious graphics in 4K at 60 solid FPS (the techniques invented by Turn 10 to maintain 4K and 60FPS are those that are implemented in Horizon). More than 700 fully modeled cars both indoors and outdoors, fully customizable and tuneable (here there are no nonsense of premium cars and pro cars and Gold cars). New circuits like Dubai. Circuits such as Maple Valley, Suzuka and Mugelo Internationale return. Configurable dynamic weather and time passed (this can be seen in long endurance races you start in the late evening and end at night. You start with cloudy skies and end up with torrential rains and lightning). Many details that occur during the race (falling leaves, passing bird stops, swirls of dust and wind). Forzavista in 4K. Many events to dispute both championships, exhibits and stories of Motorsport. Includes Race Regulation for multiplayer races, leagues, standings and tournaments. Customization of costumes for the pilot. Includes Master and Master Elite events that are customizable with favorite cars. Instead of the prize roulette they allow you to choose from one of three prizes when you level up (a suit, a car or credits). The community managed to remove the Loot Boxes from the game. The bad: If you don't like Motor Sports you won't like it. They removed the integration of Rivals with the main races. Charge times are noted on Xbox One Fat and Xbox One S. The economy of the game was broken after removing the Loot Box. The Meh!: Many haters put Forza Motorsport and its “flavor” Horizon in the same bag, even though they are very different. Personally I did not like the Forza Drivers Club accommodation since there are Elite achievements that at the beginning do not know how to get out, you have to complete the Forza Deiver Cup to access the Elite events (you think you already finished but there are actually more events to be played) . You only have two achievements to get online. 500 G of achievements are relatively easy. Worst online experience ever, don't get fooled by the amount of cars there are plenty of stupid useless cars, outdated physics, horrible ai, boring after a while without an objective, is not a racing game, is a survival racing game, but the graphics are nice I guess.. Now it's probably the best all round sim market you can buy, with tons of cars, tracks and game modes to play. There's a colossal problem though. This problem also plagued Forza 5 and 6. This game sadly still doesn't even compete with Forza Motorsport 4. This is a problem, because Forza 7 is the last game from the Motorsport franchise of this generation, and we have less actually interesting tracks, much worse car diversity and still doesn't have famous game modes like Cat and Mouse, and at one point Car Football. And i'm sorry, but Forza 4 was the last Motorsport game on the Xbox 360 and it still outshines it. Maybe if that game didn't exist then it would be fine, but that's just not acceptable. A game should utilize the power of Xbox One X, and Forza 7 doesn't particularly. Overall, this game is a decent step up over Forza 6, but to hardcore Forza fans, we are still disappointed. Even Forza Horizon 4 doesn't compete with Forza Horizon 1 by any means. Shame really.. Hands dawn the best racing simulator this gen. Graphics is incredible, and the cars are super fun to drive, and there is a lot of them.. The first Forza Motorsport game on the Xbox was one that really helped cement my love and respect for the racing-sim genre. All these years later, the franchise is still going strong. The car list is massive, thankfully they were able to secure the Porsche license on time for this game. The cars and tracks are beautifully rendered and the game still runs flawlessly. The Bernese Alps tracks were the highlight for me, the views are breathtaking and it's one of the faster tracks in the game. Every Forza Motorsport game has seen me sink countless hours into everyone of them and Forza Motorsport 7 is no exception. It's a great game to fire up and drive some fast, powerful cars for an hour or two at Laguna Seca, Yas Marina or The Nürburgring. Forza Motorsport is one of the few remaining IPs that I can rely on to produce an excellent video game experience.. For me, this is probably the best racing game you could play to date. Tons of cars to enjoy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its an awesome game, there so much cars to chose From and customize!, its fun and adictive, the problem comes when you realize the physics became somehow more árcade than forza 6, the track list its to short and not the Best, and the online races are a mess, i mean its mean to be a sim/simcade game but it feels more like an árcade, especially using a wheel it Just feels weird, good game, but it feels more of the same, Forza need a New face, competitors make a really big jump, Forza need to do it. AI Cheats. This isn't salt, it's demonstrably provable via telemetry. Cheating AI in a racing game is the absolute worst behavior and warrants nothing more than a 0. loading time, awful. developing and buying new cars, so hard. graphics, perfect. car collection, amazing. gameplay and drivatar development, crazy. it cannot be replaced by any other game in 5 years Turn10 should have good support on it.. Don't be fooled by paid reviews or listen to anybody giving this gaming anything over a 5. It's a full priced triple A game where they push pre-ordering, vip passes, expansion passes, and now decided to add a crappy loot box system and extreme microtransactions ON TOP (not in place of where it would be in a FREEIUM game). This game is trash for this reason alone, this is another game to steer clear of and hurt the pockets of these greedy corporate d bags that have ruined a once fun hobby of mine. Time for this greedy ship to sink! Rise up gamer nation!. The racing, the graphics, and cars are good. But one of the surprisingly most disappointing things about this game is the multiplayer. You enter matchmaking. Players are already racing. You have to wait. Then intermission starts. The match begins. But it turns out you are still in the lobby while everyone else is assigned to the race. Even if you do make it, there is a lot of lag. Cars can sometimes glitch out. Textures don't load. You're racing in 1st place when suddenly the game temporarily freezes, and after that 5 players have already passed you. And I thought Forza Motorsport 4's multiplayer in 2018 was bad.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 8 Sound/Music: 8 Graphics/Art: 9 Design/Atmosphere: 5 OVERALL: 7.5/10 The loot boxes were an uninspired addition to Forza 7. Gone are the difficulty based rewards that made Forza such an endearing and incredible sim racing series, and introduced are pointless loot boxes that diminish the sense of reward. Thank goodness it's still a blast to play! I would highly recommend jumping into the amazing Forza 6 if you are looking to play a great sim racer on Xbox One.. Forza Motorsport 7 is the best racing videogame. Amazing graphics, physics and car list. Also 60 fps 4K resolution.. Forza 6 is a much better game. This game has been designed around loot boxes and it shows. Menu system has taken a step backward, as have all the fun driving options. Really long load times even on the xbox one x. Graphics look amazing but cannot redeem the fact that forza 6 is a much better driving experience. Should have just enhanced the graphics on forza 6 for the new gen machine and left it there. I feel a bit cheated to be honest. I will always go back to forza 6 but really cannot see much play time in forza 7. Another game that loot boxes have ruined in my opinion. I dont mind loot boxes so much if done correctly but this whole game and menu system has been designed around it. If they must add them at least make it a small option of the game and for cosmetic items only, or not even a loot box, just a store to purchase cosmetics if you really want them. Cannot recommend this game at all.. lets start off with good. the graphics are pretty good but seem a bit cartoony. the gameplay is horrible and so are the microtransactions. I ve played every Forza Game and this will be the last. Its out over 9 months now and still got annoying bugs. Homologation, Design Bugs; long loading times on the car garage and more. For example: The splitscreen mode wasnt running the first 3 months. Sure the graphics are great and you got many many cars, but since FM6 are almost no changes (except dynamic weather and graphics) Sadly I paid over 100€ for that. Please don't make the same mistake and buy something better with your money.. i found it absolutely infuriating that it took over 3 hours from purchasing it to being able to play it! surely there is a better way than this microsoft!. I've been playing FM7 since early release and really don't get the negative reviews it has received. Yes, it's an evolution of FM6, but most Forza's are an evolution of the previous game. How people can claim they've played Forza from the first game yet not realize this is how the game is developed baffles me. The loot box hysteria is people jumping on the bandwagon. Loot boxes were never pushed and never game changing. You can't pay to win, you never could. The VIP fiasco was poor from Microsoft, but when they realized how much they'd upset people they very quickly changed it and apologized. Since this time MS has been developing the game and have now decided to keep working on FM7 rather than FM8, because this is what the fans want. They're one of the few developers who seem to understand the value of their fanbase. I personally had an issue with some of the cars being locked away behind events that you could only complete in certain circumstances. This isn't an RPG, stuff like that doesn't fly in this genre. I know it's hard for some developers to understand but some people actually have a job and commitments and end up losing out because of these terrible ideas. Thankfully MS has seen sense and unlocked all cars apart from a hand full of unicorn cars. The game itself is smooth, pretty an relatively realistic. My favorite feature is the tuning/upgrade options. No other game offers anything like as good as this for modification IMO. The engine swaps are still a generic bland mess though, unless you have no imagination and think LS swaps are still cool. It would be nice to get some manufacturer specific swaps back in. In summary I'd argue that this is the best casual Simcade game out there. When you just want to go out and blast a few laps or play with your friends it's ideal. It's realistic enough to be fun without being massively serious. It shouldn't be compared to the likes of Project Cars or Assetto Corsa because it's a different type of game. I rate it 8 out of 10, losing 1 point for MS misjudging a few choices (VIP benefits, available cars) and 1 point because it's still not as good as FM4.. Pretty much the least content of any Forza game I have ever played. Of the however many cars are advertised in this game, half of them are re-skinned Nascars or Formula E cars. One stock car with different skins would of been sufficient. Tried and true game modes have either been changed for the worse, or are completely missing. Homologation takes the proven classes(E through X) and further divides them into stupid arbitrary categories. Some cars will be homologated to 635, others to 650, and others to 680 etc, instead of just limiting them all to A class. This ruins everything from the career races to the online leaderboards. Overall I cannot recommend this game over Forza 6, or any other Forza for that matter.. A game developed and programmed by those who do not know anything about motor racing.. Forza 7 starts off very well, the graphics are fantastic, audio is great and initial game play is enjoyable. The hype about being the greatest driver really gets you motivated to achieve the top step, but after two hours of game play it all feels very bland. I would be more inclined to give a higher rating if career mode let us spend more time in the different classes before moving us into a completely new class of vehicle. You almost need to focus on 6 main classes and separate them into a championship letting us develop a feel for the class and spend more time on tuning for optimum performance. The cars just get better looking, the handling more precise, and the overall experience more comprehensive and immersive.. Been playing it for about 10 hours. Few glitches, but nothing major in xbox one X. As a Forza fan I'm happy. Some questionable design choices like loot boxes are really overshadowed as has delivered on so many other. the best simiulation game on the 8th generation, 5 was good 6 better and 7 xbox one. Good graphics, gameplay the envoirment is very good the tracks are almost the same that in real world. 4k and all at a locked 60FPS, if it looks this good on Xbox One I can't imagine how good it will look on the Xbox One X. The worst thing about Forza is that it may have stolen me away from the 'Forza Motorsport' series for good.. For all the fury I read in the user reviews I have absolutely loved my time with Forza 7 so far. I have to say that I find all of this impotent nerd rage about loot boxes sort of puzzling. Yes there are loot boxes however they aren't vital to game progression, they're relatively cheap and purchased with in game money and whats more Forza goes out of it's way more than any racing game I've played to throw credits at you at every turn. I'll frequently take a car for a blast through Nurburgring Full Circuit on my own, no other cars and get maybe 30,000 just for having 10 minutes of fun. The mods are actually worth buying too, I felt, they give you a variety of different challenges and make each trip out onto the track a little different and engaging. The user score for this game is seriously skewed by people crying over something that is really not that big of a deal whatsoever. Car Collection Tiers are also a big point of contention but again I enjoyed that too, it encouraged me to buy and drive cars I probably would have skipped over entirely before whilst saving up for a Ferrari or something. More to the point people make it sound like cars are entirely unobtainable without hitting that collectors tier but every car in the game is available from the outset for free, you just can't earn credits driving them. I don't see the problem with that set up nor do I see the p","despite its potential, FM7 delivers a high-quality racing experience . it is a boring and ugly sim that tries its best to compete with better sims like GT7 but fails exceptionally in doing **** graphics are horrible and is a testament to a failing brand and console ."
"1,046.Sumire","If I ever have a bad period in my life and feel lost, I need to remember to replay this game to remind me what it means to be human. Sumire starts off like a simple adventure game for little girls, but then it becomes more and more serious and emotional, and in the end, you feel so hopeful.. Though I love running and gunning and high-intensity games there’s no denying that games with a compelling and heart-felt story are capable of leaving a serious mark as well. Sumire, with you playing as a young girl who has recently lost her grandmother and is hoping to connect with her spirit, is one such compelling title. In her journey of only one day she’ll interact with a variety of characters and be given choices, most of which will carry a serious consequence in how things play out by day’s end so you’ll need to be mindful in how you choose. With terrific and colorful art, a great mix of the grounded real and the fantastic, and a meaningful story to tell, Sumire is a memorable experience story lovers should be sure to enjoy on Switch. ****/2021/06/mini-reviews-june-4th-edition-nintendo.html. I am just trying to guess why I can not score any game in this web, so I will see if after writing this my score will be saved.. Such a good game, love it and never bored yet! The soundtrack is beautiful Replayable Beautiful 10/10. Such a beautiful game. Art, story, soundtrack, minigames are simply wonderful. Loved every second of it. Quite short with 3 hours, but there is some replayability, if you wanna play and try a bad karma walkthrough.. Sumire Pure Beauty Sumire is a 3 hour long narrative adventure game where you play as sumire, you have a dream of your dead grandmother wanting to tell you something, a seed crashes through your window, it turns into a magical flower and the flower promises if youll show them a day in the human world, they will help you see your grandmother again.. so you make a list.. a list of your perfect day on your journey to finally see her again.. and this game is beautiful from strt to finish, from the artwork to the music, to the story telling.. I loved every moment of this game.. along your journey youll talk to animals and statues, all with their own wants and needs to make them happy, and you have the option to help them.. in eturn youll get coins and good or bad karma based on your action.. the coins don’t do much but help you just buy random thing an complete challenges within the game.. but it bjut feels nice to help these souls within the games world.. make new friends, let go of old.. find love, its such a wonderful game.. my only gripe with this game is that I did run into a game breaking bug by fast traveling to the final area.. this is a known issue being worked on now.. but it did force me to start all the way from the beginning.. but it was worth it.. it was worth rushing back through to see this story out to its end.. Sumire is a onderful game, it will touch your heart in all kinds of ways and is a must play.

"1,047.ENDER LILIES: Quietus of the Knights","This metroidvania is solid, but it could use a little more difficulty in the boss fights. But, it’s packed full of content.. Solid game in everything, art is beautiful, combat is fine, variability in gameplay really really nice, music is an absolute 11/10, story and lore are also fitting and entertaining, it may not ve revolutionary, but you certainly won't just forget it Simply a great game in which you feel the care put into it. This is a duplicate, I only played the PS4 version. I don't know how to delete reviews. I'm sure the PC version is just as good.. In this game: * Your character gets damaged, stunned, and pushed back whenever it touches an enemy, it does not matter if the enemy is *idle* or attacking. * The only way your character attacks is by summoning spirits. All enemies, and your spirits, use the *exact* same 3 tones of sepia color. That's ""ok"", until this happens: * The game locks you up in a room with 10 evenly spaced enemies. Any attempt to dash will result in you touching some *idle* enemy, getting damaged, stunned, and pushed back. So you try not to get cornered, repeat, and get damaged, etc. Parrying just delays the punishment. You clear the room, heal, move around, and get locked up in *another* room. * You get to a boss, attack by using all the spirits you can. Your spirits are drawn on top of the boss, share the exact same color, and obscure it. You can't tell WTF the boss is doing next. You dash left and get hit by an attack. You dash right and the boss dashes with you, he's idle, but you still get damaged, stunned, and pushed back. You try to parry, but can't get the timing because you can't see the boss. You can say it's a skill issue on my part, as tryhards no-hit this game. But my point is: these mechanics are trash. I did not want to get used to them or find counters to them. Another issue is the map. It intentionally shows up as only boxes with lines between them, not the actual shape of what's inside. As in any metroidvania, I found new movement abilities, and went backtracking to use them, but I *cannot* see old places in the map, just stupid boxes, so I travel there, realize the trip was a waste of time, and travel back. This ""boxes"" map idea is also trash. There are a bunch of good things I could say about this game, I get what they were going for, but with these cons, I gave up on it and uninstalled after ~5 hours.. Combat is extremely stiff and half baked. Feels like 90s Super Nintendo gameplay with an anime skin. The enemies and environments are drab and depressing. There's really not much of anything worthy of praise here.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If it weren't for the nice veneer of the art style, I would have dropped it within the first 10 minutes of playing. I gave it a chance, beat the first three or so bosses. But the gameplay never felt satisfying with how your character and abilities progress. The movement stopping whenever you swing your weapon, even in mid-air, is really jarring. I don't understand how this game is getting a sequel.. The game seems to be really overrated. Everything in this game is mediocre. Combat is ok, but nothing special. Cutscenes are just one image with some text, and there is no much story in game. Design of enemies and locations is very unoriginal and they look kinda the same. The soulslike combat is great but theres something very off about the metroidvania side of things. I cant quite put my finger on it but its something to do with the map and the fact that they commit a metroidvania sin where its technically open world but they funnel you into an exact location at every single stage of the game to continue. I think its just easier to understand once you've play the game yourself but the pixel hunting and clean up is noticeably more annoying in this game than any other metroidvania I have played. Even the progression of the main game itself suffers greatly with how they have handled the map progression. If you enjoy metroidvanias then you should definitely play this one. Personally not a fan of the anime-style art direction here, but it's very subtle. Pros: - Gameplay - Music - Story and lore - Nice variety of skills and weapons. Cons: - Quite short (took me 9hrs for a completionist). Amazing game. Pros.: - Genre. - Story. - Gameplay. - Many collectibles. - Variability of strats to beat the game. - Not demanding to grind, farm or torture with puzzles. Cons.: - We need a sequel. It's not a cons of course. The game itself is enough.. Is Perfect. Perfect!!. I don't think there is another game that combines Metroidvania and 2D souls-like in such a beautiful and different style. The storytelling is artistic, the art style is excellent, and the soundtrack is so, so beautiful. The action system has been average-above/average so far, the variety of bosses and the feeling that it will not repeat itself is very good. It goes on sale for a very good price, be sure to try it.. A perfectly serviceable Metroidvania experience. Outside of the somewhat interesting spirit system, the game does little to stand out of from the sea of games like it.. WHITE NIGHTS BEFORE WE BEGIN: Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is a video game produced by Binary Haze Interactive and published on January 21, 2021. The game was completed 100% on Xbox Series X. SOME RAIN MUST FALL: Ender Lilies begins with a small visual introduction to the game world, introducing the player to the great evil afflicting the planet. Endless corrupted rain has turned all living creatures into impure and immortal beings. The only salvation from this fate lies in the young white maidens, girls who can deprive the creatures of their corruption. The player wakes up inside a broken capsule, assuming the role of one of these maidens, Lily, the last descendant of the white priestess. From there on, the goal is to purify the still sentient creatures in order to restore what this realm once was, bringing back serenity and stopping the endless rain. WHITE ECLIPSES BLACK: This title faithfully brings all the mechanics that characterize a pure Metroidvania: different abilities unlockable throughout the game that open up previously inaccessible paths, a currency to upgrade abilities, various secret and non-secret bosses to face, and multiple paths that can be taken simultaneously. Additionally, Ender Lilies takes a lot of inspiration from Hollow Knight, with explicit references like benches and relics, similar to the aforementioned game's charms. The game's unique selling point and distinguishing feature from the rest is the type of attack available to the player. Lily will use the souls of purified fighters to defeat enemies, and it's possible to use up to three simultaneously, and six thanks to the convenient set swapping. PALE COLORS: The game's graphics are well-crafted, with different parallax layers that change for each game area. The use of muted colors to enhance the mood and devastation of this land is fully exploited. Furthermore, the visual effects add an extra boost to the gameplay. One drawback of the game is the limited variety of enemies and the similarly lacking diversity of the bosses, which are not very powerful or distinct. WINTER: The audio component is what stands out prominently above everything else. Most of the game's soundtracks are original and elegant. The latter adjective is the one that resonates throughout the game, contrasting with the chaos generated by the rain. The sound effects complement the visuals and enhance the game's combat, making it very fluid and entertaining. BUT WHY 8? PROS: The game, despite being a classic Metroidvania, adds a touch of novelty to the combat, supported by excellent audiovisual effects that keep the experience flowing towards the end without becoming boring or repetitive. Moreover, the challenge offered by the central bosses is balanced and entertaining, unlike the mini-bosses, which can be easily defeated with powerful abilities. The originality of the story context is well-structured and leaves room for curiosity. The exploration is also very interesting, and each map has multiple secrets, some of which are difficult to find. Additionally, it is highly appreciated that you can replay boss fights and engage in a boss rush, as well as the ability to modify all game parameters such as enemy and protagonist health and attack to create a greater personal challenge. CONS: The cons of this game are varied but highly subjective. Starting with the overly obvious inspiration from Hollow Knight and other Metroidvania games, such as Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, from which it borrows the combat style. RATINGS Gameplay: 8 Music: 8.5 Story: 7 _. THE SONGS , SCENERY EVERYTHING IS SO GOD DAMN BEAUTIFUL ,the jogability is good , the lore even though simple is so kindly and immersive. 30 hours on my playtime was worth it this the massive masterpiece you must try it yourself once. I really enjoyed this game! I bought it mostly for the atmosphere, music and story, not expecting the gameplay to be amazing. But I was very pleasantly surprised by it. There are so many ways to play and customize the character. Many times I would be stuck on a boss, then strategize how to change my build to work against it and then beat it very fast. The fighting itself was also very interesting, with a lot of different moves and enemies/environments that make you want to use all of them. The lore was also quite good and I absolutely loved the music. I feel like the sound effects were good, but were missing sometimes, especially in more cinematic sections. Overall I really recommend this game, it has all the elements Metroidvenia fans might be looking for, while also being creative and novel.. Really good game, the visuals are gorgeus and the combat is really challenging, as a metroidvania is not as good as others but i really recomend to everyone to give a chance to this game. Such an enjoyable Metroidvania with splendid graphics, tons of secrets, and fun gameplay. Definitely worth a buy in my book especially for those that own a powerful portable machines like Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and GPD Win 3.. Ender Lilies is absolutely NOT a 10/10 game. There are a few things the game does incredibly well: graphics, music, and the dodge mechanic. The combat is also alright, but it's also its greatest downfall. I had such high hopes for this game but in the end, much like what you'll be doing the game's protagonist - a weak af little girl in a white dress - for 60% of the game, it just fell flat. I got to the final boss and quit, because I absolutely lost interest. The game is one of the most grindy Metroidvanias ever made. But even worse, after you kill thousands of enemies and level up into the 90s, you STILL feel weak. The game gives you absolutely ZERO sense of accomplishment or empowerment. Yes, that's right folks, after 20-25 hours of playing this horrible lesson in frustration, you are still, ultimately, a little 14 year old girl in a white dress. I don't think anyone should play this game if they're looking for a good time. If you're looking for punishment, grinding, extremely confusing and boring level design with dark daaaaarrrrrkkkkk areas, a godawful map with no labels or text anywhere on it (they might as well not have given you a map at all), tons of enemies that can destroy you in 1 hit all the way til the end, extremely frustrating bosses that will take you hours of retries, and lore and a story that are just as boring, uninteresting and wretched as everything else in the world, look no further. For everyone else, stay far, far away. This is not the kind of game I will be spending my time on ever again. A Hollow Knight predecessor this game is DEFINITELY not. I honestly wish I hadn't even played it.. Ender Lilies really reminds me of Hollow Knight with its graphics and dark fantasy art style but I have to admit, I enjoyed it more. First i will start with soundtrack, which is beautiful and unforgettable (same in Hollow Knight), story is also beautiful. I also love design of each area and design of bosses, every one of them is unique and they yield very cool, challenging but fair fight. Now things that are better than in HK: First, definitely combat. Combat here is way better because you can obtain a lot of great and unique skills or let’s say purified spirits who fight for you and most of them are actually really usable in different boss fights unlike in HK. Second, checkpoint placement before bosses is actually here, which was lacking in HK. Third, fast travel is also a little bit better, because you can use more fast travel points here. Only thing, which is worse is probably map because it doesn’t show where are you exactly in current area but it’s not that bad. It is my favorite metroidvania so far and it deserves more attention.. Music, story, art and gameplay are perfect. Makes you immerse yourself in the world. I in love with this game!. I tried Ender Lilies on a whim and was continuously impressed by its gorgeous art direction, tense combat, haunting melodies, and well-realized world with a surprising amount of lore and characterization. Although hardly revolutionizing the ""metroidvania"" formula, Ender Lilies is incredible example of how engrossing storytelling, a wonderful soundtrack, and refined combat can elevate an otherwise derivative gameplay experience. This remains one of my favorite games to date.. This game is gorgeous, amazing combat, the ambient is super immersive and so is the music and the art and color, there is something special about this game the way the implemented metroidvania formula is really well done and user friendly the map even lets you know if you are missing stuff in a certain area which I think is something all games like this should have, a must buy.. The one of greatest metroid in this world. I like it very much. Game of the 2021 year.. Great game. Not a fan of hollow knight or most metroidvania games. This one was different. The story was well weaved into the duration of the game and I like how much more important it became as you got into the later game. There was a lot of optional text to read which I thought made the game much better. The plot was well written. The music was very passive and eerily soothing while also sad. I appreciated how the music amped up during boss fights.. What an incredible gem. A very good game with beautiful art and a beautiful soundtrack. If you're a fan of Metroidvania games, this is a must have.. For me is the one of the best metroidvania I played, it's true that is similar to hollow knight. the music is a masterpiece and in the final credits the music is so relaxing and ejoyjable. The game is very fun and engaging, Music is spot on and very alluring. It creates a distinct atmosphere to locations even if there's only a handful. Boss fights were average still they were very fun. The difficulty is balanced and adaptive to the strong gameplay. Unironically, I like this more compared to Hollow knight (Hollow K. is still better technically, but there's something within EL that speaks for me more. A sweet 15-hour game that can entertain and convey a simple story. Very good indeed. 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 boss fight 10/10 story 10/10 art style Must play if you like metroidvania. This game is literally a gem. Loved every bit of it, the art style, the combat, the graphics and soundtrack. Even compared to Hollow Knight it's just a lot shorter, but filled with high quality moments of fight and exploration. Even the dark and beautiful story is told in an elegant, light way that never bores. Hope the devs get the credit they deserve and give us a bigger sequel or a new game. Buy it, you won't regret it.. It's an OK metroivania. Just don't expect high quality like Symphony of the Night or any other Castlevania for that matter. It's a pretty bare bones experience from a company I'd expect is pretty green. Not bad, just really not that great either.. Loved every minute of it. Great gameplay, beautiful music and amazing art. The map seems a little confusing at first but you get used to it. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of this game!. To be perfectly clear, the game itself is not bad. Movement is pretty intuitive, with none of the unlockable mobility upgrades feeling hard to use. Combat is satisfying, and offers enough room for personalization that each player can find their own methods. The map could use work, but I appreciate the clarity in communicating which rooms still have secrets to find. Where Ender Lilies falls flat, in my opinion, is its presentation. People call it a mix of Hollow Knight and Dark Souls, but it felt more like a reheated meatloaf of the two. Tastes good, but lacks memorable charm. Storywise, I was interested at first, before I knew what was going on. But as I discovered the lore, it turned out to be a lot of reused concepts from its main inspirations. They were executed competently enough, but a copy is still a copy. It simply didn't feel as meaningful the second time around. The bosses, with a few exceptions, are generic knights that fail to leave much of an impression. The flash of red that almost every attack in the game is preceded by hurts their memorability, since you spend less time actually examining foes and learning their animations than you do simply reacting to the color red with a quick dodge or parry. Despite the plethora of unlockable attack abilities, called spirits, you won't wind up using most of them more than once. Since you need collectable resources to upgrade them, a player will naturally only want to stick to the ones they've upgraded even if they get a cool new one. On top of this, each change in spirit composition necessitates a period of relearning muscle memory. While I appreciate what they were going for with the system, it still ultimately harmed my experience. The art style and environments look pretty, but in that generic soulslike gothic way that doesn't stand out. Even now, only a day after 100% completing it, I wouldn't be able to describe most of the locations in great detail. This is despite combing through the world several times to obtain every last optional item and scrap of lore. As for the music... I was disappointed. I like MILI, so I was really looking forward to the OST. But even now, looking at the OST on its own, barely any of it actually stands out. I wouldn't be able to tell you when these songs actually play in the game, and most of the boss music seems to be going for the Dark Souls ""Gwyn's Theme"" vibe. That would be fine, if it wasn't EVERY SINGLE BOSS THEME. When all the music has the exact same feeling to it, no tracks really get a chance to stick in the mind. Jumping back to the combat, a lot of the basic enemies are very uninspired. Throughout the entire game there are these slime things that just walk at you slowly and periodically leap forwards. Generic zombie archers shoot at you unerringly, only really a threat when one is busy with another enemy. The unique enemies for each area, meanwhile, almost all fall prey to the simple strategy of dodging into their body when red flashes and then hitting them. Repeat until dead. As I said earlier, if it weren't for the flashes of red it might be more interesting. But since the actual animations barely matter to learning their moves and timing they all end up feeling the same aside from how tanky and damaging they are. For someone that wants an easier game in the genre, I would heartily recommend Ender Lilies. In fact, I think it's a great introduction to the genre. But, having played far more interesting titles with far more interesting stories and settings, I can't say I really enjoyed it. Oftentimes I'd find myself wishing I was playing Blasphemous or Hollow Knight instead. If I were to rate this game more accurately, I would probably call it a 7.5/10. A fun way to spend your time, but not one that you'd keep coming back to.. Solid Metroidvania. But I have to play without music. After 5 oder 10 loops (30 Minutes maybe) it starts to annoying me. Beside that it's negative to get the double jump after 20 minutes.. A near perfect game and as good as they come. Earned a spot on my top-10-favourite-list. If you want to have an idea of how good it is ... to me, it is up there with Ori and the Blind Forest. It is a bit hard at times, but the spawn points are very forgiving (looking at you, Hollow Knight) and one of the few games I did not turn down the music b/c it became annoying.. The worst map i have ever seen on a metroidvania. Music is repetitive, always kind of the same melody, sound effects are bad too, everything sound so weak and floaty. Art is ok, but too dark, everything looks kind of the same. Combat is ok and obviously it takes a lot of gameplay things from Hollow Knight. Perfect game! This is one of the best indie games of the year! Buy without fear. Everything in Ender Lilies estimulate your senses. Art and animations are so fluid and atmospherics, love it. Combat is so satisfaying and flexible, love it too. Maybe the the most beautiful, fun and challenging game I ever played. Can't say a bad thing, even Hollow Knight seems now behind this joy. Mili shines in the OST, specially toward final sequences. Totally 10/10.. I enjoyed it x10 times more than any AAA release from past 3 years. Also better than hollow knight.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don’t want to sound too harsh, as a Metroidvania glutton I enjoyed my time with Ender Lillies, at a time where a lot of us are eagerly awaiting Hollow Knight: Silksong, a game that attempts to do similar things fairly successfully is bound to be warmly received. From the start though, I’ve had this **** feeling that this game was missing something and the reason it’s hard to pinpoint is that the devs are good enough that it’s almost never one major thing. The creators of Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight, a title so generic it becomes offensive, understand what makes a Metroidvania work. If you go left at the start, as most Metroid fans are wont to do, you will be greeted with a locked door that will nag at you for 90% of the game and that exaltation you feel when you finally open it is exactly what the genre is all about. So if you are in the mood for a decent Metroidvania, read no further and go play Ender Lilies. If you are looking for the next Hollow Knight on the other hand, read on, or stay away from this game. So what makes a Hollow Knight so great? Maybe it depends on who you ask, but for me it’s a combination of true exploration, amazing level design and art direction, areas that feel different enough but part of a whole, great gameplay and combat; satisfying new abilities that make you want to immediately revisit previous areas. I could go on and on, but let’s focus on these for now. Ender Lilies never feels great, the areas are fine, but not memorable. It’s somewhat challenging but not consistently enough to give you a sense of accomplishment, the bosses are pretty good, but don’t feel especially inspired. There is also a readability problem where the fights become a sloppy combination of your flashy attacks and the bosses flashy attacks and you can’t tell when to dodge. The exploration is maybe the most problematic, because the game color codes the map, orange if completed and blue if you need to find something, there are also red dots on the sides if you need to find a new path. It’s helpful, but inelegant and also provides this checklist feel instead of the more refined and mysterious exploration of Hollow Knight. Another apt comparison would be the checklist nature of an Assassin’s Creed type open world map vs Breath of the Wild’s organic and explorative one. The game completely falls apart in the final section, a poisonous uninviting mess of an area that makes you reminisce fondly on Dark Souls’ Blighttown. It’s impossible not to take damage, and you are basically invited to rush through a rushed through environment instead of exploring it, an experience that mirrors development perhaps? It certainly feels that way. Ultimately the bottom line is that Ender Lilies is unoriginal, somewhat generic and if you’ve played Hollow Knight, Blasphemous, Salt and Sanctuary or a SoulsBorne you’ve played a far better version of what’s on offer here. That doesn’t mean the game is without merits, it’s competently made for the most part and will definitely scratch the Metroidvania itch if you are a fiend like me. 7.5/10. Such a beautiful game. I was waiting for a worthy Castlevania and this was definitely one.. This game is just perfect from the beginning to end.. how the difficulty begins to raise smoothly.. the choice of music in every scenario.. the story.. 100% recommended.. i made a metacritic account just to give this masterpeace a 10/10. the music, the boss battle, the story truly amizing. This game is super immersive and fun, with the music being the cherry on top. If you liked hollow knight and similar games, you will like this.. Amazing metroidvania game brilliant level design wonderful skills thrilling boss fight fascinating art direction best ost in 2021, ofc this game deserves more love. I made an account just to give this game a 10/10. Everything about this game is amazing, the music, setting, story, and atmosphere are all beautiful and give it so much charm and originality. The gameplay is not overly complex, you start with a basic attack and can dive to dodge attacks, which is fun to play with itself, but over the course of the game you get spirits which give new moves and its add so much variety. The difficulty is also just right; nothing seems unfair, and although it may take more than one try for bosses, you learn their patterns and slowly get better at it.","metroidvania is solid, but it could use a little more difficulty in the boss fights . it's packed full of content, art is beautiful, combat is fine, variability in gameplay really really nice ."
"1,048.Football Manager 2019","Even if the game is 2 years old already (actually 3, taking into account it was launched in November 2018), the level of realism dazzles. The personalities of the players on the pitch are very well reproduced, for me being very easy to recognize their style of play as I watch a common football game. I started an international qualifying campaign to Euro with my homeland nation and after taking them to the EURO Final Tournament from the 2nd place of the qualifying group - this while beating the best nation in the game at the time (Belgium, 2-0) and some previous World Cup Winnners (Spain, 1-0 in a testing friendly), I was knocked out from the group stage with 3 consecutive defeats, but the joy felt while playing FM19 remains the same after years and years of game editions and for the editions to come, I am pretty sure. An enjoyable tactical managerial sport simulation strategy.. Got a decent amount of time from the game. Maybe it's not a great improvement from the last one I played (2017) and a lot of issues are still there (match engine above all), but I love this experience and can't help it!. Same old **** as every year. Nothing new. Every year tehy brag as they bring something, only to see it's the same as it was from the start.. Football manager barely changes anything and republishes their game for full price. Greedy cheap basterds. The game database is great, but if you play for long enough and understand the mechanics the game becomes easy to beat, because it requires little adaption to the opponent and the scouting system is easy to game. There is also always some game breaking problem, such as crossings working insanely well.. One of the worst game that I played in this series. They should improve the fun and decrease details. Games would need to be faster. Players are not real managers and they don't need to be that good.. Spent hours only to manage to go through the complicated GUI. Useless info everywhere, annoying game, huge disappointment. There is no intuitive gameplay. Feels like there was no project manager for it. Huge disappointment for a management/simulation fan. I miss the good days of the older FM and/or the defunct FIFA Manager :(. 2019 is a huge leap forward from 2018 because of the new tactics system and beautiful UI. One of the milestones of the franchise.. Late review for the life of FM 2019 but thought I'd write fore people before they buy FM20. Basically bought after not having bought since 2015. It's a great looking game, and a lot of stuff is really good - tactics, training, the stats, visualisations, analysis, etc. BUT - unknown players cost a fortune. Negotiations, player interaction, press interaction all gets boring and samey. But WORST of all - the MATCH ENGINE. It's terrible. EPL matches rarely see over 20 shots - I regularly get 30+, 40+, 50+ and can't score, and I draw or lose. You get a feel for the games you know you'll lose and as I read in another review - it's a puzzle game, where the solution is to optimise the number that dictates whether you'll win or lose - It feels very much like that. It's not that realistic. That's not to say it isn't fun. It is - but SI have never managed to solve that problem in their coding. It's also clunky - particularly player searches, which are slow.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not the best franchise game, but not the worst either. The game could have a higher degree of difficulty. No more fulfills your goals. Worth it.. Just a reskin like some people have said, except in some ways the engine is actually getting worse and less and less realistic. Absolutely terrible.. The best soccer game ever. You can make your history in the club you support and see it champions with your work. It´s amazing. I only don´t understand why the FM2019 it isn´t sold in brazil, but, it´s a amazing game!. this game is soo bad...worst fm **** unreal,,,definetly last fm i buy. Detailed training mode is good. Extended dialog options is nice. Menu design is great. Improved graphics and match broadcast engine is lovely. BUT License issues are bad. FPS Drops are frustrating. AS A RESULT, You will not be able to get up for hours, you will discover new talentsand you will win great cups in the seasons waiting for you.. FM19 is totally worth the money for any football nerd who wants to experiment with tranfers, tactics and team dynamics in what is a complex and frankly, overwhelming database of staff, teams, competitions and players. The latest version is the best I've seen and a step up from last year. Improved tactics, training and match engine are worth the extra price alone (not forgetting to mention the latest wonderkids). In short, don't waste your time buying an earlier version. Casual users will prefer the more streamlined version of the game, but for purists that have plenty of time on their hands, there is enough here to spend, oh, say 200+ hours on.. What I Like: Tactical options, revamped team training, the usual comprehensive database of teams and players, and an improved user interface. What I Don't Like: Poor AI logic, unbalanced match engine, and frustrating player development. Player development is frustrating because teenagers develop extremely quickly even without match experience, while 20-25 year olds often show no improvement despite playing all season. Uncertainty is good, but the aging curve needs to be less rigid. You might as well ignore potential ability once a player hits 20. But the match engine is the bigger problem. When you see your team has crossed the ball 60 times in a match (EPL teams cross 15-20 times per match in real life), despite you telling your two wide players to ""cross less often"" then you know the game mechanics are flawed. Even your opponents will cross that often because the game seems to hard-code into player logic. It's enough to make yo want to play an older version.. They really are phoning this game in now and have been for some time. clunky and slow even on a beast of a PC. terrible layout, same same. I really don't understand why do people buy the same game every year. No real changes, it is still the basic football manager. If you like this genre, you can play the old versions and you do not loose anything.. You can still get a lot of mileage out of the older games for a fraction of the price; it's still just the same re-skin. Better yet if you want a realistic management sim where actual prizes are at stake, sign up for a Fantasy Football season and get a real taste of it.. Old poor match engine. Or rather I should say worse than ever because I remember times when there was in FM a possession football, some passes inside the penalty box, not so many nonsense panic shots and blocked crosses. Maybe it wil improve slightly with patches (I mean the last one in March) but don't expect much. Such poor match enigne makes all these nice tools in match analysis almost completely useless. Tactics ****, very few options to tweak your game plan, you can't effectively order your attacking players to get back and press the opponent, it's such a rigid unrealistic tactical management, it's only about general shape of the whole team and some special treats of your players. Also as mentioned by others, poor unrealistic transfer market, poor AI, many boring old features like answearing thousand times same questions for media. Finally trening looks like it make sense, but you can't really say that before playing few seasons, and there is nothing in this game to make you want to play that long.. Game is currently in beta conditions. Its playable but filled with game breaking bugs. There is a bug that can prevent you from saving. I lost eight hours of gameplay. Another big bug I ran into was being unable to increase the clubs youth level which made trying to develop youth players much harder. The worst is the Football Manager Community on the SI Forums. They are almost like a cult. Filled with fanboi's and heavy handed moderators. They relentless attack those who bring up any shortcoming of SI and are quick to defend them. You will attacked by the community and have any threads that point anything wrong being closed. Members of the community were attacking people for leaving negative feedback in the official feedback thread.. Another year, another Football Manager brought by Sports Interactive. This series has been coming since 2005 and as such, fans should be eager to know what the small news of this new version. Signing up for a club as a coach, setting tactics and training, hiring and taking the club as far as possible in national and international competitions are things that are part of everyday life in Football Manager. But let's go directly to the news features of this Football Manager 2019. Now we have more realistic and detailed training sessions. Each day has two or three training sessions that can be dedicated to game tactics, attacking or defensive moves, or more general things. In other words, whatever we understand. It may be a bit annoying at first to be altering train X on day X, but it's a very good feature. The tactics have also been changed ... and for the better. Movements with or without ball are back. Now we can change our tactics more deeply and there are lots of options for the player to choose and form the kind of game they want. The Tiki-taka of Barcelona, the bus of José Mourinho or the Gegenpressing of Jürgen Klopp. Yes, at the beginning it is natural that it is difficult to define a tactic with feets and head, especially for those who are new to the Football Manager series, but this is part of the menu, which makes things more rewarding. It should be noted that the 1st Division German (Bundesliga) and the 2nd Division German have for the first time the teams, equipment and licensed players. Football Manager 2019 also added the VAR (Video-referee), which allows us to see the marked offsides. But not everything is roses in this new version, because Football Manager and Transfers are two words that don't match. Unfortunately, it's already a common problem in the Football Manager series. It continues to make zero-sense clubs asking for more than 100 million euros for an unknown young player. Visually, Football Manager games have never been appealing (nor was it ever their goal), but that's because the producers have always wanted to make the Football Manager series a lightweight game. However, 3D Match Engine received improvements, especially with the physics of the ball. Negative points are the transfer market, the number of injuries a bit exaggerated and the printing conferences are something generic and repetitive. In the end, Football Manager 2019 turns out to be a good improvement over last year's version. Veredict: Football Manager 2019 has received some modifications for the better and is recommended for fans of the series.. nothing new. pretty much the same game every year. miss the good old Cm2001. It's my first Football Manager and I love it. I see that people are mad that the devs don't do anything new to this series and I probably won't buy 2020 one. My experience is great, I really feel like football manager, it's an awesome game for people like me. And I am giving it 10/10 because I love the ideas behind it. I can't deliver you a comparison with other ""football managers"" but I see that there is no point in buying more than 1. I am going to play it from time to time for 2 years or 3. My new travel game in the train or plane, I'm happy for it. And it's a great title. But don't get me wrong, my rating tells a story of one game, and it's awesome, but eventually, it gets boring. After 12 hrs I'm tired of it and I need a break. I/m going to play some other games and return to it after a while or in a train. Experience is 10/10 and it might be a personal opinion from me, but that's how reviews work, right?. Yearly release cycles are ludicrous for this game. I only buy a version of it once every 3 or 4 years. Frankly the game is getting too complicated for its own good, playing FM is more like having a second job now than a relaxing diversion.. Football Manager has radically changed my way of buying games in recent years. Worse. Because I don't trust the developers anymore. In FM 2019 they have improved training and tactics (just the layout, honestly) but left out many other problems accumulated over the last 5 years. Some of them really very boring. AI is still far behind (this is why I'm not convinced at all by the tactics change). The negotiations, the relations with the media and the players, remains all boring. For example: once again it will be useless to identify the potential star playing in an unknown league, because it will cost you more than Ronaldo. So, yes, it's something more than the usual database update, which we were used to, but not at this price. You will read positive reviews from those who bought it at 20-30 euros. For 20 euros I would have spoken very well of it too, for 55 not. For 55 is a refund. My advice is: don't buy it if you bought FM 2018. Or wait for the next sales.","football manager 19 is a tactical managerial sport simulation game . the game is 2 years old already (actually 3, taking into account it was launched in November 2018) but the level of realism dazzles . if you play for long enough and understand the mechanics the game becomes easy to beat ."
"1,049.Gunman Clive HD Collection","The gameplay in Gunman Clive is extremely typical and I only kept playing for the awesome boss battles.While the gameplay hasn't changed in its sequel,the level design,art style,music,and boss battles were amazing and for the price on this game,it will definetly be worth it.. This collection offers you 2 of the best indie platformers from the 3DS, in HD and on the Wii U at only $3.99! It's a complete no-brainer! The 1st game took me 33 minutes to complete, and I haven't quite finished the 2nd one yet. Pretty much the 2nd one is quite harder than the 1st, although the 1st one gets a bit tough, too. I think I like the 2nd one a little better because it has more color and really cool environments. Anyway, definitely give this collection a try, it's worth it!. This game is one of the best deals for the wii u. For under 5 dollars you get 2 amazing indie platforming games. Gunman Clive has great combat, exiting bosses, and fun level design, albeit having slightly boring visuals. The second game remedies this by adding lots of colors, along with upping the number and excitement of boss fights and levels. Altogether this is one game on the Wii U that you don't want to miss. I clearly just didn't ""get it"" with this game, despite really wanting to like it. Nifty graphic style, but I found the gameplay painful -- rare to find a game so slow and simple, yet so frustrating. Obviously this is firmly in the ""cult classic"" genre, where you either love it or wonder how anyone could love it.","this collection offers you 2 of the best indie platformers from the 3DS, in HD and on the wii u . the 1st game took me 33 minutes to complete, and I haven't quite finished the 2nd one yet . for under 5 dollars you get 2 amazing indie platforming games ."
"1,050.Persona 4 Arena","A familiar enough fighting game for those who played Blazblue, or games similar to it, fighting game veterans should be able to adapt fairly easily to it. Newcomers might struggle a bit, though there is a deep enough tutorial, and character challenges, to help with people entering this style cold turkey. The combat mechanics are solid enough to put it on par with games like Blazblue. Visually, there is a fine balance between solid pixel art, and hand drawn art. The music is top notch, and bringing back the OG voice actors (both Japanese and English) is always a great positive. My knocks come from the very generic crossover story, and the lack of playable Persona 3 characters (being limited only to Akihiko, Mitsuru, Aigis, and Elizabeth), despite being a crossover fighter.. A strange decision to continue the story of a RPG in a fighting game. It is as far as I can see competently made and they put a lot of effort into the game. However I was mostly here for the story and a bit out of curiosity. The game itself is a continuation from Persona 4 and Persona 3. You should definitely know these games aka the stories as you will get lost really fast otherwise. It starts when the protagonist of Persona 4 Yu returns to Inaba to visit his friends. Shockingly when he and some of his friend meet the Midnight Channel that should be gone reappears and a fighting tournament is announced by one of their friends that is not present. They want to investigate this in the TV world which is a manifestation of human subconscious / mind (Without Persona 4 knowledge you are lost and it should look strange). Meanwhile the characters from Persona 3 are now part of an organization that deals with issues related to the subconscious world and are in the area investigating a missing anti Shadow weapon (Again without Persona 3 knowledge you are a bit lost). With this the story starts. I like the story and characters. The twists and reveals are nice and overall I was satisfied. However there are weaknesses. A mayor twist can be spotted from miles away, it feels a bit forced sometimes and the story is told in character chapters. You have to unlock additional chapters to continue the story and / or see other perspectives. The gameplay is O.K for me. Fighting games / beat em ups are not my favorite genre. I am familiar with Street Fighter, Tekken and Mortal Kombat but not as much to be anywhere near expert knowledge. They managed to give the Persona feeling without a doubt. The characters, move sets, Personas and areas are familiar and enjoyable. What should I say you have basic attacks, special moves, a SP gauge for devastating attacks etc. The characters are different and have their unique moves. For me it has depth and works well. I repeat take this with a grain of salt as I am no expert in the genre. I will however point out that some characters are better or easier to use. Maybe a balance issue or just my lack to use these efficiently. As other point out the same I lean more towards the issues. The presentation is top notch and they nail the visuals and style of Persona 4/3. The soundtrack and voice actors are excellent and enhance the atmosphere. Overall while it was a nice game I dislike the fighting game approach. It is not that great while I will defend that it is well made. A 7/10 is fair.. I love this game soo much! Persona 4 Series really has changed my life, and I feel very grateful for that.. Outstanding gameplay, excellent art and graphics and oozing with that P4 personality. You’ll love it if you love persona and don’t play fighting games much, but if you actually like fighting games this is pretty broken and you’ll be annoyed with the campaigns long cutscenes.. How I rate games: Game-play, Music/Sound, Graphics & Visuals, Story/World-building, and Characters each get 0-2 points adding up to a score /10. 0 is non-existent or bad, 1 is average or N/A, and 2 is better than average. Game-play: 0 For a fighting game, the game play is very broken with some character being gods or having spam-able abilities while others are near-useless. Music/Sound: 1 The music has some new tracks that aren't terrible memorable and some tracks from P4. None of the sound effects are too annoying or amazing. Graphics & Visuals: 2 The graphics are a fun mix of drawn images for backgrounds and pixel art that keeps the artstyle from becoming dated with time. Story/World-building: 2 Oddly enough, this is the strongest part of the game. The use of adding details from P3 and interrogating them with P4's setting works wonders expanding the world and creating a story that is appropriate for the series. Characters: 2 It is mostly existing characters, but the new ones are stronger than you'd expect for a spin-off. TOTAL: 7/10. I will tell my 3 favorite games so you will know what type of gamer is writing this review. Atelier Totori Danganronpa Fire Emblem (You should know this review is of the story mode only.) THE GOOD: VOICE ACTING: Great voice acting, voice acted about 80 percent of the time. MUSIC: Great music, from piano melodies to heavy guitar riffs. CHARACTER CAST: Great characters and character interaction. GRAPHICS: Game has a great look in my opinion. My brother said he couldnt get past the fish lips though. He meant when the characters talk, the way thier mouths moved up and down very quickly looked like a fish in some way.This didnt bother me because i hardly ever looked at the mouths of the characters. When they talk, you will most likely be reading along with the text so i dont think this will be an issue for too many people. It was worth mentioning though. GAMEPLAY TIME: Long story mode for a fighting game. Over 20 hours. A lot of this time is spent reading. About 85 percent reading and 15 percent battles. Definently more of a visual novel then anything else if you are playing in story mode. This wasn't really a bad thing though. The story is written well enough to keep you rather intrigued. THE BAD: Watching the same scenes over and over with another persons outlook got old. You will do this often. Gameplay is drab. I won every fight with the same combo. If you and your opponent are running to each other, you will always get your combo in before them. Its the way the ai is programmed. I won every fight by just running up to the opponent and pressing square multiple times. Difficulty could have been amped up I believe but i didnt see the need as i dont particuraly care for fighting games anyway. Played this one mostly for the story. Another slight complaint is the way you have to read the people thoughts in each character storyline. They are not voiced and the dialogue is shown in bright white letters with a bright background. Found myself squinting my eyes just to read **** should definently take a break from this game every hour or so in my opinion. Just to let your eyes rest. I did try adjusting the brightness on my tv but it didn't help much. I would reccomend this game to a persona fan who wanted to keep in the know with the story but if you dont particulary care, I might pass. You should know that this game can be bought for under a 20 dollar price tag though. That wraps this review up.Hope it helps someone. Just in case you didn't catch this, Persona Ultimax is a sequel to Persona Arena and not a remake.. Persona 4 Arena brings the fighting game production skill of Arc System Works together with the publisher Atlus to bring out a strong entry in the 2d fighting genre. This game has been featured at the most recent EVO in 2013 which can attest to its viability for competitive play. The gameplay itself feels extremely smooth and the large amount of unique skills per character allow for a varied landscape of play. An auto-combo system is included for newer players to the fighting genre which can be a downside for some, but a player who knows their combos will always outshine one button mashing. The story mode is true to the style of the Persona series and is able to follow the canon without leaving plot-holes quite skillfully. The story mode is extremely text heavy, and surprisingly long for a fighting game. There are routes for all playable characters. This is both a blessing and a curse, as learning characters through story mode is nice, but there is extreme overlap in lines of dialogue and scenarios regardless of what character you're playing. Overall Persona 4 Arena is an extremely solid Persona game, as well as a fighter which can stand on its own merits. Overall I rate this game an 8/10 for shining above my expectations for a fighting game adapted from a jRPG.. As a fan of the Persona series, I was originally highly worried that Arena would be a ""cash in"" title. I can safely say that after purchasing the game, those worries have been put to rest. Fighting game fans will be pleased to know that the gameplay has been handled well by Arc. Controls are for the most part smooth, with beautifully done animations. Mechanics work differently for each character, utilizing some of their most common moves from the RPG. However, the core actions remain similar across the board, allowing for a player to learn the basics of playing a new character fairly quickly. In terms of the story, it adds on to the excellent world created by Atlus in Persona 4, with additional characters and story elements from Persona 3 thrown in for good measure. Persona 4 Arena definitely earns a solid recommendation from me, and I would highly recommend a purchase if you are in the US or Canada (the game is sadly region locked. Fortunately the sequel, Persona Arena Ultimax, will be region free.). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it's just as good as persona 4, in it's own way. there is a story mode, which involve a lot of reading through dialogue, as well as your character's thoughts. it takes place two months after the true ending in persona 4 and is very well done. the game-play itself is also very good. it's simple to understand the basics, but difficult to master it there is also an arcade mode, which is a shorter version of story mode, online battling, a score attack mode in which the a.i. difficulty shoots up past 'hell' difficulty, and 390 total combo challenges between all the characters.. Probably one of the best fighting games.Game play is good and It is fun playing this game.. It's one of my favorite fighting games. The fighting mechanics are decent. The graphics are superb, and controls are great and simple. The story mode is actually very intriguing, and I didn't expect that in a fighting game. I give it an 8 in stead of 10 for 2 reasons: 1. It is region locked. It's not a big deal for me, but it is for a fairly large group of people. 2. The game can only be really appreciated if you have played Persona 4 or Persona 4 Golden. Otherwise, it's just another decent fighting game.. Classic 2d fighting with lots of speed and depth, love it! There's mode for beginners with automatic combos, but pros wont use this kind of help. Story mode is deep, graphical novel and takes your time about 10 hours. Net-code is pretty decent, but not as good as ssfivae. Challenge mode is classic nightmare, at least for me, but its rewarding at the same time.. I own P4G so i had to get this game, i dont play fighting games but its great i havnt put it down even thought its tough especially online. A must own for fighting/persona fans And who in the right mind reviews a game on region lock i really dont understand that. To all those who are giving this gamer a bad review, stop giving bad scores because of the region lock! People who are wanting to give this game a try will get the wrong impression of game quality because of your complaints. Yes, I concur that it ****, its unprecedented and just not right... but tell the company that! Don't deter potential players from the game, please and thank you. I mean no offense to all of you- it's just something that personally bugged me.. This game is awesome! Great graphics and the soundtrack is superb. Fighting system is intuitive enough for beginners, but also difficult enough for experience players to put in some serious combos. Shame about the region lock, but thats why you should do your research on a game before buying it!. I normally hate fighting games like this, but I found this one oddly entertaining. The story was surprisingly pretty good and was a great follow up to Persona 4. This was the first fighting game I've found to be fun at all, good job Atlus.. This fun-to-play fighting game is backed by a beautifully catchy score and incredibly balanced characters. A must-play for any fighting game or Persona fans.. Persona 4 is a highly touted fighting game of 2012. However, it is overrated and failed to deliver a great experience. The action is way too flashy and you really can not even see what you are exactly doing.. Atlus always making gold of what they touch. This game is amazing, not only the fighting but also the story that tells you what happened after Yu Narukami left Inaba. Is a great title if you want a guilty gear/blazblue fighting style game and a great title for gamers like me who love Persona 4 and want to know what happened next. Great graphics Great story Great soundtrack Great gameplay. This is the first fighting game I've picked on day 1 and the first Persona game I've ever played. As a newcomer to both worlds I can say that P4A is incredibly accessible and at the same time packs a ton of content to keep you hooked for weeks. I've been playing it since it came out and between the story and arcade modes, challenges, score attack, and incredibly smooth netplay, I haven't had the chance to bother with any other games. My GOTY 2012.. This is terrible. Maybe I should never play another anime inspired fighting game, because between this and the terrible Skullgirls, I've lost faith. Although I love Blazblue so go figure. Small chars, slow gameplay, it takes me all day just to get to the other end of the screen. Stupid persona concept (again, similar to the terrible Skullgirls), and stupid visuals. I'm so glad my gamestore let me take this back. The developers of this and Skullgirls should get together and rewrite their resumes (leaving these games out of course), and then try to get on a team that actually knows how to put an ounce of fun into their fighting games.. This is the first PS3 game with region locking, a terrible precedent and one that was not announced in the 20 or so fluff emails about the game. Nothing beats getting a game and then getting an error you didn't even know existed. On top of that, the game is rather weak. P4Arena is a solid pass.. I was already a huge fan of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue from Arc System Works, and the Persona/SMT games are my favorite RPG franchise now that Final Fantasy has reduced itself to constant ****. But when I heard that Atlus was teaming with Arc to make a Persona fighting game, I could hardly believe it. Atlus is no stranger to trying weird things with its franchises (see: Catherine), but even after its release, I have a difficult time believing it exists. First things first, please ignore the importers that spammed this section with low scores because of Atlus' region lock, as they went out of their way to make gamers aware of this decision long before its release in Japan. Only a few weeks separated the Japanese and American releases, both included dual language capability, and the solid-as-a-rock multiplayer netcode for region-specific servers all led to the decision, and ultimately Atlus' fans have supported it as having our best interests at heart. Anyway, as for the game itself, I have been blown away by the quality of the whole thing. In combining an RPG with a fighting game, you might expect Arc and Atlus to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator for both genres. Instead, it feels like Arc saw this as an opportunity to expand on the things it learned from GG and BB, while Atlus didn't shy away from including Persona's signature social elements, extensive story, mature themes, and excellent voice acting. Yes, Arc managed to implement some entry-level mechanics like autocombos and common counters to make the game accessible to all player types, but it also included instant blocks, breaks, cancels, SP meters, and a variety of other deep mechanics that rival the best tournament-level fighters (SSFIV, UMvC3, etc.). The inclusion of Persona's status ailments was also a pleasant surprise, since it deepens both the tactical aspects of combat and the aesthetic connection to the Persona series. This is canonized material that serves as a sequel to both Persona 4 and, by proxy and inclusion of four particular characters, Persona 3. Even the end boss is a Kirijo Group android directly related to Aigis and other P3/P4 events, and since we already know that Aigis shows up in P5, Arena may serves as a light story bridge into that game as well. Also, I think it's worth noting that the Personas themselves [in Arena] were brilliantly implemented. You can alter color combinations between the human user and their Persona, allowing 64 different combinations for each character pairing. Using them in battle feels like the best parts of MvC's tag/assist system mixed with Vanguard Princess's support character mechanic, though Arena feels more advanced than both in certain ways. Even special moves are named after SP skills in Persona, ranging from Agidyne and Zionga to Megidolaon and Myriad Arrows. Guilty Gear's dust attacks have been repurposed as All Out Attacks from P3/4, and Persona users can enter an Awakened state to have a fighting chance once their health drops below 35%. Furthermore, Guilty Gear's instant kills have returned, but in a much less cheap manner, requiring certain conditions to be met before executed. BlazBlue's beginner and advanced combat modes have been blended so players always have a fallback autocombo if they get lost, but these combos are, of course, very predictable to seasoned players and not terribly effective as a button-mashing technique in the long run. That means first-time players will find the game ""easy to play but hard to master"", while veterans will be able to form their own refined play styles with each character and focus on technical things like frame count and recovery time. Persona 4 Arena also includes [arguably] the best soundtrack, the best 2D animation, and the best story of ANY fighting game to date, not to mention a wide variety of loveable characters that far eclipse the more formulaic BB roster or the tired SF and MK line-ups. This game is definitely worth the purchase, it will soon be a rarity along with other Atlus/Arc products, and with DLC and solid network modes to keep you interested for a long time, it may satisfy you more than other recent efforts, especially the disappointments from Capcom of late. No matter whether you like RPGs, fighting games, or just gaming in general, P4A offers enough unique content that you shouldn't pass it by. Calling it a simple fighting game would be like calling Catherine a simple puzzle game. Don't judge it just on its genre.. I just love Persona and as such I love any reason to revisit the wonderful cast of the games, particularly the latest two additions. While it's not another Persona game, it's an example of a spin off done right. Loyal to the subject matter and interesting in it's own light. Solid fighting mechanics with memorable characters, a no thrills sort of affair that leaves you satisfied and content in the end.. Thanks a lot, Atlus, for region lock. As a traveler I bought my PS3 overseas and you wasted my money with this unprecedented stunt. I couldn't expect it because PS3 titles are never region-locked, and you screwed your faithful customer big time. Good job!. 10/10 for the game. Excellent fighter, arguably the best Arc System Works game since BlazBlue. Bu, unfortunately, 1/10 for the region lock. Unless you read niche gaming blocks, you may not be aware this game contains a lockout preventing PS3s from outside of the USA and Canada from reading the disc. As I have the FFXIII limited edition PS3 from Japan, I cannot play the game. I bought it completely unaware of this, and now am stuck with a $60 coaster. After googling the issue I found information on it, but now it is too late. I will have to purchase a Japanese copy of the game to play it. If you have a USA PS3, I highly recommend this game as it is amazing, but if your console is imported be aware you will have to buy the version that matches your region or it will not work. Atlus, in the future if you must region lock again, please print a warning sticker or something to prevent unaware buyers from purchasing the game. Nothing **** more than playing $60 to be stuck with a coaster.. I've been a GG fan, and now a BB fan sense day one. So I really didn't come into this worry at all, sense I know Arc System Works does it right with 2D fighting games. The graphics are NICE! The music, if you love Persona music is great. And like all Arc System Work fighting games, this game is LOADED with story, and even more sense it continues from the main story of the past two games. Game-play is a little bit easier this time around, but I understand, seeing how they're appealing to the RPG community, and not just the fighting game community. Overall it's a great game that appeals to pretty much everyone experience level. This is actually the first fighting game from Arc System Work, that I would recommend newcomers to try out. It's easy to pick up, and less intimidating than most fighting games on the market today. Oh yeah! Arc System Works has the best Net code EVER in a fighting game.. This is probably going to be my personal favourite fighter for a while. My three favourite games have all been RTS, Fighting and JRPGs. I have played a lot of Persona and SMT games and it was great to see a fighter being made using P3 and P4 characters. I didn't expect the game to actually turn out to be this good. Arc Systems Works and ATLUS are a match made in heaven. The mechanics of the game are pretty similar to Blazblue or Guilty Gear players. This game incorporates some cooler mechanics like ailments and the Personas themselves and really encourages players to be aggressive. The soundtrack is great, a mix of new tunes for Arena and some old ones from the Persona games. The voice acting is pretty good around the board for both English and Japanese. The story mode is a lot bigger than you would expect, around 10-15 hours if you are a fast reader since there aren't that many matches, and most of them are easy. For beginners it has stuff like autocombo and the tutorial and challenge modes. Overall this is a must get game if you are a fan of either Persona or fighting games in general.. Guilty gear is propably my favorite fighting game franchise out there and when i heard of blazblue i was hyped but in the end disapointed but with P4A i was very surprised. I'm not a fan of persona in general but this edition blew me away, the controls are fluid and antuitive and i find each characters apealing not like in blazblue where none of them satisfied me. Don't let you lack of persona interest make you turn away from this one its solid. The game is strong at story, the story is build by completing not only one character at the roster but all of them combine make interesting story, the presentation is amazing, great job atlus and arc system, i support atlus so atlus can make persona 5 faster.. Persona 4 Arena is a great game with beautiful visuals a great in depth story with loving and very different characters. I am a huge fan of both Atlus and Arc so this game was a huge thing for me, and as much as I do love the game it has its short comings. Though the game is great for people looking to just pick up and play, more seasoned played like myself might have a little more of a problem. Picking up and play combos are very easy which becomes a problem for people who want to improve alot more because their isn't much room for improvement beyond setting up these simple combos. I wish they had made a beginner mode like in blazblue instead of making it the default. Persona 4 Arena is an amazing 2D fighting game. The graphics are superb, the sound and music is the best I've heard since Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike, and the gameplay is super solid... Check out my full video review for all the details - ****/bTLGhbk5KQE. A brilliant game from a brilliant studio, published by the best publisher currently. I love you Atlus, never stop making games. Persona 4 and Blazblue are my favorite games in the genre's that they're in. This fuses them. Holy crap.","the combat mechanics are solid enough to put it on par with games like Blazblue . the music is top notch, and bringing back the OG voice actors is always a great positive . the game itself is a continuation from Persona 4 and Persona 3 ."
"1,051.Humanity","Awesome game, the soundtrack and visuals are all coming together to form something unique and beautiful. Throughly enjoyed my time with it and i hope the team can produce more games like this in the future. A masterpiece in its own genre. For someone like me who platinumed the game on playstation without using any kind of guide,this game was so rewarding and beautiful.. The experience is wonderful and beautiful. However, if the controls were a bit more refined, it would be superb.. It’s good, im Not that much into Puzzle games. Once it got too much i quit.. Changed my rating three times during my gameplay time. It starts interesting, get a little too hard near to the beginning, than it starts getting better and better until it reaches the ultra amazing end. Fantastic game. It doesn't reach 10 because in the middle of the game the level drops (very little), but the last sequences are brilliant. One of the best games I've ever played and one that reaches its zenith when trying to get platinum. Wonderful!. Really enjoy puzzle games but this one.. it makes more like indie games. Simple, straight and not much appealing. I play without **** controller feels like a mobile game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I’m not great at puzzle games first off and the way the game is split into sections of different puzzles with different types of gimmicks is neat but some I solved with easy and enjoyed some I really struggled. For a seasoned puzzle game player I could see this being a great time. I appreciated the puzzle solution setting to help me through the levels I really got stuck on without having to Google or YouTube an answer it was a nice touch. Not a must play but if you like puzzle games definitely keep an eye on this. Humanity is a fun and clever indie puzzle game similar to Lemmings. You play as a dog guiding people to ""the light"" and use various abilities, directions and physics that develop paths to lead them while they continuously fall to their deaths in the process. The gameplay may not be that original in concept, but it's still a great puzzle game because of the puzzles themselves. I find the process of creative thinking in this game to be strangely stimulating. With the addition of trials, collectible ""goldy"" people to save, and even user-created levels, this game offers tons of replayability. Humanity is definitely worth the money if you want a fun puzzle platformer that isn't too stressful while simultaneously encouraging you to think outside the box.. Have you ever played a game that has made you feel really smart. A game that presents fun challenges to you and does a good job teaching you to overcome these challenges to feel like you might be the next great mind to bring humanity forward? Well if that sounds fun you should try Humanity. Humanity is from developers of Tetris effect and that becomes apparent as you see all the creative and weird visuals and music that will drill its way into your consciousness and put you in a zen state as you play… ok the music isn’t as good as tetris effect but its still pretty good. At its core humanity is a puzzle game and the way you interface with these puzzles is by controlling this magical glowing spirit dog and placing commands on the ground in the path of the humans to guide them where they need to go. You are basically a sheep dog guiding endless numbers of humans through obstacles and into the light. Things start out pretty simple with you mainly switching the direction of the humans in certain places as they walk in a line to the exit. But as you play you will unlock more abilities that range from letting the humans jump to arming them with lasers to defend themselves. The cadence at which you get these new mechanics is well paced, allowing you enough time to learn a new mechanic, have fun with it, test yourself with it in more difficult puzzles and integrate them with the other things you have learned along the way, get the next mechanic and repeat. I really got glued to the game in my first few sit downs and was constantly being impressed by how fun and satisfying the solutions were to pull off and witness. Along the way you will come across something called Goldy, a large gold human, that mostly acts as a collectible to strive for in each level unlocking cosmetics along your journey. These goldy can show up anywhere from 1 to 3 times in a level and vary in difficulty to save. Sometimes going out of your way to direct your humans to grab goldy will make accomplishing other things in the puzzle more difficult, sometimes the goldy is a required key to beat the level in the first place. I ended up getting all the goldy and really enjoyed the added challenge pulling this off. Something in my brain would not let me move on without getting all of them each time so I didn’t “beat” a level in my mind until I saved them all. The game is separated into different chapters each with trials and optional trials within. Each chapter has a theme and Humanity does a great job making these themes make sense from the story point of view and what the game is having you do. The story is pretty light overall, and really only exists between chapters, you don’t need to pay attention or try to understand what the game is telling you to understand the puzzles or anything. If you do pay attention though, its basically a meta commentary on humans and them needing to be led and how we can devolve into violence if it means getting what we want and a bunch of other stuff that didn’t always make a whole lot of sense. Some of it went over my head, but that didn’t take away from the experience. I didn’t even expect a story going into this so even a thin plot designed completely to introduce new gameplay mechanics to me was more than I thought I was going to get. And introducing new gameplay mechanics was both a boon and a bane for how I felt about humanity. In the first handful of chapters all the new abilities, jumping, floating, diverting paths, felt like natural evolutions allowing for more complex puzzles that I loved. Where the game started to lose me a bit is when it introduced the enemy characters. A little over halfway though the game you start having to avoid antagonistic enemy humans who want to steal the Goldy from you and will attack and kill your humans to do so. Naturally this leads to the violence I mentioned before and you have to start arming the humans with swords and guns to fight back At first this was just another thing that felt right, when and where do I give them certain defenses in order to get through safely, sure makes sense, but eventually it felt like the entire focus of the game became this concept. This was only amplified when you gain the ability to lead the humans with the follow command freely walking the herd through the levels without the need for arrows to point them on set paths. This even led to stealth mechanics being implemented, your classic wait in a safe spot, avoid detection from bad guys on a surveillance route kinda thing. The game almost changed genres into a real time strategy game at this point, which, to be clear, was well done for the most part and even enjoyable at times, but it never looked back. This is what the game was now. It made me miss the first few dozens puzzles that I was hooked on and wanted more of. I loved watching these endless lines of humans walking like ants on the paths I set for them. Jumping over each other, climbing up .... The game works when it allows experimentation and a slow, methodical approach to puzzle solving. The departure from that in the last quarter was jarring and left me longing for the structure of placing commands exclusively, but was by no means a bad part of the game. The last two core fights were excellent, and the presentation of the game as a whole is well-done. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle games.. It was the best puzzle game i’ve played in a long time. it was addictive. I didn't want it to end. Plus, it's free for ps plus members !. Would be higher but sequence 6 and 7 are some of the worst designed levels I have ever played in a game **** this game. Extremely charming puzzle game. Made by the same devs that made Tetris effect and Rez so as you might expect the music and visuals are unique, charming and memorable. For me personally the puzzles were at that perfect difficulty that takes a little time without being frustrating and the solution's were always satisfying. The last optional puzzle in particular was very hard but the payoff was amazing when I finally figured out what the solution was, I almost couldn't believe it, it was so clever.. Cool concept, & it’s designed well & ****’s just that the puzzles are not satisfying. All the “puzzles” are the player uncovering the exact steps needed to finish the level and that is not a puzzle game, that following a predetermined path. Establishment media discredited again.. Pretty descent and calming game, which helps you to relax, should be suitable to play before going to bed. Gameplay: ****/watch?v=Slkn7U5VLSA. Overrated game. The game starts out fun because you can solve problems your own way, but after act 3, all of the puzzles have one fixed solution, which is boring and makes the game a chore to play.. This game is amazing! I always loved when Sony had quirky games like this, Ape Escape, Parappa, IQ, and etc. The puzzles on this are very challenging and you have to be able to humble yourself knowing your master plan may not have been the best plan after all.. Good game, I recommend you to play this game, a wonderful game, a smart game. One of the best/amazing puzzle games! Well done SONY for putting this beautiful game on ps plus day one!. Absolutely love this game! If you enjoyed games like Maquette, The Talos Principle, Portal, The Witness, etc. then you are going to love this game!!! Puzzles galore, great music to chill with, and simple, yet very fun and relaxing gameplay. It's also free on PS Plus day one!!!. It's almost a perfect experience for me. Puzzles are fun and diversity is there in every sequence. new mechanics until the very end of the game. Music and sounds effects are very satisfying. This is a game where you can chill while listening to your favorite podcast and enjoy your time.. One of the best puzzle games games ever made, and the presentation is unmatched. Incredibly fluid controls, silky smooth frame rate, beautiful graphics, and some truly genius puzzles that’ll leave you with your mouth on the floor. This will very likely be the best puzzle game of the year.. Absolutely brilliant and beautiful high quality puzzle game! I'm not usually too big on puzzle games but this game looked interesting so decided to give it a shot and now I can't stop playing it.. This was I game I though would be mid. But goddamn it the game is hella great! Recommend it to everyone!. After first trailers I thought that the game ****. But they put it in to the ps plus so I tried it and omg it is awesome","i'm not great at puzzle games first off and the way the game is split into sections of different puzzles with different types of gimmicks is neat . for a seasoned puzzle game player i could see this being a great time . with the addition of trials, collectibles and more, the game is a great puzzle game because of the puzzles themselves ."
