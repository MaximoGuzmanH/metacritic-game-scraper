"1,104.The Outer Worlds","I did not expect to like this game as much as I did. I didn't know that my decisions throughout the game will have such a huge impact not only on the main story but on the ending of the different characters, factions, and areas of the game. The story was great, the gameplay was fun, the characters were cool. In short, it was a fun experience and I highly recommend it. I can see myself playing it again to see the effects of other choices.. The game IMO is very underrated. U can play the game anyway u want. Pick up whatever companions u want, I'd say more than half of your decisions have conquences. Multiple different endings based on ur decisions. Game eally never takes itself to serious while be genuinely funny. Writing is awesome .Gameplay is very similar to fallout considering these are the same guys that did New Vegas that's not a surprise. I like it a bit more than FO tbh. If u play this game u won't be disappointed.. After the Fallout show, I decided to jump into the games. FO4 started off ok, but quickly fell flat. I then started TOW and it hooked me immediately. The storytelling is really good. The art design is amazing. The gameplay is pretty good. I've seen how this game gets flack for being very ""average"" or ""not as good as New Vegas."" As a new comer, none of that registers with me. I think this game is stellar and worth $30.. The game delivers enjoyable RPG experience, despite a few notable flaws. Even with some of the game's limitations, I found myself genuinely entertained throughout the adventure. Unlike many sprawling, open-world games, The Outer Worlds keeps a more streamlined pace, which allows it to avoid feeling overly long or drawn-out. It fills an important niche, especially as many major Western studios have moved away from creating traditional, focused RPGs to pursue live-service games or larger, more generic action titles.While The Outer Worlds may not have the lasting legacy of some RPG classics, nor does it represent Obsidian’s finest work—it still holds charm and appeal for fans of single-player RPGs. The game offers a balance of light-hearted humor, a quirky universe to explore, and a story-driven experience that RPG enthusiasts are likely to appreciate.. impressive rpg with very good writing and a very enjoyable gameplay loop, never risks too much, falling in the ""safe"" perspective. Still one of the best crafted first person rpgs of the last years, if not the best. This game could have been amazing in my top 20 games of all time but they reused the same enemy's and locations over and over again and its just not worth the 50 hours it takes to complete this thing. I tried really hard to enjoy this but I made the awful decision of playing it straight after Cyberpunk and it just feels so stale and clunky. It has just cost me £50 on PS5 for a digital download, whereas I got Cyberpunk on physical for £25, so I'm feeling even more like I've just been robbed. I'm gutted that you can't even get a refund on Playstation store. This should not be a premium price.. Probably one of the best open world rpgs i've played as of recent. The game takes heavy inspiration from fallout, but places it in a more sci-fi, space setting, imbued with a touch of corporate hell. Fun gameplay, witty and hilarious dialogue, and enough content to keep someone playing for hours on end. Very highly reccomend.. The game would be very good, if it didn't have the annoying woke agenda inserted. And all female NPCs characters are made intentionally very ugly.. Awesome game, different from Starfield, this game has soul, a masterpiece that only obsidian could deliver to us, can't wait for TOS 2.. There's not a lot being reinvented, here. It's pretty much much 'what if Fallout and Firefly had a baby. But...WHAT IF FALLOUT AND FIREFLY HAD A BABY? And it came out cute and smart and charming and all the things you'd want. Open world RPGs struggle to find a way to create a sense of pacing for obvious reasons. This one does not. It's not a masterpiece, but it is a beautiful, thoughtful bit of escapism.. I really hate this game. I hate games with excessive multi-choice dialogue options. It's so boring, and the combat is pretty boring, too.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very wonderful and fun game. It has its own way to play, and the quality is legendary. The dialogues and choices in the story are very great. A game similar to Fallout, but it is very great.. I finished the whole game including both DLCs. With each additional hour played, I hated the game more and more. It's one of the weakest games I've ever finished. Let's see why. Review in one word for the ultra-lazy reader: Unfinished. Short review for the lazy reader: Imagine a Fallout rip-off, where at some point in the beta stage the developers say to themselves ""it's crap, but we'll advertise it anyway and people will buy it"" and with this premise they just fix the bugs and release the game as finished. And now let's talk about what pisses me off so much about it. I wouldn't mind at all that it's a Fallout rip-off, because I love Fallout. But this rip-off is half-assed, without any inventiveness or anything extra. Perhaps the only extra thing are the NPC companions. But I found them all annoying. I only took them with me because they increased my useful skills. I keep saying that it feels unfinished to me. It's time to explain why I think that. The world and NPCs are dead. Most of the NPCs you encounter will just sit or stand in place and stare at the wall. Most of the firefights you get into will be like carbon copies. The NPCs will be in a location that is on the shortest path (yes, you can avoid most firefights by simply going around them). This location will not be interesting in any way. In most cases, there will be no reason for the NPCs to be there at all. So the developers scatter boxes around the path to create the illusion that a shipment has just been overturned and the NPCs have come to see what's going on. And you'll encounter this every 100 meters along the way. The developers don't even try to pretend to simulate life. Lack of humor - one of the reasons the Fallout series is so successful is the humor. Don't expect any humor here. Sometimes there is a weak, even embarrassing attempt at humor, but you won't really be entertained. Bugs - although the game was released two years ago, the developers didn't bother with proper testing and you can still encounter bugs today. It's nothing terrible, I didn't have a situation where I couldn't finish a quest because of a bug, but it definitely ruins the already miserable impression. Fallout copycat without imagination - for example, in every second office there is a computer that you can hack and read the owner's emails. Where have I seen that before? Half-assed level design - so you're going to steal things from a window display and when you crawl through a hole in the wall after an explosion, you find that there is no corridor, no door, just no normal access to the window display. How the hell did the things get into the window display? If you start to pay more attention to your surroundings, you will find that a lot of the arrangements, corridors etc. simply don't make sense. Low variability of equipment - again, it gives the impression of a beta version. There are only a few weapons and armors in the game that look the same, only their parameters differ depending on the phase of the game you find them in (according to their level). This is slightly saved by a few unique pieces, but there are not many of them. Level cap - the base game has a level cap of 30, with one DLC it goes up to level cap 33 and with both DLCs to level cap 36. And that's criminally low. During the first DLC I was already at the maximum level, so I didn't gain any new experience. I also had the best possible equipment, with which I easily finished the game. Any joy of the new was completely gone. At that point I just wanted to be done with it. I could probably go on for a long time, but I don't feel like it. I feel like I've already spent much more time on this crap than it deserved. The saddest thing is that even though it's a Fallout rip-off, the concept is cool and it could have been a fun game. But the developers would have had to give it more time and work. Pros: Concept Cons: Unfinished, dead world, lack of humor, bugs, level design, copycat without imagination. Fallout similarities are distracting, but get into The Outer Worlds’ narrative meat and a more distinctive adventure emerges.. A game I am reviewing in retrospect, but the further I get away from, the more Im disappointed in. There is so much in this game to truly love. The setting and the characters, particularly, are a lot of fun. The world building is fantastic, and everything about the writing is what youve come to expect from a studio with the reputation of Obsidian. However, its...very shallow. Lack of real side missions, no end game play (once you finish the final mission its over), lack of customization in armor, weapons, and enemy variety really hurt it. (also, regardless of your build, the final Boss, such that it is, can only be beaten with short range attacks, so good luck if your a sniper build). This is a world that I wish I couldve poured hundreds of hours into, like many have with Fallout New Vegas, but after a dozen hours and one story play thorugh I felt like Id done everything the game had to offer.. A safe, mechanically sound, and good looking game, but is is missing the fun and story you would expect and need to keep it engaging. Not bad for a playthrough, but could have been so much better.. The Outer Worlds is a great game with some strange things sprinkled in, but overall a grand First Person Shooter experience. I enjoyed it and it really is an Obsidian game through and through with choices that hold weight. You won’t be able to please everyone. You can customize your character and even choose what traits you want to be very good at or things you want to be very bad at too. There are lots of skills to know, and characters and companions to use. At this time it was a big thing to have more than one companion out at a time and they capitalize on that. You can have your and 2 partners out at any given time off of your ship the Unreliable which is great. Make sure your team covers all the bases they can. You do it well and you could see the benefits play out in and after battle. Do it wrong and you could suffer unnecessary blunders and game over screens. Just a hint for free though. You want to level up fast go to Monarch as soon as you can. They’ll say it’s deadly and dangerous and even call you crazy for wanting to go there but it’s the best for the Experience point gain. If you’re a RPG lover, and want the time to be worth it you’ll head there right away. Depending on your choices you could side with the corporate world which hold a monopoly on everything and are lying about the whereabouts of the Hope, a big ship where the good yet eccentric doctor Phineas retrieved and rescued you from. With that being said, they are basically his enemies too. So the game is pushing you to go against them but you don’t have to. I went against them on my playthrough and it was funny. Even though the head of the organization was an idiot I didn’t kill him especially because he was in the middle of recording a commercial to all the corps and people in the Galaxy. I wouldn’t think it would have done me any good. The game is fun and the choices are important. But it can get a bit weird and strange in some areas. For some these topics may be irrelevant, but this is my review and so I want to talk about them. It seems the game also pushes a weird woke new age agenda as we not only see many alternative lifestyles represented it seems they are pushing way too hard on the same sex thing from the crew speaking on watching shows about it, NPC characters in the game being attracted to your characters you have with you. Normally this doesn’t bother me because I’m aware it’s just a game, but it seems like they were really pandering to a certain audience that wasn’t there, and going really hard in that direction. For what is my question. Did they have a lot of gay supporters or people on staff? Were they trying to be political with it and use the gay audience for the sake of wanting to be new or to be different? There were times where it got really awkward fast because of those kinds of things. You’re gonna have those kinds of people around once in a while, I get it, but the way it was delivered seemed like it was forced and strange. It didn’t affect my gameplay at all but my overall experience with the game was affected negatively for it. Let’s just say I wanted to get through the game without having to think about it. I bought it and played it and supported Obsidian, so I have a right to express my feelings on the review. But that’s enough about that. Obsidian was apart of Bethesda so naturally they’d have a bit of their DNA in there with the loot and how it’s handled by weight. Be prepared to upgrade how much you can hold of your like me and like storing as much as you can on you. There are many upgrades to Taylor your character and party to your particular play style which I absolutely love. The music was good and the gameplay kept me engaged. This is a game that’s been a long time coming for me to finally finish in my backlog and I’m glad I could get to it. I give The Outer Worlds a solid 7/10 and would recommend it to those that like RPG’s especially First Person Shooter western style RPG’s, because that’s what it is essentially. There is some political stuff in it that doesn’t help it along the lines of same sex and it can be troublesome to those that may not want that in their gaming experience. Peace to all and happy gaming.. The Outer Worlds is all about the narrative - story, choice, character progression, interactions, etc. Because it's hub-based, it lacks a bit of the exploration that makes Bethesda games great, but it also has much deeper storytelling because of this. I do miss the wide-open sense of exploration, and the loot is repetitive and often useless, but I really did like the story told here about corporate greed and a world run by corporations. The DLCs are also excellent and add so much to the base game. Looking forward to part 2.. Fallout-style first person RPG with more colourful graphics, a simplified crafting system, improved combat and stronger narratives. It's not as atmospheric as its predecssor but is less frustrating and more fun to play.. Good sci-fi RPG. I liked everything of this game, story, characters, gameplay, atmosphere. The only bad thing is that you have to wait a lot when you travel from one place to another or when you enter to certain places. I did almost all the extra things and I spent 40 hours to complete the game. Alhough it's not a great game I love, the voices, dialogues (many can be very funny) and that you can do whatever you want. To be honest I ended up a bit boring of doing extrasidequests but gameplay push me to keep going. If you don't want to do the sidequests maybe it's a good idea to do the mission of your companions (in case you want to know more of their future lives when you finish the game). I also loved the atmosphere and the sci-fi retro vibe. Also, if you have the hack ability at 80 when you are finishing the game it might be useful. I didn't have this level so I can't really asure you if it's worthy. Anyway, enjoy this sci-fi RPG you probably won't regreat it. This game deserves a 7-7'5 in my opinion.. Obsidian are real RPG pros and The Outer Worlds is just the right game. Like New Vegas in space. Overall rating: 8.8.. An ultimately forgettable and toothless RPG. Choices rarely matter in meaningful ways, combat is weightless and boring, and the central narrative is engaging but mostly goes unrealized. A disappointing return to console for obsidian.. From the company that gave us Fallout New Vegas. Well Outer Worlds is not a patch on FNV (or FO3/4). Outer Worlds does take about 10% of the completion time of Fallout 4 to beat. So that might appeal to people who want to shoot that gaming load as quick as possible. The one thing on par with FO4 is the difficulty. So both games are still easy on even the so called hard setting. Outer Worlds is an inferior experience to Fallout(s). When it comes to the combat, companions, levelling, crafting, exploring and even the writing Fallouts are superior. For that B-movie 1950's scif-fi look with a western frontier vibe Fallout is still king. I see this Outer Worlds as a step backwards in everyway in what has come before this New Vegas. The over saturation of NPC girl bosses is quite jarring and it never stops being jarring. Girls get it done right? No this is failing corporate society and everything is bad for men and women. Not sure what this Outer Worlds is saying with mostly women in all the major roles and life really ****? I do like women with short hair so thanks a lot for that I suppose? The deal breaker has got to be the rinse and repeat repetitive combat tactics. Send in companions for power attacks. Wait till they get KO then peddle backwards/kitting while spamming AOE plasma rifle fire and TDS the slow motion power. Don’t forget this game takes a tenth of the time of a Fallout game. By Monarch I am bored off my t**ts and I need a very long break before returning to finish off, ooh. It is not like this game has a compelling story or fun characters to offset the weak combat. Borderlands and Fallout has already done to death the satire of corporate **** far better and they have way more fun combat options. TD/LR; Summing up middling ARPG with simplified gameplay and considering how short a game still drags due to limited combat options. For people short on time who want uncomplicated and safe. The opposite of Fallout New Vegas the game this company also made. Oh gawd those long loading screens and the on ship lag with the storage boxes.. Boring beyond belief. Someone copy/pasted a Fallout game into UE4 and created the most bland, ugly game Ive ever played. Areas are lifeless and poorly textured, RPG mechanics are dull and pointless most times. Weapons are run of the mill. I bought the ""complete"" edition with both DLCs and I could barely get into the main game. I can't be bothered with a lengthy review. Basically: ""I do not recommend"" at any price point. I overdosed on boredom.. I played The Outer Worlds in 2019 and thought it was an average game that I was neutral towards.. The game is good with all of the different details to the world and it's characters.. This game is pretty good, it took the best parts of Fallout 4 and refined them to the max, mainly the gunplay and dialogue. This game is plainly a better version of Fallout 4, gun play is fluid, dialogue is improved and is more robust, and the story is surprisingly good. That being said, some parts of the game are a little brutal to play, especially if you're not at a high enough level, but with some grinding and side missions, that can be remedied. That and one very confusing part about a Nav-Key, which I won't go into detail on, but that stuff was **** Overall, a great game, some gripes with difficulty aside, I enjoyed it and give it an 8/10.. The Outer worlds is the result of mixing Fallout with Mass Effect having 1 third of the budget and four times the wokeism. To be honest I expected more from Obsidian, the Halcyon colony is full of vivid colours and beautiful skyboxes but populated with too repetitive and too stupid enemies and way too ugly people, special mention to the female NPCs with Morrowind faces. The almost complete lack of music while exploring the poorly designed outdoors levels with repeated assets also does not help. The ship's crew consists of 6 non romanceable clichés where the only remarkable thing is their voice acting, Ashly Burch awesome as always. They never appear to be ""real"", chilling in the ship in full armour, being teleported into elevators and being ethereal to avoid collision with you. The difficulty in Normal is non existing, I died only twice (during the first 2 hours) and finished the game with 213 heal items. Supernova it's way more interesting but has some limitations that will be hard to accept for most of the players. Story wise, it's just ok, there are some interesting missions and decisions to take that will influence the different factions, it's also full with dialogs with acid humour and anti corporation sentiments (something weird from a company owned by Microsoft). On the negative part, none of the characters/situations are remarkable (as they were for example in fallout NW) and doing 20 errands to prepare an interracial lesbian date between two chief engineers is not my idea of having space adventures. I think this game has a lot of wasted potential and maybe with more resources and less SJW content could become a great franchise.. Cash grab alert. They made a REALLY short game, then sold DLC to extend the game. The DLC should’ve been part of the original game. VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY. Don’t encourage this type of bullsheet or it’ll keep happening.. This game is a lot of fun and is designed very well. It's on a smaller scale in terms of pure size, as there are multiple smaller areas to explore, rather than one extremely large area like Skyrim or Fallout 4. The combat is probably my biggest criticism, but the dialogue, characters, story, and world-building are so fun. This is one of the more enjoyable RPGs I've played in recent years and I'm so excited for the sequel!. Such a great game. Please let this be a huge success and give Obsidian a loads of money to continue this series!!!!!. This game has enough of the Obsidian charm that made New Vegas so amazing that it will keep you invested for at least one playthrough. The gameplay is fun enough, the companions and their quests are incredibly fun to explore, and none of the characters feel flat. However, it is unfortunate to say that the world that Obsidian has built just isn't anywhere near as interesting as the Fallout universe. Everything feels more or less generic, and I feel that they should've leaned into exploring a more wacky space genre to make the game unique. On top of that, the game is a bit on the short side and there aren't nearly enough side quests. The main story doesn't really have many options for how it can go outside of two different ways. Ultimately, there's not enough content to satisfy me giving it a higher score than 7.. I've played this game twice now, one prior to the DLC, and another attempt with the DLC. I will say that the DLC does add some additional context the overall story and background. I think that this game has a lot of pros and cons, and if they can fix a lot of the negatives the second game that they make could be really great. Pros - The voice acting is amazing. I would say it's probably one of the best in awhile. For me, voice acting is important, as it really can make or break the story, and for a RPG like this, it's critical in order for a game like this to be successful. Great voice acting was necessary in order to really establish halcyon and it's decline. Most notable are for the characters of Parvati and Vicar Max, they really help provide background lore and emotion. -Dialogue and choices, I do like how it's tied to your overall stats and that there's different ways of completing some tasks, like through dialogue checks through lie, persuade, intimidate, or through skills like intelligence or perception. Now this can get repetitive at times and sometimes it doesn't really feel like it changes much. -Combat- generally good for the most part, like that you can bring two companions along with ya, and they have special abilities, you're going to want to spam their abilities to help in battles - Quests- Most of the quests don't feel like a waste of time. You'll be able to skip or just ignore the quests that are obvious filler quests too. Not many fetch quests which is a good thing, but there are few. Also cool that there's also companion quests which is a cool addition Cons -Weapon and Armor variety. This was disappointing, for a game that takes place in a different system, like where's the crazy or unique stuff like ratchet and clank does well. Armor was even worse, as it's the same few types of armors with recolors. Armor didn't feel like it added any abilities other than just higher number means better. The mods you could add, don't feel rewarding -Lack of bosses/enemy variety- it's basically mauraders, guards, and a few creature types, and robots. That gets repetitive after awhile and I felt like that they could of added more enemy variety. Even with the DLC, it doesn't correct this shortcoming, and is rather disappointing when it comes to the climax of these DLCs and fights. -Music- This is more a personal preference for me, but I think music really can help a game be even better, and this game lacks good music. Rather disappointing. - Gameplay length- Short without the DLCs, but with the DLCs it makes the game better in this regard. About 30 hours of gameplay with the DLCs. -Perks- Really boring and didn't feel like it makes a huge difference. Doesn't give any sort of excitement when you level up. Actually to me it felt like a chore after you level up with having to put points into your abilities and pick perks. The flaw system was a cool idea, but it again ties back to taking a flaw, thus negative penalties, so you can pick a perk as a tradeoff, but again the perks are boring and bland. Overall, I think this game is worth getting, I recommend getting the DLCs as well. I would say for me this game is like a 7/10 for me, which is a good score. Can't wait to see what they do for the second game for this series.. OMG!!! Bioshock+Fallout in open world! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!. The Outer Worlds is a fresh face in the open-world RPG genre, which has stagnated in recent years. The Outer Worlds has fun, exciting companions and unique settings to explore. While the game leaves you wanting more, what you do get is fun, fresh, and keeps you hooked to the end. I absolutely can't wait to see more from the franchise.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Set in an alternate future in which large corporations have begun to colonize space and terraform alien planets, the player character is revived by a ‘mad’ scientist known as Phineas Wells, and it’s not long before you soon become embroiled in solar system spanning politics and conflicts. A cross between Fallout and Mass Effect, The Outer Worlds never quite lives up to the best in either of those series in terms of narrative or weight of the decisions you’re forced to make, but it is still an enjoyable action RPG that fans of the aforementioned series will no doubt enjoy.. I liked the story. Colorful setting. Planets were awesome and most sidequests were as fleshed out as the main ones. RPG mechanics were well done in the first half as well. But mediocre dlc, along with forgetable antagonist, with most companions not being as well written as Mass effect, with rough gameplay and lack of replay value, I cannot see this game being remembered as one of obsidian's goats. But it still a solid game that should be checked out at a sale. It is basically a more polished semi open world version of cyberpunk 2077 and fallout 4 with better rpg mechanics but worse story, gameplay and characters.. Outer Worlds is a really nice game with awesome story and nice dialogue, a really nice rpg's mechanics and much better than Fallout 4. But in the other hand have some problems, at normal difficulty the combat system is really easy after just 1-2 hours with a lot of ammo and powerfull weapons, i died for the first time after 10/15 hours probably, the secondary missions are really good scripted and nice stories. It's not the best game in the genre but it's fun for sure.. Occasionally fun but often mundane, The Outer Worlds seems to miss more times than it hits. The writing is consistently good, with a reasonably engaging story and some likeable characters. It's let down though by frustrating and repetitive gameplay that really grates by the end. There is simply not enough variety in the areas, enemies, weapons or story beats. The loot system is irredeemably awful with every area stuffed full of the same crates full of the same junk. You have to ask yourself how any play tester could have said clicking on boxes for hours on end was ever fun. It seems to just be used to pad out the play-time. The world is also strangely lifeless with a lack of cutscenes or animations outside those of NPC's. You never see any ship land or take-off, ones in the sky are just static objects, there are no real set-pieces and the world itself never seems to change dynamically. Although I enjoyed some aspects of my time with the game it's hard to recommend.. The game is painfully unfun. If you think Fallout is a fetch quest heavy game, get ready for this. Loading screens that make ps3 skyrim looking snappy. Allies are either boring, cringe or even more stupid Rick Sanchez.. Great game. Limited by it's small scope but enjoyable nonetheless. The expertly written characters and stories keep you hooked. Discovery of different locations and characters that can give you quests also makes this game enjoyable. A lot of these quests are interesting, though a bit too short as compared to other similar games like the elder scrolls or fallout. You're always pushed to keep on doscovering in anticipation that you'll stumble upon another character that you can form a bind with and that will give you an interesting quest to complete. One shortcoming is the limited scope of this game. Compared to other similar games like fallout or elder scrolls, quests and storylines are too short. This means they cannot be built up to have the far reaching consequences that elder scrolls and fallout games can build up their quests to have. That said, the quests that you do have in the outer worlds are all still expertly written and enjoyable in their own light.. boring game, it was similar to kingdoms of amalur. i played it for over 30h and i dont get the hype seriously. No idea how this game has a high user score. Outer Worlds is dreadfully boring. I went in with minimal expectations other than wanting to like it. Somehow I was still terribly disappointed. Absolutely pointless, disappointing world building, disappointing recycled elements on most worlds, repetitive monsters.. A good game but a little bit formulaic. I enjoyed it but I would not play it again and id stop just short of recommending it.. Feels like a fallout game, but on a smaller scale. Powered by the Unreal graphics engine, the environments are very rich and colorful. Game stability is also very good; few if any glitches for me. I really like the ability to have 2 followers as well as the witty interactions between them. Overall I really enjoyed it, and am looking forward to playing the expansions.. Game impress first, but after three hours of playing it will disappoint you. I expected more intelligent AI in 2019. after two hours of playing i understand why skill ""+25% damage if you alone"" was added to game. They can just stay aroud you and do nothing or run into heart of fight and die in seconds. 0 points for balance with **** (7 real). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not going to be too brutal here but it's not for me. I find the environments and characters to be quite bland and after about 13 hours in I can't really bring myself to get over being bored with it to finish it. I love similar games but this one is just boring the heck out of me.. The Outer Worlds is an amazing rpg. The crewmates you pick up have good dialogue and personal quests, the ship you get is amazing and reminds me a little of the Serenity (Firefly, a tv show from 2002 was an admitted inf","the game delivers enjoyable RPG experience, despite a few notable flaws . Unlike many sprawling, open-world games, the game keeps a more streamlined pace . the story is great, the gameplay is fun, and the characters were cool ."
"1,105.Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered","Looks and feels like a PS4 pro game with adaptive triggers. The world is empty and bare. Dialogues are sooo long and uninspired.. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is a gorgeous version of an already stunning game. The story was captivating from start to finish and the variety of enemies and their moves keeps combat refreshing. I’d have liked it to of incorporated some features of the sequel such as the grapple device and the improved rock climbing but I understand that l this is more a graphical upgrade more than anything else.. This is one of the best exlcusives to PlayStation’s name and now it’s available to PC players which is a big win. I initially waved this game off and came back to it and was so glad I did. It’s a lot of fun exploring, meeting new characters, and doing the side content doesn’t feel like a slog. The sequel is also amazing and while the remaster trend is a bit strange, this game is well worth the money for anyone that is on the fence.. Horizon zero dawn is a great start to the series and only gets better from here. Alloy can be annoying at the start with her over confidence. but she grows rather quickly. The game is a little to big for lacking quick acess to travel. Since its fairly late game when you would unlock the unlimited fast travel pack, and the ability to call mounts at any time.. Horizon Zero Dawn remastered for $10 upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this purchase over 50 hours of gameplay.. It's still Horizon Zero Dawn, cab't go wrong with that. It's just that the PS4 version already looked fantastic, and still does, so instead of upgrading things that needed a refreshment, like the user interface, they just slightly upscaled the graphics, yet you still need a side-by-side comparision with the PS4 release to make out any barely noticable differences. Just seems like another lazy Sony cashgrab, seeing as the PS4 version already runs at 60 FPS on PS5 and has a permanent price point of 20€/$ yet this version retails for 50€/$ with minimal changes. Wasted potential I'd say.. The Game itself and story remain fantastic.. however the original version is perfectly good, this seems like a cash grab! Get on with new games instead of pointless remasters.. Difficult to rate this version. The graphics are much better than the old version but we feel tired. For former owners of the PS4 version, it is best to avoid it. But for someone new to the game, they might be interested.. Hello ! Having never played any Horizon game before, I decided to take the plunge after buying this remaster at a great price. And what a discovery! After 69 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say this is one of the most breathtaking games I’ve ever played on PS5—visually, it’s a masterpiece. The story is engaging and well-paced, with a heroine who feels relatable and deeply compelling.This remastered edition is truly a benchmark in quality. The reworked assets, improved lighting, and enhanced textures make it feel fresh and modern while respecting the original's essence. It’s not just a graphical upgrade—it’s a complete celebration of what made the original **** you’ve never played Horizon before, this is the perfect place to start. Even for returning players, it offers enough polish and nostalgia to warrant another journey through this incredible world. A gem that will undoubtedly be remembered in gaming history. Highly recommended!. I was hugely surprised and impressed with Horizon Zero Dawn back when it launched on the PS4. It has a standard Ubisoft open world formula, with quests, collectables, hunting/crafting and combat/stealth.What impressed me most with Horizon, is the premise/over-arching plot. Which reminded me of what I liked about the original Assassin's Creed games. What I didn't like as much was that the gmae felt like it was trying to be an RPG, with needing to level up experience points, many different NPC characters that have different dialogs that ultimately lead nowhere, incredibly unlikable main-quest characters, and a fairly repetively gameplay loop. However, the more I played, and pushing through the initial grind, and the more I leveled up the character, and the more I unlocked the skill tree, the more enjoable the gameplay became. Also, once I realised that mots NPC dialog was completely superflous, and didn't affect gameplay at all, I stopped trying to talk to every character, and sped up the dialog scenes by pressing X after reading each sentence. The game stopped feeling quite as arduous and less boring. I also enjoyed the combat a lot more. So once the remaster was announced and with a cheap upgrade cost I jumped at the chance. I was even presented with the new game plus relay option as I'd previously beat the game. So was excited for a less grindy, and upgraded experience this time around.However, once the initial cut scenes began something felt off. I looked up a comparison video on youtube, of the original vs the remaster, and the remastered scenes seemed worse at times. Overall though, the game seemed mostly the same, and the textures has been improved so I carried on my re-adventure. I bathed in the great over-arching plot, wishing there was more to it than just a few holograms and audio recordings, but alas it was the same in the original Assassin's Creed which I equally love.I skipped a lot of the unecessary NPC dialog, and because I already had a lot of the unlockables from my last playthrough figured I'd enjoy battles more because I already had good gear. This ended up not being true, I enjoyed the combat much less on this playthrough, constantly running out of ammo mid-fight and having no way to find the resources needed without having to lose all the progress of the quest so far. Despite having good weaponry this time around and knowing how to look for enemry weaknesses and change ammo to combat it, each fight felt a long drawn-out chore. Also despite having levelled up and unltra rare weapons, its regularly only took a few dozen health off enemies with tens of thousands hp. Once I got to the Frozen West DLC parts of the island, meeting again wit hthe FireClaw enemies, I'd spend hours fighting, and dying against fireclaws with health that never semed to go down.I would often recall the Horizin themed levels in Astro Bot and miss their fun and simplicity, over having to feel like each battle in the real Horizon was a completel grind. Despite the fact that the combat felt like a constant grind, the quests throughout the game felt dull and uninspired assassins creed knock offs, and the dialog through the game was embarrassingly boring. I still ended up loving the main plot of the game and wish more was done with it. Horizon Zero Dawn has the building blocks of an imcredible series and great story. If some of the grind can be reduced, and the quests more interesting this would be one of my various series.I've yet to play the sequel so still hold hope they made the game feel less grindy and more fun.. A very great remaster. They improved the graphics quality. It is true that it is less than the Forbidden West, but it remains one of the best remasters I have seen. Thank you, Gorilla Games.. It’s a solid 7, perhaps even overrated with that already. Characters are cool, Story is top and production value pretty good. But that doesnt make a game, perhaps a good movie…and doesn’t change how super mediocre and generic the gameplay itself is. I am playing it my first time and am really disappointed tbh. First i thought this is what a good assassins creed should/could be with some more love. Than i realized beside the story it’s nearly identical and super formulaic. Not sure why this game does not get the hate ubisoft games get. The whole map is **** full with icons. And sad that the gameplay is so super mediocre…since i really love the world and story… That said, the game didnt need a remaster and is hence not worth full price of $50. Next time just make a movie, and don’t waste my time. That said, i fear i will never finish this game which should lower the score even more…. Considering that I received this for 10 bucks, the difference is pretty damn amazing. Especially running on a PlayStation 5 Pro, but that is definitely not required. I love this series and while I did not ask for this, the upgrade price was reasonable enough for me to recommend this to anyone who already owns the base game. Just the same and overpriced, Sony just collecting money for pay Concord and other disasters .... I’m playing this on PS5 Pro, and the game is fantastic. Not sure why the user reviews are so poor. I loved the original on PS4 Pro, and this is pretty much the same game but with more enhanced visuals. It’s a worthy $10 upgrade if you loved the original. If Sony was charging full price with no $10 upgrade, I would’ve felt differently. If you didn’t like the original game, then skip this one. Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West are among the best games on any platform. I’m really enjoying the replay with these enhanced graphics.. Very beautiful remaster! I wasn't sure about it until I got into the game, but it is totally worth!. HZD Remastered looks AMAZING on the PS5 Pro. It was always a superb game, but of all the ones I’ve tried on the new hardware so far, this stands out at the top. Well worth the $10 upgrade. They did more motion captures and put a lot of work into this. It is not just the same game with boosted resolution or something. Definitely check it out.. If you've never played Horizon Zero Dawn play this version. The dislikes just seem to be people disliking another remaster (which i agree with this games not even that old) but judging if i've never played the original PS4 game. This will not disappoint.. One of the best games got even better! Spoiled by its successor I now will more gladly also spent time playing this remaster.. The only reason I’m recommending this is IF you already own it , they are charging 10 dollars for the upgrade. Another reason is if you do not own this game buy it , it is one of the best games on PlayStation! They put a lot of work into the remaster , so give it a try for 10 dollars if you already own the original it’s worth the price! I’m sure it would look jaw dropping on ps5 pro I have yet to try that!. On PS6 we will have Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster Remastered... Big developers are already creative zombies, unimaginative and uninspired.. No one asked for this. No one needs this. The only reason this ""remaster"" was made because the guy running Sony Interactive Entertainment now was the head of Guerrilla Games.. The original isn't old enough to warrant a remake. This is just an attempt to sell the same game twice, the money would have been better spent on something more useful than this.. The remaster of Horizon Zero Dawn is a technical masterpiece pretty much like the original game itself back on PS4 release day. It pushes visual fidelity to an outstanding level, just ever seen before in Forbidden West. One of the best game ever was crafted returns as a true „nextgen“ experience. Nixxes has made a fantastic job.. Horizon zero dawn is one of my favourite games in recent memory and this is the best version of it. It looks amazing and in performance mode is smooth as silk. Loses a point as it's a re-master and lost theimpact it had in 2017. The game itself is great, no problems with it. I'm just tired of getting Remakes on games that aren't even considered old games. Like everyone else said if you never played the original go play this version.. There was no real need to remaster this so it's basically a money grab with some new bugs thrown in.. We don't want to play the same game again and again. Sony should bring new games not REMASTERED... I think the original Horizon Zero Dawn holds up VERY WELL graphically and this remaster wasn't needed at all. But there's nothing offensive about this game either so I don't know why anyone would review bomb this game. It's just a 10 dollar upgrade for better graphics imo. Unfortunately many bugs at a point to close the game continuity only 10€ worth as upgrade don't buy it normally it's a waste of time also they could do a better job on accessibilitys. While I agree this is a remaster that not many were requesting for, it is nonetheless a masterpiece remastered by the best upscaling studio nixxes, and really breathe a breath of fresh air into a 2015 game. Everything looks so great and photo realistic now. This game will always be one of the best in my heart.. So I see some Xbox fanboys review bombing this game and its very sad to see how someone can be so sad about their console being dead last in every topic. But now to the game it’s good but we didn’t need a remaster but the graphics are stunning, gameplay is stunning. The quality and the amount of work invested in this game is incredible. Nixxes team added a new layer of coat to an already remarkable game making it one of the most beautiful looking games this generation. All of this, combined with an intriguing story and amazing gameplay, makes up for a perfect 10 for Horizon Zero Dawn once again.. Wow. The entire horizon franchise just blows me away! I fell In love with zero dawn and the Frozen wilds, and forbidden west and the burning shores are on the exact same level of perfectness! I literally can’t describe how much this world means to me, and it will forever stay in my heart!️. Graphic upgrade is awesome, one of the best remaster this gen. However, it crashes a lot.. orizon Zero Dawn Remaster is a stunning upgrade that breathes new life into an already exceptional game. The graphical improvements are nothing short of amazing—it's impressive how close it feels to Horizon Forbidden West in terms of visuals. The landscapes are more vibrant, character models are sharper, and the overall aesthetic is just breathtaking.When the remaster was first announced, I was a bit skeptical about whether it would be worth the investment. However, having played it, I can confidently say the upgrade is absolutely worth the price. The enhancements not only make the game look fantastic but also improve the overall experience, with smoother gameplay and refined mechanics.Even if you’ve never played Horizon Zero Dawn before, this remaster should be an instant buy. It’s a perfect entry point into the franchise, showcasing an epic story and an immersive world. The remaster honors the original while elevating it to new heights, making it a must-have for both newcomers and returning fans alike.. Horizon Zero dawn has a really special place in my hearth, this was my first game on my old PS4 pro. I really enjoyed the game , and now years later i think the 10£ upgrade for PS5 version absolutely worth the price ( its like a McDonalds meal for 1) I have to mention , obliviously is a remastered game ... they added new character models , high quality textures ... etc, but the old PS4 version still is a beautiful game ,if you see the compression videos you can see the difference. No surprise , if you liked the original version you will also like the remastered.. Best game I’ve ever played, we get nothing on this level on Xbox. It looks 10000x better than our only game this year on Xbox Hellablurry 2. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10$ for Forbidden West Quality is fair enough. Back in PS4 days, i didn't have chance to play Frozen Wilds DLC. I was planning to play only dlc but when i saw the visual quality, I'm very impressed because whole game is looking phenomena. Then i decided to play it all over again from the beginning. My eyes are fascinated with these masterpiece like looking visuals. Forbidden West was visual masterpiece and i can say the same for Zero Dawn Remastered too. Since my playthrough, i couldnt focus the story because most of times i use photo mode lol Its quite similar to second game's photo mode and imo the best in the industry. Thanks to greatness of Decima Engine and talented people of Guerilla Games, i find my self in this beautiful world of Horizon again.. The number of good and sensible remasters can be counted on two hands. Horizon: Zero Dawn has become both. There's no new content, but everything that made the original so good can also be found here - just in a dramatically improved visual form. Being able to rediscover the world alongside Aloy in this way should also make the new edition interesting for connoisseurs, but there is also no better (or nicer looking) opportunity for newcomers to get into the ever-growing franchise. The fact that owners of the PC version are not offered a cheap upgrade is pretty much the only annoyance in this otherwise wonderfully prepared modern classic.. Excellent ignore the stupid regular grifters saying stuff. Nixxes did a great job on improving multiple aspects that makes it really great! The originals story excellence still shines and the work they did on mocap and additions are well worth the upgrade. Again this is an fun hunter vs hunted combat with great options, world and story. Aloy is still great and now things feel even more vibrant. You all gotta ignore the people on here that trached the burning shores dlc for stupid reasons.. I've played the PS4 version of this game about ten times, and I'm happy to come back to it because everything is even better. dialogues, staging, graphics (best looking game ever, i'm serious), everything is sublimated, it's absolutely fantastic. Definitely not a needed remaster but I am glad we got it! It is not perfect yet has some glitches here and there and a few crashes when teleporting but the game is very optimized and polished!. Actually, there was no need for a remaster because Horizon still looks great on the PS4. Graphically, however, it is almost a remake as the graphics have been improved so magnificently. Horizon Zero Dawn remains an audiovisual masterpiece that everyone should have played.. Its beatiful. It was beatiful before and it is now even more. I understand that not everybody likes aloy being a little 'unsexier' but its still just Aloy and she is still great.. Beautiful remaster but It was completely unnecessary because of the second part.. Amazing game. I remember buying my PS4 pro for it. Remastered in amazing way. It looks amazing on my PS5 can’t wait for my new PS5pro that will be released next week to play it there too.. A Beautyful Remastered Game. Still a Top Game. The Game feels overall better than the original and there are no Bugs.. An excellent Remaster, wich is more a Remake! The work did on it is Great, and just Awesome for $10. A fabulous remaster of an already fantastic game , more like a remake in places a must play for all scifi fans. Horizon Zero Dawn was a really good game and this has been remastered much better than I expected, with newly added mechanics, properly working game optimization (ps5) and eye-catching graphics, providing a great experience.. Amazing game! So much work has been put into this remastered version. Anyone that has not played it are in for a treat. Definitely worth every penny…huge upgrade from the first…especially characters and the landscapes…this user score should be higher smh. They should call it Remake. Also the HDR is one of the best in the industry. The game itself is now better than ever. 10/10.. Even better than the awesome original. Improved many things like conversations, sounds and graphics (look Digital Foundry video). Dual Sense support is also very nice. 10 bucks upgrade is a no brainer and for new customers 49 bucks is a fair price.. Horizon zero dawn remastered: for a 10 dollar upgrade its more than worth it, they have redesigned the sound audio and for the dualsense controller. Plus the graphics now are are more gorgeous, more accessibility features plus the characters how they act are much better than the original, also there's an update so you can upgraded on PS5 pro too. I have played it back when it was released back in 2017 on ps4 and i played a bit on my ps5 to see the deferent between them and the remastered is much more better.. this Is a worthwhile upgrade and brings all the bells and whistles to an already great game, but with just more polish. this game is beautiful and completely immersive. Worth the small price to upgrade and you can see the difference. Game runs smooth and is a blast to play.. Playing this on my PS4 pro and comparing it to the PS5 (non-pro) - its night and day, bringing the first game up to par with the current generation. Considering, having the original ps4 disc version and upgrading for just £10 was great as there's the Wilds DLC which I didn't buy for the original PS4 - its a bargain just to have the DLC let alone textures, resolution, framerate all seem to be great. I've played it on ""favor resolution"" option as I want to see it at its best and I could not notice any framedips - I need to look at it again via my LG tv so I can see what framerates are being pushed out - it seems like its 60fps but it might be only running at 30fps - I cant tell, its just nice and smooth. A load more options for gameplay that will save some time such as skipping the pick up animation. Graphics are vastly superior to the original version, real crisp and clean and sound seems better than the original though I have to try it with my headphones to see if the 3d effects are working. Overall, for £10 - buy it, if you've not had the original HZD version, buy the remaster, its cheaper (costs £55 so cheaper than the full price to start with which is always good) and get into the wonderfully immersive HZD - good story, 2nd game follows that through with bigger and badder machines and I can't wait for the 3rd game. A good investment for sure.. Go away xbots and pc nerds with your anti psn agenda. This game looks amazing.. This is insane. This looks like an entirely new game tbh. Definitely one of the best remaster we have got in the last decade, right up there with The Witcher 3 Next Gen update.. I'm playing it now and I can already pass it. In the previous one I stayed in first place and I left, and now that I'm playing it I'm really enjoying it. Sometimes I just stand there looking at the landscape or at the machines.. One of the best remastered in history for just 10$, i get many people want other remasters but that doesn’t mean bomb reviewing this game because it deserves 10/10. They have done it again. Having played the original on the PS4, seeing the visual upgrade is truely stunning. The gameplay and story was always exceptional but with the upgraded looks just screams next gen.. If you are a fan of this franchise, this is a good time to play this adventure again, with impressive new visual effects and improved features. But on the other hand, if you are new to this adventure, the remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn is the right choice to start and enter the wonderful universe of Horizon.. At this point after 5 hours - it is simple THE best looking game as an open world. For 10€ it is master class. Would be a 10/10 if I would discovered the game. But really SOLID 9! Thx Sony!. Really wish these salty console warriors would stop review bombing games they can’t get all the time. Especially cause they can’t even afford to buy games so they instead have to rent them through Lamepass! Horizon: Zero Dawn remastered is the definitive way to play the game, and it may as well be a remake with all the graphical updates, and 10+ extra hours of motion capture that was done for this remaster. The best part about this remaster is that it can only be played on the best console to ever **** PlayStation 5!!! And soon to be played on the even more superior console……The PlayStation 5 Pro!!!. Did it need a remaster? No. But if you enjoyed the game and are eligable for the $10 upgrade and are looking to touch it again, it's 4 hours in outside of two loading bugs the game has looked good and played smooth in performance mode.. Another high quality remaster from Sony. Of course like every remaster or remake it’s the same old “this didn’t need to be remastered/remade” or “it doesn’t look any different”. Firstly if you say it doesn’t look any different you’re either trolling or you need your eyes checked. The differences are clear as crystal. If you don’t like them that’s one thing, but don’t go around spreading misinformation and if you it didn’t need to be remastered just stick with the original game? As I said it’s the same old, same old repetitive cycle of nonsense every tine Sony want to remaster one of their games. It never seems to happen with other publishers even though the arguments can easily apply. Just compete anti-bias towards Sony like always. /endrant. Before I begin I would like to say Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone. This “remaster” however is completely pointless and should’ve just been a free patch/update. Instead they’re charging 10 bucks (or 70 bucks if you don’t already own the game on PC or PS5) for what essentially just a slight graphical polish. Sure the graphics for the remaster are better than the original. The problem is that the difference isn’t nearly noticeable enough to justify its purchase or existence. It’s not like the Gears 1, Medievil, Demon Souls, Halo MCC, Xenoblade Chronicles 1, Starcraft 1 etc… where we got significantly noticeable graphics improvements and these games were on consoles that were old enough to not have any BC with the consoles of that time. Sure maybe not perfect but there were reasons to warrant it. Instead we get a remaster of a 7 year old game that changed nothing but minor graphical improvements that are unnoticeable unless you do a side by side comparison with your eyes 6 inches in front of the screen. Sony could’ve remastered or remade games like Ape Escape, SOCOM, Syphon Filter, Resistance, the first two Littlebigplanet games, Jak and Daxter, Warhawk, Folklore, Lair, Heavenly Sword (assuming that’s still a Sony IP), Loco Roco, Patapon, Wipeout, Sly Cooper and so many other games. Instead we get a remaster to a game that’s not even a decade old that wasn’t even given much effort into it. Is the future of Sony just nothing but barebones sequels to PS4 games and pointless remasters barely anyone asked for? So far the PS5 has been a joke with only 5 worthwhile games and every new IP they’ve brought forward is a flop. Unless you like playing broken unoptimized garbage like Destruction All Stars and Returnal that barely anyone has played.. This easily could have been a brand new expansion pack instead. Perhaps from the perspective of someone other than Aloy? Perhaps a prequel about backstory of Rost when he was young. The possibilities are endless. And to top it all off, it doesn't look that much different from the original. A complete waste of time for both developers and players.. While the graphical upgrades are good and noticeable, the issue stems from the fact that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered feels pointless on four fronts. The first is that Horizon Zero Dawn's PS4 version is still on the Playstation Store, at a cheaper price, with all the DLC/expansions. The second is that copies of Horizon Zero Dawn can be purchased through retailers such as Gamestop, Amazon, and eBay for cheaper. The third is that PS4 copies can be played on PS5 (with slightly lower graphical fidelity, and slightly worse frame rate, but it's not the end of the world, if you ask me). The fourth and final reason is that there are other games that would have been better to port to PS5, and would have benefitted from the graphical and performance uptick (such as the inFamous games, or Bloodborne). It's not a bad game at its core, but given that Horizon Zero Dawn is 7 years old, give or take, and still looks very good, I think it was a pointless remaster. Not as pointless as Last of Us Part 2, but still not really necessary. At least if you own the original game, physically or digitally, the upgrade is only $10.","this is one of the best exlcusives to PlayStation’s name and now it’s available to PC players which is a big win . it’s a lot of fun exploring, meeting new characters, and doing the side content doesn’t feel like a slog . the game itself and story remain fantastic, however the original version is perfectly good ."
"1,106.Super Street Fighter IV","Wonderful! Even though they have now stopped making games for the 3DS, this one is a must own for any 3DS collection, most especially street fighter fans. There’s a huge roster of characters to choose from. The controls are tight and can be customized to your preference, including mapping special moves to one of four touch screen squares. The 3D feature is gorgeous and doesn’t strain the eyes. Bottom line, you won’t be disappointed with this one. Thanks for reading my review!. The graphics seem to be almost as good as PS3 and Xbox, but only 480p. This game is a really solid port, it is not missing any features. Controls could be better, but having supers ready at the touch of a button is good for beginners too. A great portable option for people who can’t get enough of sf4.. Game: Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition Genre: Fighting Developer: Capcom System: Nintendo 3DS (3DS) Total Score: 82/100 Value Score: 8.2/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 7/10 • Music: 8/10 • Length: 7/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 7/10 Pros +Game allows ""Pro"" or ""Lite"" mode - Lite mode which allows you to do special attacks and combos with a push of a button on the touchscreen while pro mode allows players to play the game like a traditional SF game +Stereoscopic 3D Support +Ability to move from 2D view to over shoulder view +Figurine collection mode with the ability to trade and receive via Street Pass support +Gives option for non-players to play with the owner of the game (limited mention in cons) Cons -Due to the fact its on a portable, control scheme may be more difficult to control than a traditional controller -Option for non-players to play with the owner limits them to playing as only Ryu and only on the Training stage -Sound is inferior to the console versions. It's all the glory of SSF4 on the go, sure the backgrounds are static in comparison to the PC and X360/PS3 versions of this game, but the actual character models are a step above most games found on the 3DS, an absolutely fantastic port of such a huge title onto the little screen, the only slight issue is the controls, going from 4 shoulder buttons to a single pair of them can take some getting used to but that said, you can bind the missing controls to the touch screen and be happily mashing out Ultra finishers online on the toilet!. The game itself is good. But it's probably the most uncomfortable experience I had on 3DS. I own a N3DS XL, and still, the D-pad is much too small to play Street Fighter on it, a game that needs precision to correctly input the moves. Playing with the stick is even worse. My advice is to save your money and your thumbs, and play it on another platform.. How the developers fit this game on the 3DS is beyond me. It looks, feels and plays like it's big brother counterpart on consoles and PC. Truly amazing. The 3D effect is nice but not necessary and doesn't really add or indeed detract from the game. Not tried the online abilities, in fact i've turned them off as I am strictly a casual single player that likes to dip in and out of arcade mode making my way through the difficulty levels. This is particularly relevant as the hardware design of the 3DS is not conducive with comfortable long playing session, this can be improved with a grip case but the experience can never live up to a dedicated controller or fight stick, but then this is a portable version. With all the characters included from the off there's plenty to keep me going as well. In short, this is personally the best portable fighting game I've ever played.. I Love the street fighter series it is one of the best fighting games in my opinion. I Picked up this game in game for £9 so I was lucky it was on sale, the game is definitely good but to be honest it was not really the street fighter I was expecting. Street fighter in my opinion is all about mashing buttons but with the ability to just tap on the screen to use a move in this game it just felt a little too meh to me still a decent game. Street Fighter IV is still one of the best fighting games around for current gen even after all these years. Truly an amazing and addicting game. This is probably the best ever Street Fighter game ever made. Its a blast to online and on the go, this one is a must have for all 3DS owners to try.. game boring, awful damn gameplay and terrible agent could do inves combos so stay apentando the small screen to make the combo is so boring game a disaster. I just say This is one of the best ports of the 3ds But the touch pad ruins everything Yeah, is cool for the new players in street fighter and is useful to do ultra combos But make some characters like Honda, Blanka and Guile op as hell Sometimes the fights are full of lag. Street Fighter was the reason I bought a SNES and it was also the reason I bought a 3ds. The best fighter on Nintendo just got better. Plenty of options, online, 3d mode , and the list goes on. Over 3 years since it was released on 3DS and I'm still playing this one on a regular basis. How many games on a handheld have that kind of lifespan ?. This is probably the best console to portable port i have ever played, everything feels just as fluid and entertaining. I recommend this port to anyone who likes fighting games and has a 3ds. definitely the best 3ds launch game. The 3ds is a little too small for bigger hands, that's the only problem I can really find with it. It's a fighting game, what do you want? A story review?. I'm a gamer since 1993, and i always prefered Tekken over Street Fighter but in 2014 (i know am a bit late since this was released in 2011) I had a change in heart the only stupid thing is the cutscenes that i couldn't take seriously [e.g. Dudly drinking tea with his boxing gloves on, or Ken in the hospital wearing the same karate clothes while his wife giving birth to his child] .. anyways Gameplay 10 Graphics 10 Sounds 9.5. I had never played street fighter before, but this seems like the best one. I'm not that good at it, but everything is so balanced and well-executed The soundtrack rivals SSB Brawl's, and the graphics are stunning for a 3DS game. If you don't buy this, you don't have the right to call ****. It is almost perfect. Probably the best fighter on a handheld at least in my opinion. This game has great visuals, good soundtrack, a very balanced roster, a suprisingly good story mode and a unique mode that allows you to fight 3D while in 2D (if you played this version of SF4, i think you know what i'm talking about). I spend countless hours in this game, more so then any other 3DS game i have so far (Pokemon Y is reaching it though). One of my all time favorite fighters.. If when you think ""handheld fighting"" you imagine half-assed ports of better games, think again. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition is the real deal, featuring a massive number of playable characters and a complete roster of moves. Yes, there are less animations, which can be especially disappointing when you're fighting in front of a non-moving, open-mouthed hippo. But even that is easily overlooked in face of how smooth a transition this is. The main problems of the game are actually the ones present in every version: uninspired bonus stages (mere rehashes of the SFII original ones, which weren't thrilling to begin with), illustrations featuring grossly exaggerated muscles, a few bad storylines. Of course, these are all details, and none of it is ever going to dampen the sheer amount of fun to be had from the best fighting game to be ever released on a handheld.. This is a good port, but not great. I have played the pc version and the xbox version and they are far superior. The graphics here seem dead and frozen and the character models are okay, but not amazing. The big advantage here is the portability, so if that's important to you, then this is worth it. multiplayer is very under developed and not rewarding, so don't count on it alot.. This is a good fighter game, and I think a 7 is a bit low... but an 8 is too high. I got this after already having DOA: Dimensions, and the latter is definitely better in my opinion. The backgrounds in the fights don't move, and the fighting is very simplistic. Once again, these are just my feelings after having played DOA for much longer. It's a solid fighting game though, and online mode is enjoyable.. This game is really good, i love playing this game on the train or bus and the online is also very fun. The game also looks great on the 3DS. SSF4 is by far one of the best fighting games on the 3DS.. A solid fighting game, nonetheless it's a downgrade from its console counterparts and since the WFC its not the best for supporting frantic multiplayer, you will experience most of the times some lag.. A fighting game worth buying ! It has incredible graphics and 3D effect is marvelous ! The online multiplayer is great ! Nothing more to be expected then a good old side scrolling fighting game !. The game is fantastic, dynamic 3D view mode is very detailed. The attacks look great and should not envy anything to the home console editions. Yoked so that this game is not perfect is that scenarios are not very detailed.. This is a good game, mainly because I'm not a ""traditional street fighter player"" and know like no moves"", so they added moves for the touch screen, which is good. But unfortunately I've gotten bored of it because I'm bad at multiplayer and none of my friends have this game.. This game is the best portable fighting game to date. Although the game has forced touch controls, you still have the same game from the PS3/360 at the palm of your hands. Not to mention the great online and the fact that the game is in 3D. This is a must have for 3DS owners.. Super street fighter IV: 3D edition is an amazing fighting game with brilliant graphics & 3D, cool bonus features (including: barrel smashing and car smashing), lots of different modes (including: arcade mode, versus mode, 3D versus mode, challenge mode and more!), really good streetpass and great multi-player!. It is incredible to see a port like this in a portable device, especially because it does look almost identical to its HD counterparts!... The game is extremely addictive. Has by far one of the best portable online service... Achievements, Challenges and a lot of stuff to keep you busy!. Epic version of the game for the 3ds. Even though there is some lag on online play, it's understandable just like in all online games since online experience greatly depends on numerous factors. I traded my pilotwings resort for this game and I don't regret it.. The best fighting game on the 3DS. Graphically it looks alright and the 3D effect is used nicely. The fighting mechanics feel fluid and smooth. The addition of combo button commands on the touch screen make this a game that's easy to pick up and challenge others quickly. The online aspect is fantastic and you may immerse yourself in it for hours.. I think this a really good port for a handheld. 3DS has a good line up of good fighters on the system and this is one of the best they have so far. I have played a lot of hours on this game. It was the first game I picked up for the 3DS close to launch and I still think it is a great game. An awesome game for fighting genre fans.. this game is fun because you can fight with over 30 characters and battle in streetpass and sport pass and you can fight people around the world and collect stronger people and have fun. this game is pure addiction for the 3ds, has very good visuals, specially characters models and animation, easy controls lots of characters and online mode also i liked a lot its a 9 for me but i want to rise the average score. This game blew my eyes when I first started it up - it really shows off what the 3DS is capable of. Though perhaps not the best game to use the 3D effects even though they look good. Huge character selections, solid controls and some intense online fighting, you can't go wrong with this one. My only problem is having my hands cramp up while I play this, but then again, I have big hands, so I can't really knock the game on that one.. Super street fighter 4 on the go? yes please! Capcom did a really good job porting over their awesome fighting game to the 3ds. the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because i have trouble pulling off the moves with the d-pad sometimes and miss the joystick support of the 360.. It's Super Street Fighter 4, except portable. SSF4 is a great game, though the 3DS' analog stick isn't as accurate as a console's controler. The new figure collection feature is nice, and the game comes pre-loaded with the costume DLC. The biggest drawback is the once lively backgrounds have been turned into still frames.. After DOA and Blazblue came out, this still is the best fighting game for 3DS. From the arcade mode to the streetpass figurine challenges, playing this game never gets tiring.. This game got me in to fighting games. I used to hate them. Starting out with this game I was using the touchscreen buttons for the combos but slowly over time learned to execute all the combos the old fashioned way. I love this game so much I went out and got it along with an arcade stick for my 360. Can't wait for Street Fighter x Tekken!. SSF4 is an amazing port, with all the features of the original console version. All the challenges are there, and this version even packs in all the alternate costume packs that were available for purchase on the console versions. The graphics are brilliant, with only the backgrounds suffering from lowered textures, and also becoming static, but to be honest, does that really matter? You don't play fighting games for the background. The online works brilliantly, ditching the friend codes, and letting you play against anyone online almost instantly. There's always someone online, and you can set what type of people you want to play against in the menu, I.e, Amateur, Semi-pro. You can also collect figures of the characters to fight them against other players figures. The fights take place through Street Pass, and happen almost instantly. You get FP, the points used to get more figures, by playing Arcade Mode, fighting other people in Street Pass, or playing Online. If you've got a 3DS, or are planning to get one soon, SSF4 3D is one of the best launch games available.. Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition is a very good game. It has everything that is needed to make a good Street Fighter game. The 3D effect, while not needed to be up to the system's max, is not the greatest that could have been done, but when it is used, provides a nice addition to the game. The online functionality is very good, allowing for quick matchups and custom matchups. The controls are smooth and seamless, while being inviting to newer players. They may need to take some time and check things out, both in the game and in the manual, but it is a very good game. Though it has some minor bumps that could have been fixed and prepared for that launch, it is, overall, a great game.. I've never played the console versions so i don't have anything to compare it to, but this game is really good. I wouldn't say that this game is a 10 though like other reviewers have. it is a good game and was probably the best launch title available. the character roster is massive. I've never even heard of some of these characters before playing this game. the best part is that the old classic character are also in this game. my old favorites from the super Nintendo. i recommend this game to fans of fighting games everywhere. if you don't like fighting games why are you even reading this review?. Most people are in agreement that Super Street Fighter IV is one of, if not the strongest titles for the 3DS right now. This game is a perfect demonstration of what the 3DS is capable of, and how much fun the console is in general. Super Street Fighter IV is pure eye candy on the 3DS. The graphics look amazing and the 3D is executed beautifully. This game should right away assuage any doubts people may have about the capabilities of the 3DS. Moreover, the game is extremely fun and addicting. The traditional arcade mode will match you up against opponents until you reach Seth, a weird alien sort of guy who absorbs everyoneâ. Very good port of a very good game. Street Fighter 4 was a huge update for the series, and Super Street Fighter 4 added even more content to what was already good. The commands feel just right, and it's surprisingly easy to land special attacks. And it's a handheld fighting game we are talking about here. The 3D effect was very well used and looks beautiful in the 3D Versus mode, with an alternate camera angle. While the Story-Mode gets old, with a pretty cheap boss(especially at higher difficulty levels), the game has virtually infinite replay value, with online play. And the Street Pass feature is an interesting way to boost one's ego by beating randoms with their strategically assembled team. From my point of view, there are two major downsides in the game, which hold me from giving it a max score. The easy operation way of using the touch-screen should've had some sort of delay for using some special attacks. It makes it pretty annoying to face a Guile online, with the combination of latency and Sonic Boom/Flash Kick spam. Easily countered by changing the fight setup, thankfully. And the other downside, is the fact that we can't choose the spoken language from the characters. The English voices for some characters sound terribly overworked, and get old really fast. Get ready to hear things like ""I'll get my revenge"" or ""Profound sadness"" as KO speech from some characters. All around a great game, recommended to anyone with a 3DS.. For an old fan, Street Fighter might not possess and stand up to the hype due to lack of change from earlier versions, but if your a new player, and you need something to keep you going on your 3DS, this could provide you with 100 hours+ of brilliance and great engineering quality by Capcom.. Street Fighter 4 is a fun game for the 3DS. worth buying and has online multiplayer. There's no blood and the visuals are quite impressive. I've never played sf4 before but this is quite good. An excellent modern edition of street fighter. The graphics are great and its really fun playing against people online.. I played this game on 360 and found it pleasing and a fun online title, then i got my 3ds and decided to give it a go on my new console. Visually its amazing and the fighting feels almost intact except for it felt a little less fluid but thats understandable. But the spoiler of it all was LITE control mode which allows new users to tap the touch screen to repeatedly pull of advanced moves...this is good and well but not one person uses the PRO mode online so you get matches where someone will just sit there tapping their touch screen constantly so it becomes not a test of skill or a fight it becomes who can spam their touchscreen the fastest doing the same move over and over. I saw the option to accept only people to fight using PRO mode (non lite mode) but when i searched for someone to VS there was not one single person...i tried for a week and got 2 matches after searching for ages (one of which disconnected before he lost) so i took this game to the store and traded it in. CAPCOM should have made lite mode for offline only so ppl could not exploit it like this, so all in all if you want to play single player this is a great game but if you want multi...stick to PC, 360 or PS3 for this one. (unless you enjoy trying to out-spam your opponent). Great conversion, but in 3d mode the game only have 30 fps, and the backgrounds doesnÂ´t have animations. Great online, but I think n3ds could do it better!.. Probably the best launch game - which isn't saying much, but to say this is my first Street Fighter game I've properly owned I still found it an enjoyable experience. I've heard this version is quite simplistic from others in terms of pulling of moves, and I have to agree - from others I've played it's a much easier to control game - which isn't always great for most - the complexity of each of the character's attacks is what made the series so appealing to many but the automatic touch screen controls do bring newcomers more up to snuff with the big boys, which makes pros who've spent long hours mastering each technique a little cheesed off understandably - but for someone like me I had little quarrel and did try and not just to keep spamming the ultra-powerful moves and I did try and learn to play it properly! All the features and modes do work well though, it's a solid port from the current home consoles and the 3D effect does give a good (if subtle) effect. If you didn't like any of the other street fighters, little is going to change your view - as expected, the formula is pretty unchanged. But it's the best pick up and play game yet - and it's one most/everyone should have as their number 1 launch game.. Street Fighter fans can't do much better than this. On the small screen of the 3DS, the graphics are missing nearly nothing from it's console cousin, save movement in the backgrounds, but you're not playing this game to stare at the backgrounds. With the 3D effect turned on, the graphics almost seems to sharpen a bit, and characters look like tiny action figures inside the screen. The graphics also seem to run very smoothly all the time. This game seems to sound rich as well and features many different modes and challenges to satisfy whatever you're into at the time. I was particularly surprised at how well the online play seems to work. In many matches (played over DSL), the game only sputtered once, but it was barely noticeable. The rest of the matches seemed on par with something you'd expect to play on Xbox Live; very smooth and consistent. My only quam is that, for me, both the analog slider and D-pad feel like a bit of a compromise; but that is more of a hardware knock than Capcom's fault. In close, I would say that if you have or are going to have a shiny new 3DS, and don't absolutely hate Street Fighter, buy this game and don't look back. It's great.. If you're the proud owner of a shiny 3DS, this is the game to showcase what the system is capable of. SSF4: 3D Edition is easily the best looking launch title on Nintendo's new handheld. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find many differences between this port and its home console predecessors. About the only visual difference is the lack of animated backgrounds. If you've played a Street Fighter title in the past two decades, you'll be able to jump right in with no difficulty. But, Capcom has added a 'Lite' control mode for those of you out there with no prior experience with Ryu and company. 'Lite' allows players to configure and map certain special moves (Supers, Ultras etc.) to the 3DS' touchscreen. The result is a fighting game for both the hardcore and relative noobs. SSF4: 3D Edition takes what made the home console versions great and adds in a welcome dose of accessibility for fighting newbies. Great stuff.. This is my very first review for a handheld game, but better yet, its a review for a game on the newest handheld, the 3DS. The 3DS launch lineup really is a weak one, but the good news is that there are more games coming, and really goods ones too. Luckily, Super Street Fighter IV 3D is here to keep us busy until the good games come out. SSF4 really is the 3DS's best game right now, since games like Steel Diver and Pilotwings Resort havn't been getting good reviews. But this review isn't really about the new handheld, its about the game itself. So let's get started. The game is pretty much the same game as the console version of SSF4 on 360 and PS3. You've got Arcade Mode, which is the mode where you choose a character and go through a quick story sequence. You have VS Mode, where you can fight other players online or the computer. SSF4 really is an enjoyable game on the 3DS, in my opinion more enjoyable than the console versions. The thing that people complain about though is that it requires a little less skill than the console versions, because of the touch screen. The touch screen has short cut buttons to use your characters specials without having to figure out the button order and combos. In my opinion, that's a good thing. Because the fact that it's easier and requires just a bit less skill will actually attract more fans to the Street Fighter series, while hardcore fans can play the game normally with button combos without using the touch screen at all, since the touch screen is completely optional. But before everyone thinks, ""WHAT! Touch screen controls? You mean with the stupid stylus?"" You play the game with the normal buttons, and can activate a special by pressing a part of the touch screen with your finger, no stylus required. But what about the key feature to the new system itself, 3D? And how does it work with SSF4? Amazing. It's almost like you're looking in a window and watching the action in front of you, the 3D in this game is done better than any 3D movie I've ever seen. And of course, no glasses required. Amazing. I'll admit, after playing for about 30 minutes, I started getting a bit of eye strain from the 3D effect, but it wasn't too bad. After about a 10 minute break, I was fine, and I went right back into the game in 3D. But of course if the eye strain is too much for you, you can always turn the 3D off, or just adjust the 3D effect to your liking, so it gives a nice 3D effect, but hurts less. However, one advantage the 3DS version has over the console versions is the new 3D VS mode. The view on the battlefield is changed to a over the shoulder view of your character, kinda like DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi, except it's not a 360 enviorement. Obviously, this mode was added to take advantage of the 3D effect, and it works pretty well, but it can be alittle confusing at first. I personally preffer 2D mode in 3D, it's more classic, and isn't confusing. And the 3D effect is still great in 2D **** far as characters go, you get all the characters from the console versions, including the new characters that were added in the Super version, which is why it's called SUPER Street Fighter IV, not just Street Fighter IV. Overall, I'm not a big fan of fighting games, neither have I ever really cared about Street Fighter. But this game is a good exception. What really impresses me about this game is how they could port a 360/PS3 game to a handheld at all, and not only port it, but add more to it without downgrading the graphics. The fact that the 3DS got a port of a home console game from this generation pretty much shows what the 3DS is capable of. The 3DS, without a doubt, is far superior to that of the PSP, in graphics, power, and features. If you thought the graphics on the PSP were beautiful, wait til you see the graphics on the 3DS, WITH 3D!! Overall, Super Street Fighter IV is a nice launch game for the 3DS, and will definitely keep you busy until all the big 3DS monsters come out later this year. If you're getting a 3DS, SSF4 might just be your best choice for a first 3DS game. Super Street Fighter IV gets an 8/10.. This is the launch title to have for the 3DS. The best handheld fighter I have ever played. The backgrounds and characters look great and the 3D effects are some of the best of all the launch games. The ability to map 4 moves to the touch screen make pulling off your ultra combos easier since the four face button and two shoulder buttons are not ideal for Street Fighter in general but after playing for a bit you hardly care. Huge playable roster of characters and smooth controls round this title off nicely a certain must have for the 3DS early adopters.. SSF4 looks amazing on the 3ds and i can't stop playing it. Its great in short bursts and the online is fantastic! The 3d effect suits the game well and the controls are very easy to learn.. True to form, Street Fighter 4 3D is addictive, fun and the 3d works really well. Despite its average graphics in the console realm, SSF4 looks great on the 3DS, really proving its new processing power. Of all the games on the launch lineup, SSF4 and Ghost Recon are by far the best. The controls translate well to the 3DS and fights are smooth and really fun to look at, not to mention that the tilted camera angle shows off the 3D really well.. Graphically, this game showcases the power of the 3DS and the fact that it is basically the same exact game as it's PS3 and XBox 360 counterparts is a true accomplishment. However, one thing holds this game back, and that is the 3DS's design itself. Since Street Fighter is my favorite game series I figured that even if the controls were not up to par that I would at least enjoy the game. The problem is, half of the fun of this game series is mastering the input required to unleash your moves and combos, and with the 3DS's controller layout it is simply not fun. As a casual gamer, the touchscreen can make up for that fact but even then every character is severely limited which takes away much of your options. If you're a casual fan who is just picking this up to mash some buttons and beat up on some people, add a point or 2 to this score because at least the core game is solid. But as a hardcore fan who has played Street Fighter for 20 years, this was a day one return for me simply because of how uncomfortable it is to play.. This is a must have for anybody with a 3ds, the new contents makes it worth picking up. The 3d effects are amazing even when your playing in normal mode, it adds great depth to the game. it's not perfect but it's the best of the line up.. Super Street Fighter IV is an arcade like fighting game. It was on the 360 and PS3 and Now on the 3DS. If your going to buy a game for the first time on the 3DS then this is the game for you, It has a lot of lifespan and great online. The graphics are very impressive in the game, but they are tuned down because the 3DS can produced HD, and there are costs, no animated backgrounds but that is very minor in my point of view. The online mode is great, you can choose your character and fight other people from around the world and even better, on the go. I did have some lag in certain games but that is very minor. The controls are easy to learn, if your a newcomer then you can use the touch pad to press some moves that were hard to do on the consoles. Or you can turn it off and play like a pro. The 3D effects are not that much, it does work but you are pressing buttons and you will have a hard time looking at the 3D effect. I recommend that you don't use it, but that's up to you. SSFIV does have it's issues but this one of the best games to have at launch. A fantastic game.","the game is a great portable option for people who can’t get enough of sf4 . controls are tight and can be customized to your preference, including mapping special moves to one of four touch screen squares . the actual character models are a step above most games found on the 3DS ."
"1,107.City of Heroes","Glad to be back to my favorite MMO of all time. Has all the familiar bits and bobs of an MMO but puts a unique spin on everything. -Costume creator while aging is still incredibly powerful. -One of the most flexible systems of empowering your character in an MMO -Tones of player made missions and bases. -An incredibly powerful but equally clunky base (housing) editor. -A market centric economy where nearly everything can be bought with minimal to no RNG. Meaning grinding is minimal only for currency so you can just play to earn what you want. TLDR: Amazing game that aged amazingly well. Thank you to Homecoming for bringing the game back to me.. Man, I can't believe the best superhero game up to date was made in the early 2000s. When COH came out it was amazing and with each update, we got more and more features, by the time going rogue came out players were able to do things they could never do in any other game change factions in a unique quest chain which can get a hero to a villain and back based of your choice of missions. Your hero build could be totally unique selection of skill sets and don't let me get started on the hero editor which lets players build the hero they want it could have been a unique new hero or representation of an existing one. The other huge feature in the game was the custom scenario generation and the COH community did not disappoint some of the missions made by players were masterpieces that will remain lost. The story in the game and quests were fun and about average but we all know that is not the true appeal of MMOs, when it comes to MMOs it is all about the people you share your online experience with and the COH community is the nicest most openhearted community I've seen in a game, which was an exception for an MMO since most MMO communities tend to be very toxic and uninviting. The homecoming server did show some hope for COH fans but that will be over soon since NCsoft failed for a trademark application for COH2020 unless a miracle happens in court all privet servers will be gone once again.. The ultimate example of contrast between a great and enlightened developer and an avaricious, oblivious producer. For years City of Heroes pushed free updates of quality and maintained more than a modest amount of subscriptions. Unlike contemporaries, the game was much easier to pick up due to more intuitive gearing and much, MUCH faster gameplay than had ever been seen by the likes of Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, or Anarchy Online. The character customization was also orders of magnitude more complex than anything seen before. It was truly an evolution of the genre, and there was genuine artistic effort put into it. Then one day some suits that had never played the game in their lives (or any game perhaps) closed out the development studio for reasons that could be described as lunacy at best and malice at worst, unemploying tens or hundreds of people, rendering this product I spent over $100 on unplayable, and displacing a community of thousands of fans who will probably never play another MMORPG again, much less a soulless WoW-ripoff grindfest like an NCSoft title. Do not buy NCSOFT.. with a powerful character creator and a wealth of well written (if slightly repetitive) content, City of Heroes truly is a hidden gem of the MMO Genre.. Big thumbs up to one of the best MMOs nobody every played. This game includes a lot of features you wish you saw more in games, such as dynamic and settable difficulty, dynamic missions, a crapton of PvE and PvP arena and zones, time traveling pve missions, custom missions designing, heavily upgradable guild bases & associated raids and artifact control, real-time permanent order based auctions... also.. well, you get it. All this in a well made superheroes city environment, neat in-depth costumes customizations, a load of different superpowers, and generally somewhat good music! No really. This game is great. The only very big problem is that there's so few people playing it that three quarters of the features are unused, such as pvp arenas, and often the pvp zones... Hopefully you can still find people for some heroic coop action.. So far this game ****... although i'm sure itll be worth the wait... it has taken me six hours to get it started. first the installation... it crashes every 10 mins, i had to pray to keep it going the whole way through. then i had to update the updater (:P) and that took about 4 hours in itsself. after all of that i'm relieved and click the 'play' button, and a popup appears telling me to update my drivers or the game wont play... so now one day of my month of free gameplay is wasted!. The greatest and most addictive game ever. If you've ever wanted to be part of a hero comic book, if you've ever wanted to fight for truth and justice, or if you've always wanted to be part of a team that is unique and yet the same, then City of Heroes is for you. And if it isn't buy it anyway and give it a try.. Most MMOs out there deal with ""sword and sorcery"" and are fantasy based. Meaning they have elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons etc. But this game is most certainly a breath of fresh air for any jaded MMO Fantasy player, or just any MMO player who wants something different, or taking a break from the former. You start off with character customization. And let me tell you, I have yet to see any game out there that can beat the options available for CoH (one could say Champions Online, but it's basically the same type of thing). Create your superhero/supervillain with a magnitude of options. Choose his/her origin, archetype, and powers. You may change the way your avatar looks at any time at the local Tailor/Facemaker when the mood strikes you.There is no ""gear"" for you to wear in this game. Instead of the clothing and armor pieces to upgrade your character, enhancements take their place. These temporary/permanent boosts to your own abilities make you stronger with a particular power. They are always easily available at any Store or Auction House (known as Wentworth's for Heroes and Black Market for Villains), assuming you have the necessary funds to purchase them. You also gain special Enhancements through completing story arcs, or just picking them up while you fight your way through a mission. There are no ""drops"" in CoX in the traditional sense. All drops are automatically allocated to each player on the team, or just to you if you play solo. Instead of gold, or cash, currency takes the form in Influence/Infamy. As you progress through missions from your ""Contacts"" and defeat various enemy groups you gain influence/infamy for each defeat. This may seem slow at first, but let me assure you it adds up rather quickly. Especially when you work with a team. You also have the option of using Inspirations, (temporary boosts to your powers that only last a short time, but can seriously make the difference in a tight situation between dying and living), these are also available for a price but so very much lower than enhancements.Death has a penalty of course, as most MMOs do. It takes the form of experience debt. Seasoned MMO players will be acquainted with this system. It means you will have to continue on playing your missions and hunting villain groups as usual, only that half of the experience you earn will go towards paying off your ""debt"" until it is settled. Then leveling up will continue on as normal. Fret not though, just like influence/infamy it is paid off quickly enough, especially when on a team.There are many wonderful story arcs to explore throughout the game. You should love almost everyone of them. The bigger story arcs in the game take the form of Task Forces for Heroes, and Strike Forces for Villains. These arcs take hours to complete akin to dungeons from traditional MMOs, and usually require a full team to start. These offer up many chances to earn Influence/Infamy and plenty of experience points. And of course the prestigious badges. Badges are awarded through achieving certain milestones in your character's career as a hero/villain. You get them for defeating a certain amount/type of villains. For defeating titan like monsters that can only be bested by large numbers of characters. Completing Task/Strike Forces, attending special events, logging in during a celebration, exploration, and many others. Badges are not a requirement of the game, but they offer up a chance for something to ""go after"". Or simply just to one up your friends or show off to the community. There are also certain power boosts and special abilities you can gain from collecting a certain mix of badges. These are referred to as accolades. PvP isn't as strong here as I would like (at least back when I was playing; I've been told it's changed some since then). In my opinion, it's very unbalanced and in drastic need of an overhaul. But there are plenty of people who like it just the way it is. I think mainly because their chosen archetype is more built for PvP and they have the advantage. There are little in the way of rewards for playing PvP anyway. You of course can gain badges, influence/infamy, but no special enhancements to be had. The developers are keen to add new content updates every few months in form of ""Issues."" These are completely free, and usually offer up more costume creation options, story arcs, new zones to play in, and maybe a few new powers. All in all you will definitely love this game if you're into comics and/or superheroes. Creating your own personal character is very fun, and you will find it is easy to get attached to your favorite avatar. However, in my opinion, it is entirely possible to end up ""seeing it all"" in this game. Eventually collecting badges becomes boring, the level cap still hasn't been raised since launch, and not enough Task Forces or high end content are added to keep high level players interested. You should have plenty of fun though, but not forever.",glad to be back to my favorite MMO of all time . has all the familiar bits and bobs of an MMO but puts a unique spin on everything . homecoming server did show some hope for fans but that will be over soon .
"1,108.Pokemon Pearl Version","Awesome presentation but the gameplay is subpar, tiny regional dex and slow battles. It is challenging though which I do like. This was a special time for Pokemon. The first entry on DS, the first to use 3d graphics, a new generation of Pokemon that instantly became classics and one of the most iconic final boss battles in the franchise accompanied by an equally iconic soundtrack. A memorable experience.. This game is the cradle of my gaming career. As a child I couldn't even think about playing another game.. Genuinely a fantastic game and one of the best pokemon games ever made and I hope future pokemon games improve in quality. If you love Pokemon or serious role-playing, get one or both of these games. It is worth the single player features alone, but the wireless and Wi-Fi features are a great bonus. One more thing, when Pokemon Battle Revolution comes out on the Wii, you can play in 3-D with your DS as a controller and all around the world.. The game itself is actually solid, but the extremely slow engine detracts from the experience heavily. Nearly everything takes forever to do, from exploring the overworld to just battling in general.. A solid and fun pokemon experience with an okay central plot and a good balance of pokemon. It's a pretty classic pokemon adventure with some more interesting gyms and more overpowered legendaries, there isn't much to say.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing game that has great replay value. Definitely extremely nostalgic as well!. Another banger pokemon game. I had diamond, pearl, and platinum so I played through this bad boy 3 times straight as a kid.. Overall - 7.5/10 Difficulty - Hard Platform - PC Replay Value - 7/10 Gameplay - 6.5/10 Hours Played - 70 hrs Extra Notes: I played a soul-link vers. of this which was much more challenging compared to the newer games and overall personally one of my favourite Pokemon games.. To be honest I love Sinnoh. Dungeons, adventures, the league, creatures, lore. It was a revolution in Pokemon's world.. A major improvement over Gen 3 with Day and Night back, and being the first Pokemon games you can trade online with. However, Platinum and especially Heart Gold and Soul Silver make Diamond and Pearl feel really barren.. This game is an 8.5. I used to not like the game that much but that was because I mistook it for being a rehash due to the legendary pokemon being awakened. However that was also because I was watching my brother playing diamond. Eventlually I sat down, played it and really enjoyed it. Yes the game was slow *saving alot of data cough cough* but it was great. It had new mechanics like the underground, the story was decent for pokemon, the map app really helped out sniff those roaming legendary pokemon, and it was cool transferring pokemon over from ruby and sapphire. However another thing I don't like about the game is that you have to see all the pokemon to get to the post game but it was a new thing they tried so that's kind of ok. Lastly the music is great and I feel nostalgic about the game even though I first played it at 14 years old. Then again I feel nostalgic for mario and luigi paper jam and I was 23 years old.. This game is unquestionably an absolute classic, memorable soundtrack and just a solid pokemon experience. this was a great pokemon game for it's time. if you're reading this in 2021, don't buy the remake, it's just this game but with better graphics. the didn't improve anything.. Good old pixelated Pokemon games. First Pokemon game I have ever finished. Looking forward to the remakes. 8/10 Great.. The slowest game in the franchise, with one of the worst stories and dull ambient. This games really needed a third version as Platinum is... And Platinum did not fix all its flaws. There are better Pokémon games out there, this is just another Pokémon game.. Very good game with very good music. It has some things missing that were later fixed in Pokemon Platinum. You should still go ahead and play it, its enjoyable and I swear you'll have a good time. Muy buen juego con una excelente banda sonora. Tiene un par de cositas faltantes que luego se arreglan en Pokémon Platino. Aun así deberías jugarlo, es muy divertido y te prometo que pasaras un buen rato. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokémon Pearl was the first Pokémon game I played. I've played it on and off since getting it in 2017/18 and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The game features a roster of around 400 Pokémon to capture and battle with and a stellar story. However, there are a few flaws. There's very little outside content of the main gameplay and story features, and non-main content is often uninteresting and doesn't offer enough incentive to return to it. The only fun extra mode is a short local online mode that's a great time if you have nearby friends who own a Gen IV Pokémon game, but useless otherwise, and even then it offers no collectables for the main game. Other than that, it's your typical Pokémon game. Collect, train and battle hundreds of Pokémon and try to collect gym badges. It does very little to distinguish itself from other Pokémon games and is easily overshadowed by future releases. Not much to go back to if you own a modern game. But, it features plenty of amazing features as well. The gameplay is snappy, the story is great, and it nails the basics like art and music. If you're playing on a console from the original DS line the gameplay is smooth, but I've run into problems on my 3DS with inserting the cartridge. It may just be me, but it can take five or so tries to insert the cartridge before my 3DS can actually read the card correctly. The emulation itself is what to be expected from a DS game on the 3DS, but be warned if you're buying this game and don't have an original DS (Played on a Nintendo DSi and a Nintendo 3DS XL). While deeply flawed in its unorthodox pacing, its introduction of many classic Pokémon, its incredible soundtrack, serviceable characters and maintained satisfying gameplay loop makes for a solid entry into the Pokémon franchise.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My first ever video game. Superseded by pokemon platinum and has aged quite poorly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Compared to the other editions this game was a bit blunt. Walking around and fighting felt a bit slow. The map and also the soundtrack was kinda ""uninspired"". The Pokemon and trainer-designs weren't great either. It's still a solid game.. A good game: developed things from the gba games, underground was interesting if underdeveloped, went with a cold climate. If not for the horrid pacing, pokedex and being ""replaced"" by plainum in every way I would have way brighter memories of this game, but as every pokemon game, its still a good experience. A bit slower than it should be and despite having probably the best lore when it comes to the region and the legendary pokemon until that point, I feel the story could've been much better. Platinum is a better option if you want to visit Sinnoh.. Introducing tons of new Pokemon and ideas, Gamefreak proved yet again that they are one of the most consistent and reliable developers out there period.. Pokemon Pearl version is my favorite pokemon game hands down and the only pokemon game where I had more than 200 hours. The game was entertaining both during the main journey and afterwards. I spent hours in the mines digging and setting different traps. I loved making poffins with my sister and then doing contests. It very multiplayer friendly and just so fun in general! That being said, I would give it a 10.0!. 9.2 - A huge step from the GBA pokemon titles, especially finally putting in physical and special moves. Gen IV is great as well, Sinnoh region is diverse and well-designed, and legendaries are very memorable.. This game has some pretty good designs. (Lucario, Floatzel, Garchomp, etc.) The story was very good, the characters were too. The graphics were mediocre for a DS game, but still were tolerable. This game was a little repetitive at times, but was still a good game. Even after the champion there was still stuff to do. New animations were added, which made the game more aesthetically good. Overall, the game was really good.. Sensational, fun game with a story until good, but the main point goes to the fun, but I felt a certain imbalance in the wild Pokemon level, he found it very weak, but the game in general is good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Meh. That's all that comes to mind when I play this game. Honestly, it feels like generation 3.5 then generation 4. The battles are sluggish, uninteresting. The same can go for the entire game really, the game's pace is way too slow for me. The only thing I can complement this game for, It's the online play, the new pokes, and the music. Dat music. But other than that, nothing else. The game's painstaking slow pace is the reason I can't play this without getting extremely bored.. A great addition to the Pokémon series, it was not so great as a successor to the acclaimed third generation of Pokémon gaming. Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl boast a more back-to-basics plot of a villainous team seeking world domination for pure power and worship. The game recedes beyond its predecessors by allowing the formula to become tired and less engaging than ever before. Routes that feel as if they're a never-ending natural hallway, in a region that couldn't be more primitive. The pinnacle of the region is the labyrinth of Mt. Coronet. Main setting for the climatic plot, it perhaps boasts the most fascinating aspect of the fourth generation snow! Besides the point that the new Pokémon creatures were largely unnecessary additions to older characters, the side-gaming through Super Contests have gone from fun to a tedious chore. Altogether with a less stellar soundtrack, the fourth generation was a generally plain addition to the franchise.. It's the same game over and over again, since Pokemon Red. Yes, it's one of the most fantastic games ever, especially as a child. But repeating the same game over and over should be deemed immoral in a sense, especially because children are actually gullible enough to keep buying it. It's a great game and you can't go wrong with it, but please buy Pokemon Red and get the same, original and better experience.. Pokemon has continued to dominate handheld gaming since its debut and this is no exception.. the first game i ever got for the ds was pokemon diamond and i enjoyed it.......i have chieved so much in that game **** was then that i got this game stolen a few years later from a 25 year old person named jeff.....well to be exact he said he lost it......months later he finally decides to pay me back woth a yu gi oh game that **** compared to **** game itself was so bad it probably couldnt make it to the black market......i mean seriously i lost all that hard work for **** was then that one of mybfriends was generous enough to trade me that horrid game for his **** i enjoy that game and find it rather **** i cant be beat in download play except maybe now and **** only you didn have to cheat to get some of the exclusive stuff in the gam...... Pokemon--the series--evolves. But old little problems remain unsolved. The Good: Wi-Fi! Night and day! Poke Radar! X-Scissor, U-Turn, Bug Buzz! Poffins! Underground! Slathering honey! Shellos! Munchlax! The Bad: Lazy touch screen... 2D-GBA-like monsters... Poketch... Dressing, dancing... ""Saving a lot of data..."" The much awaited 4th generation of Pokemon games has arrived. And everything fans expected is here, like trading Pokemon and battling through Wi-Fi connection with real people all around the world, seeing day turn into night and so on with a real-time clock working just like in the GBC, around 100 brand new monsters (including new babies), new ways for the Pokemon to evolve (some of them unpredictable), and all that stuff we already know (you may like it or not). But little problems still make the game experience a little tiring. As always you start the game in a small town receiving your first pokemon from a professor and your adventure goes on as you become a trainer. You must search for new Pokemon species intending to fulfill the Pokedex and also capturing and raising them through battling other trainers to challenge the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four. This storyline is still the same since the 1st generation of the series ten years ago (and it really has no need for a change); but things evolve, and some little problems were left aside because the developers fear major changes--or just because they are lazy. What is better in this new generation? Wi-Fi is awesome, but it was almost an obligation; day turning into night is great (and beautiful), but Game Freak is just apologizing for not including this in the 3rd generation games; splitting all kind of moves in special type or physical type is an important change, and it's a good improvement in battling strategies; good new moves--especially the bug-type ones since bugs always needed stronger moves; Poke Radar (for Pokemon searching) is cool; digging and seeking other trainers in the Underground is funny; slathering honey in the barks to attract wild Pokemon is great; making Poffins using the touch-screen is a fair step ahead PKBlocks; new interesting berries effects; and East Sea/West Sea Shellos rocks. Almost there? There are little things that were supposed to make the game better, but... They just don't work that fine. The graphics in the towns are great, beautiful 3D buildings, etc. but what about the monsters? Why they look just a little better than in the GBA? The Poketch is a good idea, but most of the apps are useless or buggy. When you're battling other trainer you can just touch the move you want your Pokemon to use; but when you need to know the power or accuracy of a move during the battle you need to enter the Pokemon screen, and then select the ""moves"" page. Come on, they have an entire screen to display that info! (At least they should put a little ""info"" button beside the ""move"" button just like Nintendo did in Brain Age's training menu.) And why managing items is still annoying when you have a touch screen? I would like to exchange items between my Pokemon by just dragging the item here and there, but I need to select ""Pokemon"", ""item"", ""take"", then select other ""Pokemon"", ""item"", ""give"", and search for the item I want to give (it will be in the last position in the list since it was the last item that entered the bag... and I must roll all the scrollbar over until I can get there). Shouldn't it be more simple? And some other... tiring things. Crossing Mt. Coronet through cave and blizzard is unnecessarily unforgiving... Contests are much less technical than it used to be... Dressing? Dancing? I bet girls like it. Not me. :P ""Saving a lot of data...""? Are they kidding me??? And why they need to ask ""There is already a save file. It is OK to overwrite it?"" all the time? There is just one save slot! And (last one) it should bring more options to accelerate the battles, just like in the Advance Wars series, for instance. I don't like to play a game for about 150 hours and see that 50 hours were spent slowly reading ""The sandstorm rages."", ""Roselia is bufetted by the sandstorm!"", mumble, mumble. (My suggestion: a system with arrows poping up and down quickly for poison, hail, leech seed, swift swim, etc. At least as an animation option.) Kinda sad for me to say I think it was my last new Pokemon game. The series needs a serious update regarding pace before it starts to feel hopelessly dated.. Whoa, whoa!! What's the difference of selling the same game with different titles? You disappointed me, nintendo.... A Super Game With An Intense plot. You See, in this game, you are a trainer who goes on a journey over a region. there is a new villain group called team galactic who want to wake up either dialga or palkia with the use of uxie mesprit and azelf. So go on this great journey and find yourself in it.","a solid and fun pokemon experience with an okay central plot and a good balance of pokemon . the game itself is actually solid, but the extremely slow engine detracts from the experience heavily . a great pokemon experience with an okay central plot and a good balance of pokemon ."
"1,109.Blaster Master Zero II","Blaster Master Zero II improves greatly upon the controls and abilities from the previous game. The abilities while in the vehicle are pretty fun to use, but where the game shines is the sub areas. The sub area controls were improved greatly, with a new mechanic being added to make you feel much more powerful. These controls and abilities are amazing, a huge step up from the previous iteration. Unfortunately, the bosses and levels are worse than before, which takes away from this improvement. They aren't bad bosses, but most of them are somewhat boring. With the exception of one of the later worlds, the levels are simply mediocre. The exception unfortunately is really bad, it has a mechanic that ruins what was otherwise a cool concept. As for the DLC characters, Copen is a blast to play as. I would consider him a must buy, his abilities are really fun to use and you can play through pretty much the entire game without using your vehicle. Empress is still fun, but I'd only recommend buying her if you really enjoy the game. Her abilities are rather limited, forcing the vehicle to still be used for navigation and certain fights. She's pretty fun to use in sub areas fortunately. Overall, I enjoyed this game, though not quite as much as I enjoyed it's prequel. I recommend buying the first game first, and then jumping into this one if you enjoyed it.. Blaster Master Zero II is a... blast to play. The game had me so engaged that I binged through it in two days (playtime around 11,5 h; I like to take my time and exhaust all the dialogue and whatnot). Inti Creates really improved on the first game in just about all respects! Especially the difficulty has been hugely improved. The game is just the right amount of challenging, containing boss fights that made me die multiple times but feeling rewarding once I beat them. Your weapons have strengths/weaknesses against certain enemies, so you need to choose the best strategy/weapon combination for each situation. Some ideas introduced in the game, such as combining primary weapons with their optimal elemental damage subweapons, felt a little bit underdeveloped, when there exists the highest level gun, which provides a decent all-around weapon for the vast majority of encounters, so I wasn't that compelled/forced to experiment with other combinations too much. At least in this game the best weapon is a lot easier to lose compared to the previous installment. In addition to the improved combat over the first game, I really liked how there were quite a few puzzles, some of them really clever, to provide some variation to fighting. The story is still pretty predictable, like in the first game, but has more depth to it and there is more of it. The new characters are quite tropey and are left rather underutilized and underdeveloped, but I enjoyed their dialogue, regardless, and also mostly liked their designs. Jason and Eve, the ones you play with, naturally get the most attention and spotlight and have quite a bit of enjoyable to read dialogue, which drives the story forward and builds their relationship. One of the new characters introduced in this game does get a bit more exposure and goes through a more thorough, albeit rather predictable character development arc. Overall, the story isn't anything amazing, but interesting and entertaining enough to give the player something to look forward to when he or she progresses in the game. But it's the rock solid gameplay that really takes the spotlight in this game, combined with crispy visuals with beautiful pixel art and an energetic soundtrack, which while being good, I didn't unfortunately find quite as catchy and memorable as in the previous game. In short, if you like fairly challenging metroidvanias with great audiovisuals, I highly recommend Blaster Master Zero II.. Blaster Master Zero II is a great follow-up to the remake, which if you enjoyed; you will certainly enjoy this one. For the most part, this one is pretty similar to the first game with some improvements in game play, and a change up in formula with the areas. The game has great pixel art, a great soundtrack, and fun (if simple) combat. All in all, I spent around 9.5 hours in total with Blaster Master Zero II, and I had a blast with it.. If you're looking for a casual metroidvania style game, then BMZ2 is probably for you. Gameplay is easy to learn as you progress through the game in either a side scrolling tank called Sophia or in a top down view of the main character Jason. There is plenty of weapon variety in this game with all the megaman-esque weapons that allow you to progress through the various levels. The art style is great and the music is retro which might cater to your taste. I found most bosses I could beat in the first try and that is the only reason why this does not get a higher score from me. This doesn't take away the sense of accomplishment you get as you progress through the game whether by sticking to the main quest only or exploring extra planets where you can buff your character with extra life, weapons, etc. This is a game that doesn't take long to master but for the price is well worth your time.. Blaster Master Zero II is, unfortunately, not a game I can recommend. The first level, Planet Florence, and the level that follows presents all of the game's core concepts -- Its premise, its combat, its traversal mechanics, level select system and exploration elements. The game opened up with all its ideas firmly in place, then left me to ponder in which exciting directions it would go from there. The problem is that I was left pondering this for the rest of the game, all the way past the final encounter. All of the core ideas are barely touched upon, and all appeals the game could count on remain half-measured. Its premise? At first it piqued my interest, and drove me forwards with its sense of urgency. However, the game couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to portray the situation as urgent or if it wanted you to take your time. Interactions with characters are unfulfilling. They for the most part just feel like side-characters in some episodic Shonen anime; Jason says hi to them, a fight happens, and then Jason goes to do something for them 'cause he's such a nice guy. And... nothing more to it, really. I wanted to interact more with these characters, really get to know their story; but there's just nothing to it. Its combat? You get a few new weapons. Most of Sophia's are impractical for most of the fighting you'll be doing; one would probably just stick to the default weapon. To the game's credit, Jason's part of the combat is honestly rather fun, with his arsenal offering so many different ways to handle each situation. He gets just enough options to keep his side of the combat engaging; too bad everything that isn't combat just isn't fun for Jason. The bosses are easily the highlight of the game, with them asking to think smartly about how to fight them and really getting to know your options. Its traversal mechanics? You get only one power-up that makes it a slight bit easier... and not by that much. Nothing you get in this game re-contextualizes how you go through levels; power-ups act as clearly-told keys to some obstacles, and that's about it. The levels themselves don't do much to reward players for understanding their layouts. No clever shortcuts here. It makes backtracking through these levels very dull later on when the player is tasked with doing so. This also ties into its exploration. World map? It's kinda neat. Some of the games' most striking moments happen on the world map. I didn't really expect it to go any further than that, even though there is some room for more; but regardless, that's by far the lesser concern here. Passing mention to the extra contents of this game; requiring about half an hour of fetch quest busywork to be rewarded with... honestly the most obnoxious segment I've played in any modern game. The overall result is a game that, to me, felt like it was going to get good any minute now; but it does this far too late to justify the mind-boggling amount of waiting for it to happen, on all of its appeal fronts. In that perspective, I simply cannot recommend this.. While the first Master Blaster Zero was a nice nostalgiac trip with a cute, if simple, plot, it seemed a a bit lack-luster and the combat was easily trivialized by just spamming the most powerful gun upgrade in the dungeons. This sequel has greatly revamped the dungeons, with each of the weapons serving different purposes, and most enemies having a specific one they're weak to, added a fast-paced pseudo-parrying mechanic with a few different flavors to suit your preference or situational need, and expanded on the puzzle elements, though they're still very simple puzzles. The overworld is completely broken up into different planets, planetoids, and ships scattered throughout space, which helps add a better sense of visual distinction and separation, though it does make the backtracking a bit more tedious compared to the first game's inter-connected main world. tl;dr -- the dungeons are way better, the combat is faster-paced with reworked gun upgrades and the new parrying mechanic, and the overworld has been split up in ways that are mostly for the better. The plot is also a bit more involved, with side-characters to meet along the way, and more variety in boss battles both in the tank mode as well as in dungeons. If you liked the first game and just wanted a bit more depth, you'll love this sequel.. While I enjoyed the original Zero remake, I found slightly lacking. Zero 2 on the other hand is like 3-4 times better. Beautiful pixel art and great gameplay additions that really increase the fun of it all (serious improves the game). New original beautiful music in the classic Sunsoft style and a great new approach to structuring how you access areas. For 10 dollars this is a must buy. I'd even recommend skipping the first game if you're unsure of the series.","where the game shines is the sub areas . with the exception of one of the later worlds, the levels are simply mediocre . overall, i enjoyed this game, though not quite as much as I enjoyed it's prequel ."
"1,110.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light","Happy to see Lady Croft brought to life in a different way with an old school twist.. The game kicks off by giving you a history lesson from the overtly and borderline offensively English Lara Croft talking about old relics and typical Tomb Raider type things, this is where you find out about the “Mirror of Smoke” which she has been hunting. This introduction sets you up nicely thinking that you are going to start off trying to find a cool relic with mystical powers; I **** you not as soon as she has finished describing it she starts the very next sentence with “I finally found it!”. What the hell!! Don’t set me up for an adventure and then snatch it away from me, not cool guys!! Along this process of pictures and sound (I refuse to call it a cut scene but I’ll get into that more later) you are introduced to a warlord named Vasco, he snatches the Mirror of Smoke and unleashes all manner of literal hell as an ancient battle that was frozen in time breaks out around the group. It is then you are also introduced to Totec, the other protagonist of this little adventure. I hope this isn’t just me but his voice bugged the hell out of me, not because it was annoying but because it sounds so familiar, it really pissed me off that I couldn’t figure out! Now it’s your time to take control as your thrown into the action and told to use some of Lara’s bombs to solve a simple little puzzle, I’m not too proud to admit that I failed at this as I didn’t pay attention to the instructions and I ended up just jumping around the room until I pulled my head out of my arse and figured out what needed to be done. Remember in the description when it said that the visuals were shown through an “isometric view”? Well, welcome to the real world son! Isometric view is the technical term for birds eye view which essentially means that you spend the gameplay looking down on Lara and Totec like some form of, well, bird I suppose! I don’t normally go for that sort of thing but in this case it actually works out quite nicely and the angles don’t get in the way which is always my biggest gripe with fixed camera angles. The gameplay itself is actually pretty good, its a simple case of move the right analogue stick to aim and pull the right trigger to unleash the sweet kiss of death from the trademark pistols. They may have taken Lara Croft and stripped literally everything Tomb Raider from her but at least they had the dignity to leave her with infinite ammo in the pistols! As this is technically a platform it means that there is a scoring system for each level and so the levels there is glittery **** strewn Lara Croft GOL 6all over the place; sometimes they appear when you break an item or kill an enemy, sometimes there just there for the sake of being there. They aren’t actually mentioned during the game and it is never actually explained what they are but subject to video game law; anything that glistens is important and therefore must be collected immediately! Pretty quickly into the game you are given a chance to play around and experiment with some of the techniques your going to be using a lot through the game, whether they be using the grappling hook to get across large gaps of using your magical golden spear as a stepping stone to reach higher places. Oh and also, you get given a magical golden spear which in all honesty is pretty damned cool! The next mandatory item in the play book of the platform game is collectables; there are a few different collectable in the Guardian of Light world and they are actually serve a purpose as you use them to upgrade your powers and weapons and stuff like that. The storyline itself is a fairly basic one and it’s decent enough but what they have done very well is to break up the gameplay in 2 ways. Firstly, on every level you are given a couple of level specific challenges that allow you to unlock extra relics and power ups. They have also scattered Challenge Tombs in each level, these challenge tombs involve using the skills that you’ve learned along the way and if you get it right not only do you get to survive but you also get a few extra goodies, ya lucky thing you!. This game is in a similar vein to baldurs gate on the PS2 and other top down co-op dungeon crawlers, the puzzles aren't to taxing, though there are some extra challenge tombs to mix things up for extra powers, the gameplay is most enjoyable in co-op, in fact this game should only be played co-op, it is an experience meant to be shared. If you've got a good friend to come and play it at your house or over xbox live then I recommend egtting this game.. Launch issues aside and despite having little to do with the Tomb Raider universe itself aside from borrowing the main character, Lara Croft, this game ranks in the top-5 best XBLA titles ever made alongside other greats such as Shadow Complex, Limbo and Bionic Commando Rearmed. Essentially, the game features a fixed isometric camera angle as you explore dungeons, caves and jungles in single player or two-player cooperative mode. The gameplay is a mix between twin-stick shooting action, platforming and physical puzzle solving, such as trying to get both your players across a pit, navigating a bolder through spike traps and others. The closest comparisons are the older Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath games, but instead of RPG elements and swords you get guns and more refined platform/puzzle solving elements. Additionally, each level contains mini-challenges such as collecting a certain amount of red skulls, completing sections under a given time limit or destroying x number of items. By completing these challenges you're rewarded with new items, health, ammo and ability upgrades. In all, this is an incredibly great game that's enjoyable both as a single-player and co-op experience and features a long campaign, plenty of bells and whistles and a nice leaderboard that all combine to provide a lot of replay value. The only downside is the game can be kind of glitchy at times, but even those moments can be pretty hilarious if playing with a buddy. In all, stop reading this and go at least try out the demo!. I for one loved Legend and Underworld and before this game came out, I was really worried that it was going to be a second rate Tomb Raider game. Those feelings quickly passed when I started playing the game. I haven't played a game with a ""top down"" view in a while. This game was a ton of fun! Great action with all the puzzles that you would expect from a Lara Croft, Tomb Raider game. The variety of weapons and power ups that you can use was also impressive. Not only did I play this in single player but it was really fun to co-op and play it with my wife! Yes, my wife! LOL! She really liked it too. It was nice to play a game that had co-op that you could play together on the same console and not just on-line. For a DLC game, this was awesome. The graphics were good, the controls were tight, and the sound was great. The only thing lacking a bit was the story. Overall, this is a very fun game to pick up and play.. Just completed the game and had a tremendous amount of fun playing it. I was initially skeptical of the isometric viewpoint implemented in ""Guardian of Light"", but as soon as the game got going those fears were quashed. The game controls tightly, and the puzzles are presented here as not momentum-killing storyline obstacles, but rather reward missions undertaken at the player's discretion, unlike previous games where one would constantly find progression halted by increasingly exasperating mindf**ks. The graphics are top-notch throughout, with a ton of verticality; you'll find yourself pausing occasionally to marvel at an area far-below that you cleared a half-hour earlier. The challenge spikes some towards the end, as you'd expect, but it's not a deal-breaking amount. It's a great downloadable title. For $15 you'd be hard-pressed to find as fun a game.. The graphics are pretty average. Gameplay occasionally has some interesting puzzles but most of them are basically ""go here, pull the lever, watch the camera pan over to a door and run through quickly"" there are a few nice tense moments but overall can get a bit repetitive especially as its been done so much before. I actually felt like I played this game before the way I steamed through it because every puzzle I have done in some form or other before. The story isnt anything special and the voice acting is pretty poor. The sound design is also pretty generic and doesnt really stand out much. This game is far from a 10 on originality alone but the fact there is still no on line co op 2 months after it came out is a big loser for me. I may come back and bump the score up a little higher when they finally update the multiplayer co op to be online because its not something I have experienced as I live out of town and generally out of convenience it is me visiting my mates rather than them coming all the way out to me where theres no pubs and clubs and the average age of the women is about 72. Its quite hard to tempt them round to play some split screen XBLA reboot title of a previouslyl dried up franchise which I would have to say to them ""may or may not be good I havnt played it with anyone yet"" Until I experience more than half the game its not going to get more than half the score. This 3 is out of 5 for the singleplayer. When they finally release the multiplayer online and the dlc Ive heard about then I may come back and rate it higher if Im not playing RUSE or Halo or FIFA or something too much.. This game is very good, the best game that has came out of 'Summer of Arcade', The game is very unique. The fixed camera, birds eye view type look on the game and the shooting system blend very well together. With small mini tasks using grapples and many other tools in your arsenal. The games co-op is very well built taking advantage of each characters strengths and weakness. For example Laura's jumping ability and Totec carries spears which Laura jumps on. Overall the game is very good and shows potential for a squeal.. Lara is back and kicking some serious butt. Excellent puzzles, excellent action, exellent everything. This is pure tomb raider. If you are a fan of the series, this addition is essential.. I am really surprised they made this downloadable. For the price it's a steal. Great graphics, music, story, and overall it's Lara Frickin' Croft, back in action. Highly recommended.. She's still hot, the puzzles and graphics and music are still super good, the plot is good, the weapons are fun... it's pretty much all you could ask for with a Lara Croft game. Really cool sort-of-bosses and epic battles. A little on the easy side, which is the only drawback.. Not very often do you find a game like this as a downloadable title. Between the exploring, length, and the lasting appeal, this is worth every penny of the $15 you spend. I personally spent almost 30 minutes on each every just exploring. For those who like to find absolutely everything, you'll see yourself playing the game more than just once. Hopefully, this will be supported strongly with the 5 planned updates without a long time in-between releases to keep people busy. The reason this fell short of a 10 was because of the cheesy dialogue, and some gameplay mechanics that I had some problems with. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a cheap, good time.. This game brings back the core of what Laura Croft was always about. High Adventure and LOTS of fun. Crystal Dynamics have brought Laura back with a vengeance. Outstanding!. Very inventive co-op play. Laura and Totec are not simply different skins; the manner in which players use character's skills in each room lends itself to one of the most ""cooperative"" games ever. It is also quite lengthy on a first playthrough (I was very far from beating many of the time trial unlockables!). However, there some major problems with the game: the isometric view sometimes makes it difficult to tell exactly where a floating power-up is, too many side-rooms rely on inventive uses of Laura's grappling hook (and only rarely Totec's spear or shield ability), combat is generally unsatisfying, and the story elements of the game have as much subtlety as a Saturday morning cartoon (Totec's voice really does sound like a staple cartoon voice actor). Additionally, some puzzles are just annoying, even after you've found out what to do. One puzzle in particular requires split-second reflexes from both players... After at least twenty attempts, it was a frustrating experience, to say the least. Overall: If you have someone to play through this game with and like the idea of a dungeon crawler with intense puzzles, this game is excellent and easily the best arcade game this summer.. Lara Croft GoL is the best game that crystal dynamics have ever made ... i'm glad i bought it , i wasn't sure because of the isometric view , if your a bit scared to get it then DONT BE because it is the best game EVER :D 10/10 !!. Who would have thought that there's be a great, inexpensive Lara Croft game after the series of craptastic releases over the last 7 years or so? This is just a great time.. Lara Croft is finally back where she deserves too be, in a great game. Guardian of Light might be a new direction for Miss Croft but she sure seems to enjoy, cunning puzzles, numerous enemies and some really nice detailed environments, oh and there is also a 40ft fire breathing dinosaur. It just goes to prove that you dont need high rendered graphics to make a great game these days. Check the Croft out.","happy to see Lady Croft brought to life in a different way with an old school twist . the game starts off by giving you a history lesson from the overtly and borderline offensively English Lara Croft talking about old relics . you are introduced to a warlord named Vasco, he snatches the Mirror of Smoke and unleashes all manner of literal hell ."
"1,111.Midnight Club II","Although I believe that the game is dated i still think that it is worth a try even 21 years later!. ""Midnight Club II"" is a slick arcade-style racer from Rockstar Games. Its sense of speed is amazing and the races are intense. This game is super tough, but never feels frustrating. There are plenty of modifiers which keeps the action fresh. But unfortunately, there are no licensed cars or customization options. Despite its shortcomings, MC II is still a worthy sequel. I would rate it with an 8.1 out of 10.. Way on the arcade-y side of driving, but you can't tell me you see the cover and don't get ""Silver Screen"" stuck in your head to this day :P. i like the dark atmosphere reminiscent of this horror game, the vehicle damage physics and especially its simple and fun gameplay Hard game. I just don't give 10 because the game is hard.. Played the demo for this game a long time ago and Immediately got the ps2 version and I had a blast I never played a racing game that immersed me and made me feel like I was an illegal street racer. Definetly a must play!. ""Midnight Club II"" was Rockstar's follow-up to ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"". A big improvement over the original game, it still lacks many elements that would appear in the next two entries. While the sense of speed is amazing, the game is super tough. Races are difficult, but that just makes your hard earned victories all the more satisfying. I remember this game came with a ton of online modes and modifiers. Unfortunately, it does not feature any customization options or licensed cars. The story mode isn't that great either and the music is disappointing. But despite its shortcomings, the game is pretty good. It's one of the better arcade racers for the PS2. I would rate it with an 8.4 out of 10.. One of the games i played as a child on my ps2. I remember getting it and playing it for like 10 Hours straight. It starts easy but can get really difficult to finish. It has a great soundtrack, fairly good graphics for the time and the cars feel really good. Not particular realistic but fun! But **** you Rockstar for taking this game of steam :). My favourite Racing Game of all time. It's perfect in every aspect and fullfil what i desire in racing games. I recommend the PC version more than the PS2 version.. The game certanly evoluetes by the first chapter: a storyline more detailed, introduction of offical musics and a better system of control and racing in general. But it lacks sometimes that make you say ""Incredible"".. One of my favorite racing games of all time. The characters, the vehicles, the **** of it excellent. I absolutely loved this game. It's my favorite of the series, and is likely my favorite racing game in general. The handling in this game is a dream, the car selection is excellent, and the locations are full of life. I love being able to actually hit pedestrians, which no games in the series have done since. It adds more things to do with friends as well. Me and several friends have gotten together and spent a whole night trying to mortar each other and pedestrians with the SAVETHEKIDS cheat. The campaign is my favorite in the whole series and had very memorable characters and races. I still know all the shortcuts around town and can hit them perfectly. On one side, I didn't like that cars weren't customizable, but on the other side, the game's balance was much better than in MC:LA, since you didn't have to worry about other cars having upgraded parts. Your car was it, you had to beat the enemies with what cars you had and your own skill. A game like this would not be viable today, since people would complain and ask more of it, but I'd buy it again today if I had another chance.","""Midnight Club II"" is a slick arcade-style racer from Rockstar Games . it's super tough, but never feels frustrating . despite its shortcomings, MC II is still a worthy sequel ."
"1,112.SWAT 4","Very cool and unique game with a lot of character and an interesting world but its very buggy and sometimes tedious, 8 with SEF mod. as a ""SWAT simulator"" good game, but it still has some large -. Like if suspect runs away, you cant shoot, but you wait until he stops, points gun as some1 and kills them. There is mod for it, but we dont count mods. Sadly obstacles are not wallbangable. Im not going to talk about stupid things like if you stay next to door and someone tries to open it, he cant. Strange lags while team is on stairs, aimbot enemies, and that becomes even **better** when you need to wait when they point gun at someone, or they just do 360 and hit u in the head. The game is good, but for its time.. VERY GOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!! I SO LIKE TACTICAL SHOOTERS ITS SO HARD BUT IS VERY FUN!!!!. Repetitive but great for its time. I wish they made more games like this one now days. What we have the likes of swat 4 are far from its realism.. My favourite tactical shooter that gave me my childhood. The game was a breakthrough game for the time, although it is very rarely mentioned, the loyal community remembers this game. 8/10. My favorite game :)). SWAT 4 is the best tactical shooter game I have ever played in entire my life - 9/10. It was old but the best police game I've ever played. The atmosphere is perfect, the content is perfect.. Super hard game that's all and your problem because the rest is well crafted, it has nice graphics even for 2005 and the intelligence of the NPC's is acceptable. I just loved this game when it came out. I spent hours and hours of fun. A style of police game with strategy and a lot of tension. Nostalgia is a word that comes to my mind when I remember SWAT 4.. SWAT games were the best tactical shooting games back then and 4 was the best title. A game that I would enjoy to play even now.. Great game. Unfortunately there's no official Multiplayer but LAN is still playable. I highly recommend it to everyone.. Very exiting game, I've never played something similar to I enoyed it even more. One of the missions is especially memorable and creepy.. The best tactical first person shooter. You should think you tactic, else you fast finish the game. Last very good tactical single player games i ever play, old games always will be better. It's one of the great LAN games you can play again and again. You don't have to master it to have fun. It's on GOG now, DRM free, with its expansion. Online doesn't work anymore due to Gamespy. Requires tweaking to work widescreen.. SWAT 4 is undeniably realistic, intriguingly unpredictable, painfully unforgiving and above all, weirdly addictive. Completing a mission is tough, but keeping yourself from coming back for more is even harder.. why don't they make another game. This was an epic tactical shooter with such realistic playing experience MISS this game... WE NEED SWAT 5 PLEASE! this is unfair.. Graphics are old and bad. But still this game is amazing. Enemy characters are great. What I really love about this is paintball gun. I hate guns. I hate scope and flash. Very difficult to see. I love paintball gun. It's too bad I can't find any walkthrough with paintball gun. I want to see gameplays with paintball gun. Bad thing about this game. Just like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, dies too easily, takes too much time to do the mission. Things takes a lot of time. It's very slow. When get shot, movement get very slow.. - Good: Gameplay, Tactical Multiplayer, Community, Art Direction - Mixed: --- - Bad: --- The best multiplayer shooter i ever played. Great community, very addictive gameplay. I stopped playing SWAT4 a few years ago but i still remember how good this game was.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Almost every single aspect of the game dilapidates once you touched it. The shooting is lame, 5 years old girl would be a batter shooter, than highly skilled SWAT officer. I mean, shooting during movement is not THAT hard for god's sake and you will never hit a single target in this game unless you stand still for at least 3 seconds, I guarantee it. The weapons list is short and most of the guns are useless. The enemies are too damn strong, and it's not about my HP or nice AI, it's about their supernatural abilities. (Well, sometimes they act like morons too). Damn modern gangs, recturing world's shooting champions and ****. I'd take them in my team instead of those 4 morons. Talking about AI, this is the dumbest AI I ever seen. The last time I played SWAT, I just sent them into a room by themselves to laugh a little. All of them died. And you know why? They were just looking at the enemy for 5 seconds, nobody even tried to make a single shot and he just killed them one by one. This is really damn important for a game in which you have to interact with 4 AI teammates to win, don't you think? And yet, somehow, the game is good, overrated as hell, but good. It makes you feel that you are SWAT officer, it makes feel responsible for those idiots you call teammates. And it makes you incredibly satisfied about 100/100 score.. This is the best tactical shooter I've played. Simply because the game started to like everything you linked to Swat. This game is verry good. I like a lot.. Simply put, Swat 4 is one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played throughout the entirety of my gaming life. It incorporates real life hostage situations and adds a sense of excitement and Adrenalin into the user as it makes you truly feel as if you are in there shoes. Swat 4 uses very realistic sound effects and animations as well as incorporation of real life SWAT techniques in which are used to give you the full SWAT simulation, Everything about this game is spot on and as real as it comes on the PC. Overall SWAT gives the user a unique approach towards FPS shooters and has taken risk on doing something different and succeeded. I am guessing there is not going to be a sequel to SWAT 4 but if there is i will be highly anticipating it and adding it to my list of games to play. Well done Sierra Entertainment for producing a very entertaining and addictive SWAT team FPS.. A tactical game about Swat. Even I did not expect to be so beautiful game. Tactical elements made ​​the whole game. Not just ""Pom Pom"" and ""Congratulations, you have finished the game !!."". Terrible AI, bad controls, bad behavior, you can't kill any suspect because they remove points. you cant use force, you cant do anything, they give you only a few bullets per mission and a weapon you cant use, why the **** they give you a weapon if you cant kill the armed terrorist, you kill one they remove points, you get hurt, they remove points, the other stupid swats get hurt or killed, lees points, the behavior of the other swats is just ridiculous, they let the armed robbers kill the other swats, this game has one of the WORST AI I HAVE EVER SEEN. Incredible bad in context. Say no to swat franchise.. One of the best tactical shooter of all time. Only true defect is the less letal wewapon's umbalancing that ruin a bit the multyplayer experience, otherwise as perfect as no one else. The best epitaph possible for glorious sierra!. Tactical. This game has done what none other has, that is simulate real scenarios with real equipment, from opti-wands, door jams, and many less than lethal options. Your goal is to minimize casualties, rather than run around shooting everything you see. This with a realistic rating system makes this a must own. Even missing a suspects gun as evidence, or failing to report a detained civilian to trailers will affect your final rating. I played the hell out of this game co-op, and still has a very active community. That is saying something. A++. The game is called SWAT 4 and is available only on the PC. In this game, you lead a team of five SWAT members and you must undertake some complex missions such as stopping a bank raid or arresting a dangerous suspect. In this game, rather than go in ‘guns ablazing’, it pays to take the more stealthy approach. You are expected to give the suspects fair warning by yelling for compliance before you are allowed to take any lethal action. In general, it’s best to throw smokebombs or flashbangs in order to get them to surrender faster. You can also use the taser or pepperspray but this requires some practice. Going into this game thinking it’s like Call of Duty is just going to end up with you getting a lot of penalty points or worse, running out of ammo and becoming a liability to your team. Ultimately this game is about teamwork, fairplay and tactics. You play the leader of your unit. There are also two other teams comprised of two squad members. You can assign each team a different task so while one team is stacking up against a door, the other one is preparing C4 to breach the other door. You can also order them to handcuff enemies or stick by you. The AI isn’t perfect but often does a good job. They’ll often ask you to move out of the way which can be annoying if you like to keep them close (which is a good idea generally). The sound effects in this game are spot on. Every gunshot, door opening or explosion feels and sounds realistic. The voice acting is really good. The civilians sound scared and confused and the criminals sound determined and angry. The SWAT team sound cool and calculated and always sound as if they really are SWAT members. The squad leader who briefs you on your mission does an impeccable job of making you feel as if you really are eavesdropping on an important mission briefing. Online play is an interesting diversion that has it’s moments. Your characters are very frail though, so moving slowly and surprising the enemy is paramount. Overall SWAT 4 is a very fun game that has a unique approach on making FPS games more intelligent and bringing a more tactical approach to dealing with pesky criminals.. Sorry Guys that I cant can giving 10/10 because the Game have now no Official Multiplayer you have to download a other Programm and that is really bad cause SWAT4 is one of the best Tactical Shooter ever and it makes really many FUN to play it.. Swat 4 İs Best Tactical Shooter Ever. İt İs Better Than Ghost Recon And Rainbox Six . İt's Very Realistic Game. You Can ''Really'' Command Your Team But People Dont Know The Value Of Swat **** Swat 5 İs Never Come But We Still Want SWAT 5!. Every suspects or hostages are Mr Bruce Lee, SWAT officers must not treat those bare handed peoples (Bruce Lee guys) with rubber shots before handcuffing them. The SWAT officers should hand over their guns to those Bruce Lee guys so they can finished the mission themselves, because all the officers are disqualified, so disqualified that it takes a shot at the hostages' leg to make them compromise/surrender. But the officers in this game are better than the cops that shot an unarmed man dead because he took off running in a sub-way in a real life event. Another down thing is that the officers in this game can't pick up any dropped guns and use them, so when you ran out of ammos you ran of ammos! Anyone can edit the game script and modify the taser gun so it can have a touch light attached to it, shooting at a farther distance with faster projectile speed. If you aimed the taser at a **** crotch and shoot it, you can see the **** is shaking up like she's having an orgasm! Best of all the game rules can be changed by editing more game scripts.. this game is so epic, it is better than rainbow.",i just loved this game when it came out . sadly there's no official Multiplayer but LAN is still playable . swat 4 is the best tactical shooter that gave me my childhood .
"1,113.F-Zero X","Although lacking graphically, F-Zero X makes up for it in terms of performance, intense gameplay, and sheer speed. With many tracks of varying difficulty, 30 unique pilots/vehicles, hidden character relationships that affect gameplay, and an incredible metal-like soundtrack, F-Zero X is a must play for anyone up to the challenge.. Surpassed only by its Gamecube sequel, F-Zero X may very well have been the greatest racing game ever made at the time of its release. Now, 25 years later, it certainly has been succeeded by many, including the likes of the Fast Racing and Redout series, but I would say that it was only ever truly surpassed by F-Zero GX. There's something about F-Zero X and GX that no other games seem to be capable of matching: the speed, the sharp turns, the memorable and well designed tracks, the music, the unforgiving difficulty, complimented by the complete lack of any gimmicks or aids to your driving; its just you, the course, and 29 other racers out to grab the gold.. Another N64 title that stays true to its SNES roots, F-Zero X retains the air hockey physics and favours speed over presentation with its colourful but rather featureless graphics. Again its the 3D modelling that is the main leap forward which features looping, rollercoaster style tracks making for a fun futuristic racer. The only problem is that in all but one department (F-Zero has a proper championship mode) Wipeout 64 is markedly **** physics, graphics, music and variety are all superior. But in the end, they're different enough to warrant owning both.. I love this game, I can feel the speed the aesthetics, the ambience, the music, the graphics looks very cool, there's so many car race, and the difficulty is challenging, is a pretty good game.. The best racing game on Nintendo 64 without a doubt. The gameplay is extremely fast and impressive that they were able to execute it this well on a 64bit console. The courses are all phenomenally designed that give a huge variety in style, which really highlights the amount of vehicles in the game. Each vehicle has unique strengths and weaknesses which provide benefit on different cups and courses. While there are a lot of vehicles that feel relatively similar when you offer a total of 30, the art design of the characters and vehicles make it feel like you have plenty of options. The art design doesn’t stop there, it is reflected in the visuals of the courses and the awesome music. Then add a variety of game modes include solid multiplayer experiences, and you have a fantastic game. It’s one of the rare games of that era where I want to go back and beat my old records. You won’t find this combination of near perfect execution anywhere else on Nintendo 64. It holds up extremely well in 2023.. Extremely addicting and fast racing game. Graphics are a bit lacking but the game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second which completely makes up for it. Also the soundtrack is fantastic.. Insanely hard game for masochists. Pure punishment in video game form. The Dark Souls of racing games.. playing this play this game in 2022, and this game is really good, the sense of speed is very good, better than nfs payback. Great futuristic racer and a must have for multiplayer nights on N64! Lots of different vehicles to choose from however, some of the tracks become repetitive. Difficulty is perfect if you're looking for a challenge but there's still some great tracks that fit perfect for a sunday drive (a sunday in the future maybe). It's a classic and one that should not be omitted from your collection.. One of the best racing games of all time. A timeless Classic! The Wipeout games was almost equally great.. Undoubtedly the fastest speed game on the nintendo 64. The control feels great and the tracks are fun and crazy.. This is an interesting game to review, because it's one of those rare situations where the gameplay is actually not the most important element. So, let's talk about what this game as going for it: 1. Aesthetic. And holy **** this game has a lot of it. From the moment you boot up the game, you are overwhelmed with awesome (the startup music and the iconic main menu screen) It's got the vibe of a maximalist action manga. The vehicle selection screen has a ton of options, each corresponding to a unique fantasy character. Even though the game has barely any info on these characters, it still implores you to imagine a world to contain them. And then we boot into the actual race. The aesthetic we see here is an idiosyncratic style,a very late-90s flavor of retrofuturism. It's endearing in its shamelessness, even if it is not really 'futuristic' by modern standards. The sparseness of the levels complement the high-speed theme. Probably it'd be fun to play on acid, and it has that same 'satisfying' feeling as those ""trackmania press forward"" videos. 2. The soundtrack. This is one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time, and is very unique. It's a kind of midi-metal - you got some blast beats, some gutteral vocals, but above all else there is this majestic, **** guitars and keyboard. It's a little campy but has a particular charm. I have listened to the same songs from the original FZero as well as the later versions such as FZero GX or the F Zero X guitar arrange album - none of them are as good. Now about the actual gameplay. It's alright. Some of the levels are pretty neat, especially the cylinder levels which have an awesome 360 degree gravity effect. The random level generator is a nice feature. Time trial feature is fun. Personally I'm not that heavy into racing games, so I don't stress too much about beating the game or whatever. The death match is probably the most fun mode. However the PVP is pretty lacking compared to other N64 peers such as Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing.. Best racing series ever with lots of drivers and courses! Graphics 9 Sound 10 Controls 10 Gameplay 10 Lifespan 10. F-Zero was fun, but it got old real quick. It looked great and it had interesting characters and vehicles, but after a few races, I got tired of it. It would takes a few weeks before I got back into the game. It is better than the SNES version.. i like this game, well i love all games that is futuristic race with badass vehicles, but f zero x lost the identity all times that launched a new game, is a good game, but he was different from the first f zero, the x game became too much wipeout, wipeout is a awesome game we know, but these games must respect the main identity and not copy each other... i not know if they made the game too close by knowing wipeout, or it was just an accident, maybe what i think it could be a bad judgment. f zero x was NOT the fastest game in N64, he is brutally slower than extreme-g, but still very fast and dynamic. is a fun game, but he had too much weak spots, mainly when we compare to all other futuristic race games present in N64. beside the fanaticism... f zero x not deserve to be higher than score 7, because he was too decomposed, the scenario was a giant low resolution bitmap extended, simple tracks, low amount polygon, strange physic rules (like a magnetic float ship that lost the control over the ice and other things), the mass is poor compared to other games, dry controls and everything became 32 bit design when get distance. N64 was a powerful machine from that generation, we know they was able to made this game much better. what was wonderful in this game was the options, a lot of ships and basically all of then are nice, the design was very sexy and even the ""ugly"" ships was nice ships, he had many tracks (sometimes one or other was too much similar, but still nice), and was fast enough anyway, this game still rocks for me, f zero x was the last good game from the saga, because gx tryed to copy extreme-g speed and dynamic, nintendo need to know, these games must be what they are, if try to copy other game, this one never will be better than the other. by my taste i give 5, but i know this game deserve 7 by the technical side.. Great Racing Game! It's a sequal to the Super Nintendo's Classic F-Zero. The graphics are absolutely amazing for the Nintendo 64. The controls are good. The course design is great. The music is awesome. Captain Falcon is amazing. F-Zero X is a great racing game and also the fastest Racing Game and you should buy this and Mario Kart 64 together if you haven't already and if you hate F-Zero X, you're BEYOND silly as JB.. The best racing game ever made! I'm one of a handful professionals in this games worldwide. I play this game for 14 years now and for 8 active and so i might have enough experience with this masterpiece to write a **** Game comes with an enormous mass of content. You get more than in most of today's racing games and there also was no similar game back in the time. This game comes with 24 Tracks + Random Tracks, packed in 4 (5) cups, playable with 30 different vehicles, who all differ a lot. They only got 3 Attributes (Body, Boost, Grip), a weight and you also can change the gear ratio, which gives u a large number of completely different vehicles. This makes up to 600 cups you can earn overall... 150 for each difficulty (Novice, Standard, Expert, Master) which makes the game really challenging, since the CPU's don't give a **** about you and are sometimes actually a bit unfair. The Input of this game is incredible, and if you fail, it's just you and not the game. The graphics is also pretty good for the time and may better than graphics of racing games which were released in the same time. If this wasn't enough, there is a lot of techniques to discover to improve your skill in this game, which also make you go for better and better times in the Time Trial mode. As well there is a Death Race mode and a multiplayer besides this and Grand Prix mode. So you can spend hundreds of hours playing this game, without it getting boring. A masterpiece in video game history and by now without any equals.... One of the best racing games. EVER! Its so fast, the game's fluidity is perfect, the tracks are so much fun, and, most important its action packed and challenging! F-Zero X is a N64 must-buy!. Although the rest of my family never seemed to care much for this game I used to love it as a kid. 30 racers on one track was all kinds of awesome and it was just mayhem. Great music, track design and a butter smooth frame-rate made it really feel super-fast. Visually it was a little plain however but that's a minor gripe!. I daresay, the critics who criticize graphics are out of the league. I mean, sure, it's less than normal games (especially the bill-boarded/imaged graphics), but you never see such metallic graphics in cars. Even if you go 600 MPH, the graphics of the track are pretty cool. The metallic graphics match the sky, and are high quality, even if far away. 60 frames per second? Oh yes. GREAT! Barely lagged below 60 F/S. it's nice for varied challenges, and the death race is completable. use side attacks L+L. very lovable, even the Wii version (virtual console)! love the heavy metal music. and Rainbow Road? PSYCHEDELIC! awesome night sky and graphics. virtually controlling your flying. i mean, there is a lot to love about this ****. My all time favorite racer. Even though i love F-Zero GX, F-Zero X holds a special place for being the first video game i have ever played. This game is a high-octane racer and has one of the best multiplayer offerings on the N64. The soundtrack is one of my all time favorites and the course design still holds up to day. The best racer on the N64.. High octane thriller action, this is without doubt the fastest racing game around, also possessing over the top and hilariously awesome physics. It's soundtrack stands as one of the best in gaming and it's got a huge selection of racers, some of which are incredibly hard to unlock. The tracks themselves are pretty memorable and different from each other. The feel and controls are great even considering the not so great N64 controller, being able to increase momentum while flying through the skies at top speed is great. If you like the idea of going 1000mph and slamming racers off the track while an excited announcer shuts YEAH!!! then this is the racing game for you. Best racing game. Fast and smooth. You can play it 4players and its still smooth. At such hi speed the controls are perfect. Has also nice music. Easily on of the best N64 games.. When I first turned this game on, I was amazed at how buttery smooth the frame rate was. The great sense of speed while going up against 29 other racers was worth the toned down graphics and compressed sound. The music was nice to listen to and I would say it is some of the best for the N64 out of all the games. The controls are very tight and responsive, the learning curve here is minimal, but they do feel copy and paste for every vehicle. The tracks are quite varied and creative, with 24 tracks spread across 4 cups and an unlockable X cup (random track generator), making for great replay value. The difficulty is quite high, but very rewarding with many unlockable drivers - 30 in all. Single player also featured practice, time attack, and a really neat death race mode, where you have to take out all the other drivers as fast as you can. Multiplayer supports 4 players with no frame rate drop or weird limitation to speak of. There are also some customization options available for this mode. If you also count the disk drive expansion, you also get a track and ship creator as well as new ships for some of the characters. There were a few downsides to speak of, though. The graphics and detail in everything was downgraded, the AI at times can be pretty unfair (although not impossible to beat), the frame rate did suffer just a tad when the race got congested, and bumping into walls and other drivers caused me to slide, which was pretty annoying. Those aside, the game has a lot of longevity and fun, handles well, and has an amazing sense of speed. As a fan of racing games, I consider F-Zero X as the best racing game for the N64, just beating out San Francisco Rush 2049 by about a third of a Falcon Punch lol. In all seriousness, it is an amazing and challenging game. I highly recommend it. 9.3/10. Almost unlimited game play. You had to win every cup in every difficulty mode with every ship (and there were many). In addition, the last cup always generates random circuits which gives you virtually game play without end. On the other side, the graphics were very plain (below the N64 possibilities).. This is my favorite game of all time. Maybe it won't be as good for you but this game has it all. Speed, perfect controls, great atmosphere, ultra smooth frame rate and a death metal soundtrack that will make you think how on earth did Nintendo release such a hardcore game? Who cares about the lack of backgrounds? The races are supposed to be high on the sky or the stratosphere. The lack of backgrounds and spectators give this game a nice feel of isolation and danger. Nobody will come to help you if your ship is destroyed and if you get off the track... well... you are dead. Amazing game","despite lacking graphically, F-Zero X makes up for it in terms of performance, intense gameplay, and sheer speed . with many tracks of varying difficulty, 30 unique pilots/vehicles, hidden character relationships that affect gameplay, and an incredible metal-like soundtrack . the gameplay is extremely fast and impressive that they were able to execute it this well on a 64bit console ."
"1,114.EverQuest","Of all the terrible PC games to play in 2024, this has got to be the worst. Filled with UI bugs and glitches, graphics bugs and glitches, you will have a very bad time playing this game. Leveling from level 1 to about level 60 is a fast paced nostalgic and fun time (if you dont mind the bugs and glitches). After level 60 however, you are best to just uninstall the game. In addition to all the bugs and glitches, the game is unbalanced. Levels 1 to 60 are too easy and after that its too hard. The game is not very well maintained and things are not kept balanced. It is easy to see why there are people selling power leveling services in chat, because unless you are willing to spend a monthly fee and also get these power leveling services that other players are selling, you are in for one long boring ride. Theres another thing too, if you do decide to pay, you will be paying for some newer content, but most of the content is from 10 15 20 and 25 years ago.. because the game has been around for so long... I had high hopes when I decided to join the Teek Everquest server, but unfortunately, it has been a huge letdown. The most glaring issue is the extremely low population. It feels like I’m interacting with the same few players repeatedly, and it’s hard not to wonder if they’re all server admins just trying to keep the illusion of activity **** lack of communication among players is staggering. You’d expect an MMORPG to be a vibrant community full of interactions and camaraderie, but here it’s like talking to a wall. Conversations are almost nonexistent, and when they do happen, they’re rarely about the game itself—mostly just discussions about money and transactions. This focus on profit over community is disheartening and makes the entire experience feel soulless.Everquest itself is a legendary game that deserves to thrive, but the way it’s being managed on this server is contributing to its decline. It feels like the magic of Everquest is being **** dry by a lack of genuine passion from those running the show. Instead of fostering a community and engaging players, it feels like the focus is solely on making a quick **** you’re looking for a true Everquest experience, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. The Teek server simply doesn’t capture the spirit of what made the game great. It’s a dying game, and the people managing it are doing a disservice to its legacy. Save your time and find a server where the community thrives, because here, it’s anything but alive.. This used to be a good game, but not anymore. These games have more glitches than they started with, for an online MMO that's designed around groups of players the servers are empty so you can't even do most of the content. The mercenaries helped with that, but they and the game feel strangely balanced. Servers in general all have low population even the ones claiming to have high population. All the old content like items from old dungeons have become useless because they never balanced them with expansions. I paid a subscription for the progression servers, and they weren't fun. This was a classic and my favorite. Now I just hate the game. I don't suggest anyone play with this one.. I started playing this game about a year or so after it came out and it blew my mind. Everything about it was new and pretty brutal. The downtime between fighting mobs was at minimum a few minutes and grouping was kind of a necessity. I remember the first time the screen started doing something weird and I realized my in game character was starving to death and couldn't see straight. I didn't realize that was something I had to worry about until it happened and I was lost in the woods with nothing to eat. Plus, when you died you'd loose all your equipment and items if you couldn't find and retrieve your corpse. You could maybe use chat and find a friendly high level necromancer who could drag your corpse back to you and them. Leveling took forever (years and years) and people would sometimes (accidentally or intentionally) run past you trailing monsters who would then attack you. They would type into chat ""TRAIN!!!!"" as they were running by you. It was all very exciting at the time.. It is still the best MMORPG if you are patient enough to play it. Why? Because it has kinda legacy-like mechanics, still gets new players (not that much though), and has a reasonable monetisation (not a pay-to-win). However, I have one issue with the subscription prices. I think it is pretty high, but I understand why. The quality of the content.... I give this game a 10 based on the game as it came out, not what it is today. To be totally honest EQ would most likely make a better single-player game at this point than most modern games. I would really love a modern take on this game style, but I don't know that it would work as an MMO at this point. I can however still 22 years later still sit down and play this game with friends or by myself and it holds up, I know people who where not born when this game came out who have played it and are blow away. I don't know that there will be another EQ until game technology really has a major change.. The game as it was 18 years ago is good. But to be honest about it now, the graphics in some older zones will leave you will a slight feeling of nostalgia at best. Don't expect any support if you need it. Support will annoy you with foolishness and will be unable to help you with most problems. There are older and newer character models to chose from so people will be seeing and experiencing different things based on preference. What your character looks like might look different to someone else, depending on which character models are selected. Also most of the people responsible for the games success have moved on to other projects and the game has been left in other peoples hands.. This has to be my favorite game of all time. I started playing in 2000 when Kunark expansion was just released... and MAN... I was blown away. By the time you log on, you felt like you were part of a living AND breathing world. It was very dynamic feeling because OF THE PLAYERS WERE ENGAGED(Guilds and Clans who had reputations, beefs among each other, there was zone chat, A tunnel where people would trade face to face, players depending on other players for survival, etc). You would literally login at 8 in the morning and I would be completely immersed by the social dynamics and dangerous world.... find myself loging off at 6PM... realizing this was another universe. It was absolutely epic. Nowadays, WoW ruined the social aspect. I swear, people would not DARE offend other players or troll others without any SERIOUS impact on their ability to play in the game(such as find groups which you needed. or joining a guild because your character had a reputation). Everything about the game was designed for people to socialize and to form bonds online. For example, you could not just plow through monsters like you do nowadays. It took CAREFUL planning and communicating with team members to be on the same page before each fight. If one person did not participate, than your group would surely be wiped out even by the most basic npc/mob. So each class had their distinct role. You had someone who would pull the monsters and bring them towards your group while a healer would keep him alive just long enough for a tank class to taunt the enemy and receive it's attention. This tank was able to take high loads of damage while the healer would be able to keep him alive. But that was not enough!! You needed another team member to ""mezz"" the additional enemies that would come along and would surely wipe out your group in a few seconds(this mezzer would basically paralyze these npcs). If at any point, your team members were not communicating together on which monster to kill first, then a single attack on an extra NPC would cause the mezz to wear off...which could spell doom. Then there was the direct damage classes such as the Rogue and the Mage who would be your lifeblood to kill these monsters! A COMBINATION OF ALL THIS MADE THE GAME EXTREMELY SOCIAL. Nowadays, when you group in games like WoW you have no time to even type a message or communicate because your group is running through monsters so fast that you would be left behind if you even tried to type anything... So nobody talks anymore. Besides, it's not like your group will be wiped out if you made a single mistake coordinating. In EQ you had ALOT OF DOWNTIME BETWEEN FIGHTS, to recuperate mana for your casters... in between this time you formed bonds by talking to each other and forming bonds between your group and getting to know each other. You would spend hours with total strangers as if they were guildmates. THis is how it's done. Compare this to modern day mmorpgs, where people never talk to each other and there's no need to be social at all. In fact, you just click ""join dungeon"" and you run through a dungeon as fast as possible and you don't have anytime to type a single message lol. This game wasn't perfect. But it had ONE thing that it did REALLY well. This one thing was UNIQUE AND NO MODERN MMORPG CAN DO. This one unique thing is social dynamics and a feeling of a living breathing world. This alone is worth it's weight in gold. I rather have a game with tons of annoyances but with this aspect. To me this is an mmorpg. These WoW clones are single player large scale multiplayer games. At best, they are like COD ""matches"" where the server joins you to a arena. I'm waiting for Pantheon Rise of the Fallen. That game is being made by Brad Mcquaid. One of the original founders of EQ. Looking at his videos and tenets of the game... it will be exactly what we're looking for !. Shadow of its former self now. Customer Assistance is also beyond a joke after all their lay offs, ontop of that the reps I've dealt with have been dismissive and unhelpful.. In its prime, it was called ""EverCrack"" for a reason. Though it has been rebuilt, built upon, and built upon again over the long running years of development, you can still feel the roots of the game that made it great as you go through it, and eventually you will have to concede the fact that this MMO has more world area content (zones) to explore than any other MMO on the market today. It also contains a large number of classes and races to choose from, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of different pieces of usable and equipable gear, quest items, monsters and so forth making the game vast in dimension. The players are fanatically loyal, especially the ""oldcore"" players like myself, though many have migrated to the Daybreak Game Company approved Project 1999 fan-run server which still hosts old-school content. If you can see past the somewhat moded graphics (excepting the new content) and the still-static-feeling combat system you could easily see how such a vast universe with a vibrant and long running history could easily still be the #1 MMO on the market had WoW never taken that throne.. This is an old game that has gone through a lot of ups and downs. I have left and returned multiple times, but that is just it, I always come back. Other mmos I have left and forgotten while this one stays with me. It is one of the few games left that has the balls to say, clerics are healers--no you don't get a dps spec. Some classes excel at things and are better at things than others, while everything balances out in a way. I hate how every mmo now wants everyone to do everything the same. Rogues should not do the same as a wizard, that is why wizards have a limited mana bar. This game is challenging and takes some learning, but it is one of the few mmos left that don't let you frolic through zones without a care as you mow down everything you see. Without challenge all rewards seem pointless, and this game makes it feel worth the effort.. The 1st fully 3D MMO, was a major success, that drove the gaming industry to look at MMO's seriously. Developed originally by Verant, it was an amazing experience for gamers of the time. Unlike previous MMO's which were limited to 2D or isometric 3D, this MMO brought exploration to the table and a huge world with dangerous environments, punishing monsters around every corner, boat rides and massive raids like none we had seen before. Classes in the game were static with very little wiggle room in customization but each classes was very unique and had a purpose (for the most part). The game employed the old trinity class system where you needed a tank, cleric and dps class to beat difficult enemies. This created a problem for many who played hybrid classes not being able to find groups since their characters were not as effective as others playing a ""trinity"" class. Nonetheless, groups formed, people solo'ed when they had to, and raids still took place with friends and family playing together regardless of classes. The nice thing about Everquest is that due to difficulty, almost all progression was worthwhile be it quests, crafting or just level grinding... at least, that is how it was early in the game (up to the 3rd expansion) and that is how I wish to remember this fantastic game. Unfortunately, when Sony purchased the game, the game quickly spiraled down the drain with additional content that was lazily designed, poorly tested, and clearly meant to be a time sink rather than a fun time for all. Sony made unilateral decisions regarding how the game should be played and they designed all new content that way polarized much of the subscribers until finally, everyone turned their backs on Sony and moved over to WoW as soon as it hit the shelves. But that is a long story for another day.. Came back recently after a 10 year hiatus. I am loving it! The game has improved immensely. It's more user friendly than it used to be, but not ""easy mode"" like most newer MMORPGs. I think it's a good balance between challenge and reward. It also has a TON of free content (18 of 20 expansions are included in F2P). I highly recommend checking it out either if you used to play or are bored with modern MMOs. Make sure to play the Tutorial, as it explains the game very well.. Dethstar's review of EQ was spot on. SOE (Sony Online Entertainment), is possibly the poorest managed company you will encounter in your lifetime! A few years ago I left the game owing to horrible customer service. A few things you might see from this company: an hour plus being on hold while trying to correct a billing error, and good luck finding the cancel button for your auto bill... it's hidden. Or how about this all too common response “That’s a known issue, we can’t help you”… ran into that several times. To sum up customer service (which is based on management): they are either unwilling or unable to help you, and you will be expected to jump through red tape and hoops to have things done which are automated in other games. They’re not going to help you, so don’t even try! So after about 5 years of being away from this game (mostly playing wow) I figured to give it a try again (2013), hoping they would have new management… they don’t, same thing. When a company forgets who pays the bills (the customer), it’s a long or short road to bankruptcy. Our best hope is that SOE goes under soon and a well managed company buys the software. With that said, this game has a ton of potential, depth in content, a leveling/gear strategy that blows the competition away! PVE that is challenging, and a game playing style which truly supports team play and interaction with other gaming members. After some minor changes, I like this games design more than any other on the market. Simply put, I refuse to give money to a company which is run this way.. I was there during beta and I left for 8 years later on and returned some 8 months ago. Yes it has aged a lot but it has such a huge body of content and depth of story that it is definitely worth a look. The biggest issue with Everquest is that Sony Online Entertainment have it. This is a company that treat gaming customers with utter contempt and let's be honest, do you trust these guys with your personal data? Everquest will run on anything, has huge depth and a much more mature user base than many MMO. You can play it your own way and have plenty of opportunities to play for a long time to come but bear in mind, it is very very old and it shows. Having made that comment, having beta tested and brought virtually every other MMO release since I keep EQ installed since returning and find I like to drop in and play from my laptop when in hotels bored or just when I want to slow the pace a bit. Dont expect PvP on EQ, it didnt work 14 years ago and it doesnt work now. SOE in particular seem to be hopelessly unable to make PvP which is balanced and engaging. The early days of EQ saw some of the best PvP experiences I ever had in an online game but then SOE brought it and did nothing positive with it.. This game was the start of it all and still holds many memories **** time meeting and socializing with people. Now a days MMO's feel disconnected but when this game came out there was a sense of ""needing"" to band together and group up to get things done giving a sense of community. Before any kind of auctioning system was in place, you used to have to auction items and barter trade which was awesome because you could really get some good deals just by bargaining with other players first hand instead of choosing a ""buy now"" option... but those days are long gone and this game will forever be that great mmo I will probably never find again.. A great game at its time, also there were too few of them then It defined the MMOs for the time to come, yes even WoW, i know WoW fans may find it hard to believe it. Now some of its legacies were good, some not, still that was the Original!! In many aspects i haven't seen a better MMO like classes with role defining abilities, immersing world (even day/night had a major impact) etc. Still its lack of soloability, and the raid oriented content of later expansions left it with a relatively few dedicated players in major guilds and the rest moved to EQ2 or WoW mostly.. I haven't played this game in years, but when I played it back around 2000-20004 it was an incredibly addicting experience. Some of my favorite MMO experiences are in this game. This was the mother of World of Warcraft, and in many ways it was more immersive. I miss the first person view, the massive world and the battle over ""Boss kills"" between the big guilds on the server. The death penalty may have been harsh sometimes, but it ultimately made the experience more rewarding. It was fun times indeed. The only problem with the game was the incredible amount of time you had to put into the game to get anywhere, and once the server population started thinning getting pickup groups became harder and harder.","i had high hopes when i decided to join the Teek Everquest server, but unfortunately, it has been a huge letdown . the most glaring issue is the extremely low population . the focus on profit over community is disheartening and makes the entire experience feel soulless ."
"1,115.Rollcage Stage II","Fast (and unique) cars, multiple weapons (optional), (near) impossible tracks, a lot of game modes (vs/5, vs/2 and vs/the track(!)). A COMPLETE racing game.. It's a crying shame this series never made it past the PSone generation. Heck, i'd be satisfied with a half decent clone with all the hours I've poured into this underrated gem. Wipeout is great and all, but Rollcage amps up the fun factor whilst maintaining that blistering feeling of speed. With a surprising amount of depth, there is certainly more than one way to win a race which was quite groundbreaking for the time. Not fussed on finishing first? No worries. Just pummel your opponents with weapons to gain enough points to push you across the line instead. A measure of customization would have been extremely welcome but there's more than enough features here to keep you satisfied for hours. And who would've thought that 2 player rubble soccer could be so much fun? And you can't go past 2 player ""Firefox"" level as you speed around a giant ring, filling the arena with those spinning missiles. Amazing. It doesn't demand the same level of punishing precision as the Wipeout series but is still satisfyingly difficult to finish to completion. Play it now!. Although a little difficult at times, the great gameplay and the amazing soundtrack makes this racing classic a must-have for any Playstation game collection.. At the time of release Rollcage, and this sequel, offered something a little different and quicker paced than the majority of other racing games. It certainly wasn’t a game you’d find yourself playing for months on end but it was fun whilst it lasted.","it's a crying shame this series never made it past the PSone generation . with a surprising amount of depth, there is certainly more than one way to win a race . with a measure of customization would have been extremely welcome ."
"1,116.Trials Evolution: Origin of Pain","I love the core game, and this first DLC adds more of the same. My only criticism is of the BMX bikes, they handle nothing like their real world counterpart and only serve to frustrate the player even more. There is nothing more annoying that bouncing about like a clown on a poor physics model of a pedal bike. I know it runs on the same model, but BMX's DO NOT have balloons attached. Would have been a 10 had the physics been ""fun"" for the new bike. The maps are very creative and well done, that editor is just that much more and it opens a new world for 100 of custom maps, for hours for entertaining new tricks and styles this is just a great DLC for only $5. Five dollars gets you 23 new trials tracks, 10 supercross, 2 new skill games, as well as a new bike to ride. It also includes a whole bunch of new editor tools, objects, and effects to help make user content even better than before. The new bike is a blast to ride, and is a great middleground between the scorpion and the Phoenix. The tracks are just as excellent as they were in the main game, if not more so. Redlynx now has five months of data showing them what people like to play. Using this, they were able to implement popular trends into there tracks, all while still keeping the game faithful to its tried and true formula. If you bought evolution and you still want to play the game, origin of pain is the perfect excuse to give it another shot. If your already a devoted fan, you owe it to yourself to buy it. If you don't have dlc, ALL the older tracks made in track central are available to you, however you'll need the dlc to play anything with the new toys used in the tracks. At this time, it looks like 95% of everything made will require the dlc. Worthy of note- the patch that was released for the dlc was supposed to improve many things, like overall stability. However, the game still seems to have issues for some people. Also, small, under the hood changes could give your older custom tracks/games problems. I have games that can't be played because of the bugs from the patch. Also, redlynx now advertises degree deodorant in the game, weird and messed up. Overall the package is excellent, 9 or a 10 from me, but the bugs really hurt if they effect you. They probably won't. Don't let it stop you from playing. I'm sure they're working on it.. Trials Evolution was the biggest and best entry in the series and one of the best titles for XBLA. Now it gets its first DLC package, Origin of Pain introduces a new play area for Trials users as well as 35 new Trials maps, 10 new supercross maps, hundreds of new editing tools, more customisation options for your rider and a new bike, the Gecko BMX. The DLC is priced at 400MS points (£3.50) and provides hundreds of hours of fun for an already generously sized game.","five dollars gets you 23 new trials tracks, 10 supercross, 2 new skill games, and a new bike to ride . redlynx now has five months of data showing what people like to play . if you don't have dlc, ALL the older tracks made in track central are available to you ."
"1,117.Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent","A poor frame rate throughout the game and terrible introduction to controls is what you can expect from Splinter Cell Double Agent. In every way a significant downgrade over SPC: Blacklist.. Haha, this game is so ridiculous bad. The first mission is just the most annoying game design ever made. Unplayable. You have to abort a rocket start in short time and you have no idea what to do. And after a few game over retries you stopped the rocket, but must escape quickly in a few seconds from a labyrinth of terrible level design with old gameplay. And this in the first mission. No guide no hints no targets. It’s a complete fail. Maybe the game becomes easier after this. But no game should start with the hardest mission. xD We need a new modern Splinter Cell with passionated developers and stealth focused.. A disappointing follow up to Chaos Theory. I don't hate the game, I actually like some of the ideas, like the undercover missions and balancing your relationships with the NSA and JBA. There were even a few missions I really liked e.g. the Shanghai level. But a lot of these ideas aren't properly fleshed out so the experience doesn't feel fulfilling. I did like some of the missions but the majority were ok at best in my opinion. I also didn't like some of the changes or cuts from previous games. The lack of a HUD makes stealth very frustrating at times, I had to reload checkpoints a lot in this game. I also rarely used gadgets. I also think the story could've been way better than what we got which is a shame since I can tell they wanted to take the series in an interesting new direction. The game can still be fun though as the core gameplay still retains that Splinter Cell charm, just with some slight problems. Give it a go if its on sale, just avoid the god awful PC version.. I'm sure this game is incredibly fun for others and maybe not so for some but I just wish I could actually play the game without some of the worst frame drops I've ever seen in gaming and the completely delayed input and audio it's actually horrific how it was released for the Xbox 360 in this state.. An enjoyable stealth romp. Shares alot of the same issues as its og xbox counterpart but alot more polished. Although it also suffers from its own issues like the lack of a HUD for example. But at least this one has an actual somewhat coherent plot so there's that i guess.. Splinter Cell Double Agent ,has by far the best story in the franchise and Sam Fisher that you play as being both the NSA and a terrorist in John Browns Army is absolutely enthralling, The choices you make feel more emotionally driven in the narrative than logical and thats pretty darn rare to find in any game. the premise alone and the fleshed out story makes double agent worth playing but its not without its flaws, the mechanics/controls is its biggest flaw and maybe its only an issue for the 360-ps3 port, its just very clunky at times and has less refined game play than chaos theory nonetheless its still a fun game to play but in general it didn't feel very cleaned up mechanic wise. and the multiplayer is unique and also fun but also could've had a little more to it. In conclusion Splinter Cell Double Agent is my favorite Splinter Cell story out of the whole series but game play wise it can fall short and under perform at times, but if you are a fan of the franchise or stealth espionage i would highly recommend this game to you. i would give it a mid to high seven. 7.4-7.7. I played a lot of this game a few years ago, but I never really got around to beating it. A lot of the missions were a blast to play. The problem is that there is a level you have to play over and over again, the objectives change each time but your still playing on the same recycled level. Basically your agent is infiltration a terrorist base over and over again. No complaints about the graphics and gameplay. I can only give this game an 8/10. The Splinter Cell series reached it's peak during chaos theory, the level where you rob that bank, since that point the series has been in decline with a tried and tested formula that was getting stale but double agent was the last in the series not to hold your hand all the way through, using one button techniques for taking enemies down from the opposite side of the room. Although the controls are old school the story is poo and playing as a double agent you don't really get the Sam Fisher experience with all his gear and traditional attire and having to return to a hub level over and over slowed the pace of the game and gave a real sense of boredom and pointlessness. It does look nice. Overall Double Agent is the best Splinter Cell game on the 360 and would be a good experience if you haven't played one before but falls way short of the heights of the first 3 games.. Pros:Sam,places,musics,characters,endings,multiple choises! cons:not really! This is the best splinter cell game in the world there is no mistake the story is amazing and fantastic, fisher is different finally...multiple choises is fantastic,JBA HQ is pretty great this whole double agent things is something new.different endings **** fisher looking is great...plus the gameplay is like the old SC games.. More of a Splinter Cell 3.5 than a fully revamped 4, Double Agent could've been so much more. That said, and if viewed as if it was the first game in the series, it's an enjoyable experience that is definitely worth picking up whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer - and especially if found at a price well below retail. A fairly easy 1000 if looked at simply from an achievement point of view. Here's hoping Splinter Cell 5: Conviction provides a more worthy contender to the franchise.. Double Agent doesn't feel like a next-generation game in terms of its presentation, nor does it innovate enough to bring the franchise into a new generation. The story is richer than ever, but the gameplay suffers from enormous frame rate problems and came across as more or less identical to previous titles - expect from a few new icons and minor changes here and there. The time limits seems like they have been put in place because the developers were out of intuitive gameplay ideas, and the night vision goggles have been rendered worse than the previous games with its wide lens approach. The war zone levels didn't quite fit the stealth genre, certainly not with the current style of gameplay, and I no longer felt like I was in control of my surroundings. The checkpoints are not frequent enough, and there are no opportunity to quick save, so saving becomes quite tedious after a while with its eventual 15 second loading time. This game was obviously made for Xbox and simply ported to the 360 at a higher resolution. Ubisoft has already done far better with their previous titles. A shame really.. SO BAD. I played maybe the first four levels, then i quit. it's terrible/impossible. PLEASE don't buy this game. A waste of money. Try Splinter cell Conviction. SO much better. this is a broken game, and the fact that you can make guards gargle their own blood gives it a 1.. The single player in the 360 version of this game is very lackluster. Having played and beaten both I'm not sure what happened when they brought this to the 360, plot holes and at somes points full levels/missions are nowhere to be found. The upside to this game is its multiplayer, Spy vs Merc is different to the majority of shooter multiplayer games with only one team having a gun, but learning to use the spy and being able to get so close to a merc that you can snap there neck without them even noticing you there is something you have to experience. Im giving this a 6/10 for singleplayer and a 10/10 for multiplayer.. Disgustingly bad and obviously rushed. This game contains massive plot holes and about half of the missions are segments where you do undercover espionage in the same level. The levels are timed so even if you complete the objectives you can be left sitting for 20 or so minutes waiting for the timer to run out. The night vision has some weird look to it that makes it difficult to see. My biggest issue is the expert mode. It's not too hard, but the guards seem to be able to track you in most levels no matter what you do, how dark it is, or how quiet you are. The multilayer is also a huge disappointment. There is no spy vs merc death match or coop. The spy vs merc works like a sort of capture the flag. It's pretty impossible to kill a merc since they have a motion tracker that beeps louder depending on how close a spy is. So all they have to do is turn around when they hear it beep its loudest and put a round through your face. If you want more splintercell pick up chaos theory or the original xbox version of double agent. This game gets a 2 because sam can now throat chop people and it makes me giggle.",a poor frame rate throughout the game and terrible introduction to controls is what you can expect from Splinter Cell Double Agent . in every way a significant downgrade over SPC: Blacklist . a disappointing follow up to Chaos Theory .
"1,118.Pillars of Eternity: Complete Edition","Combat gets repetitive. Too much text and you can't see the direction you need to follow in the map. I enjoyed some parts of the game but I think that after 3-5 hours you'll have seen all this game can give you. Maybe years ago I would have enjoyed this game much more but not nowadays. Not a bad bad game but I just like more first person rpgs. I played for over 7 hours.. Yes. 0. I have to quote a classic on this one: ""What is the most important aspect of any game? Well being able to *** play it!"" I HAVE to give 0! I like the game (at least the beginning seems like I could very much like the game and its mechanics). But how can I give something else when the game was released with game-breaking bugs that make me don't even being able to play it! My saves won't register! So great. I won't try to start the game for the fourth time to have the same issue happening yet again. I feel like if I couldn't give this score and this review for this game it's like I would not have any consumer rights whatsoever. If somebody says my score is not fair to the developer then I can just congratulate them on being an ideal consumer. Because then it clearly doesn't matter what is fair to the person who buys their game!. A lot of the issues they had have been fixed. I made it almost all the way through without any game crashing bugs or skills not working right. One bug I found reoccurring and caused me to load saves was going into small homes and it being a bunch of white screen and white boxes and sometimes leaving everything else would be too. My main gripe with the game and why I didn’t finish were the insanely long load times. I decided to save this one for when I get a laptop or something because honestly just going through long load screens for every single building was horrible and I could have beat the game 3-4 times over by the time I gor 1/4 to 1/2 of the way through if it wasn’t for the extremely long and frequent load times. Im talking like warcraft 3 classic map loading time every time you enter a house or even go down a ladder. Its terrible. That costs so much IRL time that if I were in a small town country side in 1995 and a small child hooked on video games again I would still stop playing because of how much time it was costing me.. Baldur's Gate (BG) and its successor are two of my all time favorite games. Pillars is a very successful homage to these. The game system is no longer based on the d&d rules, which is not necessary for a computer system. Many innovations are good, so there are no more single overimportant stats for one class, while the others are completely useless. At the same time, the system is confusing at the beginning, because it is not always clear how important individual stats are for a class. On the other hand, the system is much more forgiving when stats are not distributed optimally. Combat system fits, stays close to the BG feel and is mostly fair. There is a horrendous selection of spells, although fewer might have been more, because it gets confusing from time to time and it is difficult to assess which buff or debuff would actually be more efficient for the situation. Weak points of an otherwise great game are: The sidequests are fun. The main quest, however, is weak: the motivation and urgency are not very obvious... I just search ... someone. That didn't grab me at all for a long time and then towards the end you learn a bit more. As a drive for the story moderately engaging. The own castle makes in my opinion also only mediocre sense. It is rather occupational therapy with very little influence... but you don't have to put more time into it than you want. the game world is solid but also not something special. It's fun to explore the regions, but it has little to remember. loading times are a bit long. This is especially noticeable when you have to quickly load a map (loading) into a house (loading) on the second floor (loading) and then back again... Playing on PS5 makes it a lot better. Conclusion:Those who loved Baldur's Gate will find the spiritual successor in PoE. There is a lot of love and quality in the game. Recommendation despite small quirks.. Thankfully I have access to this game for free. This is supposed to be a spiritual successor to games like Baldur's Gate? After about 20 hours in, I am bored and I'm just playing the game to be done with it. The story is pretty uninspired and the writing is pretty terrible. While the game is not awful, it's painfully mediocre overall. Enough so that I keep wondering why Obsidian did such a poor job on this.. the game isn't terrible but it has a few flaws that prevent it from being a great **** game isn't terrible but it has a few flaws that prevent it from being a great game. I'm going to post this for both consoles, as the next gen consoles like ps5 and xbox series x resolve the loading times issues that a lot mention as a negative, that doesn't factor for me as a negative. My complaints with the game are in regards to the story and design First, the game makes a lot of references to the lore that almost makes you feel like you should already know all of this stuff. It may be in best interest to watch a story recap that avoids possible spoilers to explain the lore/background. Also, the game doesn't do a very good job of doing dynamic storytelling, instead it's just conversations of text with no voice acting for the most part or reading the books/scrolls that you find. There's very few cutscenes that present the story. Also, the story is very vague for the most part where there's no sense of urgency to go through the story, and some of the side quests/tasks are easily skippable/boring. I think the biggest issue is that you don't really connect with the characters or factions in Act 2, and when you finish Act 2, the pacing of this game is just bizarre as Act3/4 are just like a few hours and then you finish the game. Basically, it's just hard to even care about the story/lore. It's even more impacted when the main villain and major plot twist doesn't even really shock me as again there's no set up for this until last the last hour of gameplay. This game isn't really one I'd recommend. It's a slog at best, a bore at worst. Here's why: 1) The story: This game confuses ""intricate"" with ""interesting"". There's a large amount of lore, sure, but it just.... isn't interesting? The writing/plot is so mediocre and unimaginative that there's no emotional investment you can really have in regards to the broader story, characters, or world at large. They're all exceptionally dull. The entire game just devoid of any human element: the story is walls of facts about things. None of it is meaningful: just complex. After a while, it starts to feel like the complexity is designed to make up for the lack of quality in the writing. This doesn't work. And it feels like the devs know this-- they try to put in ""shocking"" plot twists and philosophy, but it's all one-dimensional and cliched. Nothing feels surprising, nothing feels intellectually stimulating. Compounding this issue is the fact that the game's text is almost a parody of bad fantasy writing-- a constant stream of proper nouns washes over you at all times. It's designed to make you feel like you're learning about the new world, but it's the only trick in the writer's tool box. This means it gets old. Quickly. In short: it feels bad to buy a largely text-based game with bad text. If you want a good game with a lot of text, don't buy this. 2) The combat: Without a good story to draw you in, you would hope the game is fun to play. Well, I had the same hope; I was sorely disappointed. The RTS combat is less enjoyable/interesting than you would think and far less enjoyable than you want. It is best when it is monotonous, and at it's worst when it's involved. This is because the combat controls are clunky. That said, if you're an RTS nut the game hits all the right notes (or at least, as well as it can given the interface issues). 3) The dialogue: In addition to having nothing which -feels- human or even interesting about any of the characters, a lot of the dialogue is just... simple. You can click on the bad answer, the good answer, the mean answer, or the nice answer. Data on which ones you click is compiled and that score then gives you a reputation. It's not hard to game that system to get the one you'd like, as it's always pretty obvious which result gets what. At times it can be interesting-- legitimately so, which is why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1-- but 99% of the time it reads like a child trying to write a videogame. Divinity 2 and Disco Elysium have it beat here if you're looking for an isometric RPG. 4) The Controls: the inventory management system is clunky, the combat is clunky, the game itself is clunky. Eh. 5) The world: Again, intricate is not the same as interesting. There's a surplus of information, but little of it is relevant/interesting/communicated well. It's markedly less memorable than other full-sized RPGs (Fallout, Divinity, Yakuza, Skyrim, Disco Elysium, the Outer Worlds, the Witcher, Borderlands, etc). 6) The load times: this game (intentionally) has 1996-tier graphics. Why, in 2021, does it move like a snail in molasses every time you switch maps? I generally enjoy isometric RPGS; I wouldn't recommend this one. Divinity 2 or Disco Elysium are better Isometric RPGs. You'll find a more interesting story in the Yakuza games, Disco Elysium, Divinity 2, or Skyrim.. I really wanted to like this game, I went in without any expectations other than I really want to like it, but I couldn't even get past the 2nd story arc. Everything is just so god damn BORING man... The combat is boring even on higher difficulties, the characters all feel bland even though they have some interesting stories... And the locations are the most dull I've ever seen... By the way, whose idea was it to have a huge city separated into 5 different districts with a LOADING SCREEN every time?? And whose idea was it as well to make all of the quests happen in different districts, so you keep having more loading screens than gameplay?? The story also looked to be your bland WRPG story, wow something totally not predestined and obvious happened to you and now you're whacky whacko special, great.. Good story and great characters. It ends there. Combat has some complexity which can be very enjoyable if you give yourself time to work through understanding it. HOWEVER the game is unbearably buggy. Constant crashes when transitioning screens. Minor bugs that break the immersion (e.g. such voice lines jarring or clipping in the environment/characters with each other) to major bugs that make it unplayable (e.g. combat unable to end due to frozen characters or ongoing effects that freeze and crash the game). Would recommend avoiding the PS4 edition.. Pillars of Eternity does what it sets out to do. If feels like a slightly more modern Baldur's Gate but compared to most modern gaming experiences it is slow and oftentimes tedious. If you love Baldur's Gate and want a game with similar depth and mechanisms you may enjoy it but if you wa game that looks and feels like a modern strategic RPG you may want to look for something else.. People say this is one of the best rpg of all time and I just don’t see it! This game feels more like work than fun. It’s combat system is it’s greatest flaw. It’s the pause, select action, wait for it , repeat - system. It almost forces you to play as a tank character, Which I hate! I love a stealthy build but it’s too frustrating for this game. First off, you are so fragile (which is fine I like a challenge) but not in this game where it takes forever to do anything. Need to take a potion? Hope you can wait 10 seconds while being beat by a mob for your character to slowly pour himself a healing Cocktail. Then the heals work over time so you’re dead before you can get it’s effect. Want to sneak up on an enemy? Well expect your party members to barge in and ruin the element of surprise! Want to select your ability and fire a range shot on an unsuspecting mob? Nope, by the time the animation happens they may notice you and cancel your action! I dumped 8 hours into this before I rage quit this broken , dated game ! cocktail. A truly great game and I would give a 9/10 or 10/10. However it has a serious bug that will drop my rating. When in the PS4 version your save-file gets to big you are prevented from loading your save-file. Customer help was not that good and this destroyed the experience. It happen at approx 50% of my play-through. Games should be shipped in a working state and this is unforgivable. Anyone who defends this and even a day 1 patch should rethink about this insanity (Would you accept a car in this state?). The game itself was a spiritual successor to Baldurs gate and a positive example for a successful Kickstarter crowdfunded game. It is set in the world of Eora in the region of the Easter Reaches. The world is a fantasy setting with technology in a development state past the middle-ages as firearms were invented but are not common. A scientific breakthrough has proven the existence of souls and a transfer is possible atop of other possibilities. A plague occurs since a few years were some children were born without a soul. Your player character starts his journey when his caravan is attacked and shortly after he witnessed a strange ritual were he gains the powers of a Watcher. Basically it is a blessing and curse as you can interact with spirits, relive some past events and more. With this you start to investigate the plague and events that changed you. The main story is pretty good, well written and kept me entertained. This is also valid for sidequests and character related once. The recruitable party members have their own personalities, quests and start conversations with each other from time to time which I enjoyed as it gave them more depth (Like in Baldurs Gate 2 and Dragon Age). Special praise for Aloth here. There are also multiple outcomes for some and I was invested in them (Also multiple outcomes / approaches for side quests). Gameplay-wise you create your player character and I advice you to use care and read a guide or two as a few descriptions are a bit of and the mechanics are interwoven. It is comparable to D&D. Chose your race, attributes and character class with its skills / spells / abilities. As you level up you improve the characters. For me the Cipher w( A kind of mind mage) as an interesting concept and got really good later on. Remark: Your chosen background has actually some effects and can help you in certain situations. I have nothing to complain for graphics, soundtrack and art style. It is all excellent. Bonus point for the stronghold and exploration of the underground levels. From this alone we are in the 9-10/10 realm but there are negatives. The already mentioned critical bug should never been in a released game and I will never take people who defend this malpractice serious. You would never accept other products which such flaws like food, your car or your gaming PC. A minor complain is that it took a bit until the game took momentum. Could be below the threshold of others. With this I mean that they stop playing the game shortly after the beginning and wonder why others praise this game. Overall this is an excellent game but I wished I had bought the PC version instead. I want to decrease my rating to 1/10 but think it would be too hard. I will give a 3/10 and it should be a clear sign how good it was that I tolerated this bug so much.. game that was released in 2015 with ps2 graphics + ridiculously long loading times ruined the experience for me.. I just cannot take this much loading time. Otherwise the game would probably be around 7. I liked the story very much, the voice acting is great, the battles are a bit chaotic and found the window of tactical possibilities a bit narrow, but still decent. I feel like they just stole the whole class and progression system from D&D, but since that is decent too I don't really consider it a downside. So it would be a good game really, but the long loading screends just **** the good out of it. I would want to finish it but cant make myself doing it. I could accept if it had like 5 minutes loading time between 2 big areas. Then I would drink, pee, take a short break while it is working. But it has like 1 min loading screen between two levels of a house, or when you enter a tiny cave or anything similar. Imagine: the task is simply to speak with someone in town. You are already in that town but she is in the neighbour-disctrict and in a house on the second floor (ex. one of the main quest giver is like this) that means 5 (FIVE) f*kin loading screen. Out of town when you don't have that much closed spaces it is tolerable (just barely, but it is). But in town it is just too much.. So I ran out of games to play and decided to pick this up. Hands down one of the worst RPG’s I have ever played. The game is physically exhausting to play. All the effort put in to create an immersive experience is wiped away with the constant loading screens at every turn. Divinity Original Sin is 100 times better at ever turn.. F*** ZERO! I'll tell you why: This game has an enormous reliance on stats! And there's are enemy types like ghosts that take **** on your stats. SINCE 2015 has this not been fixed. FOR FIVE YEARS NO PATCH. This defeats the purpose of an RPG. You can't do anything against this enemy except praying. I don't care how great your story or writing is, okay? You're selling an RPG. If your RPG has enemies that you can't do anything about except getting on your knees and praying for the dice to roll in your favor - F*** OFF. I wasted two hours figuring out how to challenge those ghosts only to read on the forums that those are basically balance bugs and there's nothing one can do really. GREAT. WORTHLESS GAME but a great book.. It's been a long time since I've played a game like Pillars of Eternity. A deep role playing game with great tactical control, and amazing magic and combat leveling. One of the biggest selling points for me is always the story, and this game does not disappoint. The idea of children being born without souls, and the impact it would have on society is well explored here. The characters are fleshed out well and the story threads all weave in nicely to form an overall great experience.. Wow the constant lengthy frequent load times and the worst A.I. pathing ever. Yeah they really went for the old school feel not just on the artistic level, but the actual technical level ( ****. executed ). The story and combat was not compelling enough to override the technical mess. I was out after several hours of what is supposed to be a seventy hour journey or something. Glad we can still trade in games on console unlike PC woo hoo!. If you like a game that crashes constantly with ps2 graphics then this is the game for you. If you want a game that that allows you to take a bath between load screens, yes this game can accommodate you! The story is decent but the constant pause screen that automatically pops up every 10 seconds during a fight is insanely annoying. I’m around 90 hours into it and still have a dlc to start. It is a huge time commitment. I like long games but every time you go anywhere, whoop you get an extensively long load screen. It’s probably a good game on computer, but the ps4 just can’t handle it correctly. Nothing is more fun than fighting a boss for half an hour and then having the game crash. Which it does 5 or 6 times every time I play it.. This is an old school isometric game similar to the d & d games that were famous years ago. Everything seems fine, good story, good characters, good options....However THE LOADING TIMES really wreck this game! 1 - 2 mins to load a new location and more than 30 seconds to enter a new room inside a building? This is not acceptable. I nearly fell asleep while this game loaded and I on some occasions thought the game had crashed as the loading bar was soooo slow. The game takes many many hours to complete, this just adds to it, however not in a good way. I commend thee developers for porting this to console, however the load times ruin it. As of writing this review the game has been our about 2 years on ps4 and there has been no patch to improve the loading times at all. Very disappointed indeed.. My personal rating for ""Pillars of Eternity"" (PS4): 7,2/10 - Good Gameplay: 7,5 Video: 7 Audio: 8,5 Scope: 9 Balance: 5 Story: 6. An old school top down RPG, giving everything you could ever want in a RPG, even things you didn't think you wanted.. Amazing game, should be played by anyone who likes these kinds of games. Deep story, deep combat, cool characters. Definitely reccommend buying it. This is a very hard game to review. On one hand it was intended to be a retro style **** on the other hand it's current **** what to pick on? Almost everything I want to say bad can be argued good and vice versa. In the end I guess I'm gonna say this is a game that offers a lot of user options and customization but is a bit on the boring side considering what options have been provided. Gameplay can be tragically slow...pause, command. Instant pause, target unpause..game **** get the picture. Maybe too much pausing wasn't meant to be cuz honestly it really numbs all the immersion the game could of made u feel. That said full player control is appreciated. This truly is my dilemma with this game. I'm not sure without fully random loot drops I'm willing to play this game over and over without micromanaging every battle swing. In essence my ability to pause the game at any given moment allows me to ""attrition"" the game at the cost of me enjoying the real time fantasy version that would surely be an unplayable difficulty but beyond awesome fantasy. Somehow xcom enemy within succeeded with this concept whereas this game didn't. That's not to say I don't really enjoy this game, I actually really do but it feels somehow broken by not allowing the brilliant lore to critically percolate through ****'s just a graze.. Here lies a wonderful hark to RPG's from yesteryear which mimics the playstyle of games such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Champions of North etc. which is sadly marred by a few bugs. If you have played the games mentioned previously then you will know what to expect: an isometric, party based RPG with a combat and magic system which is deep and rewarding and an element of loot grinding. Much of the system is heavily borrowed from Dungeons & Dragons with spells and abilities renamed so as not to encroach on any copyrights. If you know that system of RPG then the learning curve is significantly easier than if you don't. The story is Pillar's best asset and your actions within that affect things which come to pass later which is not to put down any other gameplay element. It's weakest asset? Bugs. I experienced myriad crashes, mainly when loading an area, which caused the game to crash to the dashboard and even once had a corrupted save file due to a crash that occurred during saving the game. If you can get past the game issues and don't mind reloading the game (a bit too often to be honest) then 100+ hours of RPG heaven is right here. I would have rated this at around 92/100 if it wasn't for those bugs.. I just started playing this game a couple of days ago and have put in 8-10 hours already and it is quite challenging. After reading reviews of this game, I have to be honest I am every bit satisified so far. The are a lot of combinations of races, social economics, and character classes to weave your character into. I have to be honest, I didn't know if the PS4 would get some of the really good cprg's for the system, but they seem to be getting them. It's a throwback to PS2 in my opinion. This game has ported over nicely from the computer. The game is challenging not to the point you are so frustrated that the game collects dust. Having a stronghold and building it up is awesome, it reminds me of the Suikoden series. Side quests are varied which is nice.. I signed up to Metacritic just to leave this review. I like fantasy games and I like RPGs. I don't care about graphics. This is just a terrible game. Poor in so many ways. Fanservice - you get an unskippable loading screen to tell you about Kickstarter. You get other loading screens that mention it. Then you get many random NPCs that are written by Kickstarters. Then there are all the memorials dotted around the map written by Kickstarters. Does anyone care about immersion anymore? Loading screens - 36 seconds every time I want to enter a room or area. If you want to talk to someone on the upper floor of a building, it is a two minute wait to get in and out, all together. If you need to reload because you made the wrong decision, it's a good minute and a half of loading screen. I spend more time reading my book than ""playing"" this. Combat - you enter a new area, you meet a couple of huge beetles you dispatch without issue. You open a door - surprise! Six enemies that can kill you without effort. There is no indication in some areas of how tough you need to be in order to advance. Quests - you should NEVER be allowed to unwittingly make a choice that means you cannot advance another quest. I am thinking about letting the spider queen live, which means you can't enchant a weapon. Is there a warning? No. Does it make sense? No. Why should you kill something that is no threat to you? The reputation thing - far too easy to end up with a grab bag of reputation. How can I have a reputation for honesty and deviousness? Wouldn't it be a sliding scale? Unplayable. I'm in Act II and I have decided to try to sell it.. I just don't know what I'm missing here. I very much enjoyed the PC version, but got distracted with a move and never quite returned to it to finish it up. I've been doing a lot of PS4 gaming lately so I was excited to get back into this world to finish up the adventure, but man...what a mess. Between the godawful interface (and I mean, it's just terrible) and the interminable load times (I can wait sometimes a minute or more when going from one floor to another in a dungeon), and I just cannot believe this game wasn't pilloried by reviewers (professional or otherwise). I remember the load times on the PC were pretty bad, but this is ""screw this, I'm uninstalling"" territory especially when considering how small most area are, with each requiring a load screen. I'd give this adaptation one star if it weren't for the awesome game it's based on. The story is still great and the mechanics and play style are a wonderful throwback. Nevertheless, I'm giving this one up and going back to my Steam copy and wishing I'd spent the money on Original Sin instead.. This is a game in Old-school ISO-metric gfx (similar to: Baldurs Gate, Diablo, Icewind Dale, Fallout 1-2 etc) is an outstanding RPG very complex and deep, that has a great story to be told, with interesting characters. It has good voice-acting, but those moments are rare, since this game is a very text-heavy tale, so if you despise reading your stories this RPG might not be for you. Was a bit sceptic at first, since on PC there is so much mouse-clicking, and menus that it simply seems so much better suited for a PC, but it makes me happy to say: this port from PC to console is surprisingly good. Though, not sure if they patched it, but the loading times is horrible, sure not at first, but the longer in you progress, the longer the loading times. Despite this, this is a game I'd warmly recommend to any person who is fond of a text-heavy ISO-metric RPG.. Wasn't to sure about this going in to be honest, after playing witcher, dragon age, Skyrim etc, but wow it had me hooked almost instantly! Loved it, very tactical, can also be very punishing but not make you rage quit punishing, story's great, voice acting great, locations very cool, I even love the art style, genuinely can't fault it, if graphics are all that matters ( which is to me a big issue nowadays, people let it go, if it's a good game it's a good game simple as that, get over it fickle children) then maybe pass, I think it looks and plays great. Do yourself a favour, if you like rpgs give it a try, you won't regret it!. This is a wonderful old-school isometric RPG. Love it! I can imagine it's not for everyone, but if you like old-school RPG (Diablo, Baldurs Gate, Divinity etc.) this is a must have.",i enjoyed some parts of the game but after 3-5 hours you'll have seen all this game can give you . not a bad bad game but i just like more first person rpgs . my main gripe with the game and why I didn’t finish was the insanely long load times .
"1,119.Bravely Default","Solid job system and epic music but I kept finding that the characters and story felt like ""been there done that"" it is the same final fantasy crystal plotline at first fine but very much nothing new. It feels grindy and I felt sudden difficulty spikes and samey-ness. The brave and default system seems less like a boost and break system from octopath, it just seems off. I really don't like the idea of repeating story beats and chapeters 5+ TIMES times to get to the final boss with relatively nothing or little changes to gameplay or story and refighting bosses and such. Seems like a slog why would anyone enjoy that? I respect what this game to a degree but i never felt like it came together fully.. Honestly, this is a game both the critics and fans really got wrong. The only interesting thing about this game is the risk/reward system of the Bravery Mechanic. Everything else? You've seen before. Cliched characters, an uninteresting story, forgettable music, and way too many similarities to the superior Final Fantasy 3. I bought this off the hype everyone was giving it, and I'm honestly wondering if everyone got the wool pulled over their eyes aside from me. Play the DS remake/port of Final Fantasy 3 instead. Skip Bravely Default, and if somebody tells you its good, you'll know they're lying.. Bravely Default is a game that truly lives up to it's title because while it still feels like the same JRPG we have come to expect from Square Enix; it has the courage to give us a new battle system, multiplayer experiences, and a story that all feels so familiar, but experiments far too much to be considered the same thing. Bravely Default is truly a rebirth of what a JRPG can be, and what some imagination outside the box can do for any given genre that is getting a little too old for it's own good. With a well written story, an amazing score soundtrack by REVO, and a lot of ideas that tie up together so wonderfully Bravely Default is a must for anyone!. fantastic game with the best video game soundtrack ever. the story is also one of the best. I love final fantasy, i've played almost all of them, when i saw this game i thought i would like it, and i did for like 3/5 of the game. The jobs are fun to mess around, soundtrack and art direction are absolutely amazing and the story is nice at first. But then the difficulty spikes, and spikes a lot and the game becomes too grindy for me, even in normal difficulty (i've started on hard you see) and im being almost killed by random trash enemies on chapter 4, the balance team really messed up on this one.. A truly vital RPG for everyone to play. While the latter part of the story may seem tedious and repetitive, they pay off is exquisite.. I got the not true ending, which I'm satisfied with. I know you get the true ending by listening to Airy but it was too painful to know i'm falling into a trap. Otherwise, this game is fantastic. It has a pretty straightforward system for dialogue with full voice acting and movement around the map. I think the map design was amazing, I loved Florum and Anchiem, felt really unique and the themes/plot was integrated in the map design such as the citizens turning the cog wheels and the whole town was about cogs. It had a really strong core - good turn based, classes with a unique system (such as stat changes based on class and equip ranks) and the abilities. Somewhere along the lines the game becomes obnoxiously difficult at random places - with the main story line being easy AF - for example, Ch 7 Crowne was literally 2x harder than the final boss. I would have liked to see the sub quests LATER ON explored more - such as the vampire castle, what are these dragons and why am I killing them? The location and markings for the dragon were so cool and exploring for them was awesome but what are they? Also, I thought the amount of times I would end up at a crystal awakening it, going to the pillar of light and repeating I was going to go crazy... Not to mention hearing the same dialogue and awakening things. Opening knocked it out of the park ~prior to the vampire castle 9.1/10; 5-10 hours after that and after doing a few new worlds 8.5/10. Overall with the ending and slow pace and repetitive endings 8.1/ 10.. I was really disappointed from Bravely Default they told me it was the heir of Final Fantasy it is, but is the heir of the very firsts Final Fantasies, not the heir of Final Fantasy VI, and those games aged orribly. This game really looks like it was born old, the story is really boring it has quite good dialogues but what happens is so basic and derivative, it's all a we have to purificate the crystal so we go to that city, but to purificate the crystal we need the dress so we go talking to the sage to know where it is, he says the item is in the cave, than we go to the cave. Everything is so classic and seen already, the best part are the optional dialogues but they're never really fun or deep. And this continues until near the end in the last part there's a plot twist that makes the story slightly interesting that was the only part that made me actually feel like I wanted to know how it continues, even if that plot twist wasn't really well played. Also I really appreciated that Ringabel in the last part becomes serious before he was so annoying, he couldn't end a phrase without making moves on the girls, it was so repetitive to see him doing that every single time. The game also has a couple of plot holes, the greater one is having Edea betraying the army and his father at the beginning, how is possible that a girl that was always told that the vestal is an enemy that would cause great pain to the world if her mission is fulfilled suddenly decides to betray her side and her father only because her collegue wasn't acting fine? Also in the last part there's something you can do to change the course of the events be smart and find out how to reach that final. Anyway what the game gains in the story in the last part is lost in the gameplay that becomes incredibly boring and repetitive. I also expected great things from the battle system, it looked very strategic, but it turned to be extremely basic and simple I imagined one had to use brave and default strategically, but in practice the best strategy is always making the characters attack four time when they can and let another character save bp so he could heal the others if there's need. It would have been a lot better if you could know before if the opponent was going to brave or default than you could decide strategically what to do and you wouldn' mess with the frustration of attacking four times an enemy who defaulted. Also the battle can become boring because they're so long and you have to press a lot of buttons to tell them what to do every turn. The boss battles especially are very long boss have tons of hp. Luckly there's an auto battle option where the characters repeat the last action you chose, but observing that the autobattle is able to win most of the fights just show how repetitive and no strategic the battle system is. I appreciated how the subquest are, they don't have a vast variety but they're near always quite well written and they give you jobs as a reward. Also the world is well done, the world map remembers the one of the old Final Fantasies and it isn't linear, but probably it was possible to do better, on the other side the dungeons are very simple they have a boring level design, sometimes they have very basic puzzles. The thing I enjoyed the most from this game is the art style it's really nice and enjoyable. This game could have easily got a perfect score. But (and not to spoil it) the ending will agitate you. Besides that, it takes our favorite turned based jrpg formula, and improves it immensely. By allowing you to turn off random encounters or even increase it. Provides such a ease of life situation. You can also change the difficultly at any time. Lastly, the main feature of storing your turns, to then do more damage, is satisfying!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The job system is very cool as it lets you customise your character and build the party you want and think up strategies with how in character help one another. The Brave/Default system though is just game breaking. It's dumb. The usual Final Fantasy ""Defend"" command now gives you an extra turn to move later and the Brave command lets you use up to 4 turns st the same time. Simply broken. The story. Amnesia, girl who slowly realises she's wrong, 4 crystals of the elements. You played any Final Fantasy prior to 7? You've played this game basically. I know it's a throw back, but honestly, I'd rather go back to the old school Final Fantasy for the 3rd or 4th time again than play Bravely Default, it won't be as repetitive. And here is the game's bigges problem. Basically, the game takes about 15 hours to beat but...MINOR SPOILER HERE ALTHOUGH IMPORTANT TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING!!! OK, so you finally awaken the last crystal, you've done it! Well, something happens and without saying too much, the world is reset. You need to redo what was the 1st half of the game 8 MORE TIMES to finally see the ending, which is nothing even good. 8 MORE times you'll need to go through the bosses with very little change in dialogue. They basically make you play the game 9 times to see the ending. RPGs are repetitive and it's something I accept from my favourite game genre. But this is absolutely ridiculous. The plot twist is not even shocking. You see it coming very early on. This game is just not worth your time. Repetitive and mediocre. If you want a game like this though with a deep job system, I highly recommend Final Fantasy 3 (DS version) or Final Fantasy 5, any version. Bravely Default was made by the same team and uses the same artstyle as FF3 DS (sole reason I boughy BD) but do yourself a favor, go play FF3 DS instead. You'll thank me and yourself later.. It's refreshing to see people have the same thoughts and reactions to this game as me. It starts off promising with decent story, interesting combat mechanics, and cool character abilities. However,as soon as you get through the main story once... you get to do it 4. More. Times. I spent over 25hours grinding and leveling up just to repeat the same thing 4 more times. This game is repetitive with no good story and hours of grinding to stand a shot against the final boss. Promising combat but predictable story repeated for hours on end. Buy a fire emblem game or something instead of this.. I will admit, I'm very picky about turn based RPGs and hardly ever play them. There are some that I like but this one hit and doubled down on pretty much every gripe I have about this genre. On top of tons of job grinding, this one has time management mechanics and even a pay to win microtransaction they threw in there, how any of that is supposed to be fun or enhance the gameplay in any way is beyond me. Even if you do get a good party going, the late chapters have battles and boss fights so unbalanced that you're forced to loop the same actions until the boss is dead, somtimes for over half an hour. If you step outside of that loop even for one turn then you're probably dead. I can usually stick with an RPG of this size if the story is interesting enough but I barely remember any of what happened. I think I cared less about the characters the further I got. This is one of those games that is so confident the player wont mind it's endless repetition that it continuously adds more and more ways to be a slog on top of it. After dragging my feet to the end of the story, I find out they want me to go around the world and beat all the major bosses again, not once, but like six more times before I can access the final dungeon and true ending. No thanks. The only big positive I would give Bravely Default is that it's beautiful to look at. I think seeing all the diverse locations and set pieces was the driving force for me to keep playing as far as I got. It's just a shame the rest of it had to be so tedious.. A lot of grinding, but deep job system. Good - the shop was done very well. I could easily see which items were equipped, directly compare their stats easily allowing me to conclude which items have been obsolete, without having to exit shop and pull up a menu. This is probably the best shop menu I've encountered. - the voice acting is great, but because the characters are so chibi, it'a a bit hard to take the more serious dialogue serious. - speeding up battle is nice. - Being able to adjust encounter rate is very nice. Adjusting difficulty at any time is useful too. - being able to use a heal (treat) even after blind is nice. - the camera angle is actually very well placed. I can see across various rooms in dungeons, saving me time exploring dead ends. The auto zoom out during no inputs also helps - the background is like a big water painting. Pretty cool. - a fast way back out of the dungeon at the end is a very good inclusion, since there's no shop or healing station before the dungeon boss - auto play is nice - the jobs and abilities learned give a vast amount of ways to battle - being able to go back at any time during command selection is convenient - the game remembering my last command selection between battles is very convenient. Makes grinding very fluent - the new item section is really convenient for checking item details right after I picked it up without having to rummage through all the items for it - voice acting is great - hitting left and right in analog to see status effects of enemy and ally parties is very convenient - the little clue guess who killer of the commander was interesting. - the JP requirements for jobs at later levels we're sets very well. Such that I couldn't grind random encounters in a short time to gain the levels and acquire do really good abilities. this kind of forced me to progress in the story, and fights bosses to get the big JP boost - its satisfying figuring out my own job combinations and beating tough bosses - this is an interesting story about the grey area between right and wrong. And the impossibility of trying to make everyone happy. There is no ideal world where no one suffers. Where one person gains, another loses. - the party's growing uncertainty in their own beliefs stirs questions of my own and makes me want to find out the other side of the story. The side that doesn't want the crystal awakened - being able to equip new weapon and armor during battles is cool - after having accomplished my jobs set up and attained all the abilities I want, it's a good feeling applying it in tough battles and seeing it work. - at first I was very skeptical about having to reawaken the crystals again. But having airy explain the ritual again it hinted at the potential option 2 continue hitting x to break the crystal, which is pretty interesting and unexpected. To me, breaking the crystals was a way to end the game earlier, for those who do not want to grind the same battles again. But at the same time by triggering the finale, I missed out on the whole multiple worlds lore. It's an unfortunate dilemma. - the story is really interesting once the multiple world story arc begins, but the game played becomes completely repetitive and stagnant because the same enemies are rehashed only with more HP and higher attack power. I wanted to continue so that I could progressed in the story but I did not want to grind the same enemies over and over again. Had the game introduced new enemies, new areas, and new scenarios in the other worlds then I would have been inclined to continue with the game since it would be fresh and not a repetitive grind. But unfortunately every area is virtually the same, only with different wild encounters and some different cutscene triggers. - airy being evil was an unexpected twist. Didn't expect the whole crystal awakening was a bad thing either. The game did mask it as a righteous ritual really well. Further disguising her was her cute and cheery look and attitude. Plus her presence on the bottom screen. - I also like how the game gave me a lot chances to stop hitting x during the ritual. - the game made me question what it had made me initially believed. It made me trust the crystal orthodoxy, then turned the table. - I like how there are hints of airy being not gemuine, where she slips up and focuses on awakening crystals over even agnes - I think by the time I reached chapter 7, the developers probably assumed that I knew airy was evil and likely also assumed the player just wanted to go on to more chapters out of curiosity. Even the cutscenes are just rehashed Bad - wish there was an auto attack all, if I selected 4 braves. Against random enemies I usually just use all brave and mash attack. If there was an auto select option, it woulda saved me time. I was so excited to play this game. It had everything I kinda wanted in a jrpg. In many ways it was 10/10 for me. But I honestly can't ignore how bad the last half of the game was. I don't ever write reviews but I honestly regret buying this game because of how bad and pointless the story got. This is the first game that I really disagree with the general consensus on. It does have a good list of pros, but it gets repetitive and lazy. If you haven't bought this game yet...I think you should spoil the story for yourself before you decide to buy it.. Strong points: soundtrack, gameplay with many diverse classes and story Weakpoints: graphics and the dialogue (a bit to childish at times). Xenogears. THis game reminds me of xenogears. Because it starts off exceptionally ~ the intro isnt awful, the characters seem okay. Gameplay isnt bad. The scenery and towns look **** LOOKS like this is going to be a great journey. An hour in: Alright the combat is getting old. Its free to sleep in the first Inn, so this feels like a pokemon game ~ just keep going back to town after a good grind. Repeat. Repeat. The story gets so much worse. How did we get that airship? Whats with the terrible stereotypes? He wont stop talking about womanizing.. but in a non-charming way. She wont stop trying to get rid of us. The fairy always chimes in with 'BUT YOU **** SO INCREDIBLY BAD AT NAVIGATING! You got lost on a path that literally has no wrong way to go.' Grinding. Grinding. The job system is kinda.. not good at all. FFT and Disgaea really spoil someone for other games. I beat xeno gears once. If I knew then what I knew after beating it.. I would have never started the second disk/second half of the game. Knowing that, I quit after the final boss. You. and I. Have better. Things to do. Than believe. There is. A true. Ending.. A wonderful handheld RPG, Music and art style are phenomenal! Customization and battle mechanics are superb! I think the only drawback it has is the looped nature of the 3rd act. Push through though and you'll be rewarded with one of the most satisfying ending I've seen in a game like this since Persona 3.. The job and battle systems are great, the music is amazing, also this games has so many new ideas i never saw on an jrpg, like change your ultimate attack names and send it to help friends online, which actually ties to the plot really well, the bad thing is the voice acting and dialogue are not great, the story is very good but the game makes it SO repetitive, this game could be half as long and it would be better; a Also the use of music in battle and how you can combo it with other ultis with huge speed to get a lot of advantage is crazy and loved the idea. I would say is a must play but dont expect a minblowing story, let's say is like Final Fantasy 5.. The perfect jrpg, sumblime OST and art My favorite videogame, great characters.. Wonderful game, a JRPG masterpiece with so many hints and flavors a-la Final Fantasy but quite different and fresh! This has to be one of my all time favorites! I totally love it!. Rarely does a game I've never heard of make me a diehard fan. I cannot say how much of a hidden gem this was when I first played it. I bought a physical copy and a few months later everyone discovered how great it was, and being out of print, people turned heads and wondered why that was. I'll tell you why. Solid gameplay, beautiful design, excellent story. Gameplay of this game is amazing. It is just the old jobs system, but mixing and matching aspects makes it fun, as well as the simple yet exciting brave/default mechanic. Store up extra turns to attack on a character by defaulting which is just a fancy way to say, block this turn. Next turn that character has an extra turn to take, meaning they can attack twice. That is what braving is. When you use brave, you use an extra turn. However you can brave to go into debt for several turns. Meaning that if you don't defeat the enemy and your whole party goes 2 turns into debt with brave, you will be helpless for 3 turns in a row! It truly becomes a resource of its own, with many classes and abilites giving you extra turns, or costing you an extra turn for a more powerful attack. Enemies can also use this mechanic, so watch out! The art is charming, like a hand painted set from a fairytale. The character designs are a sort of chibi design to make up for the 3DS and its lack of horsepower, and doing so increases the charm of this game somehow, while keeping game performance at the same time. Rough around the edges yes, this game wasn't expected to be anything special. But the solid classic final fantasy combat mixed with what is honestly the best story I've seen out of square to date(I really can't say much lest I spoil it). This game is a sleeper hit. Sadly though it does have more filler than it should, and could easily give you more than enough play time without it(My first save file clocked in at almost 90 hours). The value is here for the price. It is polished for the most part overall, and has a shocking amount of voice over for a 3DS game. Sadly the audio of voices is compressed somewhat to make it fit, but the performances of the actors is top tier save for the memeable ""mrgrgr"" moments....that...that isn't how onomatopoeias work love... Music is top tier too. Whereas some games have nice, but ultimately forgettable music, bravely default tunes are catchy and emotionally engaging. So go out and play this game if you are an RPG fan, you will have a blast!. A solid old School RPG with a great class system pulled out of the old Final Fantasy games like FF3. The game is not to much **** with good balance until the late game where a dark knight build can decimate anyone. However, part of l the charm of the game is to find the best builds and explore new builds. The story is fairly generic but, without spoiling anything, does go in a direction I wasn’t expecting. However, the game does have shortcomings, half-way through the game becomes very repetitive and the story is put on hold, there are also micro transactions which are fairly easy to ignore but worth noting for anyone who wants to pick it up. Building your own town is slow and is fairly tedious, you don’t have much input into the town apart from deciding when to level up a shop. Overall it’s a solid game worth buying for any RPG fan.. There’s much to be said in praise of Bravely Default, perhaps too much to fit into a single review. What must be relayed, however, is that Bravely Default stands as an absolute triumph of both game design and the reinvigoration of old concepts, claiming its rightful place as a giant in the JRPG genre that will surely be remembered as a classic in years to come. Any 3DS owner with even a fleeting interest in role-playing games and a desire to get lost in an incredible, engaging adventure would be doing themselves a huge favour by picking up Bravely Default without delay.. Here me out, please! This game is one of the best games I ever played in my life and I played a colossal amount of games for the past 30 years (on every console and PC). I am not someone who writes tons of reviews, but for this one I must. The good: - Great artwork; - Charismatic characters and nice social interactions between protagosnists; - Innovative Strategic gameplay and customization; - Intelligent and great plot twists; - Awsome humor that dont affect the storytelling of serious moments; - You realy connect with the characters; - Old school style of RPG, like the SNES Final Fantasy, but with modern mechanics; - Balanced difficulty. The bad: - Soundtrack doesnt really stands out, but its not bad; - Like any RPG with and old school base, sometimes you may get lost, but not for too long. This game is innovative in its Job systems. Although many other RPGs are based on Jobs, Bravely Default transformed this old systems into something fresh. You have tons of Jobs that grants yo passive and active abilities that completely makes your characters unique. The Bravely - Default system of battle (hence the name) is completely new and intelligent, changing the flow of battles in a whole new way, not seen before. The story is addicting, emotional and fun, you will not see the time pass. And, if you are like me, you will be please to know that there is no ""crafting system"" **** You just buy gears and thats it. Don't lose the change of playing this game, its a gem.. WOW! I can't believe I missed this game till now! Where was I in 2014 not playing this game? I am baffled how I missed this game till now. This game is absolutely the BEST RPG on the 3DS. The overall gameplay is fun with turn-based setup. So here is my quick review of the game - Graphics - 10/10 because the 3D the artwork and design is so amazing Gameplay - 9/10 - Standard Turnbase Sound/Music - 9/10 - Characters voice are wonderful and music is little bland but overall nice. Characters/Story -10/10 - Absolutely amazing! Wow! How did I miss this? Plot twists but typical JRPG style . The characters are very warm and likeable! I love it! I have played a lot of RPGs on the 3DS but this takes the cake and everybody who is into Turnbase-JRPG games will understand how beautiful this game actually is! I am looking forward to the part 2.. What I really like about this game is the actual 3D! I don't usually turn on my 3D thing but this game is so amazing with it! I LOVE IT! 3DS Masterpiece 10/10!. To be honest I have only finished this game from the third try. At first I found it too difficult. It was my first game of this kind so I was a bit confused in the beginning. However there is a big big problem with this game. Whose idea it was to make gamers do same things over and over again? Not once not twice but freaking 6-7 times! This game mechanics was the most repulsive thing about this game. I liked the music and game design a lot. A LOT. this was one of the things that made me wanna finish this game. I read many reviews saying that many gamers did not like the characters in this game. Well that is just unacceptable! (inside joke). In my opinion they were decent. I really liked many of them and reading the dialogs and watching their relationship developing was another thing that kept me going. So If you are a fan of JRPG and all do not hesitate go and check this game out. As for the others... well... good luck and may the force and determination be with you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Huh, an interesting looking game that tries to break from the normal style of turn based combat. This might be worth a look. -Launched for full price -Includes any form of microtransaction. Nevermind.. I am not a fan of JRPGs or regular RPGs at all, but I must admit that I enjoyed a little bit this game; in fact, it is the first SquareEnix game that I finish. The battle mechanics were fine, the jobs were useful and versatile, the artwork was cool and the soundtrack was almost a masterpiece. The bosses were quite a challenge, but after the ""deja vu sequence"", they were boring. The english dub was awful, so I recommend to play it with the original japanese voices. Maybe one of the main reasons why this game has many mixed and negatives reviews is for the way the plot unfolds. The beginning was mysterious, charming and amazing, but the other half is repetitive. Enjoying this game relies 100% in choosing ""the right path"", while taking the other one feels like a penitence in the purgatory. Perhaps punishing the players that way wasn't the best idea.. It could have been perfect, but to lengthen the game a bit more than it should, the story get a bit repetitive in some chapters. Even so, it is one of the best games of 3ds and a JRPG that creates a young and brilliant saga for the world of videogames.. Well, bought this game when it came out but just now finished it, and im GLAD I played it! has some of the best tradition of the golden era of rpgs (16bit) going on and refines it a little bit. Graphics/art: The towns are marvelous with hand drawing on them, thats the best part, the map is generic and boring so are the dungeons, character art is ok, look way better in the 2d hand drawn inspired from the game. music : is good, nothing special, no tune will be glued to your brain, and here´s a downer, after 70 hours listening the same battle music all over again perfectly makes me never want to play this game again! but overall the tunes are ok. story: is good, the first 30hours are boring and generic, was really worried it wasnt truly going anywhere and the characters also felt boring and simple until things evolve and everything becomes more loveable. but that also has a lot to do with: gameplay: the complex job system and overall battles are the best aspect of this game, truly gets challending in normal mode after 50 hours or so.. its been a while since I found such a challenging rpg that truly requires startegy to win. That leads me to the most controversial aspect of the game. Have you seen the movie the groundhog day? (very minor spoiler) well it does it to you by replaying parts of the game over and over, maybe one or two times would been great and integral to the story, but after 4 you really start to wonder wtf was goign on...until you accept it (my case) as central to the narrative of the game, also some dialogs change to keep things fresh and you get to see different perspectives that blurry the line between the good and the bad guys, that was very well done. (altho 2 times were more than enough to repeat everything in my opinion!) Overall this is a great game and a must play for old rpg fans dont miss it ever!. This is my very first Turn-Based game. Even though am an old gamer and played hundreds of games. But I never was a turn-based fan. This game was something else because the combat was kinda fun and the story and the characters are good enough to make you keep playing. It has some good art to it and nice music. A must play for a Turn based fan specially if you own a 3DS.. I liked Bravely Default a lot started a simple and nice RPG and got more complex aas time goes on. Good history and enjoyable characters. I did end the game and obviously see the problem people have with the ""2° Part"" of the game but still even with this still a good game that i enjoyed and had fun.. There are 2 possible reasons this overrated trash got such high metacritic scores from so called ""professionals"": 1) They never completed this game. After all, this game is huge, and we all know reviewers play their games on easy and never spend more than 2-3 hours before writing a review. I suppose if you look only at the first few hours, this game is a blast. It managed to deceive me too. 2) They were bribed, or scored it highly because of Square and Nintendo The game has good production values, nice visuals and really nice music. It is a blast to play early on, and the gameplay system is not bad at all. But, the problem with this game is that: 1) It is a boring grindfest. It is very long to properly complete, very repetitive with tons of backtracking. And most random encounters are boring, you c","bravely Default is a rebirth of what a JRPG can be . it has the courage to give us a new battle system and multiplayer experiences . with a well written story, an amazing score soundtrack by REVO, the story is also one of the best ."
"1,120.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor","Graphics: 8 / Gameplay: 7 / Story: 7 / Lore/Soundtrack: 9 / Total: 7,75 = 8. Has a great visual palette. I truly enjoyed just watching the character animations. But some of the environmental “puzzles” are just way to difficult considering you are only going from point A to point B. You spend way more time climbing walls than combat. Speaking of combat I truly liked the horde fights. I found them challenging on normal difficulty… but the boss fights? Weak. Not a lot of difference between phases: very few bosses. And a couple of them can be knocked out in a few swipes. Story was Mediocre, I had no idea what my true goals were and was just going from one thing to the next. I know the review sounds harsh but I still give it a 7/10 because it does what it set out to do. And overall I was entertained enough to finish the whole game. However I won’t be bothering with bounties or treasure finding to 100% it.. Half baked, boring, puzzle game with clunky combat sprinkled in. Painfully underwhelming.. I play games for 32 years. I have never seen so bad optimalization in my life. It looks like resolution 320p. Playing in 2025 on PS5 is a very enjoyable experience. Have not experienced any bug or bad performance. The gameplay is great and better than fallen jedi. Overall it's a very good star wars game. Most of the poor reviews are from people who tried to play the game before patches and on low-end hardware/laptops. I played in 2025 after patches and updates on a desktop RTX 3080 (midrange build for 2025). I am also using the DLSS to FSR mod to enable FSR framegen, which transforms the experience. Runs 100-120 fps at a crisp 3413x1920 resolution (DLDSR downscaled to 1440p) with optimised settings (i.e. not ultra everything!) even with RT enabled. This is the first game where I have found RT does actually improve the graphics (other than Indiana Jones where it is forced on). This is a chunky adventure in which exploration is rewarded. The combat is fun, even if there are difficulty spikes. I'm not a fan of such spikes as I have limited gaming time these days (repeating boss fights isn't fun to me), so dropped to easy. I have played 25 hours so far and seem to be about halfway through (I enjoy exploring every nook and cranny). The adventure opens up as you discover new abilities in a metroidvania way. More open level designs and fast travel to mediation points solves the backtracking issues of the previous game, Fallen Order. If it hadn't been for the technical issues and high spec demands of Survivor, I truly believe it would have been heralded as an action adventure masterpiece.. I liked the combat and boss fights enough to finish the game, but the story DISGUSTS me. It's horrific. Every single line of dialogue is stupid and inconsequential. There are no good or interesting characters. Everyone acts like this was written by teenage fanfic writer. I was really hoping they'd finally add reasons to do explorations in this sequel, but it's almost all cosmetic. The builds absolutely do not matter and I stopped changing out my perks 10 hours into the game. There's so much raw material to work with here to make a good game, but whoever writes and designs this just does not have the competence.. In short,what the game has to offer for the most part is parkour and puzzles.Very little combat or other activities.I feel like 70% or more is just navigating around a badly-designed map. The combat is about the same with the first game,maybe slightly improved.Enemy variety is decent at most. The game is susceptible to level-breaking restart requiring bugs.Also,control responsiveness may be bad.Sometimes,because of that,parkour is a nightmare. The story is decent,though more Disney_ish than SW.I do not understand the people who say they do not understand the story or that it is not logically **** is not the best or worst story. Mission design is **** you want to complete the story you have to aimlessly parkour. There is no imersion,after the main story,there is not much to do.Side quest do not go in-depth.Mostly go there,grab that,find that. Although it has its moments,the game is generaly average and I find it quite **** you want to buy it,take this into consideration. A bad launch for pc but after some polishing this is overall great game that har really good combat, exploration and visuals. Great voice acting as well. Story of this game is great. Especially second part of the game is getting better. Gameplay is directly souls-like and I don't have any complaint on this. They implemented mechanics in game very well. I have encountered many bugs. Still great game.. This is my kind of game: a third person action/adventure, with some open maps (but not massive), where you can explore, and can progressively unlock sections and treasures. Story may be a bit weak, but the gameplay overcompensates. They really fixed some issues from the previous game (as the lack of fast travel) and made it bigger and better. Really enjoyed it! (already played it twice). Found it alright, good graphics, good story but be prepared to have your internet browser on standby so you can figure out how to proceed onto the next levels. I would say the game was created by a moron, but that would be an insult to morons around the world. Too many bugs and crashes, as well as bad mechanics and countless stupid fights. A story that is just bad and makes absolutely no sense. It's a petty since Fallen Order was decent enough.. The game is great, it have everything * Really nice graphic * Addictive gameplay * Cool story * Nice and warm characters True Star Wars story, better than most of the films The only problem the game have - technical one, it's very beautiful but didn't run great in some areas. A long, engrossing story, great character development, and some serious peaks and valleys made this a really enjoyable game. At times the game is pretty difficult but changing the difficulty setting is easy, and the story is worth it. It pissed me off occasionally but I’m glad I played. Hope there’s a third.. A whole lot better than the first game. It brings over the combat from the first game but does a good job with the narrative. If you've ever wondered what you'd get by combining Sekiro, God of War, Star Wars, and a smelly turd, then this game is for you.. An absolute masterpiece for both Star Wars and Soulsborne fans alike! Fallen Order was excellent and Survivor just adds to Cal's amazing story! 9/10!. It's everything I would want in a Star Wars game. The lightsaber powers builds on from the previous Fallen Order game. The world is greatly expanded. Above all, the story is better than the movies from Disney by a very long mile. In terms of plot, there are many surprises throughout. I highly recommend this game for anyone ... especially true Star Wars fans.. 8,5/10 Points: Great sequel to Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order! The Story was really good especially the ending part of the game was really surprising and twisty which I really enjoyed! Having so much sword combat techniques were cool and offered a lot of different playstyles. They also improved the biggest flaw of the previous Fallen Order game, the backtracking! If you now finished the story part of an planet or level you get an shortcut back to the beginning and dont have to walk/parkour threw the entire level back! I also liked that Cal is now older and has more beard and experience in his jedi bones :-) Only dissapointment for me was that the PS5 Pro Enhanced mode was joke! There is in my opinion no pro mode here at all! Same 30FPS quality mode or 60FPS with blurry textures and graphical issues.... this game is really beautiful but it has a flaw like this, you play the game and it flows very well until the last 2 hours, after the last 2 hours, the scenes and story flow in the game were very rushed and this caused the end of the game to be half-assed. when I came to the end of the game, I didn't even realize that I was in the final scene of the game, for example, the first game started beautifully and ended in an epic way, and this game ends just like that. Even though the last boss of this game was average, it was an uninspiring boss to be the last boss.Translated with **** (free version). It’s not a perfect game but it’s a very good Star Wars game. PS5 performance mode is great, enjoying the game!. Ps5 full of bugs, 15 hours in and stuck in bug with only option to start new game. DON NOT RELY ON AUTOSAVE. SAVE MANUALLY REGULARLY!. Pretty good, and fun, but they could lengthen the story, and add a couple more mechanics.. Worse dialogue than the predecesor and doesn't improve in nearly anything except for allowing dismemberment of the troopers. This is Marvel-style dialogue but not from the 2010-2015ish era but 2020-now dialogue, just cringe and I really don't like any of the characters barring the evil girlfriend from the first game and I'm meh about her. It's not a bad game but the visuals are at the same level, maybe even slightly worse and the combat is the same. For me the dialogue is just so, so terrible and childish that it actually takes me out of the experience, I don't think the writers can write for anybody above the age of 10. I'm just disappointed, I expect mature conversations and it's a considerable step down from Fallen Order. As for positives, I guess you can now customize your lightsaber in 5 places rather than the edges and the hilt as in Fallen Order, I mean, I don't think a single person cares but okay. Your droid has more customization but it doesn't matterially change the model. It's just fluff. The game expects us to believe we're in one of the darkest eras of galactic history, the empire is everywhere and any gains made by the Resistance are offset by the ever growing military might of the forces of evil. And then everyone is chatting as though they're in the supermarket choosing which brand of milk they're going to buy. I'm so, so, so massively disappointed.. This is a very weird sequel. First, it totally ditches the first part and ending story thread. It resets most things. Then, it feels weird. The story is a bit inconsistent and incoherent. The level design is much, much worse than the first. Overall, it feels like a rushed sequel because they had to make one. Doesn't seem like they had anything new to share story-wise.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After its initial launch, *Jedi Survivor* faced some significant challenges, but with the recent patches, it has truly transformed into an exceptional experience that Star Wars fans and gamers alike can appreciate. Visually, the game is stunning. The environments are richly detailed, from the lush greenery of the planets to the intricacies of the galactic architecture. The graphics have improved significantly following the updates, making the exploration of each world even more immersive. Gameplay mechanics have also seen considerable enhancement. The combat system is fluid and engaging, providing a satisfying blend of lightsaber dueling and Force abilities. The responsiveness of controls has improved, allowing for a more seamless experience as you engage in battles against various foes. The addition of new abilities and upgrades post-patch has added depth to character progression, making each encounter feel fresh and rewarding. The narrative continues to shine, maintaining a strong connection to the Star Wars lore while introducing new, compelling characters. The voice acting is top-notch, and the story arcs are well-crafted, delivering emotional moments that resonate with players. However, there are still minor issues to iron out, such as occasional frame rate drops in more chaotic scenes and some AI companions that could use a bit more polish. Yet, these are overshadowed by the overall quality of the game. In conclusion, *Jedi Survivor* is a remarkable journey through the Star Wars universe, offering a blend of captivating storytelling, stunning visuals, and engaging gameplay. With the fixes implemented, it stands tall as a worthy sequel and a must-play for fans of the franchise. A solid 9/10!. I loved it before and now with PS5 PRO it’s a masterpiece complete! Love it and highly recommend it. As difficult it may be to get running smoothly, like its predecessor (only a little rougher), Respawn has developed a substantially significant Star Wars sequel, with more exciting gameplay, amazingly expansive worlds, and a continuously satisfying story, though some of the new characters seem too much on the cheesy side.. This game is excellent, my only complaint is that there is no space combat.. Plot is formulaic, performance is pretty bad, and the combat is good but not as good as in the Jedi Knight games.. First 10 hours: Fantastic gameplay, stunning visuals, and a truly impressive level of detail put into the different lightsaber mechanics and open world design. This feels like a proper current-gen game with everything they 've packed into this game. 10+ hours: This game is graphically broken, and the story just ****. The lightsaber combat and overall gameplay is awesome... but for a linear story-based game, they really should have put more effort into it. The character arcs and different villains just feel lazy (classic Disney BS). Knowing how the story plays out might prevent me from wanting to go back and replay it one day. .. This game is better than its predecessor in nearly every way. I would recommend playing the first game first because the second one builds on the story and gameplay more than I could have ever dreamed.. This game is simply amazing. Best star wars game ever! Go and play it. It does not deserve its low user score at all.. A masterpiece, even better than it's predecessor Good story, good gameplay. A must buy. Best Star Wars product in the last 10 years. Everything that happensin the game feels suitable. Really enjoyable game for all Star Wars fans. It has some issues, but is more a design things like the holomap, the collectables and a very important performance issues when you are at 80% of the game at big areas that can make the game crashes plus with non autosave system it can be frustrating if it occurs.. Well-documented performance issues aside, this is an excellent follow up to Fallen Order.. One my all time favorite games. Awesome cast of characters, living worlds, engaging side quests/puzzles, replayability, fun and challenging combat, rewarding customization, and most of all it has that quirky, yet gritty star wars feel.. Navigation terrible. Map terrible. Framerate terrible. Action game that has janky animations and epileptic enemies left and right. More bad things than good things in a game. It feels unfinished and unpolished. The Quality of Video games coming out in America is so bad. What's happening with the gaming industry there.. The gameplay is still fun but Ithink this game wasn’t as good as the first one. The story is very weak, it keeps switching villains and never really locks into a good arc. The end has a note of emotion but is otherwise very anticlimactic and relies on characters we only really engage with at the very end. some bosses are ok, but on grand master they’re so drawn out that if you get OHK’d it quickly becomes a real drag to get through all the stages and cutscenes again. And on that note the OHKs and stunlocks make this game infuriating on GM which is too bad. even Fromsoft doesn’t rely on OHKs or stunlcoks to make fights difficult most of the time and they’re much harder games but they’re fun because of it. I’d love to see better boss design in the third game. I also felt that the gimmick vehicle section which saw us use an ATAT in the first one which was awesome, was really lame this time. And of course the performance issues. Sadly all of this detracts from what is still a good idea at its core, and what could be a really amazing game with more polish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game looks decent, story is good and characters are mostly likeable. The downside is the gameplay itself. Open world in this game simply isn't fun because every 3 meters there are 5 locked doors you can't enter unless you have beaten the game and unlocked all abilitys. This totally breaks the imersion of the game. Also most of the ""sidequest"" are only accessable after the main story. Gameplay is okay, weapon stances are nice and it truly shines in 1v1 bossfights. Fights against more enemys are too caotic and barely managable. Be aware that around 60-70% of the games are climbing and solving puzzles, which is okay but not in that high percentage. It's getting repetetive very quick. Tbh if you play a guy with a lightsaber you want to use it as much as you can. This game would be way better with a linear gameplay and less backtracking. I really would like to rate it higher but i can't because of the previous reasons.. Generally good but the way the game plays is confusing. I couldn't count the amount of times I got lost in this game and had to look up a solution. Overall I would only play this if you are a hardcore star wars fan and can overlook the flaws.. When it first came out poor optimization scared me away so a waited. I loved the first game and loved this even more. I loved the graphics, parkours, fights etc. Story and world design was phenomenal too. Cinematics were high quality.. Loved the first one, love this one even better on myps5.Smooth 60fps on performance mode,great graphics.Good story and characters.Amazing gameplay,best light saber fighting game and nice platforming throughs **** a must play.. Seriously one of the best modern entries into Star Wars canon. The gameplay, the voice acting, and the ability to explore the planets are the highlights for me. The Mos Eisley Cantina style bar was a great addition to the game. It’s seriously just such a fun time. 9/10. Just finished the game and I must say… that the first one was better. Fighting is very similar, but they added some not very interesting variations. No complains, but nothing really groundbreaking. Graphics is great. Now for the worse part. Story is total nonsense. Everybody fight like hell but for what really? Don’t want to spoil anything, but character motivations are pretty weak and unbelievable. Game is full of glitches and crashes from time to time. Framerate sometimes dips to like 5 fps. Generally its more of the same, but with worse story. I’ve replayed first one right after finishing it. This one, I’m done with and removing from disk. Just play the „Fallen Order”. And maybe get this one later on on sale.. This game is absolutely FANTASTIC!!! WELL DONE GREAT JOB!!! PLEASE CONTINUE THIS GAME!!! + Graphics is beautiful + Many kind of customisable options + Fantastic story + GREAT fighting system LOVE ITTHANK YOU. Story: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Visuals: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Better than the first games.. “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor” is one of the most fun action games I have ever played with unbelievably good combat. Outside of some small bugs and a somewhat weak ending, this is one of the best Star Wars games yet and even tends to be quite replayable.. The optimization isn't very good but if you ignore that than it's a fantastic game with incredible visuals, a well written story and well designed combat. Just horrible level design. I got to Jeddah and gave up. This game has fun combat but the level design is terrible.. The game continues on a high and distances itself from the EA Battelfront and SW skinngames games of late. The SW Jedi franchise really excites a star wars Fanboy / Fangirl at least for now. Original characters are woven in to the game without giving the player a sensation of forced content. One thing that bugged me out a little was the inflationary amount of spacetravel to get from one planet to another just to access some space you couldn’t the last time you got there.. A great Star Wars story AND great gameplay and a fun map. Better than Fallen Order and a great sequel in all aspects. I really hope this story continues as it's peak Star Wars.. An obviously unfinished steaming pile of excrement. I am willing to bet that no one playtested this. They managed to present a sequel that it is worse than its predecessor instead of improving on the decent gameplay that the previous game had. For the first time I found myself playing with the (equivalent of the) spellcasting archetype just to avoid the *horrible* job they did with the combat system. The only improvement was in the platforming, which was interesting. Extremely unfun, avoid at all cost. Never buy above 4.99. (I platinumed the game at maximum difficulty, perhaps your experience would be better if you focused on story mode). The story is really touching, and the battles and level design are awesome. But I've had some annoying crashes, so I’m giving it a 9.. I'm not sure if we all are playing the same game, but it runs great on PS5. Any software has a few bugs. But I think the negative reviews are just unfair. I haven't finished the game yet, but I think it's very good so far. A lot of improvements have been made compared to the first one. Ok, the cutscenes runs only in 30 FPS because the quality level increases during this scenes. Personally, I would also be fine with performance mode cutscenes. I'm also not the biggest fan of the cast of Cal. I would prefer a character editor. But anyway... I read the bad reviews and hesitated until I finally bought the game now. If you don't know yet, just try it and ignore the weird reviews here. The game runs smoothly and it's a great singleplayer game which should be supported by us. There is no legit reason for the terrible reviews. Do better if you think so. I hope for a third game of Star Wars Jedi. Maybe I'll update my review after I finish the game. Update: The game is better then expected. But I missed some more interessting and more epic scene. It's a little too flat in my opinion. But I don't regret it.. Performance Bad, Game is a blast. WHY EA???? I cant wait for the next game.. Performance issues on launch were terrible and the graphics are dissapointing at times. gameplay is a slight improvement over the first game and the story is great up until the very end. Second game in the franchise, I loved it, although the FPS drops were a significant issue. The story is excellent, and the character losses were truly impactful, adding a deep emotional layer to the game. I especially enjoyed the part where Cal briefly turns to the dark side of the Force. Now, I’m curious to see how the third game in the franchise will unfold and what directions the story will take.. It‘s a fun game. Played it through EA Play just now, had no bugs or any other kinds of errors. Felt like a Star Wars experience. Story is ok, nothing really new, but I didn‘t expect the game to reinvent the wheel, I just wanted to have a fun time. And that, my little boglings, I did have.. I was very excited for this sequel, but this game was unplayable for me. My save file keeps bugging and locking me out of the game. I've spent around 20 hours progressing save files which eventually just get locked. The game feels like a scam, don't trust EA. Story- I found this to be a natural continuation of the Jedi Fallen Order Storyline with Cal Kestis and BD-1. The storyline/ game progression is a little less linear than the first, but the overall presentation of the story felt more developed/ refined. For fans of the old team like me, Merril, Cere, and Greez, are all back. If you want a modern, lore accurate, intelligent, and well-crafted Star Wars story outside of the cinema, then this is, in my opinion, the best that is out there right now. Gameplay- The core gameplay is still the same from the original. The experience/ skill point system is identical to what was in place before. Platforming is still a big part of the game, and I feel it is still just as satisfying wall running and climbing with Cal as it did in the first game. One of the things I enjoyed most in the last game was scooting back and forth across ziplines with BD-1, and that is still here (along with a few new actions for the little one). As was stated above in the Story Section, this is less linear than the first. So be prepared to revisit different worlds and areas as the game progresses in order to unlock new upgrades/gear and progress through the storyline Combat- Force push your enemies off a cliff, pull them into you and stab them, or mind trick them into fighting each other. The core game mechanics that made Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order are still here. The game has polished a few of the core mechanics (e.g. the doge mechanics feel more responsive allowing for easier perfect doges,). They have also added two additional combat stances (crossguard and blaster stance) making a total of five stances you can choose from throughout the game. Each stance has its own strengths and weaknesses but, overall I found all five stances to be viable and very enjoyable to play with. Graphics - The game looks good with no screen tearing, wonky distortions or anything like that. I don't usually care what a game looks like. If we have screen tearing, textures popping in and out, or other graphical defects, then I will make a point of it. None here. Conclusion - This to me is what a Star Wars action game should be. It has a great story. It has intriguing and likable characters. Platforming and puzzle solving is fun. The combat is refined, fair and diverse. The only thing I found to be a negative with this game is that sometimes the non-linear nature of the game can feel a little tiring. On a few occasions I needed to stand around and wait for BD-1 to give me a few clues before I knew what needed to be done in order to progress. Great game for star wars fans the combat is fun and I only have 2 complaints 1. It's got kinda a metroidvania style where there's multiple paths and full of backtracking and 2. Way to much puzzles I had to look up quite a few they should defiantly have less in the 3rd game. The best Star Wars game ever made followed by fallen order. If you are a Star Wars fan this is a must play.. I genuinely think this is a perfect game. Obviously I think things could be made better but you could say that about any game RDR2, TLOU, Ocarina of Time, etc. The game just gets everything right though. The story/characters/Staying true to star Wars/gameplay, etc. For me it’s in the top 4 Star Wars pieces of media ever made. I’m not 100% sure where I put it within the top 4 but I think it more than deserves that high rank. The gameplay is immaculate. It’s like playing uncharted but with the gameplay mechanics and design of a From Soft game. It nails both sides of that dynamic and I think it manages to be just as good at executing those design aspects as the games that inspired it. I know some From Soft fans would freak out over this statement but I 100% believe it. Yes FS elevates the bosses to an insane level and offers a higher level of difficulty at times. Jedi S manages to offer an experience that will be a joy and a challenge for a way wider range of players. A casual player will have fun and still have a challenge in the easier difficulties while the hardest will do the same even for a Souls player. It’s not quite as hard but it also doesn’t have a ton of exploits like FS games do so you can’t cheese a boss fight if you’re struggling. You’ll have to properly best the boss. Difficulty aside i genuinely find the gameplay more fun and fulfilling than FS games. After beating a hard boss I felt way better about it. I feel like I’m utilizing all the skills I’ve learned and besting a challenging enemy while getting fulfillment emotionally because of the great story telling. FS a lot of time you end up kind of cheesing either through using cheap mechanic breaking techniques or using broken power ups. You can stay true and have a clean fight but the bosses feel like they’re asking to be cheesed with how egregious their moves or whatever advantages they’re using against you. While this never happens once in Jedi S. It always feels like a clean well designed challenge that makes sense in the world. The semi open world is done very well and is fun to explore. The traversal abilities you learn are a delight and spread out until almost the very end so you’re constantly getting new ways of traversing and therefore gaining new areas to explore from beginning to end. Now just to not make this even longer. I’ll just say vaguely how much I think the story/characters/Star Wars universe is all done to perfection. Cal is genuinely my favorite Jedi now because of how well done he is. The other characters are also well written and earn the attachments that the story assumes you’ll form. The story and vibe stay true to Star Wars better than any media made by someone without the name George Lucas. This is a huge feat because how rarely people get this right. Also it speaks volumes because it has been done right by others before and those are great but I still believe Jedi S has eclipsed them. I can’t wait for the third entry. Just as I think the next open world FS makes will be far better than Elden Ring. I think the same about the next Jedi game; for the same reason. They seem to have both taken a big step forward into a new scale game and nailed the landing. However, with this experience under their belt I believe both devs will have the knowledge to elevate the next games and iron out the few flaws that both games had. I really hope we’ll see Cal and these other characters again. A show being made following them would be a dream come true and could be made to release around the time of the next game. That’s a lofty idea but I do at least hope they’ll at least get a cameo in live action. I really think the games could go on further past a third and I hope Respawn agrees. They’ve just struck gold with this series and I hope they decide to keep it going. I 100% recommended playing this game. The only reason it’s not getting a 10 is because of performance issues. On PC it has problems and I have got it to work great maxed out, RT, 1440, at 120 fps and it was a game changer. It elevated the game greatly. To get this though I had to buy a mod that injects fsr3 which improves the visually, gets rid of a lot of blurring and artifacting the game suffered from due to fsr2, more importantly the fsr3 added frame generation. Doubles the fps from 60 to 120. So if you’re on pc I recommend it.(Modder named Luke, that’s all I say you’ll be able to find it if you look.) So it’s fixable but not without modding.I hope the next game on UE5 will fix these issues. Just as cool as Fallen Order. Many many QOL improvements and traversal is way smoother.. i tried playing on pc, it does not even work. Constant stuttering even after lowering the graphics to the point, i cant even see the faces. ALL OF THIS AFTER A YEAR SINCE ITS RELEASE. Well I’m 30 minutes in and the game has frozen completely on me twice and required a restart. It’s been out for over a year….. Toooooo long story with unnecessary adjustments. They tried to put all chrachters into one main weak story. They totally unconnected. Weapons become useless unless you make them available. Very poor game, kind of waste of time… pity how good first game was…. The game is quite good. It fell short of Fallen Order's standards. The story was uninteresting because it lacked engagement. The physics seemed funny, like what was that wall jump-climb physics? I'd rather play the Fallen Order and learn about the Survivor's story (which would only take 30 minutes). This is a game that is actually worth to play. It's a openworld (kinda) combat system game that is very smooth. U choose your own light saber color, own fighting style, and customize your own character.. Played in June 2024 (assuming some bugs were worked out before I played) This is one of the best games I've ever played. Hands down. I loved it. The first one was grea","i really enjoyed just watching the character animations . but some of the environmental ""puzzles"" are just way too difficult . the boss fights are weak and a couple of them can be knocked out in a few swipes ."
"1,121.Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II","Strategy aspect was weaker to other dawn of war games but this one by far has the best story/story telling. Was about to give 10 but at the end of the game it got repetitive, still had so much fun.. The game is going through a major identity crisis. It is not clear whether it is a cRPG or an RTS. It tries to be both at the same time and fails at both. It didn't bother me at all that the game is not a pure RTS. But it would have been better if it was a pure RPG and the RTS mechanics were completely removed from the game, or vice versa. As it is, it's caught between two game genres and it's pretty mediocre. Relic Entertaintment, on the other hand, has become one of the worst game developers I've ever seen, because the terrible gameplay mechanics that they've persistently maintained since the first game in the series, with no interest in fixing or changing them, are still there in the second game. The unit controls are pretty horrible. I mean, has nobody in the development team ever played a game from the Age of Empires series in their life? Units never follow your orders as they should, and they never move where you direct them on the map without getting stuck. And they still won't let you change the controls of the game! I've played hundreds of games in my life and this is the first time I've ever seen a game series where I can't change the controls. Everything else about the game, including the default controls, has been terrible since the first game. They tried to add RPG mechanics to the game, but we need an active pause to be able to use the units' special abilities without missing the timing, but they can't even add that because they have no idea what they're doing. They don't know how to make an RTS or a cRPG game. Games Workshop probably regrets now that they didn't give Blizzard the rights to develop the Warhammer games at the time, because not only did they make Blizzard a bigger company than they could have been, but they also failed to make the Warhammer games as successful and popular as they should have been. At least they could take Blizzard's example in making these games, but they can't even do that. Arrogance is unfortunately such a harmful thing. At least thanks to them, the Warcraft game series was created.. Decent game, awful boss fights at higher difficulty settings, very repetitive maps and enemy layouts, close to no ""strategy"" involved as you'll find yourself using the same combination of abilities the entire playthrough regardless of enemies and locations.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still holds up in 2022. Nice character customisation and building your own squad of space marines never gets old.. It's a solid game. Pros.: - Unlike Dawn of War, there is a strong story. - Emphasis on different squads. - RPG element (very simple). - Need to plan strats with the squads. - Chaos rising raises the quality. Cons.: - Same maps. Same **** - The twists could be done better, more developed and complicated. - Map design is one of the weakest points.. Once you get used to the main change from DoW (no base building) and read up a bit about what's going on (no tutorial) this is an enjoyable game. Graphics are very good considering the age (although cut scene graphical quality is poor). Very much enjoyed playing through this and look forward to playing Chaos Rising.. loved the game, the change to squad tactics was fun, i enjoy a good rts like the next guy, but this game suprised me. nice. Great game, it changed the way the genre was from base building/unit production(spam) to the real sense of Hero units that take on thousands of enemies. I never got into the 40k universe until after DW2. DW2 managed to deliver the fantasy for me that these are superior beings, capable of taking on hundreds of enemies and get some wounds along the way. The game itself is well done, you have the concept of cover being implemented in a seamless way, your units feel powerful behind it and pretty exposed when out in the open. Hero upgrade lines make a difference. Do you want to play melee or ranged? Upgrade energy or health, all these choices make a difference. There are go-to builds, but the choice still exists. Weapon and armor upgrades deliver that big upgrade (especially the freedom of changing the type of weapon). While some weapons are better than others, you can make some excellent combinations (Perma-Stealth + Shotgun). I still wished for better range of weapons, sadly in some aspects, it does fall flat, only 1 good shotgun every 6 levels makes such freedom feel very limit. Or getting a great bolter and no 1h upgrade when you're going for a melee build. The story itself is pretty well done! You have that banter going on that feels natural for these characters. It's not over the top and delivers a story you can believe in. You feel the intensity of an invasion in the story and the gameplay. The game isn't without some flaws. Weapon selection, talent builds, playing on the highest difficulty requires a single specific build across units removing all freedom you had on medium difficulty. Overall it was a great game. I highly recommend it, especially if you've never played in a 40k universe before.. -I would almost say that Dawn of War II is an ActionRPG (although handling 4 characters at a time) disguised as RTS (without resource management). Very worked in the graphic aspect. Maybe something repetitive to go forward during missions if we except the final boss. -Casi diría que Dawn of War II es un ActionRPG (aunque manejando a 4 personajes a la vez) disfrazado de RTS (sin gestión de recursos). Muy trabajado en el aspecto grafico. Quizá algo repetitivo el ir avanzando durante misiones si exceptuamos el jefe final.. So different from the original Dawn of War it can surprise you. But it is great. It has an amazing atmosphere, nice story and really fun gameplay much closer to Warhammer 40 000 lore than the original games were.. If you are a fan of Warhammer 40k you may rate this game with an 8 or more but even if you are not a fan, this is a decent game with nice graphics. Voices in Spanish were good although they were not syncronized with the lips (I bet in English it's far better). I played for almost 5 hours (this is till 12th mission out of 17th) until I got stuck. I probably could keep advancing in the game but because it's a shooting game I don't care if I don't finish it. I recommend to play one hour a day or at least rest for 10-15 minutes for every hour because this is an stressful game so you can get your eyes red if you are not careful. Remember to blink from time to time. Overall, I wouldn't give to this game more than a 7 unless you are very fan of Warhammer games.. I love strategy games, I love the Warhammer 40k universe, and this game is one of the best examples of the later (the voice acting is superb). Caveat Emptor: Personally I play games in singleplayer, competitive players looking for a fully fleshed online mode are better off playing Dawn of War I instead.. On the first thought, that game was a huge disappointment, but after many hours I must admit it was fun though. Although too many elements of RTS's genre were taken away, there're a few changes (crossover with RPG structure) that made game more enjoyable, It's also good to see Tyranids in not that bad story with interesting characters and side threads, even if the silent protagonist wasn't exactly the bullseye. Main campaign has some good moments but it becomes predictable and monotonous after a while, specially side missions. I think every fan of DoW should give it a try.. Quite different from the previous game system, but still is a great game, very fast, good graphic, nice units, it should be considered a lot more by sega btw let's see the III. If You can take the unofficial Elite expansion, really great additions, the one You would like to see from the original producer.. COH approach and it bloody works! No more annoying meatgrinder from the first game. The game is really polished, albeit pretty linear. The campaign has a fast tempo and is well scripted. Several tactical approaches possible, each quite satisfying. Another gem is a personalised squad that offers a load of customisation. - : still no proper strategic map or operational freedom.. Among my favorite Warhammer titles and favorite strategy games period, Dawn of War II is the beginning of a three-part epic tale of the battle for the Blood Ravens' recruitment worlds, continued with the Chaos Rising expansion and concluded in the stand-alone Retribution. This title represented a considerable departure gameplay wise from the first Dawn of War and its expansions, moving away from base building, resource gathering and large-scale battles towards a smaller squad tactics format seen in the earlier Company of Heroes series, from which Dawn of War II borrowed its graphics engine: a shift that was not universally welcomed. Dawn of War II is a blend of real-time squad tactics and an RPG loot-and-level system that I found deeply engrossing. The campaign is heavily story-driven and takes you to a variety of environments, including the interior of a space hulk made famous by the turn-based series of that name. Excellent music, visual effects and voice work accompany the proceedings. Series mainstays the Space Marines, Orks and Eldar returned, along with newcomers in the fearsome Tyranids, not featured in the first game due to, supposedly, engine limitations. Epic, pitched battles and a surprising end-game return of a popular character from the first game wrapped up the experience for me in the best way possible. The main flaw of DOW II was its use of the Games For Windows Live client, but it has since been updated to remove that particular pustule. An excellent title overall and worth playing today.. I tried so hard to like this game but I just can't get over how simplistic it is, even on harder difficulties. Any unit works against any enemy and the lack of strategy is boring to the point of being painful. Yes the graphics are great, but that doesn't excuse or make up for how much they've cut away from the original franchise.. I will start with this; I was disappointed. I have played the Dawn of War series since the first part. For those who have played the first part, think about what you had to do. You had to build a base, manage resources, and place defenses to protect you from the enemy. Dawn of War 2 takes that, and throws it out the window. In the multiplayer mode (I'll get onto the rest later), all you have is one building and two turrets. All the units are available in this one building, and there is only one unit that can place turrets. The strategic points, crit points and slag deposits are gone, and in their places are power and requisition resource points. I understand that some people will say that it focuses more on the tactics, but in the 1st game you had to plan out not only where to go but how to manage your resources. The games that I've played, both with bots and other players, were horrendously short compared to the first. None of that artillery and heavy vehicles also, apart from two or three tanks. I also have to point out the absurdness of the DLC's. The Chaos Space Marines (!) are locked off, and instead we get a Zerg-like alien race. I judge the game by what the base game is, and not by what the DLC's add in. What is even more annoying is that the game even allows you to play against them, the game shows you the race, waves it in front of your face, then snatches it away and asks for another 10 Euros. At least in the first game the races just did not show up if you didn't own them. In conclusion, the multiplayer mode is an offense to the first game. If you want the multiplayer, get Dawn of War 1 with the Dark Crusade DLC. It will be cheaper and more fun than the Second game with the Dark Crusade DLC (I heard that the Retribution is actually decent) Moving on to the single-player. The story follows a newly-appointed Force Commander of the space marines - whose name we choose - and his squad. I won't say any more to avoid spoilers. The story is very good. I really like that the squad leaders have names: Tarkus - the leader of the tactical marines, Cyrus, the leader of the Scouts, and more. The voice acting is good and the different teams have lots of diversity. One thing that has been mucked up in the story is the acquiring of Wargear (I'm not even going to mention the tons of Wargear DLC). Wargear is... wait for it... dropped! The whole sense of achievement and customization is gone and replaced with crates that drop the wargear. The rest, though is fairly good. Now we come on to the Last Stand mode (By the way, there's a DLC that allows you to play the Last Stand mode! What's the difference? You don't have to open Dawn of War 2! Let me ask you. Is this worth 7 Euros?), and while the mode is fun. It is quite repetitive and unless you want to pay 10 Euros for the Chaos rising DLC, this time two races are locked off! By this rate in the next dawn of war you will have to buy a DLC to play as the Space Marines. This time we are deprived of the Tyranids - the alien race, which would be very useful for this mode. Basically we are thrown into an arena with two other players and we have to survive as long as we can (sound familiar?)In this mode, the random wargear drops make more sense, but what's the point if you can just buy the DLC and get it right away? And here I come to the biggest problem with the game. The DLC's. There are 22 of them! Literally, I checked on Steam. This includes: the last standalone- The Last Stand in a Standalone client version(7 Euros). Wagear Packs (7 packs 1 euro a piece) The Ultramarines pack - a replacer for the marines (7 Euros). Keep in mind that all the above mentioned are DLC's that only work if you get retribution.(15 Euros). There are DLC's for DLC's in this game! But I'm not done. There are also Wargears for Last Standlaone, and skin pack that cost 7 Euros. The Grand Master Edition of this game( All DLC's) costs 58 euros! For around that cost that cost you could get the first game with the Dark Crusade addon for you and two friends (It would cost approx 60 Euros). The amount of DLC's is shocking. This puts Call of Duty to shame. If you value your money, wait for a sale. Alternatively, get the First game, buy the Dark Crusade DLC and install a graphics mod. It's cheaper. I have to give credit to the voice actors and to the team behind the graphics. As to the rest, a poor effort. For a few steps forward and many leaps back, I give this game a 3 out of 10.. Very bad game, I do not recommend. My score is 0, sorry only that he can not below 0, the game is boring as all the strategies, the only thing that coh 2 game worse than this. dumbed down version of the originals and the expansions are poor as well hopefully dawn of war 3 will go back to its roots........................................................... To put it simply, Dawn of War II had really enjoyable campaign and co-op modes, but the multiplayer competitive play? I'd give that a miss, though the new mechanics introduced and abolition of base construction made for a unique campaign experience, in multiplayer it just feels awkward and dull.. I think it's a joke, that you can't build ""normal"" buildings like in the first Dawn of War. This means the campaign and the normal battles aren't really interesting. I don't like that the Imperial Army and the Chaos Space Marines aren't playable in this version.. Absolute and utter crap. It seems like fun the first couple of missions, and a steady stream of gear and loot. However suddenly it turn into an absolute crapfest. You think you've got better and better gear, however for some reason the enemy gets just 10x faster upgrades or something. At midgame, my entire team got entirely wiped out from a single attack by a boss. It makes you angry because it's no strategy or tactics involved whatsoever. Feels like a cheap and crappy android pay-to-win game. As a former Warhammer player, I am sad to say this game has wasted 5-6 hours of my life. Do not buy.. Easily the best RTS game out there, even a few years after release (with Retribution expansion pack) compared to it Starcraft 2 feels like it is DoW's **** cousin. There are 6 factions in multiplayer, each one feels very different from another and each has 3 different commanders which differentiate them further, making it very hard to be bored with it. There is an incredible amount of unit upgrades, wargear for commanders, abilities and tactics to use. Each race takes a good 30-50 hours to master, there are many people with 1 k hours clocked in and still playing (personally I have about 300 and counting). Larger maps with up to 6 players are even more challenging, with more emphasis on long term strategy rather than micromanagement. Yet the game is not by any means overwhelming, and it's quite easy to learn the basics. The only thing that's not done right is too few maps. I'd really like to see some maps coming in DLC format, but since THQ got bankrupt it's very unlikely. There is also survival horde-mode, where up to three players defend themselves from hordes of incoming enemies, after each game earning experience and wargear to upgrade their heroes. Although not very complex it is very addictive. As to singleplayer, the base game's singleplayer campaign is pretty good and lasts for a good 15 hours if you do all the side missions. Chaos Rising campaign is shorter but has new interesting features and multiple endings making it also a good chunk of fun. In Retribution, the advantage is that you can play it with any race of your choosing, not just Space Marines, but the disadvantage is worse story and less unit customization options. Personally the base game's campaign is my favorite. There are still people playing in time I write this review (october 2013), it's very easy to find someone to play with, both newbies and pros with thousands of hours. There are also mods (I recommend Elite mod) that add additional units and maps. Easily one of the best game I've played, and the best RTS. Get it, it's dirt-cheap these days. No excuses, go to a store. I've spent an afternoon with the campaign mode, so it is slightly engaging, but only having a few squads to deal with isn't very exciting and doesn't leave much for tactical scope. It's basically stand and fire and wait for the power ups to refresh, a bit like what I imagine WoW to be. I am a big fan of the first game, but really haven't had much fun with this one.. In many ways a very good game. It was however somewhat ruined by repetitive and unimaginative maps. It captures a lot of the atmosphere of the wh40k universe, and the units feel unique and have interesting development options.. Big disappointment after Warhammmer 40k dawn of war Why remove base building just why... Played the game for 4-6 hours and got bored if you want a good RTS just buy dawn of war 1. Dawn of War 2 is kind of a mix of strategy and RPG. It's different from other RTS's in the sense that units level up as they fight and get stronger. You can also equip different weapons on to different squads and change them up to your liking. At least in the singleplayer. but who gives a about the singleplayer, the MULTIPLAYER in this game is badass, and for me that's what really makes this game amazing. It's addicting, it's tactical, it's competitive, and it's simply awesome. It has a very high learning curve however, expect to get your ass kicked for a while before you actually get good at it. It doesn't have enough maps, and the pathing is a bit messed up, but the sheer attention to detail with the character models and superb voice acting mixed with incredible depth (in the multiplayer) makes this game a must for strategy fans in my books.. I loved the first game in the series, the base building, while less than most other RTS games, was still solid, and balanced with the game play. It was, it's own game. I LOVED it. Then this game came out. Absolutely HATED it, they took everything I loved from 40k, and just threw it right out the window. Lets take out all the base building, most of the vehicles, and EVERY single element that could even be close to macro-managing in favor of uselessly elongated matches. And the campaign...they decided they'd make a bunch of 1v1 maps, then just port them all into the campaign. Want interesting match-ups? Too bad. Wanted to do a space marine rush/push? Too bad, because you have to work with 4 squads of 3, which entails sitting around for a long time waiting for them to kill massive spam of enemies. Worst RTS I've ever played, by far.. One of the best looking RTS for sure.. Camping mod has som really interesting missions but also some boring ones. Story is good and characters are funny too. The multiplayer is best part of this game for sure.. This is definitely one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. I will rate it 8 because it uses Windows LIVE, though. Absolutely terrible service.. A lot of people give their rating based on their taste instead to look at the game from a neutral position. It is a lot different than the first part, but it sure is a worthy part in the Warhammer series. I got really late into the Warhammer world, with DoW 1 being released in 2007 and the second one in 2009. I played the first one first to get into the story in case the second one is a continuation of the story. I understand that some people are upset it isn't like the first one but in my opinion it's even better. DoW 1 was a standard RTS just playing in the Warhammer universe, nothing special. But DoW 2 actually isn't like most of the other RTS games, it has some RPG elements that fit right in. The campaign is challenging if you're playing it on a hard difficulty, it's quiet boring in the beginning but you get more and more into the story and get hooked. With all the upgrades and skills for each squad you actually have a choice on how you want to do your missions. If you're looking for a little different RTS, DoW 2 is a good choice.. The original DOW and it's expansions are superior. This is basically a reskinned Company of Heroes but with no base management. The campaign is fun co-op but it's isometric RPG-lite and you've probably played better before. If you're looking for a Warhammer 40k game, check out the original DOW (best single player campaign of the original series) and/or it's expansion Dark Crusade (best multiplayer of the original series) instead.. How's every body doing, for my first review I decided to do one of my favorite games. Having played all of the previous Dawn of War games I had pretty high expectations for this one, especially with all the epic fails that all the expansions for the previous dawn of war ended up being. Just to start I'll go into the single player campaign. The game mechanics are very similar to the first Dawn of war, which were fairly easy to pickup within the first mission or two. It became very obvious to me from the beginning that the guys at THQ have actually started to listen to some of the fan base of the original game. They have implemented and in depth story line that does the books justice but still allowed for some choice on how to develop your characters, and how you proceed along the liner story line. ""You must remember while playing the game that yes, the game play is important but they are trying to tell a story as well."" The cover concept was add back into the game, well maybe that's a bad way to put it. A better way to put it is that they made cover important again, basically there is no more mad rush tactics that were so common in the previous expansions. Basically the campaign it's self is pretty solid all around, keeping you interested right till the end. The RPG element of the game, they have made vast improvements in this compared to it's predecessor. Now I'm not saying that it is anything new that we haven't seen in other games, but it works, it's simple and it keeps your focus where it should be... on the Mission map. Simply there is two RPG elements common to all RPG games leveling your characters and they're load out of equipment. The equipment load out is pretty simple you'll figure it out for your self. The leveling of your character can be a little trickier, you have to choose between being a jack of all trades or leveling up in very specific areas. This being said if you are not adaptable and can't move away from a certain play style your are not going to get much replay value out of DOW 2. Multiplayer, sorry I can't really comment on this part of the game. This is mostly because, the very hard-line multiplayer focus of the previous DOW was what ruined the game for a lot of fans of the first game, so to be honest I really had no interest into delving into that part of the game. In all I gave the game and 8 because THQ took and old game that people love and made it new again.. Finally, an RTS that requires a huge amount of skill and tactics in multi-player. Although I do see why people prefer the original, I believe that replacing the huge army with smaller, more tactical squads is a welcoming change. The campaign is entertaining, but would be much better if the AI had any intelligence at all. However, multi-player is where this game shines. Probably the best RTS I have played in a long time.. I am generally not a big RTS fan, but I greatly liked Dawn of War II. Maybe perhaps it was very action-oriented and had a good pace. Maybe also this is why many of the fans of the original didn't like this one. You don't actually build anything in this game or collect resources, etc. You just get dropped off in the battle zone and using various skills and military tactics you have to get the mission done. The missions have a good length and do not drag on, but there are loads of them. Another feature that I really loved about Dawn of War II is the presence of RPG elements. The squad characters level up as you complete missions and when they level up you can advance them in certain combat disciplines, whether it's health and survival, ranged damage, melee damage, or energy utilisation. This gives a certain element of replayability as you can take each squad member in different directions. Each character has their distinct strengths and weaknesses, and hence a lot of decision making befalls on the player when it comes to choosing which gear to equip them and in fact which squad members to take on the mission (as you can't take them all). The campaign is pretty long and also has a bit of an open-ended style to it after about halfway through, where some missions are optional and others are time-sensitive, meaning you also have to make decisions in regard to prioritising your missions, which is great fun and is incredibly intense. There is a lot of incentive to do well on each mission, because the better you do them, the more additional deployments you get and hence you can solve time-critical missions earlier on. I'll also review the Chaos Rising expansion on here too. It introduced a new story arc that takes place a year after the Dawn of War II campaign, and although the storyline is better, full of various twists, the campaign suffers a bit from being way too linear. There is no more incentive for doing well, because you do not get additional deployments and there are hardly any optional and time-critical missions. Chaos Rising also introduces an additional squad member, as well as a new idea to the gameplay - the corruption system. To be honest, I wasn't too fond of this idea as it was a bit annoying since all of the best gear was corrupting to the squad members, so you either had to use mediocre gear, or to use the corrupting gear and face the consequences during the game. Although Chaos Rising was a bit weaker in my opinion than the Dawn of War II campaign, I generally enjoyed them both and they lasted me a good amount of time - the original DoW II campaign should last you around 20 hours, and Chaos Rising another 10, so you'll have at least 30 hours in a single playthrough, not to mention the option of playing co-op with friends, as well as the hoard/survival mode.. Dawn of War II is weaker than its predecessor, but it's still a good game. The unit customization, experience and campaign are nice, but it lacks the strategic depth of the first game.. Okay, I'll be honest with you. At first, having tried the demo and a taste of what DoW2 has to offer, I was sorely disappointed by the drastic change from the gameplay of the original game. HOWEVER, I still decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad that I did. The game plays differently, (there's no building, and more about squad abilities and tactics) but this is by no means bad. The campaign is quite engaging and you're given a number of varied squads to improve and upgrade throughout the game, and that is by far my favourite part. There is choice involved in missions, outfitting and strategy, making an overall flamboyant single player campaign. The co-op is just as sweet. But wait there's more. The cream of the crop is the multiplayer and The Last Stand where you take on hordes of monsters with 2 other heroes. Great additions all way round. Long story short, yes it is a massive departure from DoW1's style but it is fortunately just as good in its own right. I certainly have respect for the devs for changing things up and trying out something new, and I'm glad that they've still kept the strength of this series and its ability to constantly impress me.. I find it rather odd how people are complaining about the RPG elements in the singleplayer mode. Warhammer 40k having RPG elements is bad? Did people have a lapse of memory as to what 40k is? The RPG elements do a better job of resembling collecting figures, building your army, and rolling dice than having completely uncustomizeable units. I mean seriously... GFWL is a complaint? It's free. I honestly do not understand why people think it is such a hassle. Aside from the automatic sign in as the game launches, you wouldn't even notice that GFWL exists until you play multiplayer. Making an account takes a minute unless you're handicapped in some regard. I've had GFWL for 7 years now and never in my entire usage did I encounter the kinds of problems people commonly complain about. I get it, it **** having to use it. I completely agree, but that alone doesn't make it bad. Retreat is definitely an issue, but this is more of a Relic issue, not a DOWII issue. Relic did the same **** in COH and they realized people were upset by it so they're changing it. I agree, the current retreat feature is completely oversimplified. Aside from ""it wasn't like the old game"", the removal of base building can be seen as a good thing. Your focus is shifted completely off of bases and onto combat. This allows for combat to be significantly more intricate than before, but as several others have pointed out, the Orks and Tyranids don't play very uniquely. If you believe the singleplayer is overly easy and you can spam retreat to save yourself, you must have been playing on Normal. Try that on Primarch. I dare you. Yes, you can complete the campaigns on Normal with almost no thought involved. As soon as you start trying to maximize tokens (>80% of units killed, no squads incapacitated, very short clear time), as well as playing on Primarch, the single player becomes very challenging and thoughtful. As for other simplifications from the original DOW, these criticisms are completely valid. The game easily could have had more content and customization. The lack of scope in the game is a completely valid change, as it places more importance on individual units and how you use them in combat instead of ""amass X number of unit Y, use this build order, rush"". Those kinds of ""strategies"" can be just ",the game is going through a major identity crisis . it is not clear whether it is a cRPG or an RTS . the unit controls are pretty horrible .
"1,122.Tekken Tag Tournament","Great fighting game very easy to learn the controls amazing characters just on the down side would've been better to have more storylines instead on quick clips owould Reccomend if you enjoy fighting gamestherwise would be a 8/9 for me. Superb, gorgeous, loveable, legendary! There can be no other like it on PS2! It has the cute chessiness of Tekken 3, but with a bigger character roster, souped up graphics and better fighting techniques. I honestly cannot think of a better fighting experience on the PS2; 4 and 5 may have upped the stakes a bit in terms of graphics and gameplay, but this remains a solid sweet gem, and where else can you team up with another character to make life a misery for your opponents eh??? The only issue I have, and its a minor one, is that the character storylines seem a bit silly, but thats almost always been the case with Tekken, dont you think???!!!. The best fightin game ever. An absurd amount of playable characters, tons of things to do, amazing mechanics... just perfect.. Tekken Tag Tournament is the fourth installment in the Tekken fighting game series. Tekken Tag Tournament was released as an arcade game in 1999, before becoming a North American and European launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000.. Tekken 3 with better graphics and the ability to play with two dolls at the same time! I'm not that big a fan of 2vs2 mode. Great game and a fresh, new concept. Tekken Tag Tournament was a great, standalone game with no official ties to the main series in terms of story. In Tag Tournament, you battle it out in one on one battles, or with the newly introduced tag battles. You can choose up to two characters and swap them out in a battle whenever you want. The other character can then heal a little bit of their health. This new mechanic is interesting and challenging, mainly because of the fact that you lose the battle if one of your characters reached zero HP. You can have a fully capable fighter left; you still lose. This mechanic requires strategy and knowing when to switch in time. If the timer runs out, the team with the most health left wins the match. Tekken Tag Tournament features the classic arcade game mode, in which you battle through a series of opponents and then beat the boss. In this case, this is Unknown, some sort of dark witch which mimics the fighting style of other characters, much like Mokujin. The only difference is that she can change fighting styles throughout the battle itself, rather than every new round. You can also play the one on one mode and the team battle, in which you apply the tag team mechanic, but this time, a character that is defeated, does not lose the match instantly. Instead, the remaining character fights the battle on his/her own until the next fight, in which the character is replaced by the next in line. Just like the original team battle mode, you choose eight characters from the start. You also got a new mini game, Tekken Bowl. This is just bowling with Tekken characters, in which each of them got some sort of special mechanic and handling to throw the ball. It is fun when played the first time, but it gets a little repetitive and dull fast. Because Tekken Tag Tournament act as a compilation of the first three games, almost every character ever featured so far, are playable in this game. They need to be unlocked first by beating the arcade mode with all the starting characters. The graphics look nice and follow the same format as Tekken 3. They are however, just a little more polished and fluent when talking animations. The backgrounds are all nicely detailed and especially the end stage with Unknown looks fantastic. The sound and music are almost the same as Tekken 3 and is nothing special anymore. I have to say that I did not like the music that much. It is a little blend and does nothing to enhance the experience. The controls follow the same combos and schemes as Tekken 3 and feel responsive. The switching of characters goes fluently, and the feeling of control is just great when fighting. The battles are intense and the adding of all the characters from the previous games, gives this game a complete feeling. It is a very good standalone title, just for the fun of playing Tekken. My only issue with the game remained Eddy Gordo and his alter ego Tiger Jackson. Their low ground move sets are still too overpowered and breaks the game a little bit when using the infinite low feet spin combo. In the end, I loved Tekken Tag Tournament. It is well rounded, offers a lot of characters with hours of play for unlocking them all and the new tag mechanics are greatly implemented and work perfectly. Definitely recommend this game.. Absolutely stunning Visuals Mechanics Sound And plenty of characters My all time favorite tekken. Fighting system takes a bit getting used to, since it's much more robust than the modern games. But overall it's old-school beat-em-up fun, what more can you ask for?. Tekken Tag Tournament is an excellent fighting game that throws tag-team mechanics into the mix.. A highly impressive PS2 launch game, ""Tekken Tag Tournament"" improved upon the arcade version with its superior graphics. While not quite as good as ""Tekken 3"", it was still a terrific fighting game that added the tag feature to matches. A must have for series fans. I would rate it with an 8.8 out of 10.. One of my very first games on PS2. As a fan, the moment when you realize the walls make damage to the fighters for the first time in saga. Priceless. JIN KAZAMA 4 THE WIN.. A classic Tekken game. This is the Tekken formula done right and that really shines in this installment. The tag system is super fun, and you can even take a friend along for the ride in Pair Play mode! Arcade mode runs will net you new characters and endings for your chosen first character for that classic arcade fighter feel. Playing this on the PS2 at the beginning of it's life as well as at the local arcade brings back some fond memories from the fighting game scene of yesterday. A must have for fans of classic 3D fighters.. A solid game in an established franchise that does what it's supposed to do: be a fun fighting game. This was the first game i got for the Playstation 2 and it was amazing for the time. The graphics were a huge step up from the first 3 games and the game play was solid. Countless hours were spent on this.. Tekken Tag Tournament is the fourth main installment in Namco's Tekken fighting game series. It is not canonical to the Tekken storyline. + 2 VS 2 + Tekken Bowl + Great Fighthing Game. Having grown up playing fighting games in arcades (Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat II, etc.), this was a gem when first I played it. The balance in this game is what really sets it apart. The characters really do provide a whole spectrum of fighting styles to where there is a character for virtually every play style. Where the combat itself shines is in how this game integrates combos, throws, and reversals to ensure that every usable character has their respective place in the match. The tag aspect adds the potential element of co-op or 4-player vs. mode that only increases the already excellent experience that the base fighting game offers. Simply put, this is fighting game perfection, and for its time I would be hard pressed to find any that could do it all even as well as this game...there is a reason that its impact is enough to warrant me writing this review some 16 years after its release!. Neo010390 Nov 18, 2010 10 This is definatly a step up to the arcade version and quite possible my faviroute Tekken game in the series so far. Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the ""Tag"" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum's and dojos.. Using the same engine as Tekken 3 the tag system and PS2 graphic makeover this is as good as 3d fighting gets and still holds up today (In many ways I prefred TTT's graphics to the later PS2 installments). New things where being discovered about the games fighting engine and characters 4/5 years after it first came out, While bringing back the full cast made for some ""Clone"" type characters the roster bought back a lot of old favourites from the first 2 games for a fantastic character roster. The tag system added a lot of variety and discovery to the game with so many combinations allowing for experimentation to see how they work together.. More characters, more moves, four-player tag battle, and more. Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap. Overall great Tekken Tag Tournament is a great game.. yes that exactly what the series needed playing tag is so much fun and being able to do combo moves is so cool a great step up to fighting games really good game. Solid fighting mechanics and nice introduction into tag-team fighting. Great selection of character. However it really doesn't feel like it has much else to offer. Little to no extra features. No real story mode. This game felt more like it belonged in an arcade than on a console. Overall: A good idea, but it just felt a bit unfinished. It felt more like an expansion than an actual game of its own.. Tekken Tag Tournament is a great fighter, one of the best ever made. The combat is solid, the variety of modes allows for a lot of hours playing, and it looks beautiful for a game that came out in the year 2000.. I am not a huge fan of fighting games but the I still enjoyed the Tekken series. Tekken Tag Tournament is one of the few fighting games I've owned because it is one of the best. Battling in teams of two characters and having over 35 fighters to choose from, this game was always a blast to play. TTT offered some of the best combos in the series and Unknown was one of the coolest bosses. Also, they enhanced the graphics and offered 2 new modes, team battle up to 8 characters with tag rules, and a ""Tekken Bowl"" bowling game.. This is definatly a step up to the arcade version and quite possible my faviroute Tekken game in the series so far. Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the ""Tag"" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum's and dojos. Gameplay is still the same as before, but there are some new fighting moves, different game modes to play and for the first time you can play as not one, but two characters in each fight. Not all characters are available to start off with, you have to unlock them in Arcade mode. Fight your way through 8 different stages by kicking, punching and wrestling each opponent and you will unlock a new character as well as a nice short theatre clip from each character you complete Arcade in. If you've played Tekken before, then most of the moves you'll know already but if you're new to the series, you may want to get some practicing done in Practice mode. You can change the difficulty settings if want to challenge yourself and become a master at the game. Of course this game wouldn't be Tekken without (my personal faviroute) multiplayer, where you and your friend can choose two different characters (4 altogether). Another new feature to this game is if you have a Multitap, you can have up to 4 players to make it even more enjoyable. You and your friends can get loads of aggressive fun, competing against one another to become the champion. If that wasn't enough for you why not play a much relaxing game of bowling, yes you heard me right bowling, something you might wanna try if you have a bad headache after all that anger and shouting from multiplayer. One thing that disappoints me is even though you can use two characters tag in each fight, the round ends after one of them is defeated rather than finish them both off. This would have been a nice option to let you configure this. Usually I would get bored of the same old repetitive fighting but it still manages to charm for the fourth time running.","Tekken Tag Tournament is the fourth installment in the Tekken fighting game series . it's a great, standalone game with no official ties to the main series in terms of story .

"1,123.Paradigm","Alright so me with this game on my PC represents the gaming industry caught up in its own philosophies, also me in general feeling stuck. The rating above my review represents death looming above us. The 8 means that death sometimes can party. Like when you party and almost overdose. However, there are a bunch of extra meanings. I mean, that was just the synopsis Basically, if you look a little bit more closely there is some dirt here. This actually represents how dirty we are When I say we, I mean modern society, i.e. you, with its dirty and hypocritical morals. DAMN I'm on another plane of thinking. (*dirt*). One thing is clear, the creator was too high when developing this game. Out of this the story and puzzles are too linear. Voice acting is terrible and lacks a lot of translation languages that's quite basic in a point and click game. Loved pretty much everything about this game, fair duration and difficulty, characters are pretty cool, art is awesome, music is also good. The type of humor really clicks with me but i understand it's not everyone's cup of tea. Some sequences were just too good to not give this game a 10.. It's all true. This is the first adventure game since Monkey Island 2 that I played that really, in a modern way captures that feel, the humor, the escape to a new and bizarre world. The issue with other point n click indies often was their immersiveness, and trying too hard to be MI. Paradigm has its own meta-jokes and moved with the times, by accepting the modern world but setting it in a retro future sketchy 80's setting and with its adorable characters, it achieves wat others tried and didn't do: create a new original and hilarious experience. ONE LOVE. PS it also isn't short which is awesome and keeps doing meta stuff.. Haiku Review: Genetics run wild / A sloth that pukes up candy / Lots of fat beatsies Favorite Thing: It was weird. In a good way. Least Favorite Thing: The lack of a smart-click. Why must I right-click -> use everything? Date Completed: 2018-08-10 Playtime: ~ 5h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: Point-and-click fans will definitely enjoy it.. A point 'n' click adventure developed in Perth, Western Australia by pretty much one guy with some help from a Swedish composer for the music. Surreal, a bit juvenile at times, but funny most of the time with plenty of pop culture references to the 80s, 90s and now. Just the right difficulty for me (a veteran adventure gamer who isn't actually that good at adventure games) and an indie game that definitely punches above its own weight. A bit like Thimbleweed Park except even more surreal and set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Soviet wasteland.. I have been years without laughing so much and having so much fun in a graphic adventure. Great doses of humor, new times, music, gags and just a hint of nostalgia.. Paradigm is as if ""Day of the Tentacle"" and ""Monkey Island"" hooked up, forgot to use contraceptives, and spawned one of them darned meme-spewing millennial offspring that wears its heritage on its sleeve. Paradigm is a love letter to the classic absurdist point-and-click comedy adventure, except it's that kind of super creepy love letter that's just a piece of paper with a bunch of letters cut out from magazines, and then proceeds to leave four more letters at your doorstep at odd times of the day. It's not ""just' a game--every element of Paradigm, starting from the difficulty settings, tutorial, and even the menu options, is part of the ride. For those seeking substance beyond the humor, don't fret; Paradigm delivers rewarding puzzles on top of the absurdity. Ultimately, Paradigm feels like it ended just a little too early, as if some bit ended up on the cutting room floor before its official release--a common and understandable part of game dev, but still left me with an unshakeable feeling of *something* missing near the end. Overall, for those seeking a classic, comedy adventure game experience in the vein of OG Lucas and Sierra/Dynamix productions, Paradigm is more than worth the price of admission and I thank Jacob Janerka and everybody involved with Paradigm the best in future endeavors for their creation.. The game is really fresh compared to other adventure games. It keeps surprising you with all the minigames and puns. You really don't know what will happen next, but you sure will be pleased with a number of puns there are in this game. One of the not so many examples of how to make the player keep exploring all the options and dialogues in an adventure game.","this is the first adventure game since monkey island 2 that i played . it captures that feel, the humor, the escape to a new and bizarre world . voice acting is terrible and lacks a lot of translation languages ."
"1,124.The Sims 4: Realm of Magic","For a game pack Realm of Magic adds a lot to the game and is quite an interesting and enjoyable pack. This may not be for everyone as some may argue the sims should start giving people what they want, but this is a lot of content for a Game Pack.. 20$+ for: 1. A set of spells your character will get with NO effort, 2. Some clothes (nothing truly special) and 3. A lot of bugs which will pop up at random, ruining the gameplay? Like dying to overcharge after having immunity-to-overcharge perk learned, having unplayable character after drinking potion of immortality (because the game will still attempt to make him die to old age - effectively purging actions queue once a minute), getting Curse while having curse immunity, etc, etc... Cost/content proportion is incredibly low here.... Really? All this lore about magic in popular culture, and all you can do is a fake Art-Nouveau house with three ""spellcaster"" gurus? Apparently the developers are just bored with their jobs.. This is a new low for the series, and EA's DLC practice in general. You already have the functionality of this ""game pack"" in your game, it's called *The Cheat Console* and can be accessed by pressing ALT+SHIFT+C. Of course it comes without the gnarly wooden furniture that has been ported from the Sims-3-store, but as usual you can already get that and more as a mod. Just type ""testingcheats true"", and you will be able to magically alter your surroundings, just without the one and only animation that is supposed to show your sim casting a spell. They even added the ""set as head""-cheat as a ""spell"" (after the aforementioned ""testingcheats"", shift+click on any item to get that effect). Potions have fantastic effects like ""maxmotives"", or use the script from ""get to work"" that let's random people have fights with each other when you patrol the neighborhood as a policeman. What you don't have when you use cheats is the plethora of new bugs and glitches, useless huge additions to the UI that are just in the way, and a new neighborhood with 5 lots, containing three of the most lazy and unfinished buildings I have ever seen since this series started out in 1998. The ""Realm of magic"", as interesting as it may look in a trailer, can be renamed into ""the realm of empty"", because there is nothing that you can't find somewhere else or do in any other place without having to travel the whole distance. There are *two* new harvestables that are barely used, in a magic pack with alchemy: TWO. Of course the AI hasn't been adapted in the slightest, especially when it comes to the NPCs that should somehow react - you have seen that kind of non-response in the vampire-pack already, so whatever immersion you are looking for, it won't be coming from there. The level-system is a contrived assembly of mostly useless abilities that take out the last bit of consequences or challenge. As a matter of fact you can just outright stop playing the game since you are only cheating anyway. Thankfully the game now crashes on a regular basis on top of everything else, so you won't even have to *stop* playing on your own. Calling this product an insult would still be far too generous. An insult needs at least a bare minimum of effort.","realm of magic adds a lot to the game and is quite an interesting and enjoyable pack . cost/content proportion is incredibly low for the series, and EA's DLC practice ."
"1,125.Onimusha 3: Demon Siege","Nostalgic vibes mostly, the two previous games were more to my taste. But overall, a very descent game.. nice gameplay, nice story(unskippable cutscenes), camera is cursed and skillshots maybe a little bit to hard to land. A game with a sweet story. Playing 2 characters is fun. The game is more linear and action-based. The survival aspect is weaker than in the first game. It's a good game at the level of the second game. And I think this is the longest of the 3 games. In general, the enemies are the same. The last boss was easy and not good. Some other bosses aren't bad. Especially Queen. I enjoyed playing it.. one of the best games ever made, dont mind the graphics or tank mechanics, this is HOW you create video game and tell stories. I remember playing this out of boredom and getting myself to like it a bit.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Onimusha 3: Demon Siege is a fantastic journey, it is definitely a must play!. It still onimushas game but it Lost too much of its charm. The first thing is lost was the prerender of backgrounds which is a horrible thing to lose because it Lost most of its awesome atmosphere and colour from it. The music tries to be like the first game but it can because the first still has the best soundtrack in any game and it's maybe the reason why I enjoyed the first one so much,it mostly just sounds like a generic version of number one. I find the game is a bit too long the first one was about 3_4 hours length I find the perfect for dis games , and Combat system is good but is not good enough to hold the game 10 Hours but it is a good ending for the franchise so it's worth playing it. The third entry in the series and mostly famous for having Jean Reno in it. Even from non fans of the game / series it had received much recognition. Again it is an action adventure in hack and slash type where you have to defend yourself against demons who want to take over. Story: The story begins when Samanosuke Akechi makes his way to the Honno-ji temple to ultimately end Nobunaga Odas reign of horror. However not everything happens as planned and he ends in modern day Paris while Jacque Blanc (Jean Reno) ends in feudal Japan a few days before the fight at the Honno-ji temple. Both characters have to fight their way through their enemies to get answers and solve this mystery. I like the story as it was a refreshing experience. It worked surprisingly well and Jean Reno is a bonus I value highly. Gameplay: This time you have 2 playable characters. Both have different weapons and because of this play also a bit differently. Basically it is an action adventure with all its rules. Attack your enemies and don't get hit by them in return;-): Of cause you have more options. There are magic attacks, blocking, counterattacks, combos, items and different weapons to use. Defeated enemies leave behind souls. Those come in different flavors and the most common is the currency for upgrading your weapons, armor and gauntlet (at a save point). These souls you must absorb with your gauntlet by button pressing but be careful as you are vulnerable doing that. There are also a lot of items for you to find, a dark realm to explore, a training mode and some secrets. Upgrading your stuff is a key to victory and give you an edge on the enemies. Also the controls work quite well for its time. Advice: The training helps and finishing the (optional) dark realms is beneficial. I actually grinded a bit to overpower the enemies and it worked well in the first half. Also never underestimate what Ako can do for you (vests!). I should point out that there are multiple endings and a rating system. Maybe read a guide before. Presentation: While it cant keep up with modern games it was truly amazing back then and got a lot of praise. The graphics were just amazing and enhanced the experience. Sidenote: Just the intro alone deserves praise for its time. Soundtrack was similar really good. I think there is no misstep here in this regard. Negatives: There are some small negatives. Rarely the camera is not working well enough (With emphasis on the word rarely). Some parts of the story are not that good (The Samanosuke in Jaque’s campaign for example is a bit incompetent and some other things could be done better) and the best ending is hard to get. Overall this was an enjoyable game for its time that I valued. I might not end on my favorite list but was worth my time.. All the Main line Onimusha games are awsome, but 3 was always my favorite. It was full of craziness and to this day I dont think a game has recreated the satifation of that saw tooth slash you feel with Jacques wip sword. The combat has a bit more complexity to the previous games and I love the throwimg, wip jump and the cute little fairy guide. I personally was glad there was less puzzles, the action and weopen progression was always what made these games fun.Really wish we got all the first 3 games remastered cause Warlords was amazing on modern hardware.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Great Story.......................Amazing Score.....................Great. Japanese samurai modeled after Chinese action star Geum Sung-moo. To kill enemies with a sword that cuts a strong demon; to attack with a double sword. It's so much fun that I can't wait for Onimusha's follow-up game to be released soon.. Nice soundtrack, nice combat, challenging. A really good game after all. Recommended.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. My favorite Onimusha game and the culmination of everything that has happened in the first two. Expanding on both story and gameplay. The third-best Onimusha game. Lacks the variety of Oni 2 and the finesse of Oni Warlords. Time is spent split between two characters in two times; Samanosuke in modern-day Paris, and Jacques in Japan's Warring States era. Does very much what previous Oni games did better, and little else. Not a bad game, but not universally recommended.. Probably my favorite ****'s hard to find faults with Onimusha 3 because it does what it does so well. Only the story has it's up and downs but in the end this is amazing game Onimusha series has proven to us that it stands on its own.. Aside from an absolutely breathtaking intro (it was unbelievable to think that is what the PS2 was capable of) this game is really just lazy. The game uses Jean Reno's likeness in the game, and yet only the French version of the game uses the actor's real voice. We all know he can speak fantastic English, why on earth didn't he do the English one as well. Whoever the voice actor was that they got instead of him sounds nothing like him, so it was kind of bizzar seeing Reno's face with another voice. It felt more like this was a fan made mod than anything else. As to the game itself: It really doesn't do ANYTHING new, just the same stuff from the last games in a different location. The game isn't bad, just a really big disappointment. This is what you would expect from a Hollywood movie -Game licence game. But from the Onimusha franchise, this was just a bit of a slap in the face. Overall: It is a good game, and I would only recommend to those who have not tried the previous games.. 3rd game in the series where little has changed out side of your in paris and you control 2 main charicters instead of just 1 . the voice acting is abit improved they brought a famous french actor in and modeled him for the game (i cant remember his name unfortunitly) and they have him speaking the frech in the game but not the english which is stupid because he can speak english ive heard him in other films do so. instead they have some english voice actor doing his lines which was just stupid in my book. its fairly long not as long as the second but still much longer then the first . this game is in the middle of the 3 games its better then the first but not as good as the second one . still its a fun game and it also brings samonoske back in.. I was so disappointed by this game, it actually angered me when I played it. I held this series in such high regard and maybe I overhyped this release too much. All I can say is if you loved the past two game play this one with caution.",the game is more linear and action-based . the survival aspect is weaker than in the first game . it's a good game at the level of the second game .
"1,126.Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo","Very intricate plot design, consistent settings, and moderate game length. Overall, the gaming experience is very good. However, it is more suitable to play with friends as some scenes are quite scary and require mental preparation.. Overall a phenomenal visual novel from beginning to end. In some regards, it can be a bit hard to follow— especially when picking it back up after a while (though it's easy enough to follow along and recall information), but it is genuinely amazing to play. It flowed like water in my hands and through my mind, and made hours seem like minutes. I felt the conclusion was strong, but the real strength lies in the journey through this amazing, amazing game. Anyone with a love for VNs, or looking for a breathtakingly good atmosphere with impeccable writing, Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is the diamond you've been looking for. If it hits your tastes, you'll walk out with a new favorite, like I have.. Great game! I had a few jump scares in the beginning got my blood pumping. I do wish we had the perspective of a certain main character. If we did it would have been perfect score from me :). I enjoyed this; however, i was expecting an end game twist which could’ve given this game 10/10.. It's really good. II think is Better to go blind. Cuanto más a ciegas vayas más lo vas a disfrutar, para fans de jeugos como zero escape o ace attorney.. I made an account just for this game because it is a crime that it's so underrated and unknown. I get visual novel esque games aren't for everyone, but this is one of the best of the bests in it's genre. This is one of those games that is best experiencing without knowing anything about it; if you remotely enjoy visual novel - adventure games, not playing paranormasight would be a disservice to both it's creative team and to yourself.. Great game that is getting review bombed for some reason with 1/10 ratings. If you enjoy games like 999, ai: somnium files and danganronpa this one should be right up your alley.. Idk who is giving this game negative reviews but they did not play it there is absolutely no way this game being 15.99 and the story I just witnessed could be rated negative. I can’t even see this game getting a 7/10 but out of the fact that not everyone likes the same thing that is the absolute lowest I could see someone rating this game. As for me this game is an easy 10 if you are a horror fan then on top of that a VN fan do not miss out on this game!!!!!. Although the peak of it's gameplay is in it's prologue, Paranormasight offers a intriguing mystery/horror story, with a well-written cast and beautiful art direction.. Paranormasight is a work of art that sets the gold standard for visual novels. Its web of storylines is seamlessly blending reality and imagination. The captivating atmosphere makes it a must-play for anyone with a keen interest of the supernatural and occult.","this is one of the best visual novel esque games in it's genre . if you enjoy visual novel - adventure games, not playing paranormasight would be a disservice to both it's creative team and to yourself . if you enjoy 999, ai: somnium files and danganronpa this one should be right up your alley ."
"1,127.Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling","Simply a great game from beginning to end. It is on the same level as Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door in my opinion. The cast of characters, Vi, Kabbu and Leif is so entertaining and you quickly sympathise with all three of them. The dialouges are more dynamic, simply because there use background comments from other characters between a main dialouge. Every NPC you interact with gives you the feeling of being part in an lively world with an own unique society which really helps to connect with the world and the characters in there. Especially the Sidequest are a big step forward compared to Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door. They are more fun, more creative, you be rewarded better for fullfilling them and some of the Sidequests expand the lore for this world. So you are not only getting some useful upgrades, you also get more story information about this world and the insects and their society which gives you a better understanding. The battles are as great as they are in Paper Mario, with the difference that your three characters, Vi, Kabbu and Leif are better balanced and have their own useage in fighting the different types of enemies. Vi can attack flying enemies and put them to the ground, so the others can attack them too. Kabbu is the tank who can harm armored enemies and turn them on the back, so that their defense gets lost. Leif is able to attack enemies in the ground. Thanks to this dynamic in the battles, they never gets bored. The only issue this game has is, that the puzzle solving in the overworld is clunky sometime, especially Vis ""Beemerang"" is really inaccurate to use, when you need it to activate switches. Luckily there is never a scenario where you have to use the overworld abilities under pressure so it is not a big deal. One last positive thing is the content this game offers, I didn't complete the game 100% but still put 40 hours into it and there are no time strechting gameplay elements like fetch quests or something else. Every hour I spent into it was fun, enjoyable and makes me smile.. Perfect execution of what we all wanted Nintendo to deliver but they never could be bothered to.. This is an excellent game. This has everything I could want out of a ""paper"" RPG, with good humor, a great cast (great character development too), an intriguing storyline, interesting NPCs and side quests, and, of course, an engaging and strategic combat system. It also has a well composed soundtrack. I'm glad this one stands on its own, rather than just ripping off its While there are a few bits of room for improvement, such as overworld controls, this is still a great experience, and I plan on playing it more times in the future.. I would give this game a rating of around 9.6. It is a nostalgic representation of what made the original Paper Mario games so loved. The setting is pretty original for this type of game. The art style is nice to look at and goes well with the setting. The characters are by far one of the best parts. The main trio has their own mini stories that end up coming together as a uniform team who share the same goal. This goal takes great gameplay and uses it to freshen up what many fans of gaming have wanted for so long. It has amazing moments from beginning to end, and is truly an underrated and magical experience, truly fitting of a fable.. A Love letter toold-school Paper Mario Rpgs, at first I wasn't convinced with the bug theme but the visuals and the story are so well done I just have to love it. Definitely a must have for turn-based rpg fans. Excellent fighting system and hours upon hours of fun. Congratulations to the whole Dev team. This game is genuinely amazing and what I'd hope to get from anyone the modern Mario rpgs, if you're tired of origami king or color splash spend a fraction of that money on getting this strictly better game!. so, when I saw this I tought: ""oooo bug game funny haha"". After I bought it. I knew nothing about it, I only knew it was inspired by paper Mario. After chapter 1. I was playing this game everyday. The characters have they own unique personalities and designs. Story? Just PERFECT. Side quest, optional bosses. And so much more. I recommend if you are a paper Mario fan, and I see some people just reviewing this game bad. Saying it is a copy. I say it is something unique. The art fits the game. combat? It’s pretty easy. You learn stuff Quick. Sooo yeah. That’s all!!! <3. i wrote a whole comprehensive review before meta critic just deleted it for no reason, and i'm not wasting my time writing that again, so instead i'll just say... The art is ugly, the writing and story telling is bad, the combat is lacking, and the game is overall just overrated nostalgia bait.. I can’t recommend this game enough. Is it perfect? Not at all. The medals could use some tweaking, and a few of the side quests are just downright stupid, but everything else is done so well I don’t care.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bug fables from the very beginning is a beautiful love letter to Paper Mario, from the art style to the music and everything in between it brings me back to what I remember that game being on the Nintendo 64. That's what makes this such an amazing game it makes me feel like I'm a kid again, but there are so many quality of life features that I am not even going to begin to try to list them. If you're looking for a light turn-based RPG with a pretty great story and really fun writing then I would suggest this game for your next play.. Better than Paper Mario, but not quite as good as Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door. Great cast of characters and a well done story. Includes a Hard Mode if you want a more difficult challenge.. A cute game with likeable characters. But it suffers of a few badly implemented mechanics I thought wouldn't exist anymore nowadays. Three examples: - The approximative controls when interacting with the environment, especially when using the bee's weapon. - The problem you can't buy items in bulk. You have to restart the buying process for every single unit of an item. - The missing of a combat restart option. When you're in a combat and you see in advance you'll lose it, you whether have to restart the whole game to get back to the last save spot or wait until every member of the team died. Although it's got those technical anachronisms it's still a nice game to play.. A pretty great turn based RPG with some great characters and a fun story that prods at the imagination. The combat system is good, providing a neat challenge both in strategy and actual gameplay. It is very derivative of the old Paper Mario games, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I do feel more could be done to distinguish its combat from those titles. The humor and worldbuilding are great and feel unique to this world, and the plot twists that amp up toward the latter half of the game make for an experience I won't soon forget. There are some graphical issues and some issues with pacing, but it's a surprisingly great first game for Moonsprout and I'm excited for their next one. 40 hours to complete and Vi is the best. One of my favorite games ever! A perfect love letter to the original Paper Mario series.. Bug Fables is pleasant all around, but it really loses steam. The chapters all go on a little too long and things become tedious. I frequently found myself thinking, “oh no, not again” when activities/tasks would arise. I enjoyed the game, but the tediousness really brought the overall experience down.. Bug Fables is a game that takes a simple concept, playing as bugs, and perfectly demonstrates how well one can execute such an idea. The giant world feels brilliant, taking place entirely in a garden, while you're so small that sand pits become sprawling deserts. Combat feels brilliant, as the characters compliment each other perfectly, with strengths and weaknesses for every situation. The characters are also a joy to witness in the story and world, and make every moment of this game feel great from the writing alone. It's difficult to properly sum up a game that you love, but for me Bug Fables is a near perfect execution of what Paper Mario attempted to do.. Bug Fables: The Everlasting **** This game is so boring it feels like its everlasting. There are more bugs in this game than Richard Parker growls at Pi through 227 days at sea. Heck, there's more bugs in this game than Macbeth kills people. Its kinda buggy. The only smidge of positivity in this game is that the main character is a wasp, and they may be a common ancestor to the Geospiza Fortis. This game is too buggy for me and gets a 0, just like the Biology class average.. Way too buggy. I'd rather be in biology class and learning about the finches on the Galapagos. Darwins HMS beagle is 100X more interesting than anything in stupid fug bables. Bug fables clearly had some recessive alleles in it, and they weren't the good kind. If I were to draw a punnet square for this AFWUL game, it'd be bad game dominant allele, with stupid moth recessive allele. Mothiva took away 3 points by themselves. Don't buy this game unless you're trying to punish your biology class.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""All in all, Bug Fables is an excellent title that I would recommend to everyone. RPG fans, particular those who like Paper Mario should especially grab this at their earliest opportunity. The game is so good, however, that I am pretty sure non RPG fans like myself will also have a damn good time. It may not be very replayable, as is the case with the genre, but there’s certainly a lot of bang for your bug (sorry)."" ****/2021/01/07/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling/. It takes everything that makes TTYD good and evolves the heck out of it! Love the narrative and the characters, and the new battle system is so much fun!. 1. Without a doubt, bug fables is an indie game that surpassed the quality of Nintendo games, many fans assume it as a paper mario rpg and I completely agree their nonsense lmfao 2. It's pretty cool to see how the main menu screen added more characters as you advance through the story 3. The menu codes are well-founded for pros who seek for tougher challenges, MYSTERY? is my fav of all because the location of medals are randomized which lead to infinite replay value 4. Vi, Kabbu and Leif interactive conversations > Goombario and Goombella's overworld ability 5. Front back line gimmicks and relay system 6. Hard mode medal, there's no need to say more 7. Backtracking from side quests aren't as annoying as PM series 8. The card system, I played it over 50 times 9. Boss rush and 50 rounds trial 10. You can unlock a pet and name it Chomp 11. Promising originality (characters, enemies, world themes, etc) 12. Chapter 5 Wasp kingdom, Chapter 7 ice puzzles and arcade games are the only flaws 13. Ummmmmm out of context, TOK **** compared to it. How can you release a game that constantly stutters?. I am a MASSIVE Paper Mario 64 and TTYD fan. Replayed both of them many times. Like many I have been more than disappointed with what Nintendo has done with that series. Bug Fables came out of left field for me. I had somehow never heard of it but suddenly it was released on the Switch, and it popped up on my radar. This game is a spiritual successor in every sense of the phrase. It takes many of their mechanics and does them even better. It has really great lore, and wonderful story telling. Instead of many partners, you're just three bugs which does allow a lot more focus on their individual stories and arcs. Battles can get HARD. I beat the whole thing on hard mode but had plenty of trouble in doing so. The medals (badges) allow you to make some pretty elaborate builds. I plan on going back for the side quests and to complete the optional bosses. If I have to nitpick, the controls are a bit awkward at times in the overworld, like with Vi's boomerang. Also, I like the soundtrack but the instruments feel very MIDI-ey at times. I feel like taking the same soundtrack with some better instrument MIDI could have been better. Overall I adored this game and would recommend it to any Paper Mario or Mario & Luigi fan.. Bug Fables delivers on the exact promise it stands for - Paper Mario 3. This game is truly the sequel we've waited nearly two decades for as it takes all the concepts of Paper Mario and pushes them to the next step, expanding upon the formula we know and love. The developers clearly knew their target audience as well; not only does this game call back to a nostalgic formula, it was created in such a way that the difficulty itself would have aged with it's audience. This game can be downright brutal at times, yet always remains fair and gives it's player a chance to succeed. In many ways this game is even better than any Paper Mario with a heavier focus on story and lore, a vibrant cast of characters with great depth and growth, and a large amount of side-quests and optional areas to explore. You can spend anywhere between 25-100 hours playing this game depending on how much you want to put into it, and it always feels rewarding to play. If I have any complaints, aside from the difficulty curve, it's that some of the best parts of this story is hidden. To learn about one of the main character's pasts requires a side quest line, which leads to the story focusing on this plot point for a bit until they shelve it unless you want to pursue the answers on your own. Same with resolving the plots of two other characters, which is a shame because they're more interesting than the main narrative, so I would have rather they incorporated those journeys into the main plot. There is also a lot of unresolved plot points, which may or may not be explained in the hidden lore books (which notably I did not collect), but either way it feels odd to end a journey with so many unanswered questions. Also sometimes the witty dialogue the characters say disappear too quickly, which is a shame to those of us who don't read very fast. These complaints are very minor in the grand scheme of things however; at the end of the day, Bug Fables is a journey every Paper Mario fan should go on. If you can handle a greater challenge, you will be greatly rewarded.. Well thought out game with a ton of great content. It took me 40 hours to finish the main game and all of the side quests. Excellent value!. The best recent Paper Mario game, honestly I'm kinda worried Nintendo might send them a cease and desist this is so close to the original Paper Mario games.. I've never played an RPG Paper Mario game, and yet, this game blew me away. It is an absolute masterpiece ****. Everything you come to expect out **** RPG is here - fantastic characters, a charming world, and a story that is surprisingly touching. I can not recommend this game more.. Completely superior to the latest Paper Mario game in every way, Bug Fables is what Paper Mario fans wanted and sadly never got.. This game is a f*cking blast! If you loved mario rpg, paper mario and paper the 1000 year door you gonna LOVE this spiritual successor. If nintendo doesn't want release a paper mario with true rpg elements, these developers pulled something amazing off! The characters, and the fighing elements are engaging and just pure gun to play. I can recommend it to paper mario fans, rpg loverd and gamers of all kond! Just love it. This games story, lore gameplay, world, side quest and all have been a damn great experience I’ve not had ever before! I cannot wait to see what else Moonsprout Games has in store!. Better than paper mario! It has better dialogue with characters, better RPG elements, a more lively world.. Wow! Great game! Got it on sale for 17$ and it’s worth the price of a full game! Beautiful art style! This game did what Mario origami king couldn’t ! Awesome combat! Get the game thank me later!. The game plunged me back to my childhood times! This is a gorgeous little gem in the game world! 10 bugs from 10!. Amazing. A loving tribute to the early Paper Mario games, and an incredible game in it’s own right. Amazing soundtrack, Story, Gameplay, and art style, this is one of, if not my favorite game of all time.. One of the best Indie games on the Switch, and fills a void in the library. Really enjoyable, would recommend to Paper Mario fans easily.. I've never played TTYD but I can officially say this is my favorite game of all time. The only downside to this being from an indie is that it doesn't have the most detailed sprites. Yet this is still 100 times better than what Nintendo's doing. It took me about 35 hours to beat the main game in normal mode with many more to come soon. Also the music is astounding! Just check out ""they call him spooder"". (Don't call him that). I must say if you are a fan of the first two Paper Mario games or their combat system, then this game is a must-play. The game has a beautiful soundtrack and introduces a new world never seen before. The world-building is done phenomenally and with a badge, you get at the start of the game you can play on hard mode (which is actually what the developers recommend). The difficulty change is big enough to be felt and give a consistent challenge, but never did it feel overbearing or like enemies were damage sponges just to be hit repeatedly. This game isn't just something to relive Paper Mario nostalgia but rather shows off how well the formula used for those games is and how it can be improved to feel like a full-fleshed game. The only complaint I have is there are occasional platforming sections that don't play right and can get annoying but the fact that messing up a jump just sends you back and doesn't kill or hurt you is a big positive. I would certainly recommend if you want to play an RPG, unlike many others with a good story, strong characters, and challenging combat.. Excellent RPG Game. Notoriously taking classic Paper Mario's style, this indie game really felt like a spiritual succesor, having a great story, great battling system, good music and overall, a rather pleasant adventure.. Paper Maro 1&2 fans will cum playing this game hard facts haha. Beat the game under 35 hours. Plenty of other side quests still to do. 10/10. Does Paper Mario need Mario to be good? No. I’d much rather prefer an actual Paper Mario RPG, but Bug Fables proves that you don’t need a big name to be a good RPG. Bug Fables doesn’t try to be anything special just a simple RPG with Bugs. But by keeping it simple it becomes something special and in some way more memorable then all these complex complicated concepts of other RPGs. Sometimes you gotta look at the little pictures. And the little pictures are sometimes prettier then the bigger ones.. Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling is the return to Paper we didn’t deserve. It features unique and interesting characters, an expansive and exciting overworld, and a long set playtime making it worth the money. If you love RPG’s, I strongly suggest you get it. I don’t recommend or ask, I STRONGLY suggest you to buy it.. I liked this game but I feel its started very slow. The first 10 hrs were a slog to get through but then it picked up and was pretty fun. Wasn't to difficult even with the challenge badge they give you that makes the bosses harder. With all the quest you can really put a lot of time into this game if you want to. I don't love the quick time event battle system, but its solid.. Just finished Chapter 2, fantastic game. Has a few shortcomings, but it's the most fun I've had with an RPG of this style in a very long time. With the exception of a few very slight hiccups, the game accomplishes everything it sets out to be. It's characters are wonderful, the world is fascinating, and it's full of secrets. The combat is like classic Paper Mario with a few modernizations that make it flow all the smoother. This game is just so lovingly made that no one needs to hold out for a squeal to The Thousand Year Door anymore; It's right here.. If you've been looking for a game that will fill the void that Nintendo has created since making Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, this is the game for you. As a side note, this game vastly overshadows the new Paper Mario: The Origami King if you were a larger fan of the first 2 games of this series. On its own the combat system is creative and fun, with an interesting world to explore as you play the game. Any RPG fan will like this game.. Maybe this is not TTYD but is decent and better in any way from every modern Paper Mario. If you consider what buy (Origami King or Bug Fables, buy Bug Fables with a clear conscience; Origami King is a joke). After I’ve played Paper Mario: Origami King I changed my opinion about this game. Maybe this is not a PM:TTYD but this is very good RPG game. Origami King is a beauty crap, Bug Fables is unpolished diamond. I hope that the next part of this game will wipe out the Paper Mario series, which deserves to be forgotten. It's what made the original paper Mario games great in a new package that feels superb. If you want more of a challenge similar to the paper Mario mods the game has a hard mode badge right out of the gate, and additional challenge badges you can get later on to really make it punishing. I've seen comments about how specific save spots are a problem but that's the intention, it's just like the older RPG from a bygone era. The only real complaint i have is that a few puzzles, particularly involving the boomerang, can be tedious and finicky.. Fantastic game. Don't give up after the first few minutes if you're not a fan of Paper Mario (meaning you've never played them before). Give it a chance for an hour or two & i think you'll be glad you did. Every Paper Mario fan will love it. It runs great, even in handheld mode, btw.. The Paper Mario we've all wanted. Amazing music, charming characters, wonderful gameplay, perfect combat anf awesome medal system.. This game is solid 8.5 but it deserves a lot of more attention . Full of secrets bosses, items and strategies using the medals. Technically is Paper Mario 3 Bug Fables but at least is better than the 64 original. A Must buy for any RPG fan, especially , Paper Mario Fans.. What an incredibly charming game that taps into exactly what made the old Paper Mario games so much fun to play. It might not be as long or as polished as that but it's sure as hecc miles above what Nintendo has been doing with their franchise and I had a lot of fun playing it. The characters are lovely and their dialogue, jokes, and banter is so enjoyable. The graphic iconic and colorful and gameplay a lot of fun. One of the things I wasn't too crazy about is how when you need to use Medal/Badges which gives you special attributes, there always seem to be a tradeoff instead of them outright improving your characters. Like, you'd get a badge that gives 1+ to attack BUT 1- to defense. You have to pour your level up points into medals to actually make use of them, which in itself should be the tradeoff so I didn't feel it as satisfying to use medals as I did when using badges in Paper Mario. I definitely hope to see more from this franchise again in the future!. Hey it's about time we got something like this out of a developer other than Nintendo. Cool premise, multi-platform and superficially reminds me of Hollow Knight. Sold.. As a lot of people have noted, it's a really good game for people who liked the classic Paper Mario RPGs from the Nintendo 64 and GameCube. Personally, I think the formula has aged quite well (and has even been improved upon!), so I'd actually argue this game is made for more than just those players in particular. Also, the characters and world are quite charming, and the OST is very good. There's also a LOT to do in this game, so you're definitely getting your money's worth. I hope we can fondly remember this game 15 years from now like we did with Paper Mario 64 and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.. this game is fantastic! whether you're a fan of the old school paper Mario games and looking for a spiritual successor, or a casual player looking for a fun experience for a low price, this game is a great choice. it has a well written cast of lovable characters with interesting backstories and amazing chemistry. the combat is incredible, the story and atmosphere are unforgettable, the soundtrack and artstyle are delightful, and there is an incredible amount of content for the price. it blew me away the first time I played it. instant classic.. This is the best Paper Mario game since TTYD. It truely is the spiritual successor and puts all the other Paper Mario games to shame. I wouldn’t be surprised if this may end up better than origami king based on the battle system alone.. If you like Super Paper Mario you will love this game the gameplay is great. It's basically everything good about TTYD or Paper Mario 64 but way harder. This is a must buy in my opinion.. Save points are kind of annoying in this game I think i saw another review that mentioned that. It's a good game, it def scratches that PM TYD itch until this new game releases later on this summer. I'm enjoying it.. This game succeeds in everything its trying to do, and I would say, it evens surpasses the beloved Paper Mario games!. This game is a love letter for every TTYD lover in the world. Also one to people who are skeptical about the new paper mario. I can’t even sum up my joy for this game in this review, so just go play it. Please.. I really enjoy this game but having specific save points is very annoying because that means you can't stop whenever you won't, you either have to lose your progress or keep going until you can save. Another small issue is you can't see enemy health which messes with tactics for the game. The last thing is there is part of the game where you are throwing things and you have to be precise and it's hard to do that with the way the game moves the characters. You don't have complete control over how they're facing which makes being precise hard.. Ok so one of my favourite game is Paper Mario TTYD and you know what Bug Fables is even better. Get this and You wont be disapointed I dont even know why are you checking reviews for serious. Get this game already","the cast of characters, Vi, Kabbu and Leif is so entertaining and you quickly sympathise with all three . the battles are as great as they are in Paper Mario, with the difference that your three characters, Vi, Kabbu and Leif, are better balanced . the only issue this game has is, that the puzzle solving in the overworld is really inaccurate to use ."
"1,128.Final Fantasy X-2","What a disappointment. The minigames really hold this one back imo. Has some really interesting and fun concepts like the dressphere and dressphere grid, which essentially is just changing between job classes, and the fast paced ATB system but the frustrating and honestly boring mini games ruin it for me. I tried playing through this back in 2003 and just recently tried again after buying a PS Vita on eBay to replay old PS2 and PS3 games like FFX that had been ported to it and I still can't stay interested enough to want to continue playing this snooze fest. I'm feeling that same disappointment I did all the way back in 2003. Oh well :-/. A welcome character arc for Yuna that's surrounded by a lot of superfluous content. Getting to explore a post-Sin Spira bit by bit via the treasure-hunting mechanic is a neat idea, but there's too much here to hold the player's attention. Dressspheres are a fun play on the job system and allow for great amounts of customization in combat, but gameplay does begin to get stale after a while. I think this should have been more focused on Yuna and a much tighter experience. Plus, the amount of hoops the player has to jump through to get that promised reunion between her and Tidus is frankly nuts.. Comparing it to the first Final Fantasy X feels unfair but that just tells how mediocre this game is compare to the original,. This is in the top ten worst video games of all time, just for it's gameplay alone.. My first FF game. Great story, great combat, great mini-games. Great songs. Yuna is love, Yuna is life.. My first game in the series, hence such high praise. Great music, great story, beautiful world, one of the best mini-games in the whole franchise. Yuna is one of the best heroines in video games and she is better in the second part than the first.. I really enjoyed the game back in the day. I really loved battle system and mechanics.I loved to see old places again and some newadd-ons. Cuz it gives back good memories and I played the game alot:10/10. While a solid return to the real time combat of classic Final Fantasy games, X-2 is without a doubt a weaker entry to the fantastic predecessor. A lot of the charming, and endearing party members are gone in favour of Yuna, Rikku, and newcomer Paine. All three are fine characters, but they don't quite fill the large void left by the removal of several great characters. The Dressphere giving you access to classes is a great idea. Overall, I can't recommend X-2 to anyone but hardcore FF fans, or diehard fans of X. But even then, they might leave this game disappointed.. Characters the fans of FF10 loved. A new plot. A flashy looking, well presented game. hard for me to get past the FF Barbie dress up combat theme though. Clothes power and teen rock star heart throb power propel the girls to victory! it is worth a play though. It has it's charms for all the whackyness. I would never consider this a mainline entry to the FF series. It is what it is.. Not as good as the original FFX, the story is a joke and it is way too much super-flower-powery. Still, the RPG mechanics are extremely good and, in general, super addictive.. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. Sequel to my favorite Final Fantasy and game of all time. I definitely enjoy it more than the average person.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very fun game, but it was unnecessary, I still had a lot of fun with it. Yuna is waifu.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this tenth game in the series.. There was a graphic evolution compared to X, including more fluid reactions from the characters, but there was a great reuse of scenarios (many of them remarkable in X) The battles are a little more dynamic and the dressphere system is very interesting and helps a lot with strategy. But unfortunately the positives end here lol. There are two cutscenes with absurd good music. Very weak story, it gives you a very good taste at the beginning and it could be something incredible, but it drags to the end. End just to leave a smile on the faces of the guys but it seems that it was a business put aside from the type (whew, we forgot the tidus, let's solve it here quickly). Special dresspheres are pretty much useless in the end. To miss the perfect ending, just don't sleep on the ship once and that's it, you missed a conversation at that exact moment the chapter ended. Don't even think about playing this game without a lap strap walkthrough and look before every step. The game tries to pass something light, which I found super cool at first, but then it gets tired right in the second chapter. Summary: The game at the beginning is very exciting, a lighter grip, lighter missions, but then the game does not excite. The story starts off very promising and gets a little disappointing. A nice game, but I ended up dragging myself to get 100% 65 out of 100. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If there's a single word to describe Final Fantasy X-2, it's ""lazy."" This glorified expansion to Final Fantasy X is a thrown together asset flip, made on the cheap, and meant to capitalize on an already established game. Besides there being almost no new areas to explore, the game is also split up into an unsatisfying and dull mission structure, and features a story that diminishes what came before it. However, if the game has one saving grace, it's the Dress Sphere system and solid battle system, which even hold its own compared to its predecessor. Final Fantasy X-2 isn't just a terrible name, it's a terrible product.. (going to try to avoid spoilers for both this game and Final Fantasy X, but there will be many comparisons since they link together.) I can already tell there are a lot of negative reviews by people that either didn't play the game or barely played it. Final Fantasy X-2 is not a sequel to Final Fantasy X. It's a side-game concerned more with building the world of Spira after the events of Final Fantasy X than it is continuing the story of it (which it absolutely does not do in any way). Whereas the story and world of Final Fantasy X was dark, somber, and honestly pretty depressing, the story and world of Final Fantasy X-2 is more hopeful, silly, and lighthearted. The first chapter or two, especially, probably isn't for everyone (the story at that point is very cheesy and Charlie's Angels-esque) but the actual meat of the story begins after that. The game takes place 2 years after the events of Final Fantasy X, with Yuna now free of her Summoner duties and travelling with a group of Sphere Hunters known as the Gullwings. You explore the world after it's begun to ""heal"" and help out the citizens while also progressing your own personal worries and goals. Saying too much past that is probably spoilers. Spheres are like magic ""recorder"" technology that keep track of events that happened in the past (well, oversimplifying it). These Spheres can also be turned into ""Dress Spheres"" after collected that act as new classes for your characters to equip. These Dress Spheres can be placed on a grind to grant extra buffs and then equipped by a character to allow them to change classes on the fly during battle. The battle system is far more fun, robust, and potentially difficult than the fairly 1-dimensional system of FFX. Lost is the boring turn-based system that required very little strategy and back is the ATB system that has always been far superior. Back is the class system that's been dead since Final Fantasy Tactics. The combat system and return of classes is what put the combat of FFX-2 far above FFX. Storywise and character-wise... yeah, not very strong, but not terrible either (we already know many of them, so...) This is definitely a weaker part of the game. Music is fantastic outside of a few tunes near the beginning of the game Another weaker point is, much like FFXII (PS2) you have to do very particular things in a very particular order or be locked out of content (in this case a 100% rating and a dress sphere) Also, the end-game content is FAR more difficult than FFX, so if you like challenge, even at max level, you will have at least a bit of challenge. If I gave FFX an 87% and enjoyed this more, then to be fair, including it's flaws, will give this a 90% That said, the HD Remaster version brings decent amount of content to sink your teeth into so I'd recommend just playing that one instead.. Not as good as FFX. This game lacks the heart and soul that made FFX great. The music is forgettable and sometimes sounds like something from a commercial, the gameplay is quite annoying and doesn't allow for strategy. The story is pointless for sure.. An insult to the world of video games. completely ruined the characters of the predecessor. Total crap, vote to manage the game: zero. It takes 4 as a rating only because at least the gameplay TRIES to renew itself. I advise you not to play it so as not to spoil the wonderful idea you have of the characters of Final Fantasy X. The producer should apologize to all the fans of the saga that he has made fun of.. Final Fantasy X-2 March — April 2021 Xbox Series X via GamePass Score: Six out of Ten. This game is **** Don't buy it. WHY THE **** WOULD THEY MAKE THIS GAME because the previous game already had a complete story. Playing this game is one of my largest regrets, and the lost thirty hours I have put into it could have been put towards doing anything better. WHY THE **** IS THERE A MASSAGE SCENE IN A FINAL FANASY GAME. The game has almost no story, and all the quests are extremely trivial and make to attempt to actually progress the plot. I can literally sum up the entire story in maybe two or three sentences. This game is **** don't buy it, and it completely ruins the story of the first.. The first direct sequel in Final Fantasy history (Each game had a new world, setting and characters while having reoccurring themes sometimes). On the negative side this game has much recycled assets, a sometimes silly story and I recommend a guide because of so much missable stuff. On the positive side it is good recycled content, the job / dress system is excellent from a gameplay perspective and it gives closure for the story of the previous game if you do the right things. The story itself is set approx 2 years after the events of Final Fantasy 10. Yuna has done what was thought impossible. She ultimately saved the world of Spira from a death spiral but at a high personal price. However not all is unicorns and rainbows as the people of the world have fallen into different factions with colliding worldviews. The changes that came with saving the world might lead to disaster. Meanwhile Yuna, Rikku and the new character Paine are on a mission involving an impostor that leads deeper and deeper into a secret that can change the world. I like the story, lore and worldbuilding while fully admitting that there are really some silly / goofy moments (or moments of disbelieve). You can also get closure to some arcs, learn new stuff as there are still some surprises and twists. I think I am too nice here as fan because many other despise the story. What I liked is the job / dress system. You get spheres that give your characters access to jobs. From normal stuff like Warrior, White Mage or Thief to more obscure classes like an Animal Tamer. Some you can obtain through following the main story and others are hidden. All characters can use all costumes but there is one special one for each of them (Special conditions must be met before use in each battle but these costumes are insanely powerful). Remark: There is a Garment Grid where you have to arrange the dresses. These give another array of tactical options. Some have more spots to use and others have benefits like one / multiple basic bonuses / abilities, stat boost when changing jobs in battle or protection / regeneration. There are a lot in the game and some are immensely useful (Depends also on play-style). They used the standard active time battle system familiar in Final Fantasy at that time. It works well and there are some challenges here. Gameplay: My main complaint is that there is a lot of missable stuff. I bought a guide and it has 42 pages for side missions alone excluding mini games. I like finding hidden stuff and puzzle out some things but here it goes too far as some things are in the “They expected that we figure this out alone?” realm. They have an extra to do list at the end to get everything right. You will never get the best ending without a guide but there is GameFAQs for this. There are also a ton of mini games. There is a PR duel, a card game, Blitzball (different from Final Fantasy 10!), bonus dungeons and a shooting game atop on all else. Lets talk about the presentation. Like I already said they reused a lot of assets from Final Fantasy 10. This means everything looks and sounds good but it is still a bit of a disappointment. I think I will give my final rating. Overall this is a fun and enjoyable game with some weaknesses. It would not have been received well as main game. The story has its strengths and weaknesses too but it gives closure. The battle / dress / job system is excellent however. It is for people that enjoyed the prequel and for all others it is not a good game that I would recommend without warning that you need to know or have finished the first game.. An absolutely terrible game! It’s intolerable in it’s idiotic and undeveloped plodding storyline, bad dialogue, terrible mini games that compromise almost the entirety of the run time, unbearably annoying characters, terrible character animations, copy and paste bargain basement RNG dungeons poorly stitched into levels from X, broken combat system that’s basically the same as XIII’s and XIII-2’s which were also horrible games and the unbearably cheesy character design. X-2 is about as terrible as the XIII trilogy and XV. Just play the vastly superior X and pass on this trainwreck unless you want to experience a terrible game.. All the worst impulses of a Square JRPG: cheap mega-enemies disproportionate to your place in the game. Bizarre 1-hit kills. Grinding mini games. Grinding retreading of your favorite places in Spira. Insipid auto-generates dungeons. Grinding everything. The whole game is mainly filler. Nonsense story made to sell pop idol tie-ins in Japan. I’ve played and 100% completed every final fantasy up to this point. (1-10, 12). And this is basically where the series turned into “punishing mini games to extend playtime” collection. Except ff12, I quit square Square Enix games after this. Looking at 13, 15 &KH it looks like they doubled down on the ffx2 approach.. At first it seemed pretty cool. I could play through as a giant crab if i wanted to. The job system is cool. I love their goth friend. The way they tease each other is funny and lighthearted. But the more I played, the more sloppy the design became. I went to a place with a mission, it didn't tell me where that mission was, eventually I encountered a red ""go there!"" arrow on my mini-map, and when i went where it told me, there was nothing to do there. So I tried another mission and it involved going through an entire level you already went through in FFX just to have someone run away so you have to backtrack through that entire same level again, all with random encounters. This is a sloppy mess.. Final Fantasy X-2 is an average game in general, I recommend it if you want to see the consequences of the events of the first game and want a much lighter and happier game (despite having some small emotional moments). The story has a 'prologue' to a show that is ok, but the first real arc in the story is pretty bad. The whole theme of hunting like spheres was okay, but the way they did it with those stupid LeBlanc interactions was pretty rough. Later on we have a context for LeBlanc and she becomes a more pleasant character (despite being tainted by the horrible presentation). At the end of chapter 2, the story takes a slightly more serious and less boring turn. The political issue for an interesting idea, but it didn't really affect Yuna's 'main' story. Personally I liked Paine because she is the only one who has a real serious tone to the main characters, but the way her story was handled did not please me (the story itself was okay). The Gullwings in general was one of the 'light' aspects that pleased me most in history. The game has some emotional moments, but almost all of them are due to the events in the first game. And the 'new' emotional moments don't have much weight due to the lack of 'context', focus and detail on the history of the past there (I don't want to give spoilers). Perhaps my main criticism of the story was that it has too much secondary content that has significant importance in the story or simply adds to it or the world, unlike FF X. The fight is very different from the first game but I still consider it a good fight, but I certainly found it worse. It involves much less strategy, but more timing and reflex. This is not exactly a problem and only that when I play a turn-based RPG I want a combat as strategic as possible. The game has a new movement system, only in the last dungeon did I discover how to use the 'right' of the jump system, you have to keep holding the button (strange). But I admit that this system made it possible to add another layer to the level design (even if it was sometimes misused). The change in Yuna's personality and a very complex theme, I thought it was kind of forced, for sure, but from what I had read I thought she had changed from water to wine but I didn't think she had changed so much. As for the design ... the face and hair I found peculiar, that '' 'strand' '' of her hair, especially the face, I just didn't understand why it changed. A good OST like others is average. Another thing was that the story had billionaire, even compared to Final Fantasy X. Obviously I thought Good Ending was very good, but I recognize that it 'spoils' a certain aspect of the original story (100% True Ending, I didn't think it was so much better). And although I tried unfortunately I couldn't get Good Ending. At the end of the day, I would say that this game was made 110% to farm on fans of Final Fantasy X, which at the time was a huge success and success (I would say unexpected) from Square. It is the second best seller in the franchise.. Worst $20 I've ever spent This game is horrible. Do yourself a favor and just play a legitimate Final Fantasy game. I now look into Final Fantasy games before I buy it because of the experience I had with this game. I have no interest in dancing to beat my enemies. This game gets an F. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 5/10 FFX-2 is not a good sequel. The worst part of this game is that if you've played the first FFX... you'll hate this : Everything that was charming from the previous installment is gone, this feels like a completely different game set in a different world. The serious tones are mostly gone, the characters behave like different people - losing what made them memorable in the first installment. The Battle System is a bit more lively this time around, but it's so rooted to sailor-moon-esque transformations that is a bit painful to go through... Graphics are good, not as great, since a lot of assets are straight out FFX-1 which is a couple of years old by now. The story concept is neat, but poorly executed. They've tried to milk as much as possible from FFX-1 popularity, but they failed.. Great game it could possibly make a great build up to ffx3 to be more serious oriented, ffx2 just a laid back game really enjoying the fan service and the world building. A very mediocre follow up to a stunning game. Unnecessary fanservice and it's ending ruins the entire legendary story of the previous game. Good gameplay though.. While we have great combat system here, FFX-2 is just a lot worse FFX. Serious tone is gone and for the most part, everything is just silly, when it sudenly gets darker, it feels out of place. Majority of music is bland, completely not on par with Uematsu work and the whole game is structrured in a non linear way that feels very confusing if you go for 100% playtrought. Its not really a bad game, but certainly not exactly the dream of someone who just finished X.. This is also a really good Final Fantasy game. I call it the 2nd part of Final Fantasy X and it makes allot of fun to play that game 2. A world where you will play only as 3 girls who can change their costumes which are like a class / job system in this game. It's also a really good and enjoyable game to play.. I just hope that the person who had the Idea of introducing J-Pop to the FFX lore got fired. Lazy world design, terrible music, and characters. And a surprisingly not too bad combat system. Avoid this game. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue: OKAY.. the game would get a 8 out of 10 if it wasn't for the terrible mini games I mean really rikkus #7 calibration pillar?. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Bad story, unbalanced job system, and too many missables, It's still fun to play and has a lot of content though.. FFX-2 Is a trash game. It is absolutely intolerable from dungeon design, script, plot progression, voice acting, gameplay, core loop, to literally everything. This game should be burned and buried in a desert. I never felt like I wasted my time and life as much as I did playing this terrible game and I play some terrible games on a regular basis.. I went back to play this game after a probably a decade or more hiatus. I never finished it, which is odd for a Final Fantasy game, so I decided to dust it off and give it another go from scratch. I've quickly realized why this game was never finished... First off, the controls are clunky. While much of the fine control is there from the previous game, they added a new jumping mechanic that is absolutely horrid. You are forced to jump from platform to platform quite often in this game, and it never feels smooth or fluid. If your character fails to time the jump correctly they will stop themselves and falter at the edge of the jump for a second. Sometimes you're just faltering over and over because you're not in the exact spot they want you to jump from. There are some parts of the game that are worse than others. For instance, the rotating machine underneath ****'s the thing of nightmares. You're forced to blindly climb above, below, and around it to make your way up to some treasure. The jumps are so tightly linked to other jumps you end up jumping back and forth and banging your head against a wall trying to make your way around the obstacle. The whole jumping mechanism should have never been added, bottom line. Final Fantasy is an RPG, not a platformer, and it fails horribly as a platformer. Frustrations aside from the jumping, there are just too many annoying mini-games in this **** pretty much ALL of them must be completed if you hope to get 100% completion. Final Fantasy has had it's share of mini-games in the past, but FFX-2 is essentially one big mini-game. Almost every ""mission"" involves a **** the Calm Lands has been reduced to nothing but mini-games! You're going to miss dodging lightning 100+ times in the Thunder Plains when you see the new mini-games they've added for Calibrating the lightning towers, some of the later towers are damn near impossible unless you have ESP. I had to slow down the sequencing using an emulator just to finish a few of them, and I have fairly quick reflexes. Again, Final Fantasy has always been an RPG with a few fun mini-games on the side. Final Fantasy is not Mario Party. The mini-games here are an awful distraction and rarely fun. Due to the implementation of the Dress Sphere, Square-Enix took out the tried and true formula of weapons and armor. While the Dress Sphere can be fun at times, the lack of strong equipment system means you're forced to rely on Accessories only to help gear your characters for fights and tweak your builds. Sure, Garment Grids can help a little in that regard, but it's almost not worth mentioning because the bonuses are often meager. While there are a number of Accessories in the game, you're limited to 2 spots which can be rather limiting. Overall it means that most treasure chests you encounter in the world are not filled with actual treasure. Instead they're filled with junk curatives and the occasional Accessory. It's almost boring opening treasure boxes as a result. Last major criticism is the characters. The lack of playable characters can be depressing. While you're more closely tied to a cast of 3, it also means if there's a character you dislike you can't swap them out. Paine is entirely just too emo and depressing. While the same may have been said for Lulu in FFX, Lulu had far more personality and had moments of great character. Paine is boring and lifeless in her dialogue/emotions. There are some other criticisms, but they don't require full details. The story isn't quite as epic. The lack of a clear cut antagonist is a problem. The whole ""Charlie's Angels"" motif can be too cheesy and over the top sometimes. The combat often seems a bit too easy at times. There are few benefits to maxing out a dress sphere, you can't carry any of the benefits over if you switch to another dress sphere/class (Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics). The only way you can take advantage of those other skills is if you waste an Accessory slot for a special trinket that lets you use one class's abilities that you've learned. The list goes on. What did I like about this game? Not much. You would have thought they could have spent more time improving the game given the fact they rehashed/reused almost all of the maps from FFX, there was very little they added or needed to add for X-2. Many of the character sprites were the same as well, aside from the main characters (Which did get a small upgrade/polish it seems) there were a small handful of new characters introduced so it didn't require much work. That said, I did enjoy some aspects of the dress spheres/class changes. It brought back some fun classes like Dark Knight that we haven't seen in some time. The characters of Yuna and Rikku are well done. Brother is amusing. Overall, this game isn't worth the time. I'm almost done with 100%, it's going to collect dust again after that.. After FFX this game is a huge wtf slap in the face. The spinoff games feel cheaply made and this was no different.. Why did it come to this? Sakaguchi's series didn't need this sort of disgrace. Honestly? The gameplay was decent. It was a fresh change of pace to a tired formula, which I could praise. But this games most unforgivable flaw is what it did to FFX's story. Yuna was an incredibly strong female lead for FFX. Honestly, she was the central character the whole time, and I consider her the main character. She made the decisions, chose the path they'd walk, and saved the world. She was shy and meek at first, but by the end she was strong enough to shrug off the chains of religion and destiny and shook the whole world to its core. She was a person everyone should admire, who happened to be female. Yet in X-2, she's reduced to a fanservice character and valley girl. Why? I can understand wanting to have a female lead again after all these years (FF VI) but it was done so poorly. Like they wanted to make a feminist statement but missed the mark horribly. Yuna rants on about clothes and shopping and cute boys and treasure hunting. Gone and dead is the strong character I came to know in X. She's been replaced by this shallow child that has stolen her face and voice. Not to mention the fact that the entire story was random butt pull after butt pull where things happen for no foreshadowed reason, since they were trying to tie the story to a completed, closed one. And for all the torturous turns it takes, they were pointless. The best ending you can get is the ending we already HAD after X. But with the beauty and subtlety removed from it. So while I can't say it fails as a game since the gameplay is relatively solid, I can't ever forgive SE for what they did to the series with this entry. The beginning of a long decline and the death of my youth. I hope that XV's new direction puts an end to all of this. SE has proven they can't make what they made when they still had Sakaguchi. So maybe when they try for something different, we'll see better results. I trust the KH team, and eagerly await the loosening of Disney's shackles in the form of XV.. I have to agree with the rest of the user reviews. I've played X for the first time now in 2018 and I have to say it was a masterpiece despite its flaws. This one however it's a pretty bad continuation of the original and a mediocre game overall. Simply put, FF X-2 has nothing to tell. It's just a walk through the world of Spira which is now empty and a revisit to old characters which are now poorly written and lack any depth. In the meantime you do a bunch of stupid minigames and fight random enemies because, well, they had to give you something to do. The combat isn't bad though but it's too fast, easy and lacks the strategy that X had. The main story is practically non existent and the premise itself that is supposed to draw you into the game makes no sense given what we know from X. The ending is even more stupid and just cheap fan-service. This ""story"" to call it something would only be enough to make a 2 to 3hr game. The developers knew this so they've put a lot of filler here. You will spend 90% of your time roaming aimlessly in an empty world doing minigames, random fights and speaking to random poorly written characters. And then, there's Yuna and Rikku. We understand that the world now is very different and Yuna and Rikku are young girls who are now liberated from Sin and so on. So it is obvious that the tone of these characters will change. But the developers simply didn't care to write them well or to write them at all. You see, this character development would be interesting to see but it happens offscreen, Yuna and RIkky are already like that at the start of the game. And then, the developer's interpretation of this change was to introduce Jpop, dancing and skimpy outfits with no depth at all. Very stupid. Overall, this is not a bad game, it is a mediocre one but as a continuation of X it ****. Skip it and save your time.. Pretty decent for a spin off, but doesn't match up to the original. Don't think I bothered completing it. Emulates fine, the program is a little revealing for past audiences this may shock or offend depending on circumstances. The game itself finds a niche though and functions fine but retains integrity while sacrificing some other things, not bad.. No where near as good as Final Fantasy X, but still a solid game in the franchise. It's worth a play through for fans of the previous game and general FF fans.. Sadly, one of the 2,3 or 5 games that I couldn't stand for more than 10 minutes in my 29 as gamer. In other words, one of the worst games that I have played (and I have played almost EVERY game). The characters look, act, and FIGHT! as if they were on a Sailor Moon episode :S, you literally have to change your clothes in order to use ""super powers"", and the real time system ****, because you have to play as 3 characters at the same time, so for example, when you click one command on the character A, to attack enemy C, one of your other characters alredy killed the guy, and A hits the air :S To me, the seems only a poor excuse to made profit. The s",a welcome character arc for Yuna that's surrounded by a lot of superfluous content . a lot of hoops the player has to jump through to get that promised reunion between her and Tidus is frankly nuts . this is in the top ten worst video games of all time .
"1,129.Battlerite","It is a well-designed game, and it is very fun to play with friends, but it is a shame that the community is dead. I guess I was just unlucky to play it in the downfall of the game. Big shouts to my friend Ropiey. ""Battlerite"" is a quite enjoyable little brawler that offers a fun gaming experience. While I might not see myself playing it extensively, I can certainly see the appeal for others. The game truly stands out with its polished gameplay and a diverse cast of fun characters. Each character brings a unique set of abilities to the battlefield, adding depth and excitement to every match. The overall level of polish is evident, making for a smooth and engaging gameplay experience. The fast-paced nature of ""Battlerite"" keeps you on your toes, and the battles are filled with adrenaline-pumping moments. It's the kind of game that you can hop into for a quick match or two, making it perfect for short bursts of gaming fun. While it might not become my main gaming obsession, ""Battlerite"" is undeniably a well-crafted and enjoyable brawler that can easily become a go-to choice for casual gaming sessions. So, if you're looking for a polished and fun experience with unique characters and thrilling battles, ""Battlerite"" is definitely worth a try.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent Moba ,pvp arena i ever seen! P.S(i played LoL,Dota,Dota 2,Hon,Wow,Hots. and others. Best balance ! (but not the best matchmaking, perhaps because online now is not big). You wait 10 minutes for a game with death cycle and as a result, you play with single bots, so my score will be 4 games on restricted internet (most games are not played) but I will say that they are a game played on the internet, but they are a game that ends quickly.. A good little bit of fun for a few hours. Characters are ok and gameplay is solid.. This game left a pretty bad taste in my mouth and the behavior of the developers hasn't helped. Pros: It is fun, fast paced, and a great game to play with friends. It seemed to have good potential and a passionate community. Cons: Oh boy. No Updates - Stunlock Studios released maybe 3 updates for the game before abandoning it. It didn't make them enough money so they didn't bother. Sound familiar? Unbalanced - This game has some horrible balance issues. Some characters are genuinely unplayable beyond casual games. Some characters are a MUST and some you shouldn't even bother learning. Toxic Community - Nearly every match is met with some level of insult or backhanded comment if you ever do poorly. No different than league of legends in that aspect. This could be alleviated by the developers but they have no intention of managing their community now or in the future. No report system. Shameless Cash Grab - This issue is ongoing between this developers multiple games. They are now currently releasing ANOTHER battle royale that is identical to their last. Across now 3 almost identical games the developers have the same list of characters and skins, however you must purchase each one with real money across each game independently. The developers actually released the exact same game twice, and charged full price to returning players for skins that were already over priced. I have no words to describe my disappointment in developers who choose money over hard work. Rome wasn't built in a day, and you can't make money from a bad game.. it has potential but sadly low player base is killing it. Gameplay and skill is top notch tho.. just a bit dead really. I have played very little of the game as DotA 2 is my main moba, but this is basically the opposite of DotA. Short, fast-paced games. It's not as anxiety inducing and toxic. The definition of fun.. Worst game, unbalanced. Always the same champs that win over and over again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. Get this game. Seriously. I'm writing this review because I want people to try this game out. Here are the good reasons. 1. It's cheap. $30 unlocks the full game and all the champions. Or you can play for free and unlock as you go. Unlocking new characters is relatively easy to you. The developers have put a lot of free content inside, free skins, etc. You get loot boxes often. Not like League of Legends. 2. It's faster paced than League of Legends/DOTA. Matches last 5-10 minutes. 3. The gameplay is skill based. There's no Random Number Generator (RNG) moves to the damage whatsoever. You need accuracy or you'll whiff your moves. The game tells you on the bottom right how you died, when you die, so you can improve and know what killed you. 4. This is a competitive game, with a cool ranking system. This is pure PvP and everything feels fair/balanced from what I can see. You can win with every character. It doesn't matter if there are two ranged guys, two melee guys, you can win if you are good. Similarly, you can also win if the enemy is 2vs1 on you. If you're good you can win. 5. Support this developer if you want to see more skill based games rewarded. Personally, I'm sick of League and Dota with auto right click on enemies. This game is precise and has a bit of everything: a loadout system, no cumbersome item system, no 150+ champions that barely feel different (the roster feels good). 6. Great music, I love how this game get's into some trance like music when you're in the groove. 7. The TENSION. This game creates tension in best of 5 matches. Many times I've had games tied 2-2 and had to win the last game to win. It's great. I haven't had this much tension since playing PUBG in the last of 5. 8. Simple to learn, difficult to master. There's a lot of depth and high skill ceiling in this game. It's a game you can play for a long time and learn more every day from how the characters interact with each other and the different combos your characters can perform. It's a joy to learn new characters and keeps the game feeling fresh. 9. I've had a lot of fun with this game. Join the discord, read the Reddit posts, get your friends to play a free game. 10. Support the dev. $30 is pretty cheap and they even reimburse you if you try the game and you have played the free version I think they give you a discount for champions you've already unlocked. THESE ARE THE PRACTICES AND THE DEVELOPERS WE SHOULD REWARD. Not the cash grab Ubisoft / Electronic Arts / microtransaction kind of developers. I hope this game stays with a high playerbase because I want to play it for a long time. Hell, it should be an e-sport and there's probably just not enough traffic. I'd rather watch this than some drawn out LoL match. 12. This is the true Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. You seriously are in a battle arena and you feel like you're in a tournament. The only negative I can see is if the playerbase dwindles matches will be hard to find. Right now it's very easy to find a match.. A MOBA super fun, with characters of unique characteristics, servers with little or no ping (my internet is 2 MB) The game contains some problems and bugs, but nothing that could hinder the gameplay. I think Battlerite can reach the position of League Of Legends. Awesome game! I'm not a fan of MOBA's, but this is unique among them; a true arena brawler without the other stuff. If you like WoW arenas you should like this one. I'm hoping this game and others like it will grow in popularity, as they would rightly deserve. Give it a try!. Battlerite is the answer to the question, What is the best Team-Based-PvP game out there? Gameplay consists of pure fighting and pure skills. Games are short and exciting and the balance is pretty good. There is space for character customaziation, both gameplay wise and cosmeticly. Other than buying champions, nothing else is locked behind a hard paywall. The battlerite system is completily free to use from level 1. Cosmetics are, although, randomly, obtainable, even for free to play users. Best of all, Devs love the game, listen to the community and have a lot of work planned for the near future, like in game automated tournaments and clan system as well as a champion release every month for 2018.. The matchmaking is bad. The balance is okay. There are some hard counters, but not as many as in traditional MOBAs. The community is just as toxic as LoL or DoTA. The grind is definitely real if you don't want to spend money.. Best MOBA experience I've ever had, with unique mechanics and characters. After playing this other MOBA games like league of legends or Dota 2 seem boring to me. Fast, action packed battles that keep tension from start till the end. Well done Stunlock Studios!. Decent game. Small player base. Definitely not a 10/10 like the fanboys on here say. The community is full of arrogant **** that spam ""ez"" at the end of the match. 5/10: not worth your time.. Love the arena pvp gameplay that they have created. Very fun, highly addictive, balanced, ranking based completely on skill, high level of adrenaline during the battles, I highly recommend it !. Battlerite takes the best from MOBAs - small scale PvP teamfights - and drops all the boring stuff creating an intense action experience. Add to that very short queue time and 5-10 minutes matches and you will get non-stop adrenaline fun.. I've been playing since beta on this game. Really fun game, good substitute for league of legends or wow arenas. However I have to say, it's not the easiest game for new players to get into, but especially for people who are new to isometric PvP games. The skill floor is very high. The rewards and progression are well made, and the loot box design is not too stingy. Movement can feel awkward until you get used to the game, but you can get past it. The most important question to ask yourself before installing Battlerite is this: Do I have the patience to learn this game? If you give up on games easily, then Battlerite will be a quick burn for you.. The best game in TAB games. Mechanics and game control is amazing. Moldavian communitry like this game very much. We hope you will improve your game and in 2018 we will be on the greatest world tournament.. With a diverse cast of characters, an incredible level of depth to play, and a keen focus on the part of MOBA's we enjoy the most (facing off against other players), Battlerite shines as an example of what MOBA's should be. Ditching the path of what they've always been for a stronger, brighter future.. A fun arena style isometric arena game. It runs fantastic, is fast paced, has quick battles and is very intuitive while feeling very intuitive to play. As a F2P-game, I highly recommend it!","""Battlerite"" is a fun little brawler that offers a fun gaming experience . the game truly stands out with its polished gameplay and a diverse cast of fun characters . the fast-paced nature of ""Battlerite"" keeps you on your toes ."
"1,130.Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars","horrible gameplay, horrible engine. doesnt feel like a C&C. graphics are good but no real fun. mostly boring.. I remember when I was a toddler I saw my Dadwith his cd cases on his desk that had all of the DVD versions of command and conquer. It looked amazing! I love red alert 3 Tiberium Wars and Uprising.They should make one for the 2025.. Pros.: Story. Cinematics and actors. New units and ideas. Graphics. Cons.: Absolutely dumb AI and units movement. First Scrin mission. Unplayable. I read that it's because of the patch.. Super fun RTS one of those games for me that sense I started playing as a little kid I can play a little of and drop for months or even years and come back to it and have just as much fun. Admittedly other games do the RTS system better but for me nothing can beat the setting and awesome characters troops and aesthetic of command and conquer as a whole but especially tiberium wars.. RTS icon! Minus 2 points for the lack of innovation (though it's hard to change) and a 30 fps lock. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Good real time strategy. Almost the last of its kind. Interesting world. Even if you have not played the previous parts, you will still fall in love with the world. Maybe network battles are not a good thing, but the single player campaign is very strong.. I enjoyed the game and even bought Kane's Wrath. It's very pretty. It is not the best C&C game, but it is the last good one in the series. RA3. Similar to C&C: Generals - Zero Hour, the AI is just ridiculous and nowhere near human-like playing style. I've tried playing against Medium (Balanced) difficulty level and it's just consistently relentless at sending units to attack my base. Even if I manage to defend I eventually run out of tiberium. I wonder if the developers ever bothered to play against the AI to see what it's like. Also looking at the post-game stats there is just no way that any normal player would be able to build units and structures and attack in such a short period of time. Really, because of this I'd say it's border-line unplayable.. Worst pathfinding in the genre. When you play mission, where your resources is very limited and your units always dies because they CAN'T **** EXECUTE SIMPLE COMMAND AND GET THE **** OUT OF ENEMY FIRE RANGE - only wish is delete this crappy piece of code and never install it again.. A fine enough RTS with solid mechanics and art design. Ultimately a pretty forgettable experience.. A decent RTS, not the best one in the series, but certainly worth playing at least for the C&C atmosphere and cool cast.. I was waiting for game like this since RA2, and was not disappointed :) Great in every aspect for each RTS fan :). This game was ""that line"" when relevant and good graphics and game-play improvements bordered with some dubious decisions. The game itself continues the plot of the previous ""Tiberium duo"", only in a more improved graphic. But sometimes doubts slipped about certain details, which, in the end, were realized, unfortunately, in subsequent games of the series. However, it is still the game, which is interesting to play and deserves a normal rating and attention of the players.. Good old classics, you can spend time in it and have fun. I don't want to lie, but maybe the best part in the C & C line.. Unimaginative, cliched, uninspired. A step down from Generals in sophistication. There is no more strategy as such, just a matter of churning out lots of remarkably similar units to keep throwing at a similarly spawning enemy. Boring terrain, boring units, boring gameplay. Vastly inferior to Zero Hour/Destructive Forces. EA clearly know that by dumbing the game down they will attract a lower common denominator with lower expectations. But even so, I'd be very surprised if the game's high score here isn't influenced by some kind of an EA click-farm.. The game is just horrible, nothing makes any **** sense, HEY LOOK AT ME I CAN LIE DOWN GOOD LUCK**** DOING ANYTHING. and HEY I SEE YOUR 10,000 SOLDIERS LEMME GUN THEM ALLLLL DOWN WITH 2 TURRETS. This game is good, despite this being the last known good C&C game that ever came out from EA games. This is truly a treat with the campaign being decent, but challenging even on the hard difficulty for people like me who play love the dying genera. This Uber late analysis of the game spawned from me coming back to this game in 2015, which really is rare thing for me to do with a C&C game. I beating the campaign that I cannot talk about due to spoilers because it was a interesting twist. I highly recommend staying away from skirmish or multi-player until you beaten either the Nod Campaign or GDI Campaign just to make the experience a little more authentic. This game is so good that the only reason it is not a nine is because one of the factions is slightly more overpowered over the rest, even if it feels like they deserved this OP nature considering where they came from. I recommend playing previous C&C games and avoid any C&C game released after this game.. A must have for any RTS fan, this is the apex of the C&C series coming on the eve of its decline in the playable but very flawed Red Alert 3 and then its total debasement by EA in awful C&C 4. The unit balance and differences between the 3 factions are perfect, the graphics were way ahead of their time and still look great and its has a very long and challenging single player campaign with an interesting story and varied game play.. The game is about strategy game with new resource, tiberium. The tiberium can use for power plant, weapon, etc. If your infantry through pass tiberium, that can damage your infantry.. Pretty much the greatest this series ever got. Great cast (mostly pulled from Battlestar Galactica), engaging story and really enjoyable base building strategy.Also the extra race was both a surprise and a delight.. Tiberium Wars is a simple, yet very fun RTS game. There are 3 factions to choose from, each of which are very well structured, yet still have their unique advantages and disadvantages. This balances the gameplay beautifully. Many RTS games have very complex gameplay mechanics, which often turns off newcomers of the genre. The gameplay in Tiberium Wars is very easy to grasp and the customizable AI gives you a fun, comfortable learning curve, but there is a downside to this feature. Tiberium Wars lacks any innovative RTS features and doesn’t bring anything new to the table. In addition, the limited amount of custom maps restricts the fun Tiberium Wars has to offer in skirmish mode. Fortunately, these imperfections are easily overlooked with its incredibly satisfying gameplay that deserves the attention of any RTS fan or gamers new to the genre.. Returning to C&C tradition after C&C Generals, C&C 3 brought back FMV cutscenes for the single player campaign (and with an all-star cast). 3 sides to play with makes the game more interesting but the difficulty of this game compared to previous C&C titles can be overwhelming for some though. Also no awesome soundtrack by Frank Klepacki but they did bring on Steve Jablonksy.. I really enjoyed this game and its expansion. It was a worthy addition to the cnc series. I enjoyed this rts game far more than Starcraft 2. The multiplayer side of this game was very good, and i got to rank number 1 in this game for 1v1 and the expansion when the games were released.. I was pretty dissapointed. I grew up playing Red Alert 2/Yuri's Revenge. So I never knew that the Red Alert Franchise (prequel) was released after the sequel.... And then remade with tiberium and all that stuff. I liked the original Red Alert 2, I never bothered the campaign since I just liked going to war and having like 30 factions battle on the map. Was some crazy stuff. Red Alert 3 only had 3 factions which was like 1/10 of red alert 2. As for this game, didn't meet up to my expectations at all. Maybe because it said it was newer on Steam then RA, so that maybe it'd be better, and they'd just keep improving. Main things that bothered me: The **** user interface, the menu is confusing as **** with all these modes and it's like dark blue. The Babes, this ticked me off right at the beginning, I was expecting it to be like RA 3, the point of going to war is so that when you end the war, you have babes to return to., there are like no babes in this game. The in-game user interface, they switched all the buttons, why the **** would they do that. The graphics, how does a newer game have more horrible graphics than an older game. First of all, no explosions, yea things explode on airstrike, but guess what. You can airstrike a wooden house, and it won't explode. It plays the sound effect and then it sinks into the ground. WTF. Also, the reason RA didn't let you zoom all the way in to see your troops were to not show the low-rez landscape. When you zoom in to your troops now in squads (1 squad can contain like 5 people), the background looks like a solid crap color. I look for gameplay over graphics, but the gameplay is extremely repetitive. They used crappy colors for the user interface, everything seems so damp, so I guess it's like an apocolyptic situation where some dude called Kain is trying to **** with everybody and your base is like under a rock doing research. Man, they needa continue the red alert series, I liked those graphics, gameplay, explosions ftw, music, babes, everything about it.. Overall I thought this game was very good: its single player campaigns were beefy and interesting, and had reasonably good acting and story. Multiplayer was alright too, though I never got much into that--mostly stuck to campaign/skirmish. The music, graphics, physics, etc. were all good for its time, and gameplay-wise it introduced some cool features. Anyone who hasn't played this ought to spend the $10 to get it: it'll be well worth your time and money.. This is definitely by favorite game of the Tiberium series and might be my favorite C&C game of all time. I don't know much about balance and I wouldn't exactly call the game very tactical, but I can say I was so addicted to this game for a few months that I started seeing buzzer swarms everywhere. The single player campaigns are fun, the missions are varied, the story is surprisingly interesting. I think this is the only RTS game where I've given a crap about the story. Kane is just awesome. I played the skirmishes so much I played them in my sleep. My only complains were that it lacks a good sound track and most of the environments kinda look the same after a while, but the expansion fixes the environment part. If you like this game, I'd definitely recommend the expansion.. This game is to this day (03/09/12) one of my all time favorite strategy games on the Xbox and the PC. this games admittedly odd, yet interesting cut scenes convey the story like no other strategy game out there each mission feels like you're trying to accomplish something not just going for a skirmish although you mainly ARE going for the skirmish win it puts you in situations around them. like one mission you only have infantry to capture and hold 4 fully constructed bases with vehicles aircraft and turrets. it is extremely challenging at times like in the aforementioned scenario. the fast paced gameplay runs flawlessly on my admittedly poor PC. and one of the greatest parts of this game is the fact that you can watch as an upgraded army of Venoms slaughters literally thousands of enemy infantry in a few seconds (they are the weakest and best infantry killers in the game). the units are all balanced well and can be countered if you know what to build. the connection problems online are a problem however, not it doesn't happen that much anymore but there is always the risk of being given a message that says ""Your game has fallen out of sync with your opponents, Disconnecting"" and then the game shuts down contrary to what it says it doesn't mean that just you disconnect it means the server disconnects from you and it kicks everyone. aside from that i love this game and it's semi-expansion/full game/whatever: Kane's Wrath. I highly recommend this game to any and all strategy game fans.. Looks like this game had a pretty big budget just judged by the lot of television/ movie stars in the cutscenes. Its really awesome and i would just love to see that in more games. Anyways something that could be even better would be EA finally giving the budget to a decent team and stop letting the C&C franchise from going down the sewer with mediocre games.. Okay, so just as a reminder, I'm reviewing this game about 3.5 years after its release. Besides Starcraft 2, there haven't been many big players entering the 'real time strategy' genre lately, and Tiberium Wars holds up very well. Gameplay: C&C3:Tiberium Wars is very fast paced. If you're playing on easy you'll be wondering why some of the units are so much more powerful than the others, and think it unfair; but playing against a difficult computer or player you'll find that there is usually no time or money to get to the bigger units, for better or for worse. Visual: In my personal opinion, I think the art and unit designs are great. The factions look like they should (GDI: Very professional, military-like, NOD: Sci-fi'ish, SCRIN: Buglike alien). The engine though hasn't held up very well, though on some maps (with particular lighting) the game looks just as good as anything released today, but the majority of the maps showcase a game that is only decent looking by today's standards. Single/Multiplayer: The single player is great, with many missions for each faction and live action scenes between each mission. I haven't played online, but I have played LAN a few times, which was pretty fun but we did experience synch issues a few times, and the game just wasn't as fun on multiplayer as it's predecessor, C&C:Generals. Overall: It's a great game, and if you're a fan of the genre it's a great buy.. Possibly the fastest RTS game to date as well as having the most missions developed in a 3D RTS game ever. The story is great and so is the fast gameplay. Balance issues remain but some things should have been added into the game such as sky textures and the click and drag box with background shading.. This was the most fun with an RTS game since Emperor: Battle for Dune. It doesn't share Emperor's fantastic strategic opportunities offered by various units, but it offers tons of fun, and many ideas made me completly ignore the fact that the gameplay is rather repetitive. There are some nice, though minor introductions, which don't make it seem like a complete repetition. Also, both the gameplay and story line are at their best in this installment. If I were to compare it with Red Alert 3, I would san CnC3 got everything right that RA got wrong in terms of game design, graphics, unit design, as well as the way the missions are constructed. Lots of fun.. I enjoyed the game and even bought Kane's Wrath. It's very pretty. It is not the best C&C game, but it is the last good one in the series. RA3 and C&C4 were bad. :(. Still playing and loving it (with TiberiumEssence mod to bring back the original gore). A true 3D hommage to itself: the Command&Conquer RTS. Simply a must-have.","tiberium wars is one of those games for me that started playing as a little kid . it's not the best C&C game, but it is the last good one in the series . the AI is just ridiculous and nowhere near human-like playing style . i've tried playing against Medium difficulty level and it's consistently relentless ."
"1,131.Madden NFL 10","In my previous review, I bashed this installment. mentioning it was better than the Wii version, but not by much. I based that review purely on the Superstar mode, which I still believe isn't the best. But after playing franchise mode, I take back everything I said about the game. It really brings you back to the old Madden. (Old as in 2004-2008) It's very Nostalgic to long time players whom have played the newer Maddens.. This is a very fun, fast paced, action packed game, but not your typical shoot'em action. It is very fun, but there are little features from the previous maddens that bring this down a little like just giving your character stats instead of playing the game and seeing how good the PLAYER is. The superstar menu is boring just like a regular menu and doesn't have the little things like personas or pro-bowl ballots. The multiplayer doesn't work either because EA is to cheap to keep anything up for long. I bet they're preparing to shut down Battlefield Bad Company 2' s servers down right now, which is still a really good game.. Madden 10 is over all the best madden ever, but playing against the computer in madden mode is a complete joke!!!!!!! wide receivers can't catch the computer intercepts almost ever throw!!! it totally ridiculous. Great game. Definitely better than 09 and the earlier games. Movement is good, the overall flow of the game is good. There is some issues with the momentum and how you can go for a tackle facing the opposite direction and it will teleport your character to the ball carrier sometimes. Great game overall.. It's pretty standard. Not much different from all of the other games. The multiplayer is pretty bad because you will get disconnected from lobbies too much and it's not too enjoyable. I also don't like you can't play 2v2. The superstar mode is just horrible. My ego is always big headed and they will start you as a starter even if you're a rookie, which I suppose would be funner than not playing at all. It's just not really too realistic. It's an OK football game and probably the best for it's time, but not very good. It's a buy if you want a football game, but it's far from amazing.. The usual detractors will claim nothing has changed, but this is as close to a revolutionary shift in direction that Madden has received in nine years. And it works.. Way way to slow. Madden 10 I have to say is pretty sloppy on Xbox and Wii. The franchise mode is terrible and the gameplay is crappy, madden moments is pretty cool though.","madden 10 is over all the best madden ever, but playing against the computer in madden mode is a complete joke . the superstar menu is boring just like a regular menu and doesn't have the little things like personas or pro-bowl ballots . the multiplayer doesn't work either because EA is too cheap to keep anything up for long ."
"1,132.Astro Boy: Omega Factor","Typically of Treasure, Astro Boy is a very pretty looking game in the vein of Mega Man. Not a huge amount of depth but it's definitely one of the better run'n'gun games on the Advance.. For anyone familiar with Tezuka's works (anime or manga) this will be a fantastic game with a fun and challenging gameplay with great references to his legacy. I really enjoyed unexpectedly finding some of the most iconic Tezuka's characters in this game. Both the gameplay and the visuals were great for a Gameboy game. All this combined makes this a must-play experience for anyone with a Gameboy (or emulator), even if you're not familiar with Tezuka's works the story and visuals alone are enough to satisfy you. The game doesn't drag for very long so the gameplay doesn't become repetitive even if there aren't many different powers. Good replayability too since it offers an alternative ending.. One of the best GBA games the system has to offer. I was quite surprised I liked this game as much as I did. The beautiful spritework, the shockingly good story, the catchy music, the fun gameplay mechanics, its got all the components **** game pumping through its veins, making this an easy to recommend game to at least try out. Finishing the game however is a tougher to recommend ordeal. The game requires multiple playthroughs of the same exact levels and cutscenes sometimes, and like many Sega games, it isn't afraid to be downright cheap in later stages with bad enemy placements, ludicrous damage, all for the sake of padding out the game length. While metacritic considers a 7 a moderate score, I disagree with this. For me a 5 is an average not good but not bad game. A 6 is above average, with a 7 being even better than that. A 7 is a damn solid game for my review metric, and this game gets so much right with such a genuine sense of fun that I strongly recommend anyone to try this game. Sure it has plenty of flaws, but much like Sega's own Sonic series, these flaws are worth putting up with for the charm and fun this game has. Don't sleep on this one. As I said, its one of my favorite GBA games ever., and who knows? It could become one of your favorites too.. Fast paced combat and bright graphics are positive. The story feels kind disengaged but still a lot of fun . Astro Boy really need it to have this kind of gameplay.",a 7 is a damn solid game for my review metric . the game gets so much right with such a genuine sense of fun . the graphics and story are great for a Gameboy game .
"1,133.BlazBlue: Continuum Shift","All Blazblue games are amazing. I am baffled by Spazio Games critic review here. How is someone that knows nothing about games, a game reviewer? They mention time and again beat em up. Just a heads up to everyone, this is not a beat em up and if that's what you're expecting then you'll be disappointed. This is a 2D Fighter, not even slightly resembling a beat em up. Arc Sys with Blazblue make some of the finest too.. A decent fighter with some truly unique and funny characters. Great visuals, good sounds, REALLY cheezy voice acting, but I think it's just weird writing and not the voice actors. Fighting mechanic is solid and work very well. Story mode is also pretty fun, but could have used a bit more depth for some of the side characters. The BlazBlue universe seems well thought out and deep enough to compete against other, already established, franchises. Overall: A very good fighter that just barely falls short of greatness. Perhaps a bit more depth and some longer cut-scenes.. A nice new little paradigm shift in fighting games. I didn't know what to expect but I have to say that overall the graphics and controls together create an enjoyable, smooth experience, and characters and their moves are a little redundant but highly creative, partly embracing the old school and pushing the bill just a tad. Overall super cool game!!. Not a bad game! I played the first one with a slightly jaded mentality, but I went into this one with an open mind... and it turned out well! If you are tired of the way fighting games have been for several years, this is a refreshing twist. You will have to forget some of the stuff you learned from previous fighting games, as this game punished those who rely on cheap tactics.","this is a 2D fighter, not even slightly resembling a beat em up . great visuals, good sounds, REALLY cheezy voice acting . story mode is also pretty fun, but could have used a bit more depth ."
"1,134.Life is Strange","Life is Strange 1 Review: A Journey Through Time with Some Bumps Along the Way Life is Strange 1 is a beautifully crafted narrative-driven game that immerses players into the life of Max Caulfield, a teenager who discovers she can rewind time. With its engaging story, memorable characters, and a rich world filled with intricate details, the game stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in interactive media. While it does have some rough edges, especially in terms of visuals and final choices, the game's strengths shine through, making it a worthy experience for anyone who enjoys emotional, thought-provoking narratives. Positives: One of the standout features of Life is Strange is the incredible soundtrack. The music perfectly complements the emotional beats of the game, enhancing the atmosphere and making key moments even more impactful. Tracks from indie artists help set the tone for the game, making the music not just background noise but a central part of the experience. The game also excels in its use of Max's diary. The optional diary entries give players deeper insights into her thoughts and feelings, and it's a nice way to get into the headspace of the protagonist. It adds an extra layer of immersion and emotional connection, which is especially appreciated as the story unfolds. The writing is another key strength. The dialogue feels natural and reflective of the characters’ ages, with well-crafted conversations that capture the struggles, confusion, and joy of being a teenager. The writing also does a great job of portraying the little things in life—whether it’s Max's relationship with her friends or the small moments she shares with others. It’s these details that make the world of Life is Strange feel so real and lived-in. The game’s representation of a teen world is also commendable. From dealing with personal struggles to navigating complex friendships and relationships, Life is Strange does a great job of portraying the highs and lows of adolescence. It's a world that feels familiar to anyone who’s been a teenager, full of awkward moments and the weight of decisions that feel like they carry the world’s consequences .A real standout moment occurs in Episode 5, during the backward sequence and the nightmarish sequences that Max experiences. These sequences are a great way to play around with the time-rewind mechanic in new and emotionally-charged ways, making for one of the most intense and memorable sections of the game. Negatives: Unfortunately, the game isn't without its flaws. One of the most noticeable issues lies in the game's visuals. The textures often appear lower quality than expected, especially in comparison to more graphically advanced titles from the same era. While this doesn’t detract from the experience entirely, it can be a bit distracting at times, especially in a game that relies heavily on the emotional connection to its characters and world. Facial animation and sync are also lacking. While the voice acting is generally solid, the facial expressions often feel stiff and don’t always match the tone of the dialogue. This can lead to a dissonance between what the characters are saying and how they appear to feel, which can break immersion at times. Finally, the final choices and the game's ending feel a bit forced and lack the nuance that could’ve made them feel more impactful. The conclusion has its emotional moments, but the way the player is ultimately presented with a binary decision doesn’t do justice to the complexity of the earlier narrative choices. The sense of agency that the game builds up throughout feels a bit undercut in the final moments. Final Thoughts: Despite its technical shortcomings, Life is Strange 1 delivers an emotionally resonant experience with a strong narrative and memorable characters. The soundtrack, diary entries, and the attention to detail in the world-building make it a unique title that stands out among other narrative-focused games. While the visuals and final choices may leave something to be desired, the emotional depth of the story and the unforgettable moments more than make up for these flaws. Life is Strange is an experience worth having, especially for fans of story-driven games, and it’s a journey that will stick with you long after the credits roll.. this game quite literally changed me and my entire perspective on life. the relationship between the characters, the storyline, the soundtrack everything down to the smallest details was done with intention and care, an absolute masterpiece. every time I hear one of the songs from the soundtrack I get the urge to cry from how this game touched me SO deeply.. I didnt see it coming. While I didnt expect much from this game, it became better and better with every hour I played. The story is really well written.. A great start to the series. Max has been one of my favorite video game mains since I first played this game almost ten years ago.. Not that good. LIS is an okay game, the story is nice for the most part characters were okay some maybe good but its dissapointing. Now this game is fun but not really that good, it tells you constantly about choices and consequences but they dont matter too much no matter if you abuse time travel or not. The arguably better ending is the one where your choices literally dont matter. I know a bit of the point in these games like telltale ones, is that the desicions help you to get more inmmersed more than anything, but it wouldnt **** that much here if the ending actually showcased how the other desicions affected the rest. The whole point of the game is the story and while i will say that i consider it good, i wont say its among the best ever, personally chloe wasnt that memorable as a character, max is pretty good tho, almost everyone else is pretty much forgettable, the antagonist is good but there werent any real clues aside from 1 conversation and having an incredibly keen eye in some parts of the game. As for the rest, i liked quite a bit the artstyle, ost was good for the most and for the price it aint bad (on sale). Great Job they did, The ButterFly was nailed perfectly especially in the Ending,there are some flaws but the gameplay is so good to make me forgot aboutit. I was really shocked that this crap could get such a high mc rating, and it was a shame in the game industry to make a long-term series. It really made me wonder for the first time that Maybe I was the unsociable problem when I got such a compliment for this stereotyped game of illogical dialogue and boring options from start to finish. The plot is so awkward that I am all the time with my toes buttoned to the ground, has buttoned out do not know how many three rooms a hall. GamePlay doesn't exist at all, like Batman's parents, from start to finish, you just need to act like nothing happen, run into other people's rooms and rummage, talk to yourself, and then pretend to say to others, ""I didn't mean to snoop on your privacy"" and start asking question, what is the logic of cerebral palsy? Few of the conversation options are anything normal people can say, and I remember when I was 18 years old and didn't have such low emotional intelligence, what era did this crap live in? The most **** time was when I answered Kate's phone and Chloe got angry. What the **** does that make sense? I take a call and she just lose her **** temper? I just saved your **** life, you piece of ****, and I didn't hesitate to choose a small town because I couldn't empathize with such an inexplicable person. I gave a 1 point simply because the album was good and the game didn't deserve the soundtrack at all. 这种垃圾都能拿到这么高的mc评分是真的令我感到震惊，能做成一个长久的系列更是堪称游戏界的耻辱。就这种从头到尾充满刻板印象的毫无逻辑对话和无聊选项的游戏能得到如此褒奖真的让我第一次开始怀疑自己才是那个不合群的问题少年。游戏剧情尴尬到我无时不刻都在用脚趾扣地，已经扣出不知道多少个三室一厅。游戏性和蝙蝠侠的爸妈一样根本不存在，从头到尾你要做的就装作没事人一样的跑到别人房间翻箱倒柜后自言自语，然后再假惺惺对别人说“我不是有意窥探你的隐私”后开始发问，这是什么脑瘫逻辑？对话选项几乎就没有一个是正常人能说出来的话，我印象当我的 18 岁没有这么低的情商，这群废物究竟是生活在哪个时代？印象最深刻的一次就是我接了kate的电话然后Chloe生气了，这他妈是什么道理？我接个电话就他妈发脾气？我操你妈的我刚救你的狗命你这个废物，结局我毫不犹豫选择了小镇，因为我根本无法共情这样一个莫名其妙的人。我给 1 分单纯是因为这张专辑还不错，这游戏根本配不上配乐。. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun to play-through, but quite a quick play. Graphics for playing it now just don't hold up. Overall, good story, decent dialogue and characters, and an overall too short experience for what they could have accomplished.. perfect game, perfect story and max is the best........................................... This game is a life experience, you start to see the world with different eyes after playing this masterpiece. Magnificent story, very well constructed characters, fantastic art style, and wonderful soundtrack. Play as soon as possible, you won't regret it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game and its ost literally saved my life a. This is the game that actually deserves a 10/10. Hannah Tell and Ashly Burch voiced acted 2 of the greatest characters to me and DontNod made a masterpiece of storytelling, intriguing plots, and a great soundtrack. Writing is the most important part **** like this where gameplay is not really there and the writting in this game is def 10/10. A very good game, good story with choices. Remaster is cool, best color, best resolution. A very brutal and harsh reality of growing up. No matter how painful it is, somethings must be let go. Whether you saved Chloe or Arcadia Bay, it is painful to let go but sometimes it just must be done… Man the characters in this game are so good. The dynamics between every character, especially between Chloe and Max, is so masterfully written and beautiful. The arcs and development of every character in the game too… Just so well written. Some problems I have are with the dialogue. Sometimes it felt so unrealistic and corny… Other than that though, just super fantastic.. This game will always be one of my favorite games of all time. The relationships and real world issues the game tackles was masterfully done. Max and Chloe's relationship was so well done and the more you play into the story the more you realize why this character is the way she is. There's so many plots happening in this game going on at the same time but it's all written so well its like a TV show within a game your playing. The twist also gives you replay value cause you'll look back in episode 1 and see the clues were hidden in plain sight almost like the 6th Sense. I'm writing this review after Life is Strange Double Exposure released and I really gotta say these two games are so different. I know 2 different studios made these 2 games respectively but I think the difference in quality is pretty jarring.. The best game im my life. The history is so interesting, the gamplay is simple, but. The game as a whole is the best in the entire history of games, and is in my top 3 best games ever. A good story about acceptance, funny puzzles, and the best game in life is the Life is Strange series.. Masterpiece. Sadly I won't ever be able to play this game for the first time again. Seriously one of the best narratives in gaming ever.. This game has jaw dropping moments, there was never a moment in the story where I lost focus. definitely one of the best interactive games ive played under Detroit become human. My favorite game of all time, everything in this game is crazy like the story, the character development etc.. You have to play this game!!!. Best story ı have ever seen in my whole life it has beautiful soundtrack amazing characters and antagonist it's one of those games you wish you could forget and play again but it may be boring sometimes and decisions that you make doesnt really have concequences but its still great game. I was not expecting this game to be my type of game but I really enjoyed it from the story to the gameplay and how it impacts you later on in the game! Would highly recommend it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible story and overall tone of game is nailed to a tee. Definitely recommend.. This game could have been fantastic. Don't get me wrong, there are good aspects to the game and lots of cool moments, but what were they doing with the dialogue and characters? Everyone in this game is either a living trope or speaks like a 50-year-old dad impersonating a teenager. This isn't how people talk. Choices have zero impact on the story OR CHARECTERS, which could be excusable if it was just the story, but the characters too? And all that backed by mediocre writing. Chloe is insufferable, and Warren is obnoxious. Now onto the good: The art style is gorgeous, there are cool psychological horror moments, and the whole bunker stuff is good and some of the puzzles are fun. Most the good for this game imo comes from the art and visuals. Everything else is rough That's it, really. If the characters were likable and the dialogue sounded human, it could have been great, but nope instead it's fine.. It really is incredible, worth your time for those who like innovative gameplay and an engaging story in every chapter, its stylized graphics and characters make everything more incredible.. Words can't express how much I love this game. This game completely changed my life and I don't think I'll ever get over the emotions I felt for this game. It's such a beautiful story. Thanks, Don't Nod!! NO EMOJI. It is my first interactive game. The story is fun, but you decisions do not change much here. I would say they change nothing.. This game is perfect I love it. Max is perfect with Chloe,but in my story i prefer to sacrifice Chloe. anyoay i wating for life is strange Double exposure. This game was a journey - I went from thinking it was okay, to not liking it, then to liking it a lot, and finally to thinking it was absolutely incredible. It starts with a clever premise - rewinding time is a unique way to mix up the choose your own adventure formula that makes it decidedly more video-gamey. But the mechanic itself was a bit clunky and way too slow, and I found some of the earlier writing to be ham-fisted and unable to fully capture how a power like this would actually look and feel. I also couldn't get over how unbelievably stupid everyone is - I was literally yelling at my TV like I was watching one of those B horror films where nobody's capable of making any smart decisions. But I came to realize that like those horror films, a bunch of bumbling characters can actually heighten the experience, and also they're literal children so of course they make some dumb choices .It starts out slow but things eventually do get a lot more interesting, and then it doesn't let up until a finale that stuck the landing more beautifully than almost any game I've ever played. If you're a fan of branching narratives and you like the idea **** that allows you to tweak your decisions over and over again, Life is Strange definitely belongs on your short list.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever. will change ur life buy it now please please pleasse please pleae. A fascinating story about second chances and living between fantasy and reality, it provides an emotional story and excellent characters that makes this game an all-around pleasant experience that is definitely worth playing.. What a beautiful game, the story is very well written and emotional, and the characters are so likeable and we can relate to them in many ways. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite its obvious flaws the reactive story and compelling characters make this one of the best storytelling experiences of the current generation.. Good game but feels VERY dated. I know it's old but it does not hold up well. The plot also feels like it's trying to be really heavy and adult but also doesn't want to be TOO adult. It's stuck in a weird in-between. I think you'll like it if you like true-crime stuff but if not I can't really guarantee whether you'll like it or not.. One of the best stories you will ever witness in video gaming history! It also aged incredibly well.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Life is Strange a narrative masterpiece that doesn't just tell a story but crafts an emotional symphony. This game is like a heartfelt acoustic ballad that takes you on a nostalgic trip and leaves you reflecting on the beautiful mess that is life. Graphically, ""Life is Strange"" embraces a distinctive, indie-inspired aesthetic. The soft colors and painterly style create an atmosphere that's not just visually pleasing but also emotionally evocative. It's like the album cover of a favorite record that you pull out when you need a dose of comfort. Gameplay-wise, ""Life is Strange"" shines with its decision-making mechanic. The narrative branches are a poetic dance of choices that, even if seemingly inconsequential at times, contribute to the overarching melody of the story. It's like a series of heartfelt lyrics that resonate with your own life experiences, making you feel like an active participant in the storytelling. Now, let's talk tunes. The carefully curated indie-folk soundtrack is like a companion album that perfectly complements the emotional beats of the game. Each song is a nostalgic note that carries you back to a time and place, and it's the kind of soundtrack you find yourself humming long after the game is over. And the narrative – oh, it's a heartfelt coming-of-age story with a supernatural twist, and it doesn't shy away from themes of friendship, identity, and consequence. The dialogue, even if occasionally bordering on cliché, is like the lyrics of a song that speaks directly to your heart. It's the kind of storytelling that lingers, making you reflect on your own journey. The time-rewind mechanic, innovative and emotionally charged, allows you to explore different paths and adds layers to the narrative. It's like a unique instrument in a band, contributing to the richness of the overall composition. In conclusion, Life is Strange is more than a game; it's an emotional experience. The unique aesthetic, powerful storytelling, and soulful soundtrack make it a standout in the narrative-driven genre. While it may have its moments of corniness, the emotional impact and the nostalgia it evokes elevated it. I like the game but dialogues weren't that good even the characters it's only chloe max and the teacher were good they even meesed up with frank bowers's character , sad ending and great soundtracks of course.. A seriously insane story. Every twist and turn keeps you on the edge of your seat and the art style is so good. The characters have a lot of depth and are super lovable. One of those games I always think about.. The story is too juvenile to keep me interested in the game mechanics, which are quite interesting, and I quickly became bored. I felt like I was being forced to watch a teenage drama.. It's a bit odd that it took me this long to actually beat it, but due to save files being misplaced, I just didn't want to go through the final episode without it, but eh screw it, trying to beat a certain amount of games. Anyway, I killed Chloe, and I'm glad I did. The story makes a lot of sense this way, and it really makes for a growing moment for Max than it ever will for Chloe. Chloe admiting she is a terrible person is just the cherry on top. I actually do care about the MC, Max a lot, and she really grows into a good person throughout the games, and it's perhaps the biggest reason I liked this series. Although Chloe has ""first gay crush"" written on her way to much that Max can't see the red flags, I will admit she is easily one of the best written characters in gaming. Overall good coming of age story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved the story of this game, the very exciting ending and the mechanics of time manipulation. I love this series. Hopefully there will be more like this in future.. Its a sad but also sweet game. it's very enjoyable, the only problem i see is that no matter what decisions you've made, it doesn't matter, because the only decision that would change the game's ending is the last one. Really enjoyed the story and puzzle solving got the game free on psn wouldn't normally my favourite type of games but really glad I played amazing work by the team and cast.. One of my favourites, Max and Chloe are one of the best duos in videogames. Story quickly **** you in and is very rich on narration. Gameplay is simple and fun, with decent replay value and easy platinum trophy. Graphics are nice, maybe it could be a bit better but this game is cross-gen with PS3, so it's understandable. Soundtrack is pure gold. Overall, really great game.. I love it when a game can take characters and make them feel like humans. Relatable, emotional and talk like theyre alive.. Must be played!!! One of the best experience in it's kind. Strongly recomended.... masterpiece, this game is PERFECT and negative reviews are from people who dont like this type of game or dont understand nothing. Favorite game of all time including favorite soundtrack of all time. Period.. okok kind of game and visuals but something is lacking thats why i dont want to play this agian. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rating: 100 (Masterpiece) Full Game Review: Life Is Strange is a incredible game. The gameplay is very great being able to rewind time and getting to choose your own choices which is what I like about the game. The characters are very well written especially characters like Max who is a great protagonist. The story is very well written and very engaging. Overall Life is Strange is a very enjoyable game.. This game is powerful. For some reason, even though that's my second playthrough, I can stop being emotionally damaged by this game. Actually, knowing some stuff about certain characters made some minor decisions harder. The difference they made objectively was not high, but your perception around it is what really matters. Making someone laugh, feel motivated, or pissed. You feel all of this with them, and I love this. That's only possible because of how sensitive the creators were and how amazingly developed and relatable the characters truly are. Talking about sensitivity... hands down. That is one of the best soundtracks ever selected. OST included. I could listen to the main theme for hours. This game would not be that good without those tracks. But it is perfect? no. But that was the dev's fault? Also no. The graphics and other technical elements could be better. Facial expressions feel off sometimes and clearly characters could not express themselves the way they should. Obviously, that's a financial problem, so it's understandable. And, at least, the actors nail it. Amazing performances. If you still haven't played this masterpiece, what are you waiting for?. This is an excellent story-driven game I like that it lets the viewer test which decision he is comfortable with thru the character's powers, also the added mystery of the game plot makes it a great game to sit back and enjoy as the story unfolds.. Best game I've ever played, the story is simply amazing, but the ending is not so good. One of the best storytelling game and an absoulute must play! Without any special gameplay mechanic absoulute great. I fully recommend you must playing this amazing game . Story is amazing and i love soundtrack in this game. Played the game recently on PS5. This was one of tremendous game I’ve ever played !! I totally didn’t expect this much of fun and emotions can be include in single game, amazing game and all I can say everyone to try once this masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Interesting game, really enjoyed sometimes tough choices. Would be 10/10 if a bit more difficult because it's more like interactive movie than a game.. It was a pretty compelling story. Sure it's just a teen drama with a little bit of sci-fi (?) mixed in, but it does it well. The gameplay is your regular choose your path game, so nothing special there. The characters are what makes or break a game like this. Chloe is a **** but I can understand why. Good game. Another platinum trophy that was fun to get. Easy, but fun.. The first LiF was quite a surprise when it came out. I played it through several times and even though I know the whole story I can't get bored of it. I love it until this day.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is so emotional, and everything you make can change the future! This idea is so brilliant! The game is awesome, love it!. Just wow! Not a lot of words after playing it! Emotional, it is the least i can say. Being recent in Psychology studies, i can see this game as an incredible tool to help surpass feelings of loss and help understand certain ""injustices"" of life. Games do teach us a lot!. damn ... such a perfect game. It was unique. One of the games that completely engages my mind for 1 month and will be remembered forever.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (8) Very Good. Innovative, but perhaps not the right choice for everyone. This score indicates that there are many good things to be had, but arguably so. An interactive teen drama story that touches time travel, mental illness, high school, suicide, online bullying and storms. If you care about gameplay stay away but if you like story games, give it a try. Has a good soundtrack and good characters.. this was an experience it has evryting you need in a story game play it if you want to cry ;). Loving this fantastic videogame. Best soundtrack in a videogame. Sadly it's the last good one. Amazing! Everyone must play this game. Emotional, fun to play, mystery... just everything.. My rate for this game is a well deserved 8. First of all this is not a game for everyone. So if you are more into action and shooting games you probably should skip this game but those who enjoy relaxing games or prefer to focus on the plot you should buy it. The closest games that remind me this kind of game would be Beyond or Detroit. Of course, Life is strange has worse graphics and less different things to do but I can easily say that these are the closest games. My main complaint of this game is that voices are not syncrhonized with the lips (and it's a pity because the acting voices are really good). The last episode is a bit over the top but it's still holding fine. And the last thing is that at the end of this game you can choose between two options. I chose the one that in my opinion is the more logical but I think they should have given you the choise to do another thing. Also, I was curious about the other ending and of course I watched it and I still thing it's too positive and optimistic regarding the events that you see (should have been more dramatic. Doesn't feel fair nor balance compared to the other one). Because I didn't want to spoil anything I don't know if you people will be able to get what I mean. It probably took me arount 15 hours or even more because I tried to serach everything. My only advice would be that in the second episode when they tell you that you can't use your powers pause the game and search on the internet what you must say cause trust me, you will fail if you don't do that. Of course you can start over that part of this second episode but I still think it's better to do it as I said.. I like to play Life is strange. The graphics are beautiful and have a well designed. The sound is awesome. The levels are interesting and easy to play, and the connectivity is immersive and realistic.. Great game and awesome story. What I love most about the life is strange series is the stories always have unpredictability. It's not always what you expect. The 1st game is probably my favourite out of all of them. But they are all great games and I enjoyed them all.. Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Graphics: 6/10 Enjoyability: 9/10 Overall: 9/10. Most overrated game I know. The college setting didn't appeal to me at all and the characters couldn't compensate for that either. We have the boring, shy and nerdy Max, the naive yet super annoying rebellious Chloe, and... oh, just complete the list with whatever clichéd students you can think of. I found the story completely predictable and at the same time not very believable. Gameplay is pretty much non-existent, just running around listening to monologues about coffee machines and cameras. If the information about it was at least interesting or funny ... but no. The only thing I can praise the game for: Decisions actually have noticeable consequences. However, that goes nowhere if they leave me absolutely cold emotionally because I can't stand the characters and I don't care about them.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Life is Strange is a powerful and emotional game that covers many important topics. These topics range from everyday struggles in modern day youth, to worst case scenarios and complete nightmares. As a young girl who is interested in photography, this game made me feel seen, heard and understood. As well, I was able to relate to the game’s themes of LGBTQ+ people, depression, suicide and the importance of friendship. Not to mention, Life is Strange helped me understand issues that I didn’t previously know a lot about, such as environmental issues, loss, family problems, sexual harassment, and so on. As for the game itself, Life is Strange contains beautiful background animations, as well as a rather realistic character animation style. As well, there is a beautiful and sad soundtrack that goes along with the storyline well. The main character – a photography student named Max Caulfield – is quiet, shy and caring. She reminded me a lot of myself and my personality throughout most of my high school experience. If you haven’t played Life is Strange, I will sum it up for you: Max Caulfield is a photography student, studying at Blackwell Academy in Arcadia Bay. She leaves photography class one day and walks into the school bathroom, just in time for her to see her childhood best friend Chloe get shot by another student. Desperately trying to save Chloe’s life, Max suddenly gains a super power that allows her to rewind time. This power is used throughout the game to make important choices, which strongly impact the game’s outcome. Every action has consequences – some much larger than others. The more Max uses her powers, the more things begin to go wrong in Arcadia Bay; there are environmental changes, a solar eclipse and – depending on the player’s choices – a possible deadly hurricane. In the end, Max has to make the ultimate decision: does she save her best friend, or Arcadia Bay? Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have an experience rather than just playing a game, or anyone who needs a good cry.. I liked the soundtrack, some characters (Max, Chloe, Jefferson) and of course the final chapter. There were some game-breaking bugs, inconsistent voice actors and visual glitches in cutscenes. Not a fan of the edgy characters or the unrealistic melodrama. Overall it's a good game if maybe a little over-hyped.. story was ok and i liked it when i played it, but now i realize it was not as good as i expected it to be. chloe was a great chara","life is Strange 1 is a beautifully crafted narrative-driven game that immerses players into the life of Max Caulfield, a teenager who discovers she can rewind time . the game's strengths shine through, making it a worthy experience for anyone who enjoys emotional, thought-provoking narratives ."
"1,135.Bit.Trip Presents...Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien","There are very few games I’d recommend to anyone regardless of gaming experience or preference, but Runner 2 is one of them. It’s a fantastic reminder that sometimes games are most effective when they don’t try to emulate explosion-riddled Hollywood blockbusters and instead embrace solid gameplay mechanics and unfettered creativity.. Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a mix between a platform and a rhythm’n game. It looks sharp, it plays smooth and the music is the ‘Trip’ in the title. Try it for something simply funny.. Bit.Trip Runner2 is a perfect game. The controls are perfect (I'm playing with a 360 controller). The visuals are perfect. The music is perfect. The gameplay is perfect. You can always have differing opinions when it comes to personal taste, and so I'm sure Runner2 is not everybody's cup of tea. But from a purely objective standpoint it's clear that Gaijin Games put out a really exceptional product here. There's plenty to keep both casual gamers and achievement hunters coming back for more. Highly recommended!. I'm a huge fan of the BIT.TRIP series, BIT.TRIP RUNNER in particular. When I saw this for pre-order, I new straight away I had to get it. So I did. I've played through the entire game and still aiming to 100% the game. Unbelievable fun and re-playability with solid mechanics and 2.5D graphics with this game, an easy 10/10.. Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a beautiful platform ""on rails"" driven by the rhythm of music, just like its predecessor Bit.Trip.Runner. Gaijin Games was clearly extremely inspired when began working on the title, and the result is a product full of content, challenging and, most importantly, extremely fun. Highly recommended.. Travelling along a plane at a constant pace has never been so much fun – Runner2 is an addictive and rewarding experience.. Quotation forthcoming.. There’s just a ton of content here.. Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien feels like the natural evolution of the original Bit.Trip Runner. The heart of the game is still the same, but it comes with a prettier look and expanded gameplay. While I felt like some of the expansion was unnecessary, it’s still a very fun and challenging experience. For new players, it’s more accessible than the original, and for returning vets it’s more of what made the original so unique.. Game is very fun, i played bit.trip.runner1 and i think that runner 2 is a real improvement! The graphics are improved and jumping is improving and it also supports Xbox 360 remote!. Runner 2 is definitely a casual game, intended mainly just to pass time, and it does that well enough. Much better than its predecessor, the music and graphics are fun to experience. The game itself is challanging and yet lite and lets you progress without wanting to kill yourself, in a way some video games of this genres sometimes do. I can easily see many people get bored or annoyed by this game, as it can get repetitive and is quite long for such simple gameplay. That's why I think this game is good for killing like 2-5-10-20 dead minutes of the day or something like that. Personally I've been playing this game for quite a long time but only once or twice in a weekend, or something like that, and that lets me really enjoy the game and keeps me from getting sick of it. The bottom line - but when on sale, use only when you really wish to kill some time.. Awesome and fun game concept ruined by the incredibly cheesy and testosterone depleting art style and music. If they remade the game with intense, quality electronica and less Bronyism it could easily be a 10/10.. This game is literally just quick-time events. I don't understand the appeal in it, at all. I can safely say that it's better than Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Runner 1 though, but that's not much of an achievement. The fact that games like Dishonored and Stalker have a lower score than this sickens me.","Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a mix between a platform and a rhythm’n game . it looks sharp, it plays smooth and the music is the ‘Trip’ in the title .

"1,136.Hotline Miami","Deeper thank you thing. There isn`t only ultra violence . Style, gameplay and it is only when you run this game. Obviously they added more features in the sequel, yet I love the original more because it mostly focuses on gameplay, it is not trying to explain everything, keeping the mystery factor. In top-down shooters, gameplay is even more important because it is not usual.. This game is great for several reasons, particularly its stellar soundtrack, which I consider S-tier. I play it all the time, and it was honestly the main reason I got into the game in the first place. The gameplay is another highlight—addictive, fast-paced, and delightfully frantic. Although you die in one hit (unless you take someone hostage), the quick respawn system keeps it from being frustrating. The story is also worth mentioning, as it delves into our relationship with violence, a thought-provoking and forward-thinking concept for its time. Additionally, the graphics are timeless; even though the game was released in 2012, its pixel-art style has aged beautifully and still looks fantastic today. However, the game is not without its flaws. Every moment that isn’t focused on the core second-to-second gameplay feels like a chore. For example, the boss fights are more like glorified puzzles than actual fights. They lack engaging decision-making, and once you figure out their patterns, they become mere roadblocks rather than exciting challenges. This feels like a missed opportunity, especially given how excellent the base gameplay is. Another issue is the size of some levels, particularly toward the end of the game. Their sprawling design often results in getting shot by enemies you didn’t even know existed, which can feel cheap and frustrating. On top of that, restarting a level forces you to sit through repeated dialogue, making the frequent deaths more annoying than they need to be. Despite its shortcomings, this game is a unique experience I wholeheartedly recommend. Its highs outweigh its lows, and there’s truly nothing else like it on the market. Even the sequel couldn’t replicate the magic that this game captured.. Exceptional. It's quick, raw, and brutal; yet methodical, clean, and vibrant. Outstanding in every way, and it’s one of my personal favorites.. Hotline Miami's a game focusing centrally on the concept of violence, both in games and in real life. This is delivered in a neon 80s package with some good tunes and a tasteful bit of gore, if by tasteful you mean a full 5 course meal. The gameplay is the big selling point of the game. Hotline Miami is a weird mix of a top down shooter, stealth, strategy and (vaguely) puzzle game. Dying in game is less of a failure and more of just a necessary part of winning. The game encourages trying over and over until you find a perfect route or perfect mask that allows you to proceed to the next stage. The gameplay loop is scout out, die, scout out further, die, kill the guy who killed you the first 2 times, scout out, die, kill the guy and his mate your now aware of, clear stage, onto the next. It's a repetitive loop, sure, and definitely gets frustrating on later levels, but it is pretty fun regardless. The unfairness is definitely intentional. Being shot at from beyond the screen is simply a lesson to be careful in open sightlines. Learning the enemy A.I, knowing when to shoot a gun or throw it for a silent takedown, clearing a room now or leaving it for later, it all serves to gamify violence down to a science - perfectly encapsulating the games main theme. I won't spoil the story for Hotline Miami, but surreal doesn't begin to cut it. It's the kind of story that leaves you thinking ""Wait what? That's it?"", then ""Really, that's all it was?"" when you complete the epilogue, and then a resounding ""Ohhh..."" once your watch a youtube long form video about it or a 13 year old reddit post. Ironically, having this messy, left-in-the-dark story telling serves the narrative too. Does it matter why you're doing it? It's fun right? Why stop and think now? In the story centred missions, I found myself wondering when I would go back to the action - unknowingly playing right into the games hands. The main things that hold me back from scoring this game higher are repetitive/luck based gameplay and the general buggy-ness. In the end, the best strategy was to hide around corners and shoot with the mask that silences your weapon. And though the enemy A.I is not meant to be the most sophisticated, the way that they interact with doors (especially the dogs) has gotten me unfairly killed many times. Plus, the story, though good on later ponderings, isn't super enthralling by itself and takes supplementary material to be fully appreciated. If your considering playing this game, ask yourself this first. Do you like to hurt people? Including yourself? If the answers yes, then go play it.. Great game, nice plot twists and good story.I would love to have a third game on this series but not going to happen soon enough Im guessing.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very challenging game, but not once did I ever get mad. Every time I died (which was a lot of times) I never felt like it wasn't my fault. It only urged me to improve, or to try new approaches. Highly reccomend to anyone who loves a difficult game.. Amazing gameplay, fantastic synth-wave atmosphere and music with a gripping story. If you want a fast and stunning experience at the same time, this game is a MUST for you. Very fun.. the game isn’t perfect i will say that but this game has changed me one of the most big indie games and its changed me as a person the themes it gives in the end the meta the walk back everytime you kill every time you see the go to car it gives you an eerie feel buts that what’s i love the story is pretty lack luster but going back after the sequel you see everything this game was going to give and it was just always going to end the same way. like the game says the AI is Predictible, when you die you respawn at the area you`ve entered, the requirements are low and takes like 700 MBs, it`s great that you can play with Controller, the sountrack is Awesome, i Wished the game was longer because you can complete the game like 3 Hours if you're good enought, i highly recommend you buy the game on Discount. yes, this is now in critical acclaim, due to retro vibe that can change into heart for person's legacy.. The idea is nice and of course its only a low budget indie game. But the controlling is a bit bad. I expected the music to be great, but it is just ok. The gameplay is heavily focused on skill, there is almost no strategic decision to be made. Graphics **** budget. **** there.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its hard to innovate an entire new genre but Hotline Miami does just that. It's unique top down gorefest was a blast when it first came out and all these years later it is still unrivaled.. Nice but ai of the enemies are not that great. Also the songs of this game are bangers. For me its one of the best indie gamea ever.. the most worst game i played in all time everything is bad and its full of glitches and bugs. Absolutely stunning gameplay. The top down perspective and art style look stunning. The action is great. The puzzle solving to take out every last enemy without getting hit feels miraculous. Must play for a reason.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 9/10; Atmosphere:10/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: 9/10. There is a plot here, but it is secondary. First of all, it's just an adrenaline-fueled meat grinder of the Russian mafia under a super cool, driving, 10 out of 10 ost. Purely Ukrainian entertainment.. Blends gameplay, story and player in a genius way. Incredible music and gameplay. 9.5/10. Hotline Miami is a violent game with a very simple gameplay. Add to that some catchy music and a well thought out map design and you have a fun game.. Yes, I love hurting other people. Hello to the losers of this game who are jealous of a masterpiece like Baldur's Gate 3. On the release day of Hotline Miami, we will give this trash game a 1-day temporary game of the year award.. Yes, i like hunting other people. Thank you for asking one hundred times.... Cool game with awesome vibe. Best part of the game, is music. Interesting/tricky plot. Game mechanics isn't best, some control are bugged. But it's a vibe-game..

"1,137.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge","Shredder's Revenge captures the spirit and gameplay of the much loved arcade side scrollers, but with no attempt to update or innovate it relies a little too much on nostalgia.. This gameis out here acting like the competition for good 2D brawlers is massive. This game is exactly what a modern 2D brawler should look like. No dumb story, no over the top difficult to get into moveset, and not too hard. It's casual friendly, yet has a good element of skill and mastery to it. The spritework is also top notch. Everything from the animations and little details like reviving someone with pizza in multiplayer was though over and created with love for not only the game type, but the TMNT franchise in general.. Great game. Fantastic gameplay and lots of characters and nostalgia. A perfect balance between retro and modern games. A bit short and easy though.. It really doesn’t get much better than this. I feel like it is 1992 all over again. Great game, tight controls, original voices, Easter eggs… it has it all. I only have two real complaints: 1) Shredder’s voice is terrible and 2) Since most of us who grew up with the SNES are now old, hurting and have arthritis starting, a tubo option for the buttons would have been great.. A modern retro beat 'em up that pays tribute to the arcade games. It can be played solo or with up to five other partners online. The Turtles, April 'O Neil and Splinter all have their distinct fighting styles and special moves. You can play through the levels in either Arcade or Story mode. The latter features a ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" -style map, mini-challenges and hidden collectibles. Once you beat the game, you'll unlock Casey Jones. Overall, this is a fun action game. I would rate it with an 8.7 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The gameplay is a 1:1 copy of Turtles in Time but not as good. So, if you like to play a worse version of a classic with slightly modernized grafics, this might be for you. Annoying is the download that is forced onto you before you can play, to add advertisement for DLC into the game. The love to detail that many of the professional reviewers see in this game escapes my eyes. Retro style can be nice, but this looks more like done with mario paint on a week-end project. They have not even hired professional voice actors. I would much rather have my 30 € back then this game on my shelf. It can be fun in couch coop, and that is maybe the best reason to buy it. I cerrainly feel betraied by the many positive reviews.. Even if I did not have nostalgia glasses on for this video game, I still think that it is a competent beat 'em up to have in any fan's collection. If someone is also a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, then that is just a bonus!. Great nostalgia brought back to playstation. I wish they do more of these games. But I have a slight complaint with the combat. Leo had much better combat than in this version. I'm getting a good of this too but old combat is also a part of nostalgia.. Best beat and up today, the best ninja turtles game of the last decades too. Gameplay, graphics, art direction and replay factor = 10. So far nine playable characters, story mode and arcade mode with Coop for up to six players. Ultimate turtles. I hope the game has more DLCs.. For TMNT fans it is mush have game. We were playing with 3 players via online coop and it was a very very good beat 'm up game with the classic characters. But the story was too short.. Nostalgia and the animations are good but the gameplay feels lacking and doesn't feels sluggish. Sometimes your character attacks the wrong direction and for needing precision on things you get warped around the screen based on how you're attacking. It was a pain trying to line my character up with flying stuff. Trying to beat shredder without getting hit has made me hate this game. It doesn't feel, skill based, but it feels highly luck based. The overworld map numbering and layout annoys me, and the game feels lacking substance after one playthrough. The super shredder fight itself is like 3/10.. Perfect. This team knows what they doing. Hope we see more old school stuff from them.. you wont regret buying this, beat'em up that gets you back to best years ever and those are 80's :). Well… This is my 2nd time playing beat-em-up after Streets of Rage 4 (which I loved). Probably now that I’m used to the Beat-em-up formula which felt so fresh when I 1st played SOR4 recently, I guess TNMT:SR wasn’t as fun. Nothing to do with TNMT: Shredder’s Revenge ofcourse, if I played this 1st instead of SOR4 probably I would’ve love TNMT:SR too! However, I don’t like repetition and this is more of the same. Probably best to stay away from Beat-em-ups me thinks!. best game ever this is the best game ever and ever.i dont know what to say , this is is a masterpiece oh god yeah. Turtles In Time on SNES was the bomb back in the day. This retro fueled beat em up scroller keeps the controlls, moves and fx to the most faithfull preservance i have seen in a recreation. I was being dropped straight into the boys room back in the early 90´s again. What a blast... Loving this game and worth the wait. It just nails the whole look and vibe of the Konami coin-ops and raises the bar in every respect. For any belt action fan this is essential and if you like party games it's also a total blast.. It must be experienced ,very enjoyable and fun . And has a nostalgic feel.. DEVs, PLEASE fix these issues. The game is great, too bad is completely broken: - Online play is completely broken. It's impossibie to finish a game from the start, it's guaranteed to bug on the start of some stage. Characters do not appear and neither the health bars. Only way to fix is exiting the game. - The Taunt + Special power ""unlimited exploit"" broke the offline game. It makes the game awfully easy and also really, really annoying online because players taunt everytime hindering the game, annoying due to sound effects and ending the ""beat´em up"" part - it's just a special move spamming session online. Make it limited or whatever possible to fix this. - Please give us a way to remove idle players. They ""hold"" the screen and the game gets unplayable. Disconnect them after a while idle, give us a move where we can toss them, I dont know. When it's not the bugs ruining the game, it's the idle players. - The pizza on the 5th stage needs a shadow or an indicator, it's impossible to know where it is. Or make it fly WITH the screen so we can get it. - A minor thing: Please make the ""hot to play"" screen disabling possible on options. Yes it's skippable, but it's annoying. The game is good, but broken right now. Please work on it.. They nailed the nostalgic aesthetic with this game in the visuals and music. Something about the gameplay still feels off even though there's similar moves. Being able to spam the charge up for the super attack was a strange inclusion. I feel like an inclusion of a block move and being able to time a block or counter would have added more of a strategic/tactical gameplay element to this game which is what it really needs. The gameplay is just way too simply for modern gaming tastes. The nostalgia wears off fast and the levels get repetitive and then I couldn't wait till the game was over with.. This game does what you expect of it well, good fun easy spammable controls, hordes of enemies, and great co-op functionality. It doesn’t have to make sense or look flashy if it’s fun to play with mates. That said, it is quite a short game and for $30 it’s a bit too short and some of the levels do seem too easy. Still fun tho and hopefully this ushers in a new era of actually well made classic style beat ‘em ups.. I saw the excitement and reviews about this game and was so into the idea. Trailers and gameplay looked great, but I kinda feel lied to. Talk about nostalgia entirely carrying the weight. That isn't to say this game is bad, it's okay, but seriously this is the kind of game that would have been released on the Xbox 360 Live Arcade for $15. Wait... oh, that actually kinda did happen. People were hyping this way too much. They kept saying ""oh there's so many challenges and collectibles and leveling up your character"" but none of those add up to anything. You get points going through the game which unlocks more health or moves but it doesn't add anything to the game really. Leveling up doesn't do much. The challenges are just things like don't get hit or don't fall in a pit. There are no secrets really and Casey Jones was already shown as an unlockable character so... online play is the only thing left after you beat this. You'll finish this game in a couple hours. The replayability is minimal. How do I write a review here, there's so little? You'll get into it, see the throwback stuff, see some jokes and cheesy lines, you'll be hooked to keep playing because level 1 feels so classic. You see the stuff from the cartoon, pokes at old jokes and classic 90s kids things. Then you'll start getting annoyed by the gameplay a few levels in. You aren't pumping in quarters but some of the enemies and bosses are crafted to cough up quarters. The music in some levels just doesn't match the game. Some of the music is great but like TMNT 2 it feels like a desperate cash-in that ignores what made it so good in the first place. It just feels off. The game is made for multiplayer but I didn't find any type of play to be all that fun. First time through I got all but 2 of the collectibles and most of the challenges. I started with Donny, balanced and simple but a weird style to play with less reach than expected. After finish I played through a level with each character and had no interest in playing again. Raphael is by far the worst to play with. Casey Jones plays like a wrestler and is too much of a ""one joke"" character. Leo, Mikey, Splinter, and April are the typical beat-em-up characters. The voice overs are... well. I'm not sure if it's just that these guys are all older or if they were recording these with cell phones on an airplane. They sound wrong and distorted. None of them quite sound like their core character. I felt it was a little lazy they didn't voice the cut scenes most of the time except for one line quips. Just text on a screen. The story is basically a childish mix of classic 90s cartoon tropes. The endings slightly change depending on who you play as, again just another nostalgia nod to the cartoon. The taunts are annoying. If you play online half the time everyone is just doing this. You hear them a lot. One taunt over and over. The specials aren't very unique to the character. The jokes and nostalgia are fun the first time around but the second time through these just seem like old pizza found under the couch. Once those wear off the game seems very empty. Now, I'm sad and I wish I bought a pizza instead.. One of the best games in this genre in the last year! Play strictly in co-op with friends, several hours of fun are guaranteed! The game is a bit simplified, but that doesn't get in the way. I advise!!!. A direct continuation of the Super Nes classic, this new episode evokes each easter egg to make every fan nostalgic. Despite being a game of easy assimilation, it definitely seeks to please the fan born between the 80's and 90's. A charm aside.. Shredder's Revenge delivers what it sets out to do exceptionally well. It's a fun, addicting 16-bit throwback to old school retro beat 'em ups, perhaps the very best to do so since that very era ended. There were a few slight problems I ran across like a boss glitching out or not be able to change the difficulty of the story unless you start over. There is just an insane amount of replay value with numerous challenges to do and collectibles to find in each stage. I do prefer to play with only one or two other players but the fact that this game has up to 6 player co-op is honestly quite impressive. One thing is for sure: this is a must play for beat 'em up fans or TMNT fans, and especially an essential title for both.. A perfect old school beat-em-up. Made with oodles of love, hopping into this game to rumble with randos whenever I have a spare 10-15 mintues is going to be my happy place for the next few years. It's that good.. Definitely the nostalgia trip is justified, excellent control, responsive, nice moves, throwback to the classic arcade and console games, amazing pixel art, the hub or the world map is a clear homage to the NES TMNT game, a lot of replay value, the co-op is super fun and the online multiplayer allows you to have a better solo experinece. Definitely nostalgic. It’s a blast to play as a single player or multiplayer! Definitely worth playing!. Amazing game... the graphics are great just as a fun arcade game. So many stages and characters to play with. The stage design are varied and enemies fun and interesting. You can multiplay locally or online, is a great party game and just good fun with simple mechanics and engaging gameplay. 10/10 kawabunga!. It's pretty fun but way too short and the story is too simplistic... i'm a bit disappointed. Just dream come true,receive best game in the series after 30 years, even not from Konami,but still such a faithful to original.. This is a perfectly executed game, its nails its art, presentation, sound, and level design. It feels like the best version of the classic beat em up gameplay and it might be the best example of the genre ever made. Its an instaclassic. I hope they make more of them.. If you were a kid during the 90s probably you will love this game. Finally I can finish this thing without ask my mother for more money for buying credits. Best soundtrack of the year so far. If you don't like Mutants over Broadway and Panic in the Sky you don't have a soul. It plays exactly as it supposed to play. Fun above the rest. Great game.. Nostalgic level 10/10. From the start it brings so many memories from childhood. Game is well done and is suited for everyone. This is a must buy for solo and also multiplayer. Multiplayer online connectivity with others is easily accessible.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nice retro game, best beat them up on new consoles. Need more that games in our time, bought on full price to support developers.. Played every version of every TMNT game, from the arcade through NES, SNES, mega drive, PS3, you name it... Such an amazing tribute I've yet to see in my life and for me it's also the best TMNT of all times! Thank you so much for this awesome game, would love to see more from this developer! COWABUNGA!!!. It's quite telling that I've never really been a fan of the Ninja Turtles franchise and still had an absolute blast playing this game. Hats off to DotEmu and Tribute Games for making one of the finest beat-em-ups in its class.. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a call back to a bygone era of games. This is very much a sequel to TMNT: Turtles in Time, but it also is leaning very, very heavily on nostalgia, pretty much running every single popular character and toy from the original series in the game as a boss or someone you have to rescue. Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as Master Splinter, April O’Neill, and Casey Jones, this game has seven characters instead of four, and while it is a side-scrolling beat ’em up, there are some differences between the characters. Unfortunately, this game also shows why they don’t make these games anymore – this game took a lot of effort to make, and is nicely animated pixel art, but it’s only two and a half hours long. If you try and collect everything, it might take you another hour… but after that, it’s just grinding for some tedious achievements, which isn’t fun. The other problem is that beat ’em up gameplay remains very simplistic, and this game is no exception. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and while it reflects the design of the era, modern games are more fun to play and less awkward and stiff. This isn’t bad as far as beat ’em ups go – in fact, it’s a reasonably good example, though Turtles in Time felt like it had better variety – but the game is still very simple, and not really super fun to play. Being short is a saving grace as much as it is a drawback; if it was any longer, you’d get bored. Which is the biggest problem, really – it isn’t 1994 anymore. Back in the day, I remember enjoying these games, but today, they’re just too simple compared to modern game design. The game is quite easy even on the middle difficulty setting, but cranking the difficulty didn’t really make me any more enamored with it. The high difficulty older beat ’em ups were designed as quarter eaters; modern games don’t benefit from that, but it reveals just how little content there actually is. While it was kind of nostalgic seeing all these characters again, the voice acting wasn’t great and the only thing that made me laugh was the “twist” at the end. All in all, I can’t recommend this trip down memory lane unless you get it for free, like playing it on Game Pass or something. There, it is a reasonable thing, as you can taste it and see if you want to see it through, and even if you do, it won’t feel like it took a bite out of your wallet for such a short and mediocre experience.. Great Beat ’em up and best game TMNT ever ................................... As a fanboy of the older beat em ups of the Turtles I really hate to write this. In a way i am disappointed in this game. It feels more like a party game then a proper beat em up. Almost in every screen the perspective of the backdrops are just so wrong or objects are way too big, like the cars for example. Completing all challenges is just too easy. The whole party just spamming taunt to be able to spam your Super Attack is funny at first but it actually ruins the game for its difficulty and other mechanics.. This game is so much fun, it’s great for those who grew up watching the turtles and also perfect for those who just want to play a fun game, it’s really great for the price your paying, absolutely no regrets there.. Superb game. Not only a retro like game. Many details in the gameplay, the graphics, animations to show how much developers care about fans! thxxxxxx !!!. As simple as I can put it. If you are into the arcade cabinets for the original turtles this is your game. May not be for someone who missed turtles in time or isn't very much into TMNT. However, it checks all the boxes for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is perfectly executed fan service that other developers need to take notes on. It’s the perfect blend of staying loyal to its retro roots while implementing subtle modern improvements. It’s such an honest homage to the classic side scrolling Ninja Turtles beat ‘em ups from the NES and SNES era to which it really feels like this was actually the next Turtles game that should have released after Turtles In Time. The graphics are amazing. Very gorgeous highly polished sprites that stay true to the roots without any unnecessary forcing of modern flashy effects. Same goes with the music, for the most part it sounds like it is exceptionally crafted music from the SNES era. There’s even some licensed music that fits surprisingly well. Every part of the presentation of this game is so well executed that someone could easily mistake this for a 25 year old game, and I mean that as a compliment. The maps are all extremely well designed, and many of them give nods to levels from old Turtles games. The gameplay is super tight, and does an awesome job of balancing the difficulty for all players. New players can easily pick it up and make it by with button mashing, and experienced players can appreciate the subtle level of complexity to the move sets. Initially I was disappointed in the length of the game - you can easily beat it in 2-3 hours, but the game is designed for you to replay the levels. Each level has challenges and secrets, and while they’re not the most exciting, it does give you more reason to keep playing. Also, there is an extremely seamless drop in and out system for online multiplayer, and it’s genuinely fun playing with random people. With all things considered, the $25 price tag is perfect for the content in this game. Especially considering that you are paying for such a genuine TMNT experience, even down to the carefully designed opening video that insanely so close to the cartoon. I don’t score games as 10 often. But for what this game set out to be, with what it is priced to be, and the amount of additional content added into the game, it truly excels at everything that it set out to do. This is how fan service games should be. With consideration of what it was trying to do, it’s a perfect game. Easily the best of all time in the beat ‘em ups genre.","a modern retro beat 'em up that pays tribute to the arcade games . it can be played solo or with up to five other partners online . once you beat the game, you'll unlock Casey Jones ."
"1,138.Guitar Hero World Tour (2008)","not bad, but you're not missing much if you miss out on this entry in the franchise. Amazing in every sense.I know it's hard not to compare this to rockband 2 but come on quit complaining and trying to figure out which is better.There both very awesome and brilliant in there own **** have to get both games and enjoy.This game will **** hours upon hours out of your **** replay value is off the charts and something you can pop in your 360 10 years from now just to try to beat your last score or get a higher rank on the leader boards.Think of this though,What does EA always do?They cut you off and remove online support to force you to buy there next game like they always do,so if your looking for longetivity then go with the Guitar hero franchise to guarantee that you can play 5-10 years online.This game is so freakin' awesome that It's 7-1-2012 and I still play this game here and **** do you get my **** there is just one comparison then I would say that the guitar hero games are 100% better if you play alone and The Rock band games are better when you play with friends,but that's it.I give this game a 9.9 because in my opinion GH 5 is perfection.. When Guitar Hero World Tour was announced I was stoked to the max, when I heard drums were added to the game also I wanted to cry. I waited anxiously for this game to come out, weeks passed and eventually came to the day of the release. I bought the full game bundle at midnight, came home and loaded up the first song. I was like okay, typical Guitar ****'s try the drums. The drums were fun also, the setlist was great too, but not as great as the first 3 games. The engine just didn't feel comfortable, there's just something about this game I don't like, but I can't seem to get my finger on it. I hate the slider notes for one thing, the game is fairly easy on guitar, the drums bass pedal had like velcro on the bottom to keep it from sliding. The drums broke within a week by the way, and I never bought a new set. I went into band mode online, and it is atrocious. I never want to play online on that game ever. People lag out constantly, the game lags, sometimes the score meter screws ****'s just terrible. The game is iffy, I suggest looking into this game more before you buy it.. Being a huge fan of the series, it's a shame how broken the game is. The achievements, characters, unlockables, and even the charts themselves seem... wrong. The only reason why the game isn't rated lower is due to the fact that the setlist is, for the most part, good, and at the time it was nice to play drums. Now this seems even much more dated than the first Guitar Hero!. Generally speaking the game is very fun to play. There is a reasonable amount of variaty in song choice and the boundle set is fun to use with friends and even if you feel like trying all the instruments. The career is very average as it gets quite boring if you have to do a gig that include songs you arnt really intrested in. If you want my advice I say play quickplay and online with your friends to get the best experiance.. Guitar Hero: World Tour was my first Guitar Hero game. At first i liked it, but in a few weeks the novelty went and i realised that all i was doing was a pressing a few buttons on a taccy plastic peripheral. And seeming as i already play the REAL guitar, it got very boring, very quickly. If you play ANY musical instrument than this probably isn't for you. A bit of a laugh with friends or at a party but in Single Player VERY DULL!!!!!! I'd give it a miss if i were you .","this entry in the guitar hero franchise is amazing in every sense . the game is so freakin' awesome that it's 7-1-2012 and i still play this game here . the engine just didn't feel comfortable, but it's not as great as the first 3 games ."
"1,140.Core Keeper","The game has a gorgeous pixel art style, diverse world and offers interesting mechanics. However, it does have some flaws, such as slow progression and repetitive tasks. Overall, it’s a charming experience with a lot of potential and room for improvement.. Games like this are why steam early access is so successful. Jump in on the ground floor of something awesome on its way to being amazing. The formula for this game is simple. Play solo or grab some friends. Dig to your hearts content. build a base, move in some NPCs, die to some bosses. Craft, farm, cook, and don’t forget to apply those skill points! While most early access games are buy now and shelf them to age like fine wine, this is a buy, and play now situation!. The game wastes your time so much, I'd highly recommend against it unless they take it out of the beta phase and fix all the issues and bugs. The devs don't care and instead rely on mods and assume everyone is on pc despite releasing it elsewhere. it is a normal game with its flaws. it is fun to play with friends. but in this genre, there are plenty of better options. Great game in a beautiful pixel-art style! I love the combination between **** valley and **** just works!. Holy ****, this game is amazing. If you like pixel art and games like Terraria this is a MUST PLAY.. Super fun game (especially the first hours into the game where everything is new), the gameplay is very player friendly and in my opinion it has huge potential to become a monster ****. But i'm not gonna lie, the game right now has huge problems, for example: the item progression is extremely poor, you basically get to scarlet tier (you could even skip it and keep using stone for bossing but it's not necessary) and then forget about armor until you can farm the ninja gear, the upgrade system was a good idea but at the same time kills the hype for future armor tiers, by the time i could farm the Galaxite ore i already had a full Ninja set (insanely broken and bis imo) the craftable melee weapons are so bad they're not even worth crafting, i wasted hours exploring the whole jungle for the chipped blade to craft the ""legendary"" sword only to find out it had the range of a dagger, low damage and no special attack, talking about legendary items, the pickaxe.. it requires crazy amounts of materials and the item itself isn't worth mentioning, what's up with that man? it kinda feels as if the devs were scared of making these weapons fun and strong, nobody wants to farm for hours only to get a worthless item they just keep on their inventory because of sunk cost fallacy, then there's the issue with the boss materials for summoning and scanning, the amount of materials are way too high and the summoning items are one time only, either lower the amount of materials required or make them permanent so the player can farm kills for drops. The food system needs some help too, maybe limit the amount of food you can have at the same time but extend their durations. There are also some issues with mob spawns, sometimes, out of nowhere you can kinda phase out(?) of the map and get instantly surrounded by mobs (happened a lot on the sunken sea and shimmering frontier areas) Really liked the talent tree even though i only got 4 or 5 skills to 100, it requires a lot of grinding but hey i don't mind. The bosses are alright, some variety would've been appreciated ie: making the poison slime a frog, the magma one a golem and the blue one a crab (would make sense considering the zones they're in) Overall the game is really fun cosidering it's a 1.0, if the game keeps getting updates, qol and mods then it will be a game worth replaying and even speedrunning.. A very fun and solid overhead minecraft like, the progression is very solid and there are so many possibilities with the design. Hoping to come back to this one later.. Terraria meets ****. Best of both worlds. Loads of boss fights, weapons, pets, armor sets accessories and etc to collect. Farming feels simple but doesn't become tiring, being able to place drills to automatically harvest ores is also an amazing QoL feature. In general, the QoL in this game is unmatched. Auto stack feature in chest menu, a hold to mine feature so you dont have to use the joystick while stripmining, automatic crafting on a lot of crafting tables, easy access to vendors, which dont need any huge specifications to join your base, gravestones that keep your items safe if you die, teleporters spread across the map, items that help you locate bosses on the (genuinel huge) map, custom terrain generation,with a seed based system, the list goes on. It was such a blast to experience this game, and even though I beat in roughly 25 hours or so, i dont wanna stop. I could keep playing for many many more hours, honestly, furthering my skill trees, building a prettier base and so on. Absolutely fantastic game, 10/10 ( oh and as a little side info, i played this game for like 4 days straight pretty much with out breaks ( except going to uni lol) cause i was THAT addicted to it. Great game for terraria/ **** valley enjoyers, extremely grindy to get all achievements, would love to see more of it in the future, not a 10 just because it needs more decorative and casual/ ""cozy"" elements IMO.. Excellent game. As you probably know, it's basically a top-down version of Terraria or Minecraft, but in my opinion vastly superior to both. Minecraft has hideous visuals, while Core Keeper is beautiful to look at. Terraria has the infuriating issue of being CONSTANTLY bombarded by enemy attacks, always preventing you from doing what you are trying to do. Core Keeper, conversely, is much more respectful of the player, typically allowing you to engage enemies on your own terms. It's also easier to prevent enemies spawning where you don't want them to be. So you have the freedom to build a house, craft items, farm animals and plants, and cook food without being constantly bothered (unless you set up your base in a spot with a lot of enemy spawn tiles, but you can remove those to ""cleanse"" it anyway as mentioned above). 10+ hours in so far and 2 bosses defeated, and I haven't been pestered by the stupid bloodmoons, goblin hordes or any trash like that that happens in many other survival crafting games. I've had enemies appear around my base 2-3 times causing minor damage, and that's plenty; enough to give you a reason to think about traps and securing your base, but not so much as to detract from your main goals. So this is a welcome difference that makes me want to keep playing. If you've never played either of the abovementioned games, but think you like the idea of survival crafting and building game, it's excellent for the asking price (especially as it's 50% off on a couple stores), so give it a go. Beautiful graphics; a fun and engaging gameplay loop of exploring, collecting resources and building; easy to jump into and back out of on your own time, and great fun either solo or with a friend(s).","the game has a beautiful pixel art style, diverse world and interesting mechanics . it does have some flaws, such as slow progression and repetitive tasks . it is fun to play with friends. but in this genre, there are plenty of better options ."
"1,141.Rumble Racing","enjoyable game. The learning curve is tough without becoming impossible, and races never seem out of reach to win even if you keep coming up just short.","the learning curve is tough without becoming impossible, and races never seem out of reach . the learning curve is tough without becoming impossible, and races never seem out of reach ."
"1,142.Tropico","It was fun to try the very first part of the series. In actuality, unfortunately, I constantly saw advertisements and reviews in magazines, but I could not try it myself. I got acquainted tropico after 5 and 6 parts, and was surprised that for the most part nothing has changed in the basic mechanics of the game. Now it makes no sense to start from the first one, modern parts offer everything the same, only deeper and bigger, visually more beautiful, and more convenient in terms of interfaces. Only for historians-archaeologists. Great game: The atmosphere is perfect, it is not only caribbean, but it is also funny to read the manual. Gameplay is very good, you need some hours to understand the mechanics and there is always something to do. The best part is, that you need to think strategically, but also need to do some micro management. Even as an experienced Tropico player I still discover some good ideas, but nonetheless it could be more complex and less casual. Graphic is...2001 ;) So dont expect much. Anyway you cant change the resolution to 16:9, what is unfortunate. And there are no mods in internet.. I've played the heck out of this game. I have to say, it is a really enjoyable and fun experience. You can micromanage everything. Unfortunately, the fun runs out rather quickly as there is not a whole lot you can do past a certain point. Overall good game.. Tropico is a fantastic city builder. It allows you to build and manage your island paradise. You control the fate of every single one of your citizens without being able to actually tell them what to do. However you can lead them in the direction you want. Every island you play can be a completely different city. The Cuban flare of the game can really carry you away. The game difficulty offers a wide range but most scenarios are very tough. Few games are as rewarding as Tropico - and the original is still the best in the series.. Tropico 1 is, even 13 years after it's release, really fun to play. I loved this game as a child, and even now the graphic part of the game is still decent, while the gameplay is just epic! The newest version definitely has some more options, but if you buy Tropico 1, you'll still get tons of fun for just a few bucks.. Beautiful graphics (as for 2001). Nice and smooth gameplay, good tutorial, you're getting into the game quite fast. If you like games with indirect control this game is really for you. Although economy simulation balance is little bit more on casual side, not on hardcore one. But anyway, game is really funny and definitely should have a try.. One of the games of my childhood. Really loved to play it back in time and I still play it sometimes, along with Tropico 2. Unfortunately, the newer parts do not have the unique spirit the first part had.. Amazing, amazing, amazing, and simply amazing. Love playing this game so much. Beautiful graphics, stunning scenery and architecture, interesting story and great musical score. Definitely one of the best ""build your city/society"" type of tycoon-ish games I've played. Excellent!!",tropico is a fantastic city builder . you control the fate of every single one of your citizens without being able to actually tell them what to do . you can micromanage everything . the fun runs out rather quickly as there is not a whole lot you can do past a certain point .
"1,143.Wizardry 8","greatest game ever made. Best dungeon crawler game in history. Wizardry 6-8 for life.. the first game that introduced me to the world of old school RPGs. Quite original.. I played this game thru some time ago. Destroying Dark Savant was not pleasurable because he kinda died too fast. But this is like the only downside. The game was a masterpiece in every possible way. Music was great, atmosphere was great, combat was engaging (TURN BASED!), story was fun too.. A masterpiece. I just finished this game today on 3/31/2021 and many gameplay mechanics are novel even by today's standards. Considering the time it was released, this was a revolutionary RPG. Movement in the game is freeform and real-time while combat is turn-based, reminding me a bit of Might and Magic 6. I love the level of detail that went into all aspects of the game. You can see packs of enemies at a distance, and they act realistically. They're not aware until they see you, and when they spot you, they start heading in your direction. Encounter design is very good. Monsters scale to your level, but it's not the lazy scaling of older Elder Scrolls games. You come across stronger monster types as you level up. The game is quite difficult, and for the first half of the game, I was regularly coming across monsters that would stomp all over me. It made the world feel dangerous and exciting. The dungeons are creative, and excellently designed. They feel organic to your adventure, and not just dungeon_1234. They also make great use of verticality and puzzle-solving. Story is ""meh."". 10/10 will play again. truly a industry-defining gaming up there with the best.. If you play it today it's so terrible old school you can only watch in terror. Every fight or action has to be prepared, everyone takes his best weapons for the fight, the people in background prepare their buffs, the wizards learn their spells, and voila, the single level 1 cockroach is dead. Or the chest is opened without touching it, it took only 20 nights resting. When you start the game it looks hard but promising, but after a while you find out it remains like that: It's a battle between the player and the rules, and the rules don't like you having fun.. While it's true that the graphics are sub-optimal, everything else is amazing and makes it a 10. What other game has so many great unique classes (ninja, samurai, bishop, gadgeteer, etc)? This is one of the best party creation RPG's ever made, if that's what you're looking for.. There are a lot of good things about Wizardry 8. It allows you to create up to 6 core party members. (You have two more slots for NPCs.) It has a lot of variety of races and classes. The spell list is extensive and the tactical combat is fairly deep. It is an old series, built upon a very free-wheeling mixture of science fiction and fantasy -- strangely refreshing in comparison to the narrower tropes of many of today's RPGs. The high-level plot isn't terribly deep, but it does not compare unfavorably to more modern RPGs. It is a hard game -- brutally hard on ""normal"", and not remotely easy on ""novice"". ""Save early, save often"" is the mantra to live by with this game. Whether that is bad or good depends on what you are looking for, but you want to go in with your eyes wide open. Wizardry is not forgiving of mistakes. Depth is a double-edged sword. Unless you research extensively, you _will_ make mistakes in your initial party design. Depending on how big those mistakes are, you may later be frustrated. The difficulty is made worse by the Wizardry's depth -- the ideal party for the beginning of the game will not be ideal in mid-game, and the ideal party for the end will again be different. So, that's the good. The bad: There are continuously wandering monsters in many zones (especially initially, but they _do_ respawn). These fights are hard, and you can easily go from one fight to another, depleted, with no hope of winning it. Sometimes you can run away, but that isn't always an option. At times, it feels like an endless grind. The story is often lost in the mix -- Wizardry relies heavily on this mechanic, and the gameplay can be extremely repetitive. It can get boring. If Wizardry is old-school in a lot of good ways, it's also old-school in some bad ways. The parties of wandering monsters you face often make no sense. There is no sense of story there, no explanation of how this fits into a bigger picture. You can loot NPCs' chests without consequences. Unlike more modern RPGs, there is comparatively little sense of character, of interpersonal story. It's a game built around tactical combat with a thin leavening of plot. In the end, the repetitive game-play and paper-thin characterization make it hard for me to give it more than a 7. If these aren't problems for you, you may enjoy it more.. I think that it is the best RPG turn based game EVER! It was fun to play and I may be wrong but this is first game that had iron made mode. At least for me it was first game with this feature :) To bad that this company is not making more games :( Jagged Alliance creators come back!!!! :D. Truly amazing and well-polished old school RPG. While Might and Magic went the way of FPS-styled RPG, Wizardry stayed true to the format and delivered a game that is well-designed and engaging.. I was eagerly awaiting this game. I still consider its precedessor (Wizardry 7) to be one of the best RPGs ever made if not the best. Wizardry 8 brought me countless hours of immersive and fun game-play. I did fell for the turn-based RPGs of this style because of how much it resembled pen&paper gameplay and because of the strategy element. I played it recently and it was still good. The story was nice, the atmosphere was still there. It also had a very good difficulty curve. The game had few problems resulting from the combat design, but there haven't been very much significant. I still think this game is one of the best in the genre.. If you're a classic CRPG gamer, and you like turn based combat and have tolerance to ""dated graphics""..then go out and buy this now! (Steam has it for $9.99) I am a late comer to this title but I picked it up and loaded it and haven't looked back. A great adventure in high fantasy along with GREAT turn based combat system. The characters are complex and spending your bonus points correctly requires some research and reading, but the gameplay is just so rewarding. If you like classic RPG gaming then this is a no brainer!. A truly unique game combining good ole school dungeon crawling and phase-based combat with modern 3D graphics and sound. Everything in this game, from the (huge!) world design to the voice acting is top notch, and to this day it remains one of the best cRPGs in video game history. It's just too bad it went by so unnoticed, and that there's no hope for a sequel.. The swan song of the old-school RPG. Where its peers like Might and Magic and Ultima went out with a whimper, the Wizardry series did it with a triumphant bang. There's a decent story which wraps up the trilogy neatly, but the game's focus is on its rich tactical combat system and deep character customization. The interface is finely polished, the multitude of character races and classes nearly perfectly balanced, and the voice acting by turns quirky, uproarious, and endearing. An absolute classic.. Wizardry 8 is a last shard of an Era of old-school RPG. In the times, when BioWare was beginning to replace good-old RPG by character-centred ones, Wizardry 8 looks like a relic from the glorious past. And this relic still can do it! Really hard fights - especially on high levels (both of characters and gameplay), when you can meet a group of casters and fighters. Such encounters require a deep understanding of gameplay mechanics, character abilities, weak spots of both your squad and enemies. Really epic possibility to create endless set of character combinations (lots of classes, lots of races, and each combo really influences gameplay style): a squad of wizards or fighters, or a mixed dream-team? They all can reach the final, but, possibly, some of them - with MUCH more troubles. Stylish! Long time ago forgotten idea of mix of hardcore sci-fi and sword-and-sorcery fantasy (nowadays replaced with Asian idea of ""let's draw lots of nice stuff and not even try to explain why the heck this all is lying in one pile"") looks brutally elegant. Giant metal constructions and starships of space empires are placed along with giant trees of spiritualist squirrels, monks, fish psionics... Ah, good old sci-fi! Elegant ending of epic story. The game everyone must play to see how it was before, and to understand - these games have placed the base for modern concept of RPG. Sometimes I miss such games, their endless replayability and solid foundation.","""wizardry 6-8 for life"" was the first game that introduced me to the world of old school RPGs . movement in the game is freeform and real-time while combat is turn-based . the dungeons are creative, and excellently designed ."
"1,145.Tomb Raider II","Best Tomb Raider game ever **** is the best game in the **** introduced new moves like climbing walls,use of vehicles, many weapons and **** the levels are good and **** has better graphics compared to the 1st game.Levels are large but not so difficult like Tomb Raider 3(1998).I also like Lara's iconic long **** game is very interesting and fun to play.Best levels designed.This game is a masterpiece.Best game of all time️️️.. This game is my childhood. Brings so many memories. Was difficult but somehow menagable. Despite the pixelated graphics places in the game was amazing.. Easily the best game ever made! Well, if you like the classic Tomb Raider concept, of course. Within the TR & speedrun community - e. g. see twitch - most agree that this was the best, better than the first technically and in level design, better than all relaunches and best over all. The remake of TR 1 to 3 which is expected for early 2024 is expected to change graphics only, not gameplay and is therefore highly anticipated. This is a must-play, a milestone and still brilliant fun if you like exploring ancient tombs.","the remake of TR 1 to 3 is expected for early 2024 . it will change graphics only, not gameplay and is therefore highly anticipated . despite the pixelated graphics places in the game was amazing ."
"1,146.Aliens Versus Predator 2","Excellent game from top to bottom. I enjoyed the single player, but all the PvP modes are where this game truly shines.. best alien game ever made a pc exsluive graphcily superıor of time. feels true game of second aliens movie.. played it around 2003/5 on my pentium 3; experience that is hard to forget; looking back from 202x, can say: i wish there was a remake with modern graphics, although even now it would make you **** bricks playing in the dark:)), otherwise - the quality of how it was done, 3 stories connected into one - i wish younger games could come close to it, but they never did - avp 2010, colonial marines - sad trash compared to AvP2; the only quality game on pc 1st person was Alien: Isolation , but that was different gameplay style. as 1st person action in Aliens Universe AvP2 is still unbeaten. Great game in the famous Alien vs. Predator universe with incredibly cool gameplay, interesting story, atmosphere, detailed environments, and good multiplayer. The game offers unique gameplay as one of three characters that are radically different from each other. When playing as an Alien, the game offers a unique opportunity to go through the entire development cycle of an alien from a Facehugger to an adult Drone by yourselves. Almost any surface for movement becomes available to us. And instilling fear in your victims and killing them with stealth one after another makes you feel like an ideal killing machine. The Marine campaign will make you feel like a hero in a world of monsters. The main character is strong, fearless, a specialist in all types of equipment and weapons, and looks a bit like Iron Arnie himself. The human gameplay is intense, dynamic, and also very fun, especially when you are given a smart gun or an exoskeleton. The role of the Predator gives an unforgettable feeling of dominance, being a super hunter at the top of the food chain. A huge number of high-tech gadgets and weapons give a lot of fun and diversify the ways of killing their victims. Panic makes enemies act differently and it's up to you to decide whether to spare unarmed frightened prey with a kind of Predator code or collect a trophy. Beautifully developed detailed environments with a variety of locations. The player is constantly surrounded by an atmosphere of the unknown, filled with fear and threat. Incredibly interesting and exciting plot, which tells us the story of the incident and its consequences on the planet LV1201. The storylines of all three characters cross throughout the story. The finale of each campaign will not leave anyone indifferent. 100% this is the best game in the Alien vs Predator series at the moment.. Best AvP, bad AI. Gameplay: combat mechanics 6/10 stealth (alien) 7/10 atmosphere 10/10 Gameplay as immersive horror (marine): 8/10 Story 8/10 Graphics 9/10 Sounds & music 8/10 . Monolith production, That's it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I remember playing the game with my lads back in the day and having the most fun.. Just like its predecessor, Alien Versus Predator 2 is stunning. The graphics are significantly improved and the action is even more intense. Hidden gem!. This game was so much fun. The single player was great, but the multiplayer was amazing. The three way race wars were an unending fun multiplayer.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 2001 classic shooter with great campaign and storyline, diverse, great graphics and sound, insane atmosphere, must have for any fps fan. best of the series, back when big franchises didnt just sell out and put garbage on shelves. I was just pleasantly surprised by EVERYTHING I saw. Good asymmetrical gameplay, though I didn't get a chance to see it online. Rating it super highly because it deserves to be seen by modern players as a GOOD licensed game (even if not directly tied-in to a movie). Gives just the experience of playing as any one of the movie monsters it features.. A masterpiece; there is no game like AVP2! The landscapes, characters, direction, everything...specially the arsenal against the most terrible enemies ever. After 10 years Tomiko's death still breaks my heart. Being an alien is like being inside Franz Kafka book! This game deserves a remaking. Who are the persons who produced it?. Still have it with the original box sadly Sierra dropped the servers so i pretty much forgot about it. But having recently played the never ones of the series i realized how well this game was actually made. You can play as Arny, Predator and Alien. Everyone with their unique approach to the game. Thus the marine having the longest playtrough the others are also refreshing to play. Its an gem among the pc games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An intriguing plot, haunting sound effects, brutal gameplay and explosive arsenal should be enough to draw you into one of the greatest game of the franchise, if you can forgive the aging graphics.. This game is one of the old gems that never really caught a massive following, likely due to the fact that it was based off some movie franchises and a lot of people (including myself) tend to avoid ANY game that is based off movies, but it just so happens that I was quite the aliens/predator fan. This game was fantastic, I would probably still play it if there were people online! Server support was cut a few years back I believe and you have to do something funky during startup to play online, but you still can. Either way, the single player experience, tons of fun, the marine campaign just inspires a sense of dread, you're always wondering when something will appear, and you frequently have to run like hell, even after beating the marine campaign multiple times, I never really get bored of it. The multiplayer is where this game is just top notch though, even though it was often plagued by hackers, the variety in weapons prompted people to always pick overpowered weapons, most of these things were solved by dedicated servers with good admins, and not only that but it was always fun, had tons of features, like, an unbelievable amount. All 3 races were highly enjoyable to play. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 instead of 10 is basically because of the complete and utter lack of balancing, easily overshadowed by how fun it is to simply play on a well maintained dedicated server, it only seldom caused frustration.","great game in the famous Alien vs. Predator universe with incredibly cool gameplay, interesting story, atmosphere, detailed environments, and good multiplayer . the main character is strong, fearless, a specialist in all types of equipment and weapons, and looks a bit like Iron Arnie himself . the game offers unique gameplay as one of three characters that are radically different from each other ."
"1,147.Giants: Citizen Kabuto","great humor, fun story, stunning graphics - only held back by the janky collision system. Giants is a hybrid FPS/TPS with lightweight floaty combat, similar to C&C Renegade. There is no inventory/ammo management or map exploration, the basic game loop: you go to the map marker, kill/fetch the target, watch cutscene, restock on items and repeat. Enemies are stupid and there are no difficulty levels. Again, the combat has no weight to it and in general the game feels very cheaply made. As you can see from the other reviews, the only thing the game has going for it is the humour. The characters have funny accents, say bad words, and even make pp jokes! Highly recommend /s. One of the funniest games ever created. Mechanically they threw in everything except the kitchen sink. So if you want a focused polished experience this ain't it, but if you want imagination and diversity it's great. A bit buggy and hard to get into because of the dated tech to really recommend.. One of the best action adventures games I ever played in my entire life :) Humor is so ridiculous that makes you laugh constantly. Story also very enjoyable with few plot twists :). One of the best older games I've ever played. The humor the 3 VERY different player types all interacting together in both single player and the never ending great multiplayer. I am SUPER SUPER PISSED this game never got BIG like other games. This game deserves to be reborn and get popular for a change because anyone who played it loved it!!! PERIOD!!!. I love the humor of the game, and the characters are quite likable. Nevertheless, the PC version (from GoG) is incredibly, incredibly broken on Windows 10. I'm not sure whether the original version was this bad. All the physics and hit detection fail to work correctly. Unless an enemy stops moving, my bullets will fail to hit it. The game isn't one bit balanced, and the save points vary all over the place. Some levels are way too long, and some are way too easy. It's quite repetitive. Every time I climb up a mountain, it feels like I'm glitching my way through the game, yet that's the way to beat it. It feels like there was very little quality control put into the gameplay itself. On the other hand, I really, really like the smartass humor in this game. Its dialogue is a masterpiece.. GIants Citizen Kabuto is not only a fabulous game with 3 distinctive play styles, a unique lore and universe but is the funniest game of all time without a doubt in my mind. Just watching to cut scenes makes me crack up in laughter. This is a cult classic with a gripping and hilarious story line that is easy to follow and an amazing game play engine where you play as marines, then as a magical witch then finally as the Giant himself. While the first two modes are fantastic, the Giant can feel way too repetitive and a really letdown of a final chapter. Giants Citizen Kabuto also had an online mode which I believe is still active with a small group of people who organise game sessions. Overall amazing game, if you like a good laugh and an amazing game, play Giants Citizen Kabuto!. One of those incredibly unique and original titles that were never truly appreciated, despite offering fantastic visuals and worlds especially for it's time, beautiful soundtrack by 2 of the best composers, , fun gameplay offering 3 completely different factions and amazing both single-player and multiplayer experience. 10/10. I cant believe it, its 2014 and i still play Giants On-line With my old school Friends! Giants has a very unique GamePlay and some fancy and enjoyable graphics regarding of its release date, The History isn't the best out there, but the Feeling This Game Offers is neat and very original i have to admit (compared with other games up to this date) and the Multiplayer Combination of Base Building and Team-Working to Defeat other totally Different Races is just GENIUS. Its a shame the developers team ran out of funds to release the game as they wanted to, I could pay to see a Giants 2 for sure.. Giants: Citizen Kabuto is one of my top 10 games of all time, a three part story complete of all parties associated with the planet and its inhabitants, with funny quarky moments, a good sound track and a lot of British slang and voice acting, this is one of the few games that really lifts my spirits after playing too many redundant games in the late era. Especially the base building mechanics in the game, paired with the way you destroy the enemies base. Kind a wish there was a Giants 2 *sobs.. I played this when it first came out and it barely ran on my machine. It looked gorgeous with the introductory pan over the island with the sun in the background and all the great sun flares. Then I played the game and it was absolutely sensational. It was a quirky, beautiful, unbelievably fun experience with great challenges and a game where an RTS and FPS combination was pulled off perfectly. I really don't understand why there was never a second one made.","the game is a hybrid FPS/TPS with lightweight floaty combat, similar to C&C Renegade . there is no inventory/ammo management or map exploration, and there are no difficulty levels . the only thing the game has going for it is the humour ."
"1,148.Metal Slug X","You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. You can't go wrong with metal slug whether on ps1 or ps2, it's goofy it's funny and enjoyable to play with a friend or a relative for a short, good amount of time to beat it.. All kids who play ps1 must have finished this game, it's enough to play once and it's really fun to play with friends. What a blast from the past! You can get a bundle of the first three Metal Slugs on steam for $10 on sale. Metal Slug X is a remastered of the second one, I think. Each installment is a great co-op for an hour of gameplay. Good humor, unlimited lives, and pure fun :D. Classic with an impeccable artistic section. Fun and super replayable. My favorite of the Neo-Geo.. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GOOD.. The best installment of the series. Not as huge and high-def as Metal Slug 3, but its simplicity makes it a perfectly round and pleasant experience to play - especially in 2p-coop!. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. This game is an amazing revision of an already amazing game, the difficulty is great (better if you play it on arcade), the music is great, the character design and mecha design are great, it has this colorful vibe that you don't see very often, simply a classic. As a recommendation play it with a friend and try to beat it with limited continues.. Metal Slug is best game in ps1 i love it , i love it , i love it i playing Metal Slug X so many times p.s:in Iran we call this game sarbaz kocholo it means little soldier. I loved this game It was so good the only other ps1 game i would ive 10 isnt on this website and trust me I played a lot of psone back in the day that is no light statement. It was so fun to work through the smart levels with decent but detailed and intersesting graphics and it had a perfect easy to learn hard to master like games should be. It also was not repetitive at all for a side scrolling shooting game because there was constant new enemies and interesting ways to challenge the player wich is great level design.. Metal Slug X is one of the many PSOne classics, it is such an addicting and awesome game. The artstyle is arcady and some parts in the game are really funny. The shooting mechanics and side-scrolling action is better than its ever been. Metal Slug X is like a combination of Metal Slug One and Two, it combines boss fights and it makes the experience longer and better. Metal Slug X is truly a classic.","metal slug is one of the best games on ps1 and ps2 . it's funny and enjoyable to play with a friend or a relative for a short, good amount of time to beat it ."
"1,149.Out of the Park Baseball 13","I would give this game a 10 but still think there is room for improvement and don't want them to get lazy like EA Sports. First off, this is reviewed as a simulation game, not as a live action sports game. If you are looking for an EA sports type game, stop reading now. Sure it would be great if a company like OOTP Developments could work with EA or Activision and put together the ultimate sports sim, the numbers/simulation depth of OOTP with the live action of the big developers, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. OOTP is a great game on its own though, especially if you want to recreate history and the mod community is pretty large, they don't have all the rights but you can easily download MLB uniforms and logos from the mod community, along with player images (facegen) that really made the game graphically appealing. This is the ultimate GM game for a baseball fan, take over the Cubs in the 80s and actually build a world series team. take over the Brooklyn Dodgers and stop them from moving to Los Angeles. Take over Boston in the 20s and stop the trade of the greatest player ever to the hated Yankees. Create custom baseball cards (also mods for that) and vote for yourself who should win end of season awards and who should be in the Hall of Fame. Did someone get a career ending injury and you want to change it, a few quick clicks and he is back in the game. did someone retire too soon or is playing too long, its easy to force retirements and make players come out of retirement. You can basically do anything you want in this game, very addicting.. OOTP 13 is the first baseball sim I've been able to seriously get into. I have yet to see any set of stats or results generated from it that has looked unrealistic to me. Between the historical players and teams, league customization, and career modes, you've got a lot of different options on how to play the game. One thing that really surprised me was the dynamic nature of the leagues. In the three seasons that I've been working my way up the minor league system as a manager, not only did the planned move of the Astros to the AL West happen, but the Pirates wound up moving to Charlotte, and Major League expansion teams were added in Jacksonville and Indianapolis. It makes an ongoing seasonal campaign more interesting when there's other stuff going on that's completely unrelated to anything you're doing. I look forward to being able to manage the Rays at the Major League level at some point... though they might be in Des Moines by then. :). This is a great game for people who are interested in a extremely in depth management sports simulation. This is NOT for anyone who just wants to play through a game of baseball like a console sports game. If you love in depth management of stats, lineups, financials, minor league's, drafts, and much more; this is the game for you!. I really got hooked on this sports management situation - and I am not a baseball fan by far. The information is presented in a very accessible way (compared to the loads of data you face) and the ability to completely build your own fantasy league, import modded logos and uniforms brings an addiction level that is rarely reached these days. For me it's on par with Civ: Just one more ball game. No, it doesn't have NBA 2K12 or MLB: The Show like graphics, but it doesn't need to. It's not what this game is about. And who has ever blamed Minecraft for being graphically deficient? Try this game for a little while and it will really grow on you!. Knocking the game for the graphics is wrong. It 's not meant to be a graphics or arcade game. It's meant to have all the nuances and subleties of baseball. And it succeeds there. Where it can be knocked is for the lack of technical support and problems that go unanswered. Suggestions, encouraged by the developer, seem to go unnoticed. Older versions are better than the newer ones. The game can give hours upon hours upon hours of enjoyment but then ends with an unexpected crash or glitch which makes you start over making it seem like going back to 0000 in an arcade game. The details, statistical realism and format make it a great game when it runs right, but the problems really detract and are frustrating. I give it an 8 barely.. The best baseball simulation/management game out there. Very addicting game that allows you to take control of your favorite team or create your own league.. My favorite baseball game ever! I really enjoy the thinking and all the baseball ""stuff."" I would play all day if I could. I also really like the online leagues.. This simulation is very-well developed. It accurately reflects baseball of any era from the 1800's to complete and accurate rosters as of 2012. If you want a game where you are the CEO i.e. GM then this is the game for you. No, the graphics and sound are not like a first-person shooter or something but they are very good for what they are needed for. This isn't some glitz shooter for a dumbace. You are smart? You will like. This is a game about building a contender through the draft, free-agency, and trades. Controlling ticket prices etc. It is a very deep simulation and has excellent online leagues against human opponents. Easily the best game in the genre.. For a baseball game having the same hold as Football manager then this game is for you. So many options to tailor the game to your likes and a very helpful forum and producer for help and advice. So simple to get into but with long term playability. Many hours can be lost trying to win the next game or sign that star player you need for your franchise to get to the top.. Great game. Responsive developers. Rich selection of mods from an outstanding and active user community. Nearly unlimited customization possibilities. Not liking this game because it doesn't have PS3 graphics is akin to not liking the movie ""Gladiator"" because there were no light sabres.. I'm a gamer and a huge sports management gamer. Of all the games I have played through out the years OOTP is the one I play everyday. You can play historical, current MLB, fictional, fast sim or play out every game. The mods made by the forum are awesome as well as the fact the developer is active on the board.. I gave the game a 9/10, but this game is not for everyone because it is a management SIMULATOR. If you lack imagination, can't read, or have a short attention span this game probably isn't for you. If you truly want to experience and be immersed in the heartbreak and the exhilaration that comes from America's Pastime, OOTP is for you. And that's not even mentioning the great mods, online leagues, and active community that take the enjoyment to the next level. My favorite baseball game.. 10/10. Not much more to say. Like baseball? or even just like the idea of taking control of your own sports team? Or even creating your own league and watching it grow and expand into the future. This has has alot to offer. For people being negative about 'no graphics engine'. Please take a second to view the game website and realise that this is a TEXT-BASED sports sim.. This is a text based sim that focuses on the management aspects of running a team and the stats of baseball, not a game for those looking to play with today's level of HD graphics like MLB: The Show. The amazing thing about OOTP is the unlimited customizability. You can play any season of MLB's past. You can create a fictional league with 80 teams. You can play with historical player randomly debutting through the history of the league. When I say your options are unlimited, I mean it.. I've played OOTP for 8 years and no other sports simulation even comes close to the depth and detail that OOTP13 offers for Baseball fans. Whatever you like to play whether it be Historical, Fictional or real MLB rosters OOTP13 fits the bill! Do yourself a favor and BUY OOTP13 right now! The best bang for your buck!!!!. I've played many board and computer baseball games over the years and, in my opinion, this is the very best. Replay historical seasons or draft players from different eras, create and immerse yourself in fictional baseball worlds, the possibilities for customisation are terrific and there is a great community of OOTP players and modders with a lively and helpful forum.wonderful value for money.. I have been playing OOTP baseball since version 6, approximately 8 years now. I have played many baseball games through the years but none come close to the pure fun and thorough enjoyment as OOTP baseball. OOTP does not do everything but with each new release it comes closer to being the best baseball game ever. Can you simulate what its like managing the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Nolan Ryan, Ozzie Smith etc. with other traditional baseball games? No, but with OOTP you can. Combine that with the greatest modders, customer support and the greatest development team and what do you get? Simply the most ideal baseball game that your money can buy. Anyone who bashes this splendid game must be in love with video games that have the worst simulation stats, yearly updates as well as the worst customer and development support. You can have that. I'll very gladly take OOTP any day, any year. But if you want a far more greater challenge, then OOTP baseball is the only way to go. Hands down.. Anyone bashing the game for a lack of graphics is obviously either 12 or a button masher-type gamer. Enjoy your The Show video games with their snazzy graphics, horrendously terrible simulation stats and minimal year to year updates. I'll take my OOTP. If you want a challenge as a manager or general manager and are detail-oriented, this game is absolutely the one for you.. When I purchased OOTP 2007 years ago I realized that baseball can be fun. Five versions later the feeling is always the same, best investissement I've ever done in a computer game. No game give me that much enjoyment, not a single day I don't start it to manage my highly missed Expos.. The perfect sim to recreate history according to my rules. I can take as long as I want to mark my idea on the history of Base Ball from 1871 to the present. I've been playing OOTP since the beginning. If you're into graphics, look elsewhere. If you are into a believable sim that portraits the game of baseball look no further. 10 out of 10. Anyone who even mentions the word graphics as a part of their review shouldn't be playing (or reviewing) the game. It is a text-based management sim. This is like going over to review Call of Duty and criticizing the game for being ""unrealistic"" because you don't die after being shot once, or criticizing Assassin's Creed because you can't jump out of buildings into haystacks in real life. As a text-based baseball simulation, this game is the gold standard. Simple as that.. This game has grown leaps and bounds since the original ootp was releases many years ago. Verizon 13 has a brand new interface, which makes everything only a click or two away. IMO, the game doesn't need fancy graphics because the simulation engine is excellent and mods like real logos, uniforms, and ballparks bring the game to life - using facegen, as players change teams, so do their uniforms. I've already played this version more than v12 and that's saying alot as I've spend days on end playing just one more game. If you're a stat head or just someone who loves the game of baseball, you owe it to yourself to see the endless possibilities that can be created with ootp.. play the game the way YOU want to play.. OOTP 13 is the best baseball simulator available. Period. It's complicated, it has a learning curve, it has none of the 3-D graphics that today's ADD children demand (see the two bad, and very sad and ignorant reviews), and if you want to know what it's like to be a GM, past or present, historical or fictional, this is the simulation you want. This is an intellectual pastime; you have to think, plan ahead, have a strategy and make good decisions in order to win consistently. The speed with which you can twitch a controller will not help you.. OOTP 13 is the best management/simulation sports game ever created! There is nothing like it. The ability to create any baseball universe you want with nearly whatever rules you want is unparalled. It also has the most accurate baseball simulation numbers and you can even simulate any era of baseball (or make a new one with your league averages!) truly amazing piece of software that allows you to be a manager, GM, commisiner,and let's you dabble with your creative side ( make your own stories, teams, league setup) cannot recommend it enough... Go buy it now!. If you are a true baseball fan then this is the game for you. OOTP gives you the ability to manage just about every aspect of your team. There are so many great features in this game that it is almost impossible to stop playing. There is no other game that I own that I play as much as OOTP!. OOTP 13 is my first version of the Out of the Park games. I am a baseball fan and hoped to use the software to teach myself more about strategies and gain a deeper understanding of how the world of professional baseball works. In the time that I've owned OOTP 13, my knowledge of active rosters, 40 man rosters, waiving players, minor league call ups, and a whole host of other things that avid baseball fans are familiar with has increased tremendously. I can spend hours geeking out pouring over stats and looking for my next star player. The game doesn't feature much in the way of graphics but it's a niche genre and that doesn't detract from the game in any way.. OOTP 13 is easily the best baseball game I have ever played. The variety, flexibility and breadth of options in creating a league is fantastic. It provides me with endless hours of enjoyment. Also, the developer support is excellent, something the big game companies should strive for. The user community is very active and supportive and provides excellent mods, etc. The $39.95 is the best bargain I have ever paid for a game - the hourly cost to me is pennies.. To experience simulated baseball that seems real there is no other game on the market. Not only is OOTPB the best in its genre, but it continues to improve in form function and performance every year. OOTPB can be intimidating to the new player but the resources and community available at ****/board/ will set anyone on the right track. If you have a question just ask. What type of baseball do you like? Current day, check. Historical, check Fictional, check. Fantasy, check. International, check. Relegation league, check. Multiply the above with hundreds of online leagues and you have virtually no limits on the baseball universe you can create. OOTP is a sports management sim. Graphics may be part of the game going forward. They are certainly not required to enjoy the game in its current skin. Be prepared for total immersion.. The best baseball simulation on the market. Out of the Park Baseball gives you the flexibility to play the game how you want, from replaying history, replaying history, setting up your ideal fictional universe, or even creating a tournament of all-time great teams. A great community with useful mods, and a development team that cares is a big plus. My favorite new feature in version 13 is the random debut feature, which allows players to import into your universe randomly and adds to the already tremendous replay value.. If you want graphics, buy a PS3 or XBOX game. If you want to be immersed in a baseball world -- real or fiction -- in a way you can't find anywhere else, go with OOTP. The endless information in the game, the realistic GM experience and the countless possibilities for both fictional and real-life worlds make this the only text-sim baseball game you should play.. OOTP doesn't do everything I'd like it to do, but it does do most of what I would like it to do (e.g. the ability to create your own fictional worlds, industry-leading customizeability, challenging online leagues). And, except for maybe the Civilization franchise, I probably play and get more out of OOTP than any other video game. It's not there yet, but every year OOTP gets me a little bit closer to gaming Nirvana. Thanks, OOTP! :). You have to be awfully short-sighted to not only negatively review a game the quality of OOTP, but to give it a 0 rating (signifying that it has zero redeemable value). Gross overreaction like that provides no value whatsoever to those looking for usable insight into the game. It comes across as nothing but immature axe grinding. OOTP does not provide a graphics engine, nor does it need it. Would it be a nice addition? Yes, but the lack of does not in any way diminish the quality of every other aspect it provides.. This is the game I have been waiting for all my life! I can bring all my childhood favorites back and never let them go. This game is a gift from above.. My favorite thing about this game is (1) the customization available, and (2) the support of the community. It's your game, and you can play it the way that you want to, and if you're looking for something in particular, you can find it on the user forums. It's not going to impress the video game crowd, but after growing up with Strat-o-Matic, APBA, Earl Weaver Baseball, and SherCo, it's a dream come true.. I have played OOTP baseball since version 3. It gives me by far the most ""bang for the buck"" than any other computer/video game I've ever owned. If you are a baseball fan, do yourself a favor and at least give the demo a try.. This is the best baseball simulation out on the market today , its up to date . it has something for everyone. i played baseball mogul for years till i found this game and baseball mogul just **** in comparison to OOTP. . in ootp u have a lot more freedom to create ur type of game . baseball mogul is so limited everywhere . ootp is making strides every version and now even has is to where u can broadcast ur sim on ur website. u can use any of the thousands of mods out there for ootp or make ur own . if ur a big baseball guy u have to get ootp as their is no substitute for this game .i think everyone wants a graphics engine in ootp and there will be one but do u want them to get it right or half ass it and just throw something out there? i mean if u are gonna do it u do it right so i know ootp is doing the right thing and waiting to have the funds to hire a great guy to do the graphics engine . the price is great if u want the best game and besides that they always have like a 10 dollars off sale all the time so i mean if u buy it then most of the time ull get it for even a greater price . but really this game is the best baseball simulation money can buy hands down the best. OOTP 13 is a fantastic game. It's a great successor to the previous year's title and includes numerous additional features (association leagues is my favorite).. This game has endless replay value. The number of different ways it can be played is only limited by your imagination. The slick interface is more intuitive than ever. Fictional, historical, hybrid, ""what if"" -- the possibilities are endless! Best money you'll ever spend on a computer game!. Ideal game for experienced and detail-oriented gamers. Requires effort to create and manage, but great support from the best modder community in the world, combined with great customer service and development support makes it all worth the effort. The game does not need a graphics engine because it is not a toy. This may turn off younger gamers, but so be it. Great for replays and fictional.. Have to agree with Helm123 after so many years of the same old crap you'd think he'd up the graphics of the game to at least something like MicroLeague Baseball animations. I'm sick of READING text myself. I want to see more than just a stupid softball roll out into the field and it's not even accurate of what the text says happen. My money is going to Baseball Mogul 2013 because at least it has some animations and you get a little of the feeling of being there. APBA baseball was fun in its day because it has BROADCASTING and that would be an improvement to this game as well. Take it from me it's just not worth $39.95 every year just to get an upgrade to the HTML performance and a new lineup card. He's just milking the donkey now and you also and you're just not getting $39.95 worth if you have a lesser year version to at least 2007.. Same old tired graphics as the years before. Can't believe it's 2012 and we're still reading endless lines of text. At least now when I need my sports simulation fix I can fire up Football Manager and at least visualize the outcome of the game.","this is a simulation game, not as a live action sports type game . i would give this game a 10 but still think there is room for improvement . i have yet to see any set of stats or results generated from it that has looked unrealistic ."
"1,150.Nioh: Bloodshed's End","An incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo. This game has a lot to offer: - Durability: You can spend a lot of hours by completing the campaign which is huge with plenty submissions and is very challenging. - The possibilities to build your character are incredible huge.. greater game ever made. fantastic combat and story. Great graphic and map queality. Best souls like ever made.. It's great. It's the best game I've ever seen. The picture is exquisite, the movement is smooth, and the design is exquisite.. Incredible. Like the base game before it, this is Nioh at its very best. Phenomenal boss fights, a badass tip of the hat to Ninja Gaiden fans, this DLC has it all. Casuls need not apply however.. This DLC is my favourite one in Nioh by far. There is a perfectly named final difficulty introduced. There is an abyss mode for endless difficulty for anyone into that. There is no new weapon type but I can't think of anything missing here. The best part was the story where you see how parts of Japanese history materialized and a nostalgic closure for many characters in the series. Nioh got the ending it deserved in an epic and fantastic farewell!.

"1,151.Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition","I just finished the main campaign and left a lot of side content behind, but there’s a mode (no spoilers) where you can do the side quests after finishing the campaign, so that’s fine. But talking about the main story... for me, the story of FF XV is about loss, sacrifices, and learning to keep going, no matter what it costs. It’s a spectacular game, and I truly understand the criticism the game got when it was first released, about how it felt incomplete in parts... To really understand the game, you have to watch a movie that comes before the game, an anime that tells the story before the movie, and you had to play the demo, which is no longer available. Can you play the game without these? Yes, sometimes the player might feel a bit lost, but it’s okay... Square tried to do something different in this game, an expanded universe, and that’s fine. Did they succeed 100%? No, but they tried to do something with their biggest IP, and that’s fair. I loved FF XV and I’ll continue to platinum it. I want to see more about it, and usually it goes for 50 reais during sales, and I highly recommend it. It’s worth the 50 reais. I finished it in 30 hours of gameplay, but I can easily take it to around 100 hours to platinum it, so I definitely recommend it for 50 reais. When I get around to doing the rest of the game, I’ll update the review.. I love this game! From the very beginning it hooked me with its pleasant visuals and fantastic music. The cover of the song Stand by Me by Florence and the Machine will now make me feel pleasantly sad.. Final Fantasy XV was the best journey I ever had with a video game. The storyline was amazing, the bond between the 4 main characters (Noctis, Gladio, Ignis, and Prompto) is very strong, depicting an incredible everlasting friendship. That in my opinion is what makes the game worth the time as I am, to this day, a strong admirer of their friendship and I even sometimes wish I had that type of friends. The game, compared to the launch day, has improved quite a lot in the technical aspect, so it is the best time to give it a try again.. A pretentious hipster Boyband pushing a car through the desert and hold-X-button-to-win combat is not my idea of Final Fantasy. This game is by far the worst mainline Final Fantasy. It is actually so bad, that it ruined Square Enix's reputation and almost destroyed the Final Fantasy franchise.. Its a very surprising and magic game. FFXV is very underrated. It can be slow at the start but it picks up. Its weakest aspect by far is story. Its not necessarily bad but it was told the worst way possible, often leaving you confused with whats happening. But what saves it is the characters, all of them are really good, fun and surprisingly likeable. Interactions are fun, they are filled with charm and uniqueness and it never disappoints to watch them. Gameplay is fun. Combat can be surpisingly complex despite what it seems at first glance, it has some layer of complexity and the weapons are fun and varied. You can also control the other characters, having each a very unique playstyle that satisfies variety in combat. Side quests are pretty repetitive unfortunately, although at times it can be fun, it throws off the experience. Driving is disappointing. And the last act of the game ruins everything that was good to begin with in the gameplay. What i like this game most is honestly its magic. OST is beautiful walking in each town with each a new theme thats wonderfully made is an experience. Exploring with the characters seeing how they interact. Taking things slow to camp, fish and hunt. Watching the characters just be, with a lot of interactions, secrets and fun dialogue, followed by on point voice acting. Driving mechanics are disappointing but just going by some places and sightseeing, watching the group mess around in the car and relaxing. Perplexing boss fights. Riding you chocobo. Its a game that i can describe just magical, with flaws (and some very bad) but often wonderful.. A very special game close to my heart as it's my first FF. I love the story although I felt it could be told better. Love the open world, except it can felt a bit empty and chapter 13 onwards felt like it fell off a bit, but it made me teared a lot at the end.. Amazing graphics and deep story and character development in a lovely rendered open world as you can expect from FF games. Sadly the combat mechanics are mediocre and the open world side quests are repetitive and offer little challenge and sadly don't progress the story. Additionally a lot of the items obtained in the course of the game seem to have little use. Could have been so much more engaging.. i don't even like this game that much because it's not turnBASED, but i respect that it's my friend's favorite game and he was right about everything and won and made me realize to never trust larrys.. Despite the valid criticisms of FFXV, the game's world is impossible not to love.. Good gameplay, great characters, but terrible rambling story. The combat system looks interesting at first glance, but in reality it is primitive and boring. Bring back the combat system like in the old games in the series, such as 8-10.. This game has become something personal for me, I really like this feeling of road adventure and this bond between the main four characters. Words cannot describe the feeling when you are just chilling in Regalia or just running around the location to amazing music from Yoko Shimomura.. What can I say, it's better than the other tedious Final Fantasy titles with a more well rounded, humane main cast. As an RPG there's tons of content to keep me busy. Really one of the games I couldn't miss out on.. Better than the 1/10 PS4 version I stumbled across, but still bad. I just held O and it felt like I was watching a YouTube video. It makes me sad to learn that Tabata was fired for this game :(. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Loved every second with the boys on an epic road trip. Been playing final fantasy since 97, and this game is definitely in my top five!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best Final Fantasy games today. Yes, FF15 ending is awesome. And the whole game is filled of interesting and charming stuff to discover. Surely a must play for Final Fantasy fans, and one of my favorite open world games. I hate to say this, but the game ended a fantastic story with a mediocre ending. And the supposed real ending DLC is cancelled instead we can buy the book which is supposed to be the cannon ending DLC. The gaming experiences are great, but not extraordinary. However, it is a must-play FF game in my opinion.. A masterpiece of the franchise and in the genre. The music, the graphics, the deep personality of characters and story... are all top-notch. The combat and gameplay MAY BE a niche, MAY BE not what a lng time franchise fan expect it to be, but it don't fall short in terms of fun, fluidity and difficulty. The character development and personalities are very well placed, even when they are inconvenient or over the top, it seems like it was intended. 10/10 game.. I dislike the first part of the game, focused on spending time on a rail-roaded car in a simple open world with slow pacing and boring secondary missions. Gameplay wise it is not too fun and it depends completely on warping and AI aggressiveness doesn't let you act very freely. The skill tree requires too much grinding and if you focus on primaries you end up with very few abilities. As other FF, sponges everywhere (god I hate infinite health bars). I'd recommend playing on easy if you want to focus on primaries/main story and avoid excessive difficulty due to lack of grinding secondaries and facing even more ominous sponges.After this first open world part, the game falls back to a more typical rail roaded experience, which I actually prefer and think makes the game shine more. Story and character development get a boost and become the main focus. The game improves a lot in this second part though it is still tied to the same gameplay and some repetition. Music is amazing, cinematics are top tier and visuals/facials help transmit emotions properly. I'd give a good review to the base **** problem with FF15 comes down to its dependency on other content, including transmedia. First, the DLCS (Episode of...) add a lot of story and background to the characters which really improve on the base game. Each episode has special gameplay for the character you control. For me, the ideal FF15 base game would have had this DLCS from the start, placed chronologically in the main story. Also, I would have followed the FF7 remake gameplay idea of swapping between the different characters in combat and combining the different gameplay of the characters.Then we have the Kingslaive film, which is amazing and a true gift to fans. It acts as a prologue to the game and helps complete the **** story and further develop other characters. The game was also accompanied by a 5 episode short anime series which shines some light on the 4 main friends background.When considering FF15 as the combination of base game + DLCS + Film + Anime it turns out into an amazing piece of entertainment. The story/characters/lore/cinematics/music of all these combined are a feat to reckon. So I'd recommend anyone to give the universe a chance and not stick to the base game. If you go for the whole product, it is great!. A stunning open world game and a really amazing action jrpg. I've enjoyed every single minute of my exploration of the ff15 world, and this thanks to the enjoyable and charismatic party, Ignis, Gladio, Prompto and Noctis. And also thanks to the gorgeous OST. A pretty amazing experience that I'm happy to have experienced for myself. Right, that's the weakest FF game I have played. The camera during fighting is horrible. The fight is so casual and lacks so much. The story is kind of ok at some point it doesn't make sense at all. The texture loading is poor and glitchy. Not too many weapons for an open-world game. The first 15 hours are boring as hell. I'm giving 3☆ just because I'm a fan of FF. But that game is a disaster. Not close to FF7, FF-X, X-2.. A truly great introductory for getting me into the series and honestly one of the first Games I've ever platinumed. fans hated on this when it released. Mostly because it was different. The game basically plays out where you do some of the main story, but ALL of the side quests in the early and mid game. Late game is about the story. There is no ""saving at the end boss"" and then running around back through all the planet to do a bunch of end game boss fights or power ups. People didn't know how to handle this at release. It was a vast departure from previous entries. The cast is good. The characters are endearing. The ending beats you over the head without mercy. There is a ton to make you laugh and think of good times. bad things happen that you don't want to. All part of excellent story telling. Combat is fast and easy to learn, hard to master. Some of the experiances in the game are something you can only experiance, and not really describe. Like the chocobo farm. will replay this game periodically. One of the most gorgeous games I've played. The story is truly enjoyable and the characters grows with me in this adventure. The fun gameplay and the spectacular soundtrack makes the whole thing worth it. My feelings for this game really mixed. Overall it's a good game with interesting ideas, gorgeous graphics and a fantastic **** I don't think all the ideas are not well implemented. The beginning was fine and I loved everything but the more you progress the worse it got for me. At the end I just wanted to finish the game and after that I had no more motivation to keep playing the game for the platinum trophy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first 10 chapters were really amazing! Final fantasy XV gave me such an amazing sense of adventure, camping in the wild, making photos of funny things, driving regalia across the region and stopping by the stations to reffil the back or to get some new memories! That part was so well done, so refreshing and brilliant idea! But unfortunately after some time things changed and this game started to bore me so much that I honestly struggled to finish it... And I'm glad that I'm finished it becomes the ending was really great! Story of FF XV is really good as well as the graphic! But such things as unnecessary change of pace after some events of story, just dull and boring side quests, useless AI of companions, enemies with way to long health bar, inability make a summon at any time, and many other small things are making this game somewhat unpolished. But after all I really enjoyed my time with this game.. Final Fantasy XV gave me a magical feel. I loved the beautiful open world, just exploring it and discover new places. Four guys on a roadtrip and their great friendship is what truly makes the game for me. Now with the Royal edition (or Windows editon, I have played both) most of the bugs are fixed, some stories are added and if you play the DLC's too the story feels more complete. I will still recomment watching the Kingsglaive movie and the Brotherhood anime series to fully understand the story. All in all the Royal edition of the game is an amazing game in my humble opinion.. Rich, beautiful open world game with a simple but very beautiful story.I particularly love the fast gameplay and the magnificent music of the game, honestly the most spectacular of the entire series. I explored with my chocobo discovering magnificent landscapes and exploring ice caves and lava-filled volcanoes. A sensational adventure that was able to give me many emotions, and for this reason I can easily consider it my favorite Final Fantasy. If you're looking for a charming open world game, with a pretty cool story and a really epic Lore, than Final Fantasy 15 is what you should play for sure. A game with an outstanding OST, a great gameplay with a lot of equipments options, and amazing dungeons to explore. All unique qualities that I love to see in good action jrpg games, and after having played many of them, I'm not exaggerating when I say that this it was a truly amazing surprise for me. And I'm definitely happy to have played it, and enjoyed it, for more than 230 hours. A port that fixes a few issues with one of the worst Final Fantasy games but unfortunately not enough. It is still messy and incomplete despite the hobbled together patchwork nature of this release, the combat continues to be clunky and as dull as dishwater. If you are looking for an aimless open world game with very little to see and do other than fetch quests and fishing, then this is the game for you.. ok game, finished it on steam, i enjoyed the open world, would recommend to play. I like this game so much that I want to give it a higher score than this. Unfortunately, the game is held back by bad decisions made by Square-Enix, like cutting content to put it under a paywall. Even if you have all the DLC's, the experience feels fragmented. Flaws aside, the gameplay is really good (but not the QTE's and magic grenades), and the story is awesome and very emotional.. Superb modern take on final fantasy. This world lives, and the characters are original, not like the boring mess that is 16.. Looking back at the entire Final Fantasy 15 project, I think overall a great job has been done by the Luminous Production team. If you love openworld games and Action JRPG games, then you're gonna love playing this FF15 too. Since it has fast and fun gameplay (especially if you master all the different approaches of the different weapons), a wonderful world to explore with the Chocobo or the Regalia and with amazing dungeons to discover, a Godtier OST, cute minigames, a very charismatic villain, very characterized main cast of characters, a simple but very epic story, in particular so if you have the patience to follow the entire multimedia story of the game, an exceptional art design. Considered as the narrative universe of FF15 is one of the largest and most ambitious made within the franchise, comparable in size and ambition only to the FF7 Compilation, the result obtained with Final Fantasy 15 was able to fully satisfy me. Especially in the great Lore built for the game. Certainly a game that I can safely recommend to lovers of the genre, and also to fans of Final Fantasy games. It's definitely a worthy entry in the series. the game overall is pretty ok BUT... the endgame of it is so terrble and boring... pls just why square.. WHY ?? first 25% of it are like a 7-8 out of ten next 40% more like 8-9 out of ten ... really awesome open world feeling and last like 20-30% are so boring, lame and stupid.. it just makes no fun and sense at all 2-3 out of ten at most. I don't really know how to start this review... I don't even know what rating I'm going to give to this game, because Final Fantasy XV is such a complicated experience. As a videogame, it's a big mess, I honestly didn't enjoy the Open World aspect, while the world looks gorgeous, there's not enough quality content in it, the driving mechanics are questionable, the gameplay is easy with very simple mechanics, and the side quests are generic, but the very charming cast of characters kept me intrigued. The story starts nice but gets uninteresting after the first hour, it feels like the story is absent for a big part of the game but fortunately it picks up later on, and that's a shame because it's a such a beautiful story, just very poorly written. There's a certain point halfway through the story where the game becomes linear and focuses on the narrative, and I really liked that because the Open World just doesn't work very well. There's a lot of action and some challenging boss fights in the second half of the game, and all that leads to the final chapter, which is one of the best sequences I've ever played, and the ending is one the BEST things I've ever experienced! The soundtrack is phenomenal as expected, one of my favorite soundtracks ever, it really compliments the game and its key moments. Overall Final Fantasy XV is such a terrible videogame but surprisingly enough an exceptional one as well, there are so many flaws while at the same time it manages to surpass the player's expectations in such a unique way, and that is exactly what makes it so good for me. I love this game, It's a very interesting and rewarding experience despite its very obvious flaws. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Final Fantasy is a turn game franchise, but Final Fantasy XV changed it. I liked FFXV's battle mechanics. Very dynamic and frenetic. I already have liked The Final Fantasy XII's battle mechanics, so it was an improvement. The gameplay throughout the game is ok. The graphics are good, in particular the facial animations (none of ""my face is tired"" thing). The landscape is very beautiful. The soundtrack is incredible (as in almost every Final Fantasy). Noctis' relationship with his friends is enjoyable, but sometimes it gets a little repetitive, the same lines of dialogues etc. Nevertheless, the game has its ups and downs. It takes time to really begin. The exploration at the beginning is ok, but after awhile, it gets dull and extremely boring. You don't have much to do in the world. The side quests are AWFUL (as in almost every Final Fantasy), I don't want to move in circles searching for yellow frogs, it's ridiculous. The driving is awful as well, very boring, at least you have fast travel. The main story is not so good, but the final battle and the end of the game are awesome, it helped to increase my score on this game. However, some segments in the main story are dull, very linear without a lot things to do (linearity is not bad, if made it right is good), but in this game isn't good. What saved this game was the willing to see the end and the battle mechanics (with an awesome soundtrack). Unfortunately, I forced to finish this game because I really wanted to see the end, the side quests and the car segments are very boring and I almost stopped playing. The game is not a masterpiece, it has its flaws, but playable.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Great environment, the bond between the main characters is beautiful, the combat is fun if you know how to play , camping and photos make eos a comfortable place.. Wow. I forgot just how much I loved XV. This game is unbelievably good. The soundtrack is easily my favorite in the series, but with Yoko Shimomura at the helm, that's not surprising. I've discovered a whole lot more depth to the combat of this game, especially after playing through all of the DLCs and getting to use different movesets. The Royal Edition is one of my favorite games of all time. Of course, I still have problems with the game, but they're so minimal compared to what I love about it. This game is one of a kind.. I couldn't finish this game. After falling in love with FF7, I imagine this one at least would be cool, but I was wrong. Firstly, even with a good premise, the story just doesn't get you. Most of it, with my eight hours of gameplay, was told by boring flashback cutscenes. The dialog doesn't help much, mostly cuz the characters weren't interesting enough. If the gameplay was good, I'd beat it, but it's not. I had to play it on my keyboard because the game doesn't recognize the DualSense or Xbox Controller - And even if it recognizes, it is not smooth at all. Block, attack, run, and use ""powers"" feels so strange and the combo with your companions feels gimmick. Another thing that got me pissed was the car. You use it many times and it is boring asf. Either driving or not. All of it is bad. There is no even point to detail it. The open world isn't inviting also. Anyway, I hope the other FFs are better like FF7.. Dear god why didn't you create me as a 'Japanese'... World is awesome, gampelay is sometimes hard but, it's ok.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and excellent graphic and good music and good daY. There was still some threads left unfinished, which I hope one day they can come back and revisit as a remake, in similar fashion to FF7-Remake. The rpg action was decent, almost on the level of kingdom hearts. The story was even more fascinating, despite how depressing it was, but it went somewhat unfinished because it was suppose to have multiple endings.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. One of the best Games I have ever played. Very gorgeous world, Beautiful story, great character design, and gameplay. The music is a masterpiece. I have been listening to it since I played this game. 10/10. Overall unfortunately a waste of potential in its current state. Still I will keep this game in mind and hope for a proper remake at some point in the future because I really appreciate its great ambitions that were unfortunately left unfulfilled to a degree that made this title a bad experience to actually play. I think a proper remake of this game could actually be a great FF game with a mature tone. I could only really enjoy the music - everything else (story, characters, gameplay) had (too) high ambitions but ultimately lacks ""soul"" and depht and on top there are huge optimization problems with this game. There was a lot of potential in the story but the first 2/3 of the game feels cheesy like it was aimed at a very young audience who might prefer blunt storytelling and plain characters. Also I hate the K-Pop aesthetics which made the main characters look extremely unappealing and unrelatable to me. Ultimately what killed this game for me was the bad optimization/port and that they filled the game with useless/boring quests, mechanics and an open world that didn't add anything fun or interesting to the game instead of focusing on a set of core principles that could actually carry the game to be excellent (story, pacing, gameplay, optimization etc). What baffles me is why this game would receive so much praise, when it's gameplay, pacing, character interaction etc still needs so much work and the first 2/3 of the game are just very annoying. From what I could gather from the reviewers I noticed there seems to be a kind of group of accounts that keep pushing very high user reviews to the top of this list and downvotes low score reviews (for whatever reason that is beyond me). Also I can see some reviewers being emotionally captured by the ending/final parts of the game that apparently inspired some strong emotions in some people and I can respect that. However I feel like it's not enough to judge a game by its ending. This is not a movie. You play this game for a very long time some might hit a triple digit of hours played) and for me it's quite relevant, wether this time is spent in an enjoyable way and FF XV is not delivering on that front. What it does have is a nice antagonist and a really interesting storyline underneath a very rough skin. But I dont think this is nearly enough to give a game a 9 or a 10. I strongly recommend to look at the FF VII remake instead, if you want a properly crafted, current gen FF experience, that actually makes sense to play. When playing FF XV I kept getting the strong impression that random popular stuff was just meshed together (generic quests, empty open world, stealth etc) and it lacked direction and purpose because there was no proper focus on what should be a defining strength of this game. I think a Final Fantasy game should bring a good focus on story and characters and I feel like most of the game this didn't work out.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fifteenth game in the series.. I'm currently FF VII Remake and I'm loving more and more FF XV, this one is faster, more emotional, the music simply wow, it's true that in the second part you feel that all was in a hurry, but still, what a bunch of epic moment, also I don't understand how people can say that FF VII Remake looks better, FF XV is far far above in graphics. After 40 hours I find FF VII Remake boring and I have no interest in finishing it, I spent 71 hours for FF XV and there were not enough.. GOOD + Excellent Storyline + Exciting fighting + Excellent Level design + Very Good Soundtrack + Beautiful art design + Too many Weapons + Chocoobo BAD - Driving - Short Storyline. So finaly i got and played it to the ending and now i can finaly say this is the worst final fantasy game i have ever played.. Awesome and engaging, fun battle system but hard to got the point at the beginning, also the best post-game content I play recently, more challenging than most of the game that in general is pretty easy. good open world!!!!!! but they are a big default after The chapter 8 the storytelling is to quickly.. It is not the best of the saga but it is a good game for new and veteran players. It tries to innovate and cover a lot -apart from the fact that its development was eternal- and that ends up weighing it down. Its story at times feels a bit disconnected or poorly directed, but when it manages to get it on track it works quite well. Despite what you might expect, you get quite attached to the group, the landscape, its fauna and its conflicts. The combat system is pretty good although again the camera shines for doing whatever it wants. The music is never out of place and has silly little details like food, sleeping and the main characters' hobbies, which has its charm. I can't say it's a guaranteed purchase, but I had a pretty good time, despite having cancelled content and a bit of DLC abuse. At least it delivers on its introductory message, and even though it doesn't claim its throne in the JRPG world, it's not a bad game in the genre and a step forward for Square Enix, which had become somewhat stagnant after FF XIII.. Great game. I enjoyed everything about this game. The story could have been better.. Amazing story and amazing characters but a little bit boring gameplay, i love 50%. It's like a semi-finished product. The ending is too bad. The operation effect of PC version is also poor.. The combat is shallow and repetitive with an annoying lock on that only gets in the way, even visually. You literally just need to hoard potions to be invincible, i only fought enemies that were 20+ levels higher than myself because i hate grinding and never died or had any difficulty, you probably can get stuck later on if you run out of items. Magic works like itens, its kinda cool but very limited. The summons are automatic and only happen when they damn well please which is almost never LMAO Yet one could argue its the best combat in any FF game, and they wouldnt be wrong, anything is better than the old lazy turn based trash. Its extremely linear and at first uses a self driving car to bore you to death, 2/3 into the main story its replaced by a train which is literally the same thing dropping the half assed pretense of being ""open world"". They really went to some pathetic lengths to try to make the game longer artificially but its pretty short anyways, like 10 to 15 hours if you dont bother with the errand boy side quests. The story has a lot of logic flaws, its not better than IX, VII and even X, the villain is uninteresting and the best he does is pull a move already done in the franchise. The brotherhood stuff and emotional manipulation they aimed for could have worked if the game was actually good, open world and felt like a journey which it doesnt in the least. The music is great, some custcenes are beautiful, the characters are all wasted on a bad game, these are the reasons my score isnt even lower.. I'm not usually give the highest score but need to balance these selfish low points. Honestly, this game is a masterpiece with it's ""Lore, Soundtracks, Gameplay and Movie"". I know game itself make us feel a bit depressive but what reality make us to feel and this game is exactly success it! There is not always everything must have happiness.. Spectacular action game, with an incredible unique open world to explore. A living world, full of wonderful creatures and incredible dungeons to explore. Cool gameplay, amazing ost, and an emotional story full of epic characters and Summons, made this game a true gem. If you love action jrpg games, this is a must play. ""Final Fantasy 15"" has defects and chapter problems, but it is quite good as a game, but it can't match the name of ""Final Fantasy"". If you want to wear a crown, you must bear its weight. Review of ""Final Fantasy XV"" Graphic/Art: 10 Music/Sounds: 9 Narrative/Performance:7 (-0.2) Gameplay: 7 Score: 7.8 (-0.5). A fast-paced and high-impact action game, with a very simple plot but that manages to give great emotions. I have hardly found other games that have given me the same emotions that the exceptional ending of this Final Fantasy XV gave me. Having played many action games in my videogamer career, I can certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great action jrpg experience.. A wonderful and incredible open world game! Amazing soundtrack, fun gameplay, an epic Lore like the souls games, and a truly beautiful world. I love open world game like this. You should play it. Because it's a must play. There is so much wrong with this game that I want to get the few good things out of the way first. The music is fantastic, as to be expected from a Final Fantasy title. The visuals are also very impressive. Square Enix has really mastered the art of presentation, and XV is no exception to that. That's where the good ends though. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING else about this game is pure trash. I won't mention any story spoilers, but let's just say that there's a lot of empty setup for no r","i finished the main campaign and left a lot of side content behind . but there’s a mode (no spoilers) where you can do the side quests after finishing the campaign, so that’s fine . to really understand the game, you have to watch a movie that comes before the game and an anime that tells the story before the movie ."
"1,153.Rocket League","full of little **** **** and the matchamaking is even worse dont waste your time. Rocket league is ass they banned me for getting swearing us some kid for a good reason cuz he was running back to me and now I got champion and he didn't I can't play Rocket League a week so don't play the game because epic games got all family friendly play cod where you can actually swear. This game used to be so fun until epic games was the owner of rocket league, everything is so expensive in game and my ranked teamates are actually horrible. it’s almost unplayable at times because I have a terrible teamate and you guys still haven’t fixed the laggy servers. Epic games stop being lazy and fix the game instead of constantly taking peoples money and not caring about that game. Everybody whishes you guys would have never bought it from phsyonix because it was such a fun competitive game **** to see it turn out like fortnite.. I am so tired of getting teammates that do absolutely NOTHING. The matchmaking is this game is a joke. I get put with someone who refuses to play the game on a regular basis. And to top itoff the people Im playing against should be ranked way higher than they are and I get bullied in matches because the matchmaking is soooo bad. 2v1 on a regular basis cause my teammates do nothing can’t even leave the match. Because if I do then I’m the one who suffers. My teammate will just go into the next match and do the same thing all over again. **** the prices for this thing are ridiculous. 30 dollars per car in game? Really? Yall are horrible people. Sell back to original owners. The game was actually fun then.. Masterpiece of soccer games! The only problem is that they removed trading, it was almost the game heart!. I used to love this game; it had the touch **** competitive environment with a great community. Now, I feel like they want to squeeze every penny out of our pockets. It's no longer a competitive game, it's a casual game like Fortnite. I don't think the game will ever return to what it was, and the idea of spending money to get things in Fortnite—god, it's a game for kids. I'm not going to spend money on that.. It's bad. Maybe even terrible. The community is so toxic and bad, gameplay's repetitive. Those little kids leaving the match after losing makes the game really unplayable. The matchmaking is horrible, as you get placed in a high rank lobby and it's frustrating. And you can't leave, because you'll get banned. Also, it's so hard for newcomers to play this game, to learn all the basics. Although there are some good things about this game. A great aspect of Rocket League is its fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action. Matches are quick, intense, and full of excitement, with constant scoring opportunities, last-second saves, and dramatic comebacks. The gameplay keeps players on the edge of their seat, offering an engaging and dynamic experience where every match feels fresh and thrilling, whether you're playing casually or competitively. The energy of the game makes it incredibly fun to watch and play, with moments of pure excitement happening every few minutes. That helps the sorry state of this horrible game.. it is si fun comp at the extra modes are kinda fun and epic hasen't sold the gamelike fortnite. Have over 2500 hours played on this game since 2016. It is a good time to play with friends, but solo-queueing is a recipe for disaster. Online is toxic, smurfs are everywhere and matchmaking feels broken. After having invested so much time into this game it is time to hang it up, but enter at your own risk and know that once you start to learn the game you'll never want to stop. Best of luck and thank you to Rocket League for 8 long years of play.. very bad game should have never removed trading and you lose rank when your teamate disconnects which is so ass please fix your trash game. Just like every competitive game, the community is toxic. The worst part is how they did not update this game in a meaningful way for years. But still, among all competitive games, this one is the best. If it was 2016, this game was a 10/10.. Stupid game teammates always absolutely terrible and I have to carry but never works. Over hyped, over played. Idk why rocket league is still even around in 2024. It got stale in the first year of it's release and hasn't done much since then. I guess soccer fans will litterally play any soccer game to death reguardless of it's quality. Completely garbage can't even leave a game without getting banned needs to be fixed ASAP and conceding should only take 2 out of 3 votes especially when that 3rd is the one throwing please fix these problems. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. not as fun as FIFA, doesn't have the analogue of FIFA Ultimate Team, some tricks are super hard to learn, players are rude and not always smart, so there's no that ""build a team from scratch"" type of joy, but the gameplay is really dynamic and fun. As long as you can learn, it's packed with action. Car's that play soccer, so simple and so surprisingly fun. Also, the soundtrack for this game slaps so hard.. Two biggest facts....Game is full of only toxic people (like high school football in a small town) kinda of toxic. Game punishes you for sticking up for yourself. Banned for 5-30 mins at a time. You play 2v2 and have no teammate. They never move. 3 mins in the score is 10 to 0. I abonden match and get banned for 30 mins for leaving my teammate....That never moved an inch or ever played. Game is boring and made for toxic people to rage on. Avoid. Again its boring. Knock the same ball into the same goal. Over and over again. Numbs the brain I guess?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is so much fun to play. I have played it for the past 6 years of my life and it is super fun! There are so many great things to do in this game. You can play alone, or with up to 3 other players. You can play with both bots and players and get tons of rewards. Car bodies, decals, boosts, goal explosions, trails, toppers, flags, anthems and so many other things. There is more than just soccer. You can play hoops, hockey, dropshot and rumble! Play all these different modes in tournaments too! Are you away from home? It's ok! Because Epic and Psyonix made a mobile version called Rocket League Sideswipe. You even get XP bonuses by playing both. I love Rocket League and never want to leave. This is why I love Rocket League.. One of the best learning curves in gaming, free game, fun grinding ranked by yourself or squading up with friends.. This one of the best games with cars. The one major problem of this whole game is that the servers are so bad, I can't tell you how many times I have lost due to the servers being hot garbage where I live. Pls fix your servers. The gameplays is very nice and if you try hard enough it can be extremly enjoyable. Has a hard stuck Diamond 3 I think there is to many wash up players that are 2 to3 levels above me im facing in 1s, that is just not fair for me. It is hard to improve, I've about 560 hours on this game yet for 150 of them i've just been in the same rank. So please add more high mid ranks that are only 2 levels not 3, so they don't take so long to level up to a higher rank. With having more ranks you can be more precise in the competion. In my opion you can't get better at a game from facing a person way out of my league, I can get better from me better then me like a champ 1 or 2, has help me improve my games in 2s, I think this game is great. and bad both ways.. okay game with terrible netcode on horrible servers with low tick rate. bad developers. bad matchmaking. game is not being developed. they are just milking it for mtx and battle passes.. it's a very good game very interesting and it' better if you play it with your friends but if youplay alone it's still very good. I'm just writing this becauso of the community, it is one of the worst i've been, like in 1 to 3 matches theres a troll and then when i report they don't give a damn about it, it also was good before epic bought it. Rocket league has always been very satisfying and rewarding. You’re never bored. It’s all very difficult to get good at the game. It teaches you a lot of lessons on how to play with others and work on your skills. Great work!. Developers killed the game, it used to be fun but its been 3 years since a major update. Trading was removed, that was a big part of the community and it seems like epic games/psyonix only wants money and nothing else. Horrible ranked system filled with smurfs and boosted accounts, the only good thing about the game is how complicated it is at first. When you start to learn the game it becomes more boring and frustrating, without any meaningful updates the game ****.. Biggest piece of dog shi t i have seen in a long time this game failed, not fun, just boring, the makers are useless. Good game with a good idea. I don’t remember under what circumstances I met her. What I do know is that it was 2019 and I only played it with friends back then and then deleted it. But then I grew up and in 2023 I decided to try my luck again. I liked the game, I stuck with it for a long time, if you learn to play well it will give you a feeling of euphoria. For example: Extra time in a match, the score is 2-2, the opponents are launching a dangerous attack, the goal is empty, it would seem that everything is lost. But then you appear, make a brilliant save and begin your counterattack, after which you score, for this you can already give 7 points, the idea itself is original, I have never seen anything like it anywhere else. You can add one point for this. Next come parameters such as graphics, etc. Nothing surprising, but it is kept at a good level, this is something that should go into the core of the game. But for 2023 this is rather weak, there will be no advantage in this. Now about the support - the community (please fix it), that's all.. Addictive gameplay, lazy developers. It was better when it first came out. Now, everytime I start it, I feel like developers are trying to milk me.. what a save! what a game! ilike it and it is for free great 9/10 (i only have 300 hours). I played this game since the name itself was ""SuperSonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars"", so yes,a long time ago. best game of all time. such a good game but the changes epic is making **** ass. One of the few online games I liked to play and platinum. Gameplay is fun and accessible for new players. There a lot of pro players, but you can play with casual players. I spend +100h in this game, after the platinum and 100% I continue playing because is a very good game!. While it is a great game, which I would give it a 10/10, but the player-to-player trading removal announcement basically ruined it for me. But the main part of why I quit this game is because I got so aggregated of losing to dumb teammates or toxic opponents, and no matter how long or how much I've tried to cope with getting better at this game when playing competetively, I just can't handle it anymore; too much stress, frustration, anger and more that this game has built up for me since I started playing back in 2019, before free-to-play. Not to mention smurfing, why tf has that not been fixed yet??? Yet you're removing trading, a huge part of this game's casual and trading community?????? I thought I could trust you Epic and Psyonix, and I'm sorry for whatever the lords of Epic Games has done to you Psyonix but you're the one that agreed to give yourself to them, so you're also the culprit in this case. I used to love this game, but now it's going down the EA route, lack of actual content from updates, lack of fixing the highly-requested matchmaking issues and the removing of crucial features with a huge lack of proper reasoning, I have officially quit Rocket League forever. Long story short, this game has been ruined by greed. The game alone is great, but the state of it is today, it's a solid 5/10.. Very enjoyable game. It is basically football but instead of humans there are cars.. never really play the game, but when I go to friends' houses they enjoy it, I play it to connect with friends the real high point of this.. Games are rigged which really destroys what is otherwise a fun game Rigged??? Generally the following are obviously used to handicap players and/or drive outcomes: Cars slowed at critical moments Car turning radius is reduced Boost consumed significantly faster Shots altered dramatically Shots angle off wall in impossible directions Ball speed off car reduced significantly Demo in impossible situations It’s ridiculous really. There is no point in this and it is so obvious. The saying is “This is Rocket League”. This game use to be good. No new content on top of trading being removed. This is a game killer.. Epic just killed this game. over the years epic games take back many player avantages and add NOTHING or coriged NOTHING AT ALL.They only care about the stuff who concern MONEY here dev are active of course.Rocket league have many probleme like the smrf ,with all that money why they don't corige the trash serv?? it's been years now... I never put money in that game and i already have all i want thanks to the trade between player but it takes long compare to à guy who paid who thats **** epic seems to have forget that's it's à FREE TO PLAY now they retire the trading between player, new player must paid 20 dollars to have à decent car and not the trash one at the beginning or wait 10 000 Hours to have a miracle in lootbox lmao. Epic know that retire the trading scene will anger players but they do it any way because they trust the fact that her players are cow who will pay whatever. Its so insulting from them, they add or coriged nothing in years and take back the few advantage of the free play player,show them they are wrong and buy nothing. Epic Games don't care about players they only care about money they disrespect players . it was their last fault toward me i stop rocket league and i will never tutch a epic game again. Show them that you are not just a cow.... Overrated asf. played.. Fun to play, simple and have lots of customization. This game relies heavily on luck and ping, 30% of a match is skill based the rest is ping and luck which is horrible for a pvp game. also matchmaking is none existent if u want a game u can play and have fun with for 1 or 2 rounds its ok. but if u are up for a game to play daily and have lots of fun with then go play something else u will find other games that are way more fun that that. also one of the most toxic comunitys ever ppl are literally standing afk in a 3v3 to text and hate on each other with no consequences as they wont get banned what so ever.. Way better on the switch or pc. The one thing I don't like are the physics in the air and the fact you can get matched with Platinum or Diamond as a silver at times. Still, great game.. + Insanely fun with an extraordinary skill ceiling + Matchmaking and ranking is totally fair + Exactly what one might expect when combining soccer with demolition derby cars - This game is addictive as hell and I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the game just so I can have some semblance of a normal life every now and then - Online community is toxic at the best of times - What a save!. The only way to pull a negative from this game is to say its just not your cup of tea. Skill matters, monetisation is light and the fun component is high. Even if your skill is low, and trust me, mine is low, you can have a blast if you love what its doing. It nails the sound, the feeling and the replay-ability. Thank you for reading. Enjoy Gaming.. Rocket League is like FIFA but with cars and crazy action. One of the funniest online ""sports"" game I´ve ever player! Overall rating: 8,9.. Great game, love it. Only 3 minus points. - servers could be a bit better. - Demos are inconsistent. - and my buddy keeps missing wide open goals after I did all that work of dribbling the entire team. Makes me big mad, the eu salty type of mad.. This is the best soccer game I’ve ever played, but it is not an traditional soccer game, it is a soccer game with freaking RC cars, and it is a LOT of fun. The online is decent at best, but the Platinum is what makes it shine for me.. Meh, the game isn't too great... In competitive, you play against people that are better than you! MY DAD LITTERALY BROKE MY CONTROLLER BECAUSE HE GOT MAD! And, The game is a lie... Mostly, it says, Finding people your rank! And then at the end of the game, I lose badly, AND IT SAYS THEY ARE BRONZE IV AND IM UNRANKED! The fun is 37%.. i love how competitive this game is! it’s not like any other game therefore it takes time and skill to get better.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done!. They are such a big esports Title ,Thats why it got nominated into best esports game of the year One thing that they definitely need is CROSS PLATFORM TRADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also need to invest more money in the game and get more devs and publishers to enhance it and get more people working on the game for hackers and stuff. My Biggest one yet is ""UNREAL ENGINE 5"" if they add that the game will go from a 8.3 rating to probably a 8.9 rating. I know I don’t play enough sports or racing games, but I’ve played enough to know this game is bad. The difficulty scaling is off the charts. Literally, you need to have at least gotten a degree in mathematics to play this game. The angles you have to be in to hit the ball to get it in the goal is impossible to master let alone impossible to even learn. Casual players are absolutely cursed to this abomination ****. Bad controls, horrible game concept, and competitive/toxic nature of the community. The only good thing about this game is the customization. Please don’t play this game. However, it’s pretty much dead so I’m glad for that.. Rocket league is a great game. im playing it for more than 5 years now, not consistent but still i get back over and over again. It is fun to grind and the pro scene in rocket league is immense. A very fun and hard game with lots of mechanics which may be sometime frustrating but always worth to play.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10) Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. Fun and addictive sports game and I’m not a sports fan. The learning curve is steep but the matchmaking does a good job at matching you to similar skill level players. Good game for quick fun. What you see is what you get, very simple game.. Gameplay - 10/10 Visuals - 8/10 Uniqueness - 10/10 No story or characters come to mind, but the game is great fun!. Best multiplayer game of all time and also one of the most creative one out there. Just a 1 for the idea being solid. Execution is trash, servers are trash, players are trash, makers are trash, game is trash. If you trash talk in this game, go outside.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rocket League improves upon Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars in every aspect imaginable.. This game is broke. Community extremely toxic. I have been playing since release and it has only got worse. Every rank is filled with smurfs, players abandon matches within seconds if any goal is allowed, and communication is toxic/terrible. All while the Devs seem to do nothing about it. I do not recommend giving your time or money to this game.. Don't take the 2015 to 2019 reviews seriously. The games was good back then but know it's mediocre at best. Huge smurfing problems. Toxicity. Tons of microtransactions. Epic game ruined this games big time.. For anyone reading this, the game is very flawed and not fun anymore in season 6 , let me tell you why. The matchmaking **** this season , im not a good player BUT I ALWAYS GET PUT WITH THE WORST TEAMMATES. Im a teamplayer , i never complained last seasons. But this season the teammates are ass while some opponents play like they belong ranks higher than me. Second of all the ping issue is worse now. Rocket always was kinda ass with the high pings but this season it's way worse. That's pretty much it tho. If my vibe is right i can still enjoy this game . But mostly it's just unfair and not fun anymore . Idk if anyone else has this issue but rocket league might come at an end for me.. (Played in 2020) The best soccer game than FIFA, I have played it for a total of more than 100 hours, not only that, but also its events and game modes.. I'm not good enough for this game to be good. Though i can accept that it is objectively fun.. Good fun. You know what you're getting into every time. Takes a lot of skill to get better though.. Epic games turned this 9 into a 1. They removed a lot of good futures ruined the trading scene and making items that would cost normaly 1 euro into 20 euro. Also there chat bots are garbage. I just got. 720 hour ban for typing a word WITH THE CHAT TURNED OFF. I still registers when i typ on playstation. Submit a ticket and not get any help what so ever. F epic game hope that company will die soon. Its the good game but the developers do not support it enough in terms of the prizes provided by the Competitive. Football with cars? Count me in! So many tricks to do and ways to play, it's very easy to pick up and incredibly addictive! Car customization is decent, you can make your car look pretty stylish, quite edgy, or very goofy. I find the fact that the cars look like toys very charming, it gives the game its own personal art-style in a very creative way. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. Inhumanly difficult game. Inhumanly difficult game. Inhumanly difficult game.. Like fortnite I love how this game made me and my friends sunk tons of hours into it.. The game isn't that bad but its community is the worst of the worst. Servers are always lagging, I've played games 30 years ago without so much online problems as lagging, disconnections, hoping the developers never put out another game. Taking into consideration that the game relies only on online multiplayer and that the community of players is the worst of all times, they really should've made single player modes (apart from that non relevant bs they have included). If you're looking to waste your time with mindless infants this is the game for you.... Football/Soccer with cars? Sign me up! So many tricks to do & ways to play, it's very easy to pick up, and very addictive.. A unique game with no performance flaws, great physics and good soundtrack. The only negatives are the camera which can be sometimes misleading and toxic player community. But the real reason why it's not 10/10 is that the game used to require PS Plus membership before it went free to play. Back then without membership you could just play against bots.. this is a very polished game that promises exactly what it delivers. It is soccer with cars. What's not to love. With an impressive amount of customization and near perfect controls this is an excellent online game.. I downloaded Rocket League the day it went for free but I wasn't interested in playing it for some reason. I decided to give it a try some days ago though, and I got hooked immediately! Rocket League is football/soccer with cars... and that's pretty much it. It sounds very simple, but it's executed so perfectly and it's undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. Aside from being fun to play though, Rocket League is accessible to everyone. However, the player's skills and experience are very important in Rocket League because there aren't any stats in this game. Also, there's a fair amount of different game modes, the customization is cool, the music is fine, and the visuals are pretty good but not anything special. Surprisingly enough, I don't have anything negative to say about this game; it's flawless. Pros: + Excellent execution + Addictive and accessible + Nice amount of content + Car customization Cons: - None Content: 7/10 Music: 6/10 Graphics/Audio: 8/10 Final Rating: 9/10 - Amazing - Rocket League is all about pure fun, accessibility and skill... and it excels in every way; it's so goddamn fun to play, it genuinely makes me happy Do I recommend it?: Hell yes! I'd recommend Rocket League even to people who don't play racing or sports games.. Yes, Thi's Game is perfect and very nice! The cars, objets, gameplay, is perfect.. Bad game. If you are a silver you can meet People that are platinum or better.. There is absolutely no pleasure in playing this game online against other players, I play well against bots at the pro level, but the online system completely ignores my level, and constantly puts to play against very skilled players, it is impossible to set it in the settings, so my teammates call me a noob... Yes, I am noob and I want to play with noobs!. At first, I was expecting some overhyped sports game with little-to-no game skills, up until I watched my friend play this over his Twitch live streams. It honestly got me engaged, and when I came to the realization that this game was free for the PS4, I didn’t hesitate to download it and play the game. It’s pretty fun, and a stress-reliever.. Ranked rewards are kinda stupid… u Play your Ranking Matches and After Ranking in dia u have to win 50 more games to get your dis rewards. That’s ridiculous. Best online game nowadays, very fun game. Football and cars, what do you want more?. Rocket League is a game that every once and awhile can be very addicting during the weekend. I love this game but even I know there are noticeable flaws in this game. Before I go over flaws about this game. Just know that my overall score for this game is 8.4 - 10. This will be tough for me, but its for the better of those that found this that want to get into this game. #1 - The Community, oh lord the community, though its obviously not entirely bad, it's still incredibly and unbelievably toxic for car soccer standards. You would think that people would just have fun as they work up the ranks but nope, toxicity everywhere, especially in the higher ranks. #2 - Though the match-making in my opinion is overall pretty solid, Its really bad in detecting smurfs and can give you pretty unfair matches, especially in doubles. #3 - Sometimes the servers can be almost unplayable at any given time, some days you'll be fine and other days psyonix tries to sabotage you. #4 - In my opinion, I feel like rumble is a gamemode that you can only enjoy when playing with friends. In fact, I think it's probably very fun and addicting with friends, but when you're playing with random strangers, its either just not fun and kinda boring, or annoying with strangers spamming their items or boosts. #5 - Unless I'm missing something, why does camera shake exist? #6 - Sometimes it feels like I can get demo'd no matter how slightly my car is touched. There has been a couple of occasions where my car has been slighty swiped or door'd and It registers a demoltion. Might as well tickle my car with a feather and then quickly run before I explode. #7 - The cpu cars in this game are probably the easiest a.i. I have ever faced in a video game because they weren't coded to be able to boost in the air to hit the ball while its in the air, they basically just wait until the ball drops. The all star and ""unfair"" a.i. difficulties can easily get blown out by double digits if you tried. And that's it. Those are the only noticeable issues that I have had with the game. Again, my overall review of the game is 8.4 - 10. I love this game, don't get me wrong, but I have seen these things happen and I want to warn newcomers of this of you come across this. Please keep this in your mind if you get into the game. Thank you for reading.. Probably the best way to play together with your friends no matter what platform you have. And plus it is free.. Rocket League is probably, the best sports game out there compared to annual ripoff games like Fifa, Madden, or 2K. It's soccer with cars, and is super enjoyable and addicting. This game isn't really noob-friendly, especially if you aren't playing ranked. You'll have to practice A LOT in training or search up how to do combos. This game should be played with controller, not really PC friendly. Also, you don't need PS Plus to play this which is a good perk. Finally, it's FREE. There's no in-game advantages for cosmetics and they aren't shoved in your face to buy them. The devs also implemented an amazing soundtrack system. You can pick whatever soundtrack from their playlist and play it. This is also a good way to advertise less popular artists. Overall, Rocket League gets my 10!. Very fun game to play. Don’t need to be good at it to enjoy it either. Plenty people are still online after it’s release 6 years ago. Rocket League is a very fun, replayable, and unique game that has more than earned the popularity it has had for years. Is it a super complex innovative game with a remarkable story line? No but does that make it a bad game? Not at all, with it becoming free a few months ago now everyone can enjoy the fun of playing a little bit of car soccer with friends while you scream at your teammate Jimmy because he’s a **** goalie, fun times for everyone and far more fun and unique than most battle royales. Way better than fifa and PES games. I only gave this game 9/10 because of toxicity in this game.. Rocket League is My second ever video game. I'm talking above rdr2 and god of war and just behind Minecraft for me. It's actually endless fun. You don't have to be good at all although there's no limit to how good you can get. For me the servers are amazing. Even if you can't hit the ball 9/10 time hitting it once gives you a very strange feeling of happiness. That feeling that you just helped your team out and made an impact on the match. It can be difficult sure but I've never raged while playing the game and I am not even that good. It's super addictive and the amount of free cosmetics and the wholesome player base makes it easily one of the most fun games on ps4. And hey if you don't like it is free making it probably the best multiplayer free game on the platform.. Game is interesting and good,but the ranking system is **** based on wins and if you get paired with bad teammates it will be your fault you couldnt win and you will be ranked **** happens a bit too often to not be a problem.. This is an incredible game, worth playing for hours, days or even more. Super addictive, once you start one match, you cannot stop playing for at least more than an hour. This game requires training, and yes if you don't train at least half an hour per day, you will find yourself stuck in Silver or Gold likely forever. Graphics is ok, physics of this game is so accurate. I love the game in every way, it is one of the games I always wanted.. The proposal of the game is good, but the execution is not satisfactory. The game is very repetitive and there are no differences between the cars although it is a free game it could be better worked with more game modes. Overall it is a game that you will play once with friends and then forget about it",the game used to be so fun until epic games was the owner of rocket league . epic games stopped being lazy and fixed the game instead of constantly taking peoples money and not caring about that game . the matchmaking is this game is a joke. 30 dollars per car in game? Really?
"1,154.Dead or Alive 4","Skip to any other Dead or Alive game over this one if you just wat single player. The extremely scripted and automated I.A is trash. This is not a great challenge when the I.A can counter 90% of the time oven when your attack does no connect. If you can play it Online or Local with a friend it can be a fun experience. Any other DOA game is far more balanced when it comes to I.A, and can be beaten without you resorting to cheap tactics just to see the endings; that for the most part are irrelevant to the story. I see this one as the weakest in the series.. Not the best but is playable with new console with mos powered at the time 8/10. it's an option if you have an Xbox, a great fighting game. It's a challenge that you have to train enough to beat or maybe try your luck XD.. Everything about Dead or Alive 4 is beautiful: the combat, the visuals, and the sound. Combined with the insane amount of content and high replay value, gamers will certainly have a great time playing this game.. DOA4 was graphically amazing. Playing as Ryu Hayabusa just brought back those Ninja Gaiden feelings.. The game is beautiful and still holds up today. The game has the classic DOA feel, and is accessible yet deep, and rides that line better than any fighting game out there. The game play is addicting, and you can learn new things about each character and combos you didn't know before each time you turn it on! A game for fighting game newcomers and veterans alike!. A good looking game but a very flawed fighter. There is just no skill needed it is based entirely on luck. Noticed a certain fighter you vs will pummel you no matter how much skill you have, how much you block or how well timed you are. The AI knows everything and is able to read input before it executes, all this on normal difficulty, this is the sort of play you expect at very hard not normal. Oddly winning a fight feels a test of patience and luck there was no fight i haf i could say i win with skill because the game does not allow for it.. Good fighting game. Pretty tough at times. It has a deep and engaging fighting system. You can jump right in and play, but this game is difficult to master. The battles are finished quickly, though. You can't help but notice how good the environments look, certainly impressive for the time that it released! It definitely still holds up today.. While campy and difficult at the same time, but nonetheless Dead or Alive 4 has it's moments which Dead or Alive 5 could learn from instead of being a joke. Also fellow Itagaki on facebook.. The evolution of the saga. The game is fast is dynamic is challenging. Besides having a very good color and some scenarios very good taste. In addition to a staff of very good character. Buenisimo also has some musical theme.. Initially i was gonna give this game a 4 cause of the very extremely cheap AI,but figured out the reason they counter your attacks is cause i use the same moves.They made the game challenging so that you can become a better fighter which i guess is a good thing,practicing how to counter your opponents attacks is key to winning a match,the graphics are stunning and the music depends on the stage you play,voices are in japanese but i guess that didn't bothered **** very challenging game but if you give it a chance you'll see that challenge is quite the opposite of frustrating.. The first 7th generation fighting game, DOA4 is not only a very solid game in just the fighting mechanics, but also offers a complete package which even some fighting games lack today. The gameplay is very easy to pick up and understand without the need for a tutorial, yet it is difficult to master. The controls are excellent and combat not only looks cinematic but plays fast and fluent too. In addition, stages are dynamic and serve as more than just a pretty background- they can be used against your opponents. There is very little stopping you from enjoying the game. Time attack, survival, versus, team battle, online, replay channel, an in-depth training mode as well as an amazing story (for a fighting game anyway) which is unique for each character make this easily one of the best fighting games around. You can play 1v1 or have 2v2, so if you prefer using just one character you can. By far the easiest fighting game to recommend for newcomers to the genre.. Maybe the greatest trademark of the series is the hot babes, that are in lol. But it is a fast paced action fighting game, which relies on your reflexes, also. But the DOA Series had their best moments with the second installement.. This is my favorite fighting game of all time. I was there when Team Ninja released Dead or Alive 3 on the original Xbox at launch, and I played it everyday. The incredible countering system got me to play more and more just to master each characters movements and play-styles. Now, DOA4 rises to the challenge and delivers a crisp, fast paced fighter that is pretty much perfect. I have a few gripes however that made me give it a 9/10. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH MODES. WE NEED MORE FIGHTERS. That's it. Otherwise, DOA4 is a very unique fighter that will keep fans happy and newcomers posted for more.. Wow, really surprise, this version of Dead or Alive is the better, the graphics are incredible, the story, the characters, all in DOA 4 is fantastic. And the online is really amazing. I love it.. 6 Word Review from Familiar Fan: Raises the bar for DOA fans. If you're a DOA fan returning to DOA, many aspects will be familiar to you. Attacks, grabs, and holds have all carried over from the other DOA games; and you will be familiar with those mechanics. Most of your combos you used from the previous DOA game should carry over to DOA 4, but that isn't a guarantee. However, there are some new additions. Beside new characters, some characters not returning, and new/modified move lists there are bigger additions. Some sort of ""rebound"" mechanic as been added to combat, most characters have a ""sub-stance"" in their move list and the final boss might seem cheap when compared to DOA 3 or even DOA 2 boss. IF you're new to the DOA series, the game mechanics aren't impossible to learn in DOA 4, but WITHOUT an EASY mode and practicing only on AI will cause learning game mechanics to be challenging, but not impossible. If you have a buddy with DOA 4, 3 or even DOA 2 Ultimate play Versus with their copy and see if you can pick up the game mechanics from them. That way, they will pose a challenge yet can tone it down in difficulty when needed. If you didn't pick up game mechanics when versing with them, don't try the series.","the game has the classic DOA feel, and is accessible yet deep . there is just no skill needed it is based entirely on luck . a good looking game but a very flawed fighter . it's a great challenge that you have to train enough to beat ."
"1,155.Pure","Pure, an ATV racing game with 3 fair modes, an ATV builder (parts & cosmetics). Short like Auto Modellista. Fair difficulty. Graphics wise, a fair game with it's environments, ATV details are fair & characters look good enough/suit the game. Starting the player is given tutorials, to accel, turn, use left stick move up then down at hills before doing tricks for boost. These can be repeated later. Went to garage & other modes to see what the game offered. Garage is an ATV builder, so instead of unlocking ATVs you build them/gain parts to match classes/stats to swap them out for to enter into later events. Or auto scale. If you liked the car builder in Sega GT on Dreamcast this goes a step further of parts to put together & consider stats. Love this feature. The player has the choice to either select parts themselves or auto scale parts if they don't care & update per class. In beginning you can just put whatever you want. But later builds wbest to consider stats to get by beside good driving & auto scale per class entry. You don't need a specific part for a class, a class option will just show up when changing parts. So few have a class C to A option. Garage/ATV builder requires a lot of selection choices to get to the cosmetics & to build it. It goes pretty in-depth. I'm no expert on ATVs but if someone wanted to they can make any parts match stats but cosmetic wise the game is limited. For cosmetics which happens about half way to 3/4 of the way through the customisation of the ATV the liveries/colours are limited. If you want sponsors/liveries you have them but you can't move them they are preset options so if you want further creativity you won't find it here. If you want parts presets to select then those prior to the cosmetics offer that. Cosmetics are awarded & can be swapped out like stat changing parts. So while you can change the handles, the fenders, the 3 frame types & more, sponsors, liveries and a few colours. From the engines & other important little to big pieces you get D class (or higher classes) or standard/+1 upgrade consideration in the building. But you will also have five stats to consider. Max Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost and Tricks. Sprocket, Boost Systems & Brakes offer Standard & Sprint kits. While Engine, tires & shocks offer class changes. If enter lower class entry the game will prompt an is it ok to auto scale it for you. Modes offered are World Tour, Single Event & Trial Mode, online play & leaderboard. Solo review. There is 3 types of events. Races, Sprint & Freestyle. Races are races at 3 laps default, sprint are shorter tracks, usually 5 laps default. Freestyle I thought was tricks only but it's actually a fuel survival mode with points & power ups. By doing tricks, & gaining a X2 power up the player will do preform well but others like the fuel power up freeze the fuel level not increase it. They vary from fuel freezing, X2 points, a special trick with LB/RB and fire/flame one for boost. Single Event & Trial Mode are more so a look at each of the 3 modes in an easy to jump in way but with minor changes. There are only 2 locations the player can go to in these until they unlock more in the World Tour mode. World Tour mode the player has a few characters to select. Some alternate looks. 2 from the start of each & a bit of a description of each character. From there the event list with the tutorials to repeat or start the first race/time events. 7 categories are in the World Tour, blocked by points similar to MotorStorm & unlocked over time. The points to unlock the next group of events are fair & 4-7 events (mostly a mix of race & sprint with the odd freestyle) each with mostly 1 freestyle. For points they are only granted in each group, so point count is only towards unlocks. Not points totalled across all groups. Points per group. Vary per position. Parts, classes, tracks for single race/time trial mode unlock besides the next group/tier of events. Are few tutorial/briefing cutscenes as well besides the track view loading screens. Got stuck on Group 3 track with water/odd hill respawn a lot. Needed boost/left jump. Tracks have 2-4 paths most times. Boost lowers on not performing tricks correctly. Best to go with world tour & unlock parts/tracks before playing other modes due to 2 tracks at start. Tricks can be fair to pull off but repeats offer less boost/some hill gaps can be short, be careful. Side, front & back tricks work out well for points & boost if done right around each track for points in freestyle or general boost. Tiny fuel on lap completion/tricks. The A, B while for tricks not sure if needing higher boost to allow B intermediate tricks or not. As pressing X is for boost but A and B show on the boost bar so seems to be the case there then to be one or two bar range boost even if not to do with boost bar cartridges format. Manual booklet useless towards many details of freestyle/other depth. Good core, done well.. It’s February 7th 2024 and I still believe this game needs a sequel or a remaster. This game is still amazing till this day I’m playing pure as I’m typing this but the only downside is that I never played pure online before and its kinda sad knowing that I would never play it online.. The BEST racing game EVER. Please can someone at Disney make a sequel? PLEASE? I beg you!. Realy fun game it focuses on either racing to the finish line or performing tricks to earn style points and the highest wins with a very large focus on customizing your quads and the 6 characters to choose from who each have a unique ultimate trick and varies depending what version they are this was just a blast.. I’ve been playin for 7 years, and not even once I’ve thought about returning this game and it shows. It would make a great game to play if the apocalypse happed.. This is a very cool game for gatherings with friends, it was my childhood game.. Once you get the hang out of it 'Pure' is a really good game. It's challenging, but not so difficult that you give up. To me it's like 'Tony Hawk's Pro Skater' meets ATV/Quad racing. You get to race, but do crazy tricks in the air. It's not just going around in a loop. To win you have to do stunts, which is what makes it very appealing. I definitely recommend this for people who like extreme sports, or racing games, or just wanna try something out. It's too bad this game didn't do better though... It might have something to do with the name and the fact that most sports games tend to have a big name attached to it.. this is the best ATV racing game ever. late to the party as i played this game on 2011 and wow!!! its amazing superb scenery's, insane jumps, daredevil stunts and different routes. felt like riding an atv. the acceleration put to climb a sandy mountain everything is awesome. 10/10 for sure. Short, fun, relaxing. Being surrounded by games that want me to take them seriously it is a welcomed breathe of fresh air to play something where the decisions don't hold a huge amount of risk. Crashing from 150ft in the air trying to cram three tricks into a combo where you barely could have had two, only to reset yourself and go for it off the next jump is extremely gratifying. The pace of the game is perfect in my opinion; there was not a point where I felt that my ATV was limited or that I didn't get enough time to practice in the lower class. I think what held it back was how forgiving it was (even towards then end), and redundancy of the races. Motorstorm made you work your ass off and put down a perfect lap to win the last few events and I felt that the skill level required did not ramp up at the same pace in Pure. Being limited to a Freestyle, Race, and Spring got to be monotonous after a while but due to the length of the game I never felt like I was grinding. All this combined with some pretty environments and a half decent soundtrack made this a good one sitting game. This is definitely something to play with friends but I don't know if I would go back to it by myself.. I love this game, but it would be hard to put my finger on anything in this game that I could call innovative. With that being said, this game will be in my collection a long time. Although I tend to prefer games with a little more realism, I can't help but be reminded of all the years I have been enjoying the SSX series. I truly believe that Disney could take this series to the same heights that the SSX series has achieved. I love the trick system in PURE and even the ATV customization. I would have preferred some sort of custom character creation but having that been omitted from the game does not detract from it's brilliance. The tracks are fun but still I would have liked a little more variety in the environments. With a trick system as exaggerated and fun as the one in PURE I couldn't help but feel that the developers could have gone even crazier with the track environments. This is a minor gripe though as this game has provided my friends and I with countless hours of enjoyment. I don't think it would be a stretch to call this game a must have family title for the Xbox 360.. This game is not great, I understand why some people like it, but although I like racing games this was fun but it gets boring quickly and is not worth buying. I only got it because it came as a bundle copy with my lego Batman.. Great game, include a good variety of parts to build some awesome ATVs. An great amount of tricks and overall a fun time for everyone. This was a great chioce for me and could be for you too. I suggest to pick it up soon!. Is is one of my most played racers this gen and a truly awesome game it's non stop arcade speed and thrills frm start to finish and I can't recomend it enough I think the only people who wouldn't enjoy this is those peeps who live for simulation racers but those guys tend to be a bit strange anyway so the rest of us can play pure and have fun while they play with their spanners ha ha :). Nothing special. Limited to quad bikes. Good Tracks but can become very complicated. Especially if you just want a classic racing game. Don't bother buying unless its less than a tenner.","pure is an ATV racing game with 3 fair modes, an ATV builder (parts & cosmetics) the player has the choice to either select parts themselves or auto scale parts if they don't care & update per class entry . cosmetics happens about half way through the customisation of the ATV ."
"1,156.LocoRoco 2","What is this game? It’s adorable, yet it’s so weird. It’s simple to play, but it’s so awkward to control and move. I like it, but I’m also happy if I don’t play this again.. Very nice game, the improvements make it more fun! The music, characters and gameplay are great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. LocoRoco 2 is a truly imaginative title and one worth revisiting on the vita if missed on the psp. The aesthetic is extremely vibrant and gorgeous. The whole game exudes colour and this is matched with the equally colourful and infectious soundtrack. The soundtrack and visual style are used effectively to contrast the good in the game with the evil. With a game with limited narrative, the occasional text box, the story is effectively told through the animation and music. The characters are perhaps one dimensional but act as simple and lovable balls of colour and sound. Having the choice between characters is nice but I found myself sticking with the default LocoRoco. The gameplay is very innovative and engaging but quick movement and changes of direction can make certain scenarios frustrating and make some deaths feel cheap. It is however a pleasure to explore the well designed and varied levels that truly encourage exploration for secrets and offer incentives for replaying by introducing new gameplay mechanics that can open up previously closed areas. The level of difficulty is low allowing the player to enjoy the visuals, level design and music. LocoRoco 2 is padded with some mini games which are a bit unnecessary and not too engaging, adding to the length of the game to its detriment. Overall LocoRoco 2 is a pleasure to play through its visuals sound and gameplay and is definitely recommended.. Probably the only game you can find that makes you turn away from playing it due to the girly and childish cover. But trust me, this is probably one of the best PSP game you will find.. An imaginative and original game that utilizes unique gameplay and fun visuals. LocoRoco 2 is light and breezy and has that classic easy to learn/hard to master learning curve. The music is lively and the colors jump out at you. This creates a great energy running throughout the game. The game is a joy to play even if its lightness means that it won't be particularly engaging or involving.","the aesthetic is extremely vibrant and gorgeous . quick movement and changes of direction can make certain scenarios frustrating and make some deaths feel cheap . the level of difficulty is low allowing the player to enjoy the visuals, level design and music ."
