"1,157.The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria","This is one of the best game concepts I've ever seen - you play a dwarf trying to reclaim Moria. As a big Lord of the Rings fan, this game was a no-brainer to pick up and play. Sadly, it has some pretty significant issues that prevent it from being a truly great game. The inventory system is unnecessarily burdensome, with limited space - why not let every item type go up to 99? Instead several types of items only go up to a 30-stack, which hurts inventory space. The crafting system is unnecessarily burdensome as well - why make it take over one full minute to cook food, a resource you desperately need to not die in the game? The progression is rough as well - one of the worst map designs I've ever seen, its impossible to figure out where I am based on the map. Glitches and bugs throughout the game, map markers that should have disappeared many quests ago still remaining on the map, constant framerate issues even at the lowest graphical settings (I have a 3070Ti), very generic combat sequences that are just plain dull. Boss fights that are uninspired. Teleporting across the map requires an extremely rare resource that you ALSO need to progress in the game, on top of just getting around the map. Plus its a lonely experience - your only friend in the game is a **** don't meet any other interesting characters in the game until very, very far into the game (I assume, I haven't finished the game). Don't get me wrong, there are positives too - there are several areas in the game that are just beautiful and make your jaw drop. I nerded out when I got to see several locations, and the game makes great use of the LOTR lore. The singing dwarf, while glitchy, is still fun to hear. But overall, this is not an experience I desire to finish playing, nor is it a game I'd recommend to friends. My hope is they make a non-exclusive sequel available on steam that is of significantly higher quality, but with the relatively average/poor ratings the game has received, that seems unlikely.. I've been a huge fan of this game and, frankly, I'd say that it's the best mmo I've played. However, you need to pay for absolutely everything in this game (even for the ability to ride a horse) and even if you buy a vip account you don't get access to all content! Turbine really killed all the pleasure of playing it.. These ratings should be updated to reflect current changes and problems, support and stability are nearly 0 and the PvP system is and has been extremely broken and full of exploits.. Solid expansion pack, this IMO is where LOTRO really starts to take off, I never really thought the base game was anything to shout about but with expansion packs like MoM the game really starts to make a name for its self. The quests are so much better here than they are in the base game, the team at Turbine have certainly learnt from their mistakes there, the PvM is classed as some of the best in LOTROs history and the same can be said for the PvE which is further improved with AI changes. Overall is a must have purchase for people who are already fans of LOTRO and its a great opportunity for players who perhaps didn't like the base game to try the game again.. Fantastic. Eregion was a great place to quest as you searched for signs of the Fellowship and earned your first legendary weapon. The epic line of quests and the conflict with the Watcher in the Water was exciting. Delving into Moria was a great experience. At times it had some lag and some bugs, but I greatly enjoyed this expansion and this experience. Finding the Balrog, signs of his struggle with Gandalf, getting to the bridge where Gandalf fell...great great stuff.. Yes there a lot of MMORPGS out there but LOTRO has a unique approach in the quest system, spec requirements and the purchasing currency (turbine points) that me rate this game a perfect 10. LOTRO's quest system includes main story mode and sub quests like NWN and skyrim style is a very effective implementation to a MMORPG game. The quests and deeds are mixed with rewards (turbine points, title , traits) that probably gives excitement to the playing experience because there is a lot to achieve here an its very rewarding that you finished them. Another thing is that the game engine used here is very flexible that even my old dual core laptop with onboard gpu can run this game and at the same time my gaming pc fully utilizes the full graphic quality of this game. If you haven't played it before play it now!. This MMO has many fans and I will admit I do like this game, with that being said I do want to point out Leveling up in this game past level 20ish becomes a major grind mostly because free to play players do not have access to many of the quests. and purchasing all the quests in the game can be very expensive, their is a plus to this though because once you by the expansions your other characters have access to them as well. There are 3 tiers to this game F2P - get the fewest perks and over all will most likely be looking for a new game in a few months. Premium players - get a few more perks but only by purchasing some turbine points Pay to play players - get the most perks how ever they still need to purchase expansions. So you may be thinking to your self Why should I even try yo play this game? First off the story line is very good and well worth going through. All the epic quests that take you through the game is open to all players, side quests are the ones you may have to purchase. While you play you can gain Turbine points that allow you to purchase stuff from the store such as quests that you may want to get however this is a very long and drawn out process. The graphics are very good and can be very stunning. Over all this game is great for players that do not mind grinding. .. I have played Lotro for a very long time, always wondering about a true expansion. My expectation was ****. For a first expansion Turbine hit the ground running, with a smooth launch, wonderful quests ( and engaging). They made a very lore heavy/friendly recreation from Tolkien's books, but I already expected that much.","the inventory system is unnecessarily burdensome, with limited space . several types of items only go up to a 30-stack, which hurts inventory space . the progression is rough as well - one of the worst map designs I've ever seen ."
"1,158.Control: Ultimate Edition","Gameplay issues aside I really did not enjoy my time with this game. I loved Alan Wake so much I wanted to give it a try because I heard they are in the same world. Believe it or not the story is more confusing than Alan Wake but it doesn’t have the charm to keep me engaged. I did complete the game, which took about 12 hours, but by the end of it, I was pretty frustrated with the whole experience.. This was cool and fun. Smooth combat, an engaging environment, a unique atmosphere, excellent sound design, and great acting/voice acting. The story is bonkers, though, just as it is in all the Alan Wake-themed games. There are a few inconvenient difficulty spikes that feel unfair at the time, but persistence and a combat guide will get you through.. Hartman Final Boss Fight [AWE Expansion] was annoying asf. It's just too much unrealistic hard time that you lose all of your patience. This fight made the game less plausible for me. We. Don't. Want. Regenerating. Bosses. Big dissopointment Remedy, Bravo!. The gameplay is really fun, The destruction is really nice, and combat good and tactical. DLC are not so amazing...fells like a downgrade.. The story is boring and not engaging. All the cutscenes are just conversations between two emotionless robots. The objectives are often confusing, It's rarely clear what you're supposed do and the awful map makes it hard to find where you're even supposed to go. The gameplay is cool though, the launch ability is definitely the best part of the game.. In my opinion, it's such a great game that I platinumed the game on both PS4 and PS5. The plot of the game is very good. It should definitely be made into a TV series. Fighting mechanics are very good. When you enter the fight, the environment is neat, but after the fight is over, the environment is a mess. I look forward to the continuation of the game.. There's a lot to like about Control, chief of these is the story which is a little opaque but nevertheless compelling. Graphics are good for 2019 apart from the cut scenes which are laughable. Sound is very underwhelming, I can't remember any musical theme. ( Notable exception the Ashtray Maze which is about to as close as Rage Against the Machine as it's possible to get without getting sued) . Gameplay is fluid and the controls are responsive. Combat is a little brutal but you can tweek the options even making your character immortal, so if there's something you just can't get passed there are options, good in a linear game like this. My major gripe is you spend at least half of the game lost, wondering around aimlessly trying to find where your supposed to go! That's kinda frustrating, annoying and boring in equal measure. I've docked the game 2 stars simply because of this.. Control offers a truly immersive gameplay experience, thanks to Remedy's powerful Northlight engine. Although the story may have some shortcomings, the game excels in providing a Metroidvania-style progression and a sense of discovery that is hard to find in other titles.. All of Remedy's boundless imagination and postmodern sensibilities finally come together in their magnum opus, this jaw-dropping and perfect video game. The environment is eerie and brutally imposing. The combat is delirious. There are surprises around every corner. Exploring the Oldest House is tense and at times unnerving. The story is full of heart and terror. The lore is deep and inviting. It's hard to do it better than this, folks.. Great Narrative, great world, okay characters and beautifully many crazy and creative ideas (and good songs). Sadly gameplay lacks a lot of variety and gets boring and repetetive at times.. A rich story with great controls and many interesting things to explore in this mysterious building.. The game starts mysteriously from the very beginning: we enter a building, pick up a certain weapon and become the director. Mysterious, isn't it? The further we go, the more secrets will be revealed, and some we will have to guess **** game resembles older games in terms of mechanics - there are no first aid kits or health regeneration, health must be picked up from enemies. There are no markers, we will have to discover the way to all locations ourselves (there is a map). We cannot save the game whenever we want, it is only possible at checkpoints. However, when we use a checkpoint, enemies will respawn and we will have to fight them. For people who want to feel a bit like in the years 2000-2007, this will be the perfect **** game has a character development system and each point invested in the character is felt during the game. We have several skill trees to choose from and one can even go so far as to say that it is possible to create several different builds. We can play as a typical tank, we can go for energy, shields, throwing objects - there are several paths to choose from. The weapon upgrade scheme is more extensive – here we have a few more options to choose from depending on how you play. We can have a typical pistol, but we can also modify it into a good sniper rifle.Another element reminiscent of old games are bosses. In several stages of the game, as well as in optional tasks, we can meet bosses who require us to use the full range of our skills. The fights are not repeatable, each boss behaves and looks different and before we get to know him, it is more than certain that we will die several **** destruction of the terrain – insane. The terrain after the battle looks like the terrain after the battle, everything is broken, pillars are damaged, the floor is ****. I can't remember a game where it would be done so well, apart from Half-Life.When it comes to storytelling, nothing is served to us on a plate here. The game keeps us in the dark, in understatements. In later stages, many things will be explained or we will come to the right conclusions ourselves, but many things will also be left unsaid and we will only base ourselves on our guesses and information gathered in notes. And there are really a lot of these notes, sometimes too many. If we have a movie to watch in the game, it is a real movie, with real actors. This is not very **** main character has a number of skills and these skills are not just for show. Each one is useful and the game is designed in such a way that we have to learn to use them to effectively fight opponents. An interesting trick is that we do not receive these powers right away, but as the plot progresses. The game can surprise us in this **** entire action of the game takes place in one large building and there is a lot of backtracking. We will find some passage, but we will not enter it because it will be available only later in the game. This may bother some people, but I did not feel bored with it.Some opponents leave a little too little life.Some notes are censored by blurred words. This trick is supposed to make us guess certain things while reading. In my opinion, it is completely unnecessary.Side quests have a time limit. When they appear, we have a certain amount of time to take on the task. If we don't do it, they disappear. They often appear during the main missions. In my opinion, this element requires refinement.There are translation errors and dialogues fly by too quickly.. It's a decent game, but I'm not interested in the visuals or dialogue of the game. Gameplay is decent, but not anything special or outstanding. Visually, although impressive, the game is rather dull. The use of colors is fantastic and the game has a clear art direction, but still looks very grayscale and empty. I understand that the washed colors and emptiness of the environments is by design and part of the story/style, but it isn't done well. The idea was there, but the execution was not. Gameplay, for at least the first several hours, is very dull. I can't comment on the latter half of the game as I didn't go past a few hours of playing. The game isn't for me. I find it mediocre. But who knows, you might like it.. amazing game that combines great gameplay and good story with a beautiful atmosphere. Amazing story, -2 for gameplay, remedy universe and the story telling is 10/10.. A game with fantastic atmosphere and graphics, but not enough pros to outweigh the cons. For example, one of the things that I really didn't enjoy was the combat as it was fun at first, but gradually gets more repetitive and just begins feeling like a chore. Another thing is the map, as it can be very difficult to read at times, as getting from point A to point B can be hard to do because the map will place a marker where the objective is, but does not take into account if it is above or below you. In conclusion, Control may be a great game for some but with its unexciting gameplay and convoluted map, it just isn't for me.. gameplay mechanics were decent but I felt it was a bit repetitive after playing for a while. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pretty good game with immersive story and location design. I enjoyed a sort of Portal-like feeling of a huge complex that you explore and uncover it's hidden secrets. The whole premise is spiced up by the 1960s motive and real-life videos of dr Darling. This game is a complete experience and does not pretend to be something else I had plenty of fun. Plus the environment destruction mechanics are superb! The DLCs did drag out a bit though and I couldn't bring myself to finish them after such an engaging main story.. Story: 8 Gameplay: 7 Game Mechanics: 7 Enjoyed the story but the characters were meh. The gameplay could've been more impactful, with a little too much repetition. The game could've used the environments a bit better.. Enjoyed the game very much. Last time I've really dived into the game was while playing BG3, this is a second time for a really long time. Despite never playing such kind of games and being a bit sceptical, I was genuinely surprised. thei game caught my interest, I think innear the end is a little too long and some activities of the ultimate edition are not that good but a great game overall for sure. An amazing game that'll keep you intrigued and captivated through out the story. Plenty of exciting moments that get you hyped when playing (ashtray maze). The gameplay is very fun, once you get the levitate ability it made the combat even more enjoyable. The launch ability is op. Control is awesome and everyone should play it if you love third person shooters. Also runs great on a ps5 no frame drops that I noticed.. A solid game with great atmosphere and good graphics. Puzzles are mostly fun and powers are enjoyable to level up. Unfortunately, it is a bit boring and frustrating a lot of the time. Still fun for a single playthrough, but definitely not very inviting for a second playthrough.. It's an incredibly interesting, fascinating world ruined by the middest combat I've ever experienced. Played much longer than I would have just because the incredible allure of the games world made me tolerate the **** gunplay. Couldn't make it past the generator section before throwing in the towel and looking up the rest of the cutscenes.. terrible game of bad gameplay slow, slow to walk slow in combats slow in enemies everything in this game is slow and massive. History is complete rubbish. game not recommended.. Control is an atmospheric masterpiece. The setting and mood are top notch, with a combat system that is a joy to play. Some people criticize the combat for being too repetitive, but it's only as repetitive as you allow it to be. Use all the weapons at your disposal instead of spamming two overpowered tools over and over, and you'll have a great time. Someone please remind me to play this game after I go senile so I can experience it for the first time again.. I replayed this version of the game, after playing AW2. I enjoyed the gameplay and the supernatural story.. Dyna-mite Control boasts one of the best gameplay experiences I've ever encountered. However, the most controversial aspect of the game is its narrative, so I would like to address that **** me, the narrative wasn't a major focus. While I was initially intrigued by Jesse's story and the events unfolding in the Bureau, as the game progressed, it became increasingly complex and challenging to comprehend. I found myself breezing through the story and later resorting to watching explanations of the plot, leaving me bewildered. It's worth noting that to fully grasp the plot on your first playthrough, you need to meticulously read every single note, watch every Dr. Darling video, and so on. Despite the storytelling challenges, the lore of the game is exceptional, fascinating in every aspect; the main issue lies in how it is **** the other hand, the gameplay stands out as one of the best I've ever witnessed in games. Every combat mechanic adds complexity and enjoyment to the fights (except for the Shield perk). This, coupled with a vast array of weapons, results in the most enjoyable third-person shooter gameplay. However, there are some drawbacks, particularly with the bosses. The main game lacks interesting bosses, as each one turns into a common enemy after the initial boss fight, which feels arbitrary and isn't justified by the plot. In the AWE DLC, the boss fight with Hartman stands out as the most challenging and intriguing, connecting well with the Alan Wake story.I must also mention the masterful level design, with the highlight being Chapter 9: Polaris. The Maze sequence, accompanied by the Old Gods of Asgard track, creates an unforgettable experience reminiscent of Episode 4 from Alan Wake or the We Sing episode from Alan Wake 2. Speaking of the soundtrack, the track ""Sankarian Tango"" deserves mention for its brilliance and its ability to encapsulate the protagonist's journey through Remedy's **** summary, Control offers an unforgettable gameplay experience, interesting characters and lore, and a memorable soundtrack. However, the weak narration significantly lowered my overall score for the game to 8/10.. game is well made. history is ok, but feels repetitive. killing and killing the same enemies, running and jumping. i cant feel immersion on that.. This game is incredible. The gameplay (combat and traversal) is fluid and unique. The world and world building is the best I've seen in a videogame. The story in general is confusing and directionless (that's how I feel about it), even though it creates great situations for gameplay. The DLC is a great inclusion to this Edition, more fun gameplay situations.. Control is a beast of game that effortlessly builds a world and history of such richness that that alone would carry it to success. Luckily, Remedy didn't stop there and, giving major kudos to writer Sam Lake, we're treated to a personal and epic story of peeling back the layers of reality, of facing the mundane and not allowing it to constrain us. Gameplay boasts a chaotic collection of paranormal abilities that showcase the destructive physics that the developers undoubtedly pushed the technical limits on, and the haunting atmosphere promises many a mystery to come, cementing Control as one of the best games I've played in the last decade.. Deep and creepy. Fast paced action and awesome powers to play with. Remedy has nailed it with Control.. A fantastic example of how it is possible to unfold a story in a really creative way, supported by some solid gameplay and incredible visuals. I was not a fan of Remedy's shooter but this time I was litterally **** into the story and it was a blast. Particular mention to the audio design: it's mindblowing!. Control on PS5 was a game with excellent graphics, animations and cutscenes. The fights were intense, although at the end got a little dull. The main problem in my mind was very limited variation of enemies and scenary. Overall good game.. Mediocre gameplay with a lot of repetition. Story has some good elements, but the protagonist constant comments and mary sue attitude detriments the overall experience.. Not for me personally. Now maybe I didn't give the game a chance but I've played nearly Three hours of it and I don't see any real reason to continue. I do believe there is a good game in here, the amount of positive reviews I see for the game tells me that I -must- be missing something or maybe it's just one of those things we can chalk up to a ""Yeah, it just wasn't for him, it seems."" First of all let me say that graphically the game is gorgeous, I'm running on quite a high end PC and the game looks genuinely phenomenal and really establishes a certain aesthetic of that 70s/80s office feel and the set pieces were genuinely good to look at. The passive storytelling is another part of the game I'm fond of, the redacted notes and letters you find around the place really help you feel like there's been more going on in the world the developers created rather than just you as a character being inserted in and everything goes from there. Combat is okay, it's nothing overly special but it's good enough so that it's not super tedious. For me, the protagonist isn't likeable, as the player, I genuinely don't care about anything she has to say or what her actual goal is, the inner monologues as well; for me, seem really frustrating because it takes a while to realise as to why she's having these inner monologues, and perhaps for a lack of a better word, the whole thing seemed a bit pretentious. So the game does require a bit of Self-Navigation but the map barely does a good job at helping you out here, you can never tell what floor you're on according to the map, maybe I've missed something like a floor switch button and if I have, then that's my fault; but I found that the self navigation in a giant building in a game like this just wasn't for me. For me, the game just wasn't fun and the story wasn't compelling enough to keep me going, I've heard it gets better after the four-five hour mark but I genuinely have next to no desire to hit that ""Launch"" button. When I turn the game off, I'm not excited to put it back on. To reiterate, I do think there is a good game in here, potentially one I might enjoy; but for where I left off and the experience I've had with it already, it's just not for me and I can't recommend it for the above reasons.. How can it be that they don't put an indicator to know where to go? When I started playing it I said ""this game is wonderful"" but as the first missions went by I realized that it's totally boring, I spend hours going through the map without finding the place where I have to go to progress, I haven't been angry in a while so much with a game but I'm not going to give it a bad score because of this. I was looking for a good game to forget my problems and I came across this game that drives you crazy. The gameplay mechanics are precise, and the combat system is thoughtfully crafted. While the map may pose some confusion, the navigation system empowers the player through a sign system that immerses them in the experience. However, the surrealistic undertone may not appeal to those who prefer a more straightforward and linear narrative.. This games biggest problem is repetition and the boring level design . I completed this game from some years ago on the PS4 and I had fun so I played it again The characters are not interesting. They're just talking about the lore and there's not really any development and the gameplay gets tedious after a while because you just doing the same thing and because it's all grey blocks the level the sign it gets boring for eyes. After awhile, I just had to ask myself if I even wanted to finish this game and I have to say no because i just get too bored.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PS4 progress won't transfer to PS5. UNPLAYABLE PS4 progress won't transfer to PS5. UNPLAYABLE. I am not saying it was wrong because it is not a true religion but I don’t believe it is true even when we do. I did't know what to expect from this game. But I certainly didn't expect it will turn out to be a weird, braintwisting and utterly unique masterpiece. Courtney Hopes performance als Jesse Faden (the main character) is spot on, perfect voice acting and I love Jesse as a character. The game has great story telling with humor and lots of suspense as well as masterclass world building (documents and audio recodings). Not to mention the amazing graphics and the very unique art style (reminds me of Stanley Kubrick movies with all that geometry, lighting contrasts and 60/70s interor and technology). There is clever level design, detailed decoration and realistic enviroment. The fighting system is really cool, the combination of superhuman powers and shooting with different kind of weapons mix quite fine and lead to exciting fast-paced-battles. The sourroundings react to your actions really nicely (things break, explode etc.). Overally Control has a really well made atmosphere with build up suspense, psychological horror elements and firghtening enivorments. But it manages to never get too scary, just the right amount. I really liked the insane attention to details (adding so much additional stuff like very long handwritten texts or forever ongoing voicelines add to the world immersive feeling). The ashtray maze level on its own is a gaming masterpiece, one of the best video game missions ever. The length of the game is just right, for people who really liked it Control even offers two quite good DLCs. In addition to that I have to mention the flawless programming: there is an impressive high quality of effects and physical behaviour of objects, I never encountered bugs or graphical errors. The sheer amount of documents, audio recordings etc. especially the ones that are linked together shows me Remedy really put a lot of effort and love into this game. What I have to criticize is that raytracing looks stunning on the PS5 but feels weird and too irritating since it produces a stutter and blurring when moving the camera. Another minor problem is that enemies are too repetative and mostly the same (except the mold zombies which I think feels like a nice hommage to TLOU). Fighting parts always feel the same wave style, there are no tactical aproaches and only rarely different situations - I wish for the sequel to improve in this aspect. Another improvement for a sequel could be to move the weapon form choosing to the directional buttons of the controller, this would make it possible to choose from more different weapon forms fluently. You find weapon mods and personal mods too often, they really stuff in the inventory and are mostly useless since most are weaker than the ones you already have. The translation of the documents or subtitles into german is sometimes quite poorly, I started with english audio and german texts but soon switched to both english since a lot of the humor or cleverness of the texts is lost in grammatical errors or obvious google translator mistakes. One thing that set me off was that you sometimes instant die when falling off a cliff, this ruines the game flow. Personally I think the ending felt too rushed, it would be better to leave the player a break before the final fight - I was confused and surprised to find myself in the final battle all of the sudden. Overall control is a really outstanding game. It shines with its creativity and innovative ideas. The only big flaws for me are that I personally can't use the raytracing mode because it makes me motion sick and that the enemies get too repetative after some time. Still its very uniqueness and amazing setting, story and world design make it in my opinion a 10/10 masterpiece.. Such a brilliantly unique game. If you're looking for something different, this is certainly the place to start. A truly immersive experience, one with a cornucopia of quirky yet utterly compelling lore, and the gameplay coupled with the environmental destruction is truly something to marvel at.. There’s a lot of good and a lot of bad with this. It’s got one of thr worst stories ever. Trust me, remedy even knows it’s awful. It makes no sense, and it’s so poorly written. The game gets very repetitive enemies-wise, and it’s unforgivingly hard. With all that being said, the controls are super tight and thr action is fun. The haptic feedback is amazing and the shooting is solid like returnal. The levitating is also so well done. Simply put, the gameplay is very good. The graphics are decent but nothing special. A couple of the puzzles are Also very random and not intuitive at all. It’s a good game, but I don’t see it being this award winning game the critics raved about. Amazing. A very unique game. You can tell that there went alot of work into this game. Awesome. Graphically the game looks nice (although not extraordinary special) but overall it just lacks ""soul"". The story telling is one of the great misses. It doesn't have the suspense you would expect and that it potentially could have, but also sometimes it is puzzling (in a bad way) what the board and the previous director are saying. This is so unnecessary.. The characters, and especially Jesse, never connect to the player. There are no ups and downs, just the steady (and repetitive) stream of hiss and missions. The environment is also soulless, even though that might be the intention because of the bureau of control, it is somehow always neutral and boring. Some checkpoints are well intended, but poorly placed, which sometimes leads to frustration, as many others have noted. This doesn't make it a bad game, just a very average one. It is a pity because the game has so much more potential. The levitating, lifting and throwing of things and the controls are phenomenal. For me it is a fun game, but one that I will forget about now that I finished it. It is a good buy when on sale, but not worth the full price.. It's a polished well made game, good controls and fun. not a 10 but solid!!. Best game ever! And the best development studio because they are out of politics! EA, R*, CD Projekt dog shift studios should learn from Remedy!. Control great game!!!!. I love this. The game is fantastic. Im not mad for shooters on console but this just hits the sweet spot. It has this sense of mystery all the way through. You never quite know what exactly is going on or why there's things going on. You need to explore your surroundings and watch videos you'll find and read the documents lying around to have an idea of whats happening. The game doesn't tell you much in how to do things. The map is useless and I just accidentally found out how to upgrade weapons. Its a breath of fresh air but theres a problem. This game's story is like the build up to Christmas but when the day finally comes it doesn't meet the expectations. Your 9 years of age and your expecting a PS2 but you get the N64. Not a bad system but its no PS2. You have to remember that this is a game first and a story second. There is a sense of atmosphere though and thats just as important and it is spooky. Sometimes terrifying. I felt so confused most of the time. Whats with the hotel? Why am I the director? Whats the hiss? Why am I here? Was I always the director? Is the gun the director? Am I asking the right questions? The problem is that you have all these questions and you expect to get some answers but your just left hanging. The character you play as is just satisfied with the outcome. She now knows the answers to the why, what, how questions but Im left with 'Huh? What'. I dont know how to describe it. I felt like this is the sequel to another game. They just expected you to know some of the lore already but what lore. This is a new IP. But it does leave me wanting more and I can't wait to play the next one.. Very good game, but the AMC is way too hard dlc, a lot of enemies and hard boss.. Hours Played: 11 Hours Trophy Completion: 35/68 (53%) Worth My Time: Yes, at least one playthrough. Worth My Money: Yes, if heavily discounted. What I Like: Oozes personality and style. Story well told in a variety of ways. What I Dislike: Gameplay feels lacking in a variety of manners. Combat feels stiff, exploration feels repetitive, progression feels narrow. How It Stacks Up: Decent port, but not sure if it's worth playing if you already played it on PS4 unless you're a huge fan. Remedy is a good studio that certainly deserves praise, but the quality just can't compare to Sony's first party offerings.. I cannot believe the amount of positive reviews for this game. (edit: upon reading many of the positive reviews I am actually convinced they were written either by actual AIs, people who didn't even play the game, or just morons.) The writers (both of the reviews and game) should be deeply ashamed. They (the game developers) took a great concept, which they even marketed as based on SCP Foundation, and absolutely ruined it. The main character won't shut the **** up. It's maddening. She constantly narrates everything with the most inane commentary of all time. There is zero immersion because you are not the main character, some moron is. The best parts of the game are totally immolated by this. The gameplay loop is also tragically bad. Run through office space after office space shooting enemies who for some reason take your entire clip to kill, but themselves are armed with SMGs and sometimes even forcefields (that also take your whole clip to bring down). There are no difficulty settings either, except to make yourself invincible or turn on one-hitting. Which of course, ruins any tension in the fights. The dialogue is all poorly written exposition, and then followed by more inane and incredibly annoying narration by the main character. All I could think is ""why won't she shut the **** up so I can have my own thoughts about what is happening."" The mystery and paranormal intrigue is the only redeeming factor, but they ripped the concepts straight from SCP, which is a much much better use of your time if you enjoy that kind of fiction content, because SCP contains literally thousands of stories, and ""objects of power"", and this game contains maybe 5 or so. The game's best quality is that it isn't totally linear, and you can explore around and find clues and hints about the mysterious objects and events. But this is not the focus, and there isn't nearly enough of this content to justify the game's existence. Do not buy this game. I was lucky that I got it for free from a friend and didn't waste a dime on it. Control is an awesome game. Sure it’s not perfect buy Ive only found few flaws & nothing that bothers me. Important: it took around 3.5-5 hours to figure out WTF was even going on. It was similar to a Souls game in that area. I play games slow, methodical searching everywhere, everything, reading all items, taking notes if necessary & the story is well acted & an interesting, spooky at times & a “thinker”. The superpowers you get feel real with proper physics & most importantly fun as hell. If you blast through the main story only you’ll miss out on some cool powers so do ALL side missions. I didn’t find anything you could miss or bypass. Do whatever missions you want. There’s main, side, “alert” & board missions. Main & side are obvious & do them as you please. Alert randomly pop up when you pick up certain items & just randomly. Board missions you choose at “save points” where you pick up to three that you constantly work on like kill X number of enemies in a certain area or with a certain weapon & other variations for a reward like a weapon modifier or character modifier. The are takes place in a building but surprisingly it’s architecture is different on the floors & as huge as the game is, it’s fairly easy to remember. I’m finishing the second DLC. Platinum trophy main game so my opinion isn’t from a few minutes or hours of play. If being specific I’d say 8.6/10. I had the game from PSN+ subscription but I bought a new copy to support the developer & to have a physical copy. After I finish the PS5 version","i loved Alan Wake so much I wanted to give it a try . i did complete the game, which took about 12 hours, but by the end of it, i was pretty frustrated with the whole experience . the story is bonkers, though, just as it is in all the Alan Wake-themed games."
"1,159.SoulCalibur IV","Decent entry into the SoulCalibur series but hampered by the armor/stats mechanic introduced and used only in this game.. In the end, this game is best suited for two-player action. There is no extensive single player mode. If a player has a constant stream of friends, then this game will rock! If not, then they will need a broadband connection, else, the game will bore them quickly.. Single player feature wasn't as good as 3, and netcode needs work. However beautiful graphics and game design. Other than that, it improves on everything else SC3 set out to do.. Like most people i didn't even know these games exist, because for some reason nobody promotes them, but in many ways they are actually more fun than Tekken and Street Fighter. Unlike people who made MK11, Makers of Soulcalibur at least understands how to make good looking female characters in a fighting game. It's not even that important, but at least they don't make female characters purposefully uglier. PS: Ignore anyone who says that this 4th game is meh and 1 was way better. That's a lie. These are just nostalgic nerds, ignore them. 3 and 4 are both amazing games and have great characters and amazing graphics for it's time.. This fourth installment in the series is fantastic, but the familiar gameplay is what keeps it from being great. The original ""Soul Calibur"" was truly groundbreaking and the first sequel simply repeated the formula for a wider audience. By the time SC 3 came around, the franchise started to show signs of aging due to the lack of innovation. Part 4 adds a character creator and ""Star Wars"" guest fighters, but it ultimately just feels like another entry. I would rate it with an 8.5 out of 10.. Good fighting game overall. I like 6 better but this one has Darth Vader. It also has the guy from the force unleashed. You unlock him by beating arcade mode with Darth Vader. I think it also has Yoda but I dont think I can unlock him on PS3 in 2020. That kind of ****.. Im better at Soulcalibur 6. Im still getting used to this game. I dont like playing with Darth Vader. He plays kind of stiff.. The force unleashed guy is fast and is fun to play with. I love playing with Ivy. And the character creater is ok but not great.. This title had the best gameplay, and ambience, even though im on the calibur train since Soul Edge. The matches were slow paced, and instinct driven, with a hint of tactics (cancel moves!) Consumed all my spare hours for a year and a half back in the day.. Wow! I HATE this game AND Soulcalibur 5. The games are a huge failure compared to the trilogy that came before them. They should have never been made. The story is incomprehensible. The graphics and stage design can't hold a candle to the previous games. The story mode is abysmal and too short. The music for this game and Soulcalibur 5 are the worst of the series. Everyone I grew up playing with lost ALL of their charm and became one-dimensional. The voice acting is awful and have less dialogue. The other classic modes ****. The controls were unresponsive and stiff. The mechanics that the series so beloved were altered for no reason and the AI was broken which is what made the game WORSE. I wish these games were never made. All these positive ratings for this game are LIES.. SC IV is amazing. It is exactly what I wanted to work with. A 2 player game that provides a near-perfect competitive environment. The 10 comes from teh fact that this is my favorite genre - by FAR! And that the create-a fighter works extremely well. Also - can you say mild camel toe.. Reviewing something so similar to the preceding three games -- and after releases like Super Street Fighter IV -- becomes monotonous. Especially coming from a franchise once treasured in the fighting game genre. Pros? The inclusion of Star Wars exclusives is an excellent concept; the introduction of online mode; stunning graphics; once again, Soulcalibur IV caters to veterans and casuals with its variety of strikingly unique fighting styles. Cons? Unfortunately, the Star Wars concept is defeated by largely imbalanced fighting mechanics; Critical Finishers, although visually stunning, take too long to reach and are largely unseen outside of multiplayer; lack of replay value; occassional online hiccups; the gameplay is all too familiar and in 2014, it hasn't aged marvelously.. one of my favorite fighting games the music is good the characters are good the fighting is amazing and its just overall great fighting game the only problems are some characters are cheap but other then that this game is good oh and the storyline is lacking but isnt every fighting games story ?. soulcalibur IV is an amazing fighting game with great fighting mechanics, amazing music, coolness, a large amount of playable characters and places to battle. it's only problems are that it isn't as good as soulcalibur II and that the fighting system is a bit slow moving.. probably the best fight game I've played on my PS3. Very nice graphics, POWEFRFULL soundtrack and very good online. Darth Vader and Yoda in this game made me want a StarWars fight game like SoulCalibur.. While it is technically the same as the first three games, veterans and newcomers alike can adore the new features in Soulcalibur IV. Pros: The inclusion of Star Wars exclusives, Critical Finishers and online play refreshes the overwhelmingly familiar gameplay; absolutely stunning graphics; drastically improved story mode and Character Creation; a variety of strikingly unique characters and combos. Cons: It's almost too familiar to Soulcalibur III; occasional online hiccups; silly dialogue.. SoulCalibur has a huge following and this was the reason I bought this game. I can see the attraction. It's fluid energetic and atmospheric. Maybe I'm not a fan of 3d beat em ups or maybe I'm too lazy to perform the ridiculous combos but I just found myself bored and infuriated. I think If you are into this sort of thing this is perhaps ( level with Tekken) the best game out there. I find 3d beat em ups so different from 2d ones that they fall into a different category . I guess what I'm trying to say is Im not a fan of the genre hence can't review this game fairly. One thing that can be said 3 years later the games graphics still look crisp and beautiful. The gameplay is enjoyable enough but I was bored after 2 days. The last beat em up I really enjoyed was Rocky on the xbox which isnt really a beat em **** im confused. Overall I recommend to fans but to noobs it's too taxing to remember the moves and too repetitive to enjoy over a long period of time. Online requires a lot of patience also as the competition is intense ( as to be expected spose) . 7/10.. i did not like this soul calibur game and find that it is the worst in the series. the story like is non existent with the characters and each one only has about 5 battles. i am not sure if it is this way with everyone but i am having a hard time putting combos together with all the characters and find myself just mashing the 3 attack buttons. i loved the 3rd one and wish they had kept most of what made that game great and at least had more extra features to entertain myself when i dont want to get my a$$ handed to me while playing online. i liked the addition of darth vader and the secret apperntace but unfourtunatly darth vader isnt a very good character since his moves are slow. i find that the controls have a bit of a delay and they never quite do what you want them to. trading this back in for some of my money back. This is a really good addition to the PS3's arsenal of games and variety. Great graphics and sound, heaps of characters to choose from and awesome moves and customisation too. The only thing this game lacks is a real story and a larger amount of cutscenes for different characters. The final boss should not be from 3 characters no matter who you are playing as, but from every character available. Still this is a very good game.. I have found Soul Calibur IV to be a very disapointing installment of the series. I can only commend the game for it's unique character designs and good online action. I feel the game lacks in variety, the moves and combos are too straight-forward. For a hard-core fan of the SC series, I would recommend renting it, rather than buying it.","this is the fourth installment in the SoulCalibur series . it's fantastic, but the familiar gameplay is what keeps it from being great . i would rate it with an 8.5 out of 10. ."
"1,160.The Forgotten City","this game probably gonna forever be mine most liked game of all time i finished 5 minutes ago and thats a precious experience for me plot philosphy thecharacters atmosphere and world of course there simple plot holes and little bugs but game make this things reckless with evrerything shown to you i think thats game i once lifetime experience everyone should get it i finished recently like i said and i was expecting yeah theres multiple choosesbut prabaly im not gonna play again when i finished when game finished i cant belive i, finished game and find myself with lookimg credits with pupy eyes i cant press esc to to skip and let it flow to end and ending made me felt different and emotional well thats because ending i get but still thats felt amazing if you are reading this get this game and play if you are into rpg games and categories i will guarantte you will enjoy the game even tho you dont like the categories i think you will enjoy.. The plot of the game is interesting and leads to philosophical thoughts about life. The graphics are at such a level that I was happy to look around, and even if the gameplay is not impressive with the variety of mechanics, it did not prevent me from enjoying the game. And although sometimes it was difficult for me to understand what to do next, this is rather exclusively my problem. It was an interesting story in which it was interesting to exist.. Played a few hours and love the relaxing gameplay and mystery. It's oddly haunting to have golden statues look at you when you move past them.. Was a bit surprised going from the official teaser how talkative this game but few conversation after - I do not mind. Characters are fun, the idea is interesting, solid story telling,... Glad I did not miss this one. An interesting time loop game I really enjoyed once I got into it. The characters aren't all that interesting but they really are just there to carry the main theme of the story and for that they work well enough. The mystery is intriguing enough to carry the game, even through some of the more tedious parts.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's just a dialogue simulator with RPG mechanics. I played the game for a little over 1 hour, but it failed to capture my interest. The amount of dialogue we had to listen to complete the main and side missions managed to overwhelm me. As soon as you start the game it's like you're entering a grind fest. Everything about the game feels like an unbearable chore. On the other hand, even though I completely turned off motion blur and increased the sharpness, the graphics of the game still look very blurry. Since the game was developed by a small team, everyone generally praised it for support purposes, but unfortunately it did not seem like an interesting enough game to be worth my time. Such a dialogue-oriented game should also offer variety in gameplay so that the player does not get bored. Just walking around, listening to dialogue, and then looking around for notes makes the game boring enough for me to ignore it, even if it has an interesting story.. I don't think it's the best one of these time loop games, but its certainly an interesting one. If you are more into the investigating aspect of these games and don't mind tons of dialog, this is the one for you.. A timeloop-based narrative investigation game in a very cool setting, an underground roman city that lives under the following rule : ""the many shall suffer for the crime of the one"". If one commits a sin, the whole community dies. A crime is about to be commited and you have to resolve this mistery to get out the loop you're stuck in. it's a really cool and original idea, the city is magnificent, the story is thrilling, the character writing is good. The issue is that the gameplay is very basic. The story is far more linear than it first seems, the dialogues aren't so decisive, there is no real investigation system, and the combats are boring and just here to fill the gaps. So it was cool to discover the setting, the characters, the story, but don't expect any exiting gameplay.. One of the best games i ever played, deserves recognition, i Wish there were more games like this. Massively overrated. For a game that relies so heavily on dialogue, the dialogues themselves aren't all that good. Voice actors do their best to elevate this material, but there's only so much they can do. This game wasn't written by a professional script writer, and it clearly shows. This whole timeloop mechanic is very tedious. I have no idea how both this game and Outer Wilds are some of the most well-received adventure games of the last five years, despite the timeloop implementation being equally as awful in both of them. The journal is a joke. It lets you put a tracker on a quest you wanna follow, except half the time this tracker doesn't work and you have to navigate on your own. I hate this kind of approach. You either let a player track every quest or none of them. The way it's done here, it just creates confusion. The graphics are nothing to write home about. A tad more fidelity than you'd expect from your typical indie game, but still nowhere near enough to compete with big budget contemporaries. I couldn't help but think that instead of these ""pretty"" graphics and fancy voice acting they could've invested more funds and effort into the actual gameplay, quests, etc. Take, for example, Age Of Decadence, which, yes, looked way behind times, but it had a much better writing, actually interesting characters, more and better quests, even more locations variety. Better score too. The soundtrack in The Forgotten City is basically just stock ""ancient music"" and lacks severely in originality and memorability. Once again, if we're talking smaller budget, indie titles, take something like Enderal, which had a massive 5-hour long OST with tons of memorable tunes. Overall, this game is an admirable attempt, but still a letdown in so many ways. The developers clearly bit off more than they could chew. Perhaps they should've started with something more lowkey, prove themselves and gain more experience, before undertaking something so ambitious.. Greek, Roman or Egyptian. Whatever it is, I always think of mythology as a superhero comic. And this game is built upon it. I don't know who fked whom. I don't know who is what? So it was hard following their stories. But the game did a fantastic job of telling everything about them or stories I need to know to follow through. So if you even don't know wtf their mythology comic is about. Don't worry the game got your back. The story, 65% of the story was phenomenal. It was fantastic. It got stale at the end but did not drop the ball. There are 4 endings. Each one of them is very clever. Except for the canon one. The character models were ok. Except for the ladies. Every fking lady in the game looks the same. The lack of facial expression was very noticeable. These things can be excused as this is an indie game. And as always, they must include Western woke culture for the sick fks out there.. FABULOUS GAME!! I was intrigued throughout the game, the story, the OST, everything was top notch. It's hard to believe this game was made by only 3 people. REALLY LOVE IT. Jesus Christ what a buggy mess. Just play the Skyrim mod instead, it's free.. An amazing game with and incredible gameplay mechanic, the history could be better but it is still a pretty good gone nonetheless, the game also have enough paths that you wont be bored at all.. A woke groundhog day in ancient rome, the timed quest and npcs chimping out and locking you out are annoying, you dont have multiple ways to progress, you will follow the same path up to a point, and then choose which of the obvious 4 endings to follow through with. But as far as story centered walking simulators go, this is decent.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Excellent game! I can say very little without spoiling it, but think Groundhog Day meets ancient days. Well written and voiced, beautiful graphics, and a great story concept! And multiple endings mean your choices actually do matter! I understand the playtime is around 6 hours but I spent 15 hours just playing around with decisions, dialogue choices, character alliances, etc.. Creative time loop mechanic with intriguing plot and charatcters. Great mystery game.. Really loved the world and the whole loop concept. It must be played with patience just so you're able to connect everything all the different characters tell you.. Not a game for people who dislike a lot of reading and running around aimlessly. I like the mysteriousness but I dislikee the lack of direction. The city isn't interesting enough to keep you running around looking for clues. There are quests that I have no idea how to complete. There will be a lot of time spent testing out a clue, or an idea and then be disappointed that it doesn't work out, and then stuck without knowing how to make the story progress.. Criminally underrated Witcher 3 story telling meets inception in Greece. I am not the greatest fan of ancient Greek/Rome story setting, but this game made it so interesting I stayed till 5 AM till I finished the game in at least different 3 ways. The game is no doubt masterpiece. Clearly product of love for the few developers that worked on it. The story, characters and dialog are well ground, fantastically delivered, and respect your critical thinking. Ending is elegant and although the plot is intricate all the loose ends are tied flawlessly.. I will never forget this game. An incredible story, betrayal, intrigue, plot twist... This game has it all for the sake of story. It's a great job, according to a 3-person developer team. I must say it has better story and optimization than most AAA games. (Of course, there is a slight optimization problem.) But it bothered me that we asked the same questions to the people we talked to in the game, and this reduced the diversity. On the other hand, after spending some time in the game, you see that we do nothing but talk. The game has a crouch key to go stealth, but it doesn't do much. Finally, as the story progresses, the names of some characters are forgotten, although the game tries to remind us of these characters, it is not very successful.. The most beautiful and magnificent work of art and dedication i ever seen in my 12 years of gaming truly a once in a life time masterpiece of writing and design. This game is pretty good if you like history or fantasy. A pretty good adventure , graphics are decent , story is really great. But just one thing I don't like about this game is that the face expressions of the chacaracters . But its not a really big problem.. Just a masterpiece. Clever, beautiful, touching… a must play. Can’t recommend it enough.. A game with great time loop and puzzle mechanics, sadly bogged down by clunky combat. The time loop puzzle is satisfying, but the game loses its momentum towards the end when it devolves into scouring the map in fetch quests.. A great game, with an exciting story told in a way that could only be told in a video game. The characters and situations are well written and the juxtaposition of ancient rome and modern times is entertaining. The amount of historical research that went into the making of this game is staggering, considering the short dev team.. Wonderful game. The story is a masterpiece. But the only problem is that I can finish one of the endings too quickly. I wish I had been ignorant of the truth for longer.. Came for the story, stayed for the graphics. That is of course not ideal. I expected to be more impressed by both the story and the interactions. I was thinking 2 things while playing it: boy, this writing sure pales in comparison to Disco Elysium and this kinda feels like a Fallout New Vegas Vault. It probably worked much better in its original incarnation as a mod. Beautiful detective game. The city is visually nice, the various endings are good!. An enjoyable time loop romp through a little Roman village. Date Completed: 2022-02-06 Playtime: 7h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: Yes!. The game is decent, but I don't understand the hype, though I must say I played around 1h and I have gave up. For me it is so boring because dialogs are flat, life of the city is not better than Skyrim NPCs and we have 2022 not 2011. There is too overwhelming pathos: music, dialogs. Maybe it was fine back in the day but today I feel it makes narrative flat. Interactions with the world are boring and even though I tried 3 times I can't force myself to play more in this game.. Good story, I'm not regret at all playing this game. Did all endings and enjoy them all, if you like a story based game you need to play this. Plus I learn some new thinks about Ancient time.. What a great story rich game! I enjoyed every moment of it! Although I learned something new about history by playing this game, so it was definitely worth it. Unique, well-written, surprising, and interesting throughout it all, The Forgotten City is a great game that deserves your time.. This game has an amazing story full of twists and turns, original puzzles and beautiful graphics. I would give it 10/10 because it's an experience you won't forget. But you also won't forget the problems that the game has and they annoyed me all the time. Lags and objects appearing in front of you or the fact that the game sometimes just stops and starts loading wouldn't bother me that much. What bothered me though was the over the top political correctness. It was very annoying especially because story is everything in this game. Some of the characters were in the game to impose the author's political views to the player. I want to enjoy an otherwise interesting story, not be lectured on political issues. The Forgotten City is an amazing game that is only stopped from perfection by its not-so-good technical state and completely inappropriate political propaganda. I look forward to more games from these developers and hope they avoid the mentioned problems in their next projects.. Absolutely phenomenal game, fantastic story told in a way that just grabs you by the balls and holds onto them until the end. Bravo! Haven't play something that good for a while.. The forgotten city is a game the lives or dies by its writing. Thankfully the game is quite well written (mostly). The game is less concerned with epic battles or even dialogue options with branching paths and is more interested with politics and philosophy. At its core, the game is about ethics, about what is right and wrong and how do we know what is right or wrong. An ambitious way to write a game, and it mostly works. This is not like Nier: Automata who talks about philosophers but doesn't go to far into the actual philosophy of the big thinkers they invoke. The Forgotten city wants you to engage with the ideas of ethics and morality and in the end, it does pick a side on what they think is the most correct answer to these ideas they put forth. I respect that they did this and would love it for other devs do the same instead of doing the whole ""it's up to the player"" mentality which has its place in gaming, but it can come off as a cop out for a mot of games and feel like the publisher was too afraid that picking a side would hurt their profits. That being said, I find that the level of depth they went into was quite shallow and isn't anything you would find in a first year philosophy class. After hiring historians to help make sure their world had historical authenticity, I felt like they could have also benefited from hiring a philosophy professor to help with the writing. I am three paragraphs in and I have yet to talk about the gameplay or the graphics. That's because both are serviceable and there isn't much to talk about. The game does have light puzzle mechanics, which are fine if a little one-note. The combat is pretty out of place and the game could probably be better without it. As I said in the review, the game lives or dies by its writing, because gameplay wise, it is unremarkable. The game is totally worth the experience if you're looking for something new, don't get it if you're looking for an action packed adventure.. This game was surprisingly fun. Of course it's not on the same narrative and development level as a AAA game because it was made by a team of 3 people. Granted, my bar was set pretty low, but I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth checking out.. NPCs are creepy and battle encounters feels like some unity rip-off game. Graphics are on the high side but I was expecting some kind of better GI or RT effects.. Simply amazing. I hear the complaints about ""stiff graphics"" but understanding where this game comes from as well as the idea of 'art style' will get you past this barrier. This game is an experience that no gamer should go without experiencing. It will influence other games for years to come. Play a pioneer while it's still easily digestible. Also, avoid spoilers at all costs!. This is the first time-loop game I've played, and I loved it. I found it very immersive, despite its relative simplicity. It got me thinking and problem-solving in a way unlike the adventure games I usually play.. There are too few supported languages. So it's not fun. It's annoying. Please support a lot of languages.. Outer Wilds, but in ancient Rome and with a detective vibe. Must play for narrative games lovers.. The game looked like it would disappoint, mainly because of the terrible endings that games of this style have been releasing. However, I was surprised, with well-written dialogues and a sense of importance in the story. I could see the effort in delivering a good ending, and I hope the developers continue with new projects.. The greatest story telling game I’ve ever played and the fact that it’s in time means you actually learn real story’s. It’s very intelligent dialogue and pulls you in with a very human quality, the conversions feel real and are very powerful. If they could make the Scale even bigger I’d say this game would be better then elder scrolls. But the depth of story is far better then anything elder scrolls had made.. If your bar for quality has dropped so low to the point where this is some of the best writing in gaming, please seek help or play more narrative video games. For a game made for ""Adults who like figuring things out for themselves"" the mission path is extremely straight forward, and there isn't much thought required to get through the game. Just go with the blatantly obvious solutions or just cheese your way through it because the game breaks at the slightest hiccup. And aside from a single moment, nothing really feels clever. For a game with a timeloop mechanic, they do **** all to give you interesting puzzles or narrative beats to get around by using the timeloop. Most solutions basically play out with you choosing dialogue until you say the wrong thing. Then on the next loop you go back and say something different. And it's not like you really have much input either as the options are pretty rigid and several times the game would not let me say the one thing I very easily could have said to sway the conversation in my favor. It's so surface level and rigid that I can't fathom why anyone would think the dialogue or choices are interesting. I mean I literally got the ""True"" ending on my first run through and I didn't even feel like I did anything special to deserve it. Speaking of the ending, the big reveals in the last act are unbearably corny and play out like something you'd probably see in a random Gmod level. And despite coming out, what, almost a decade after the mod? It still looks a plays like a skyrim mod, though I'd argue the original mod's visuals almost fit better and Skyrim's facial animations are about on par with this 2021 release. I seriously can't believe this game was made in Unreal 4. It looks like it was made Unity, by people who don't understand lighting and post processing. I just don't understand what anyone sees in this game. The illusion of choice is paper thin, the ending is eye-roll worthy, and it's just kinda corny as a whole. The 4th wall breaking jokes are facebook level humor and having a ""Karen"" joke literally 2 minutes into the game does not set a great tone.. Amazing game! Hard to find these days games like that. Impressive! Started to play and couldn't stop for hours and hours. This is a story focused game. Literally the only combat is an occasional area that you fire your bow in where the enemies take two hits and all they do is rush you if they see you. I never came close to dying by an enemy so you shouldn't either. If that sounds fine with you then keep reading. The premise is you have been transported to a lost ancient Roman city that is cut off from the outside world. AND you are stuck in a timeloop. It is your duty to explore and chat with everybody, discover leads, follow leads, and break the timeloop. The city area is not so big but I think it is the perfect size for this game. I'm going to spitball and say there are about 12 people in the city. The characters and the mystery are enjoyable. The characters will probably not be so memorable in the long run but I imagine the mystery will be. In a game such as this there is a lot of possibility for the little annoyance of needing to repeat your actions everyday if you want to build off of something you previously did. There is no such annoyance here I am glad to tell you. For one, there is a very nice, overly trusting man that will run and do your important errands at the beginning of the loop. Also, all the characters you interact with are totally cool with being blunt and cutting to the chase. There are 4 endings and one of them is THE ending. The others are options but they don't leave you satisfied. So why do I think this game is only a 7 out 10? It is not that the game does anything wrong I just, for whatever reason, don't have any strong feelings toward it. It is good. It is solid. If you like this kind of thing you will enjoy yourself. I enjoyed myself.. The Forgotten City An experience you wont forget The forgotten city is a 6 hour long action adventure mystery game where you playas a character that wakes up in what seems like the distant past, in this land of people afraid of this golden rule, if just one person sins theyre all doomed, these golden statues will cometo live and turn everyone into gold.. but hers the conundrum, to get some info and escape, you gotta do a little sinning.. luckily for you.. youre a time traveler.. you steal the item or kill the person you need to, run to this portal, go back intime, thankfully theres a messanger standing right at the portal for you to tell all the info to, so they can run and take care of things you already took care of, not only that, youre back with the item you stole, sin free, rinse repeat, talk to the charcters in this small yet lived in feeling city,solve their problems, get what you need.. youll even get your own golden bow,which leads to some amazing dungon crawling sequences that I would’ve lovedseeing more of, youre dealing with thesegolden monsers, shooting vines leavesandalgie, to turn them into gold to traverse.. I loved it.. but again sadly this makes up maybe only 2 hours total of this 6 hour game.. the rest is just talking and listening, being persuasive, solving problems, figuring out the big giant people puzzle, how can I get what I need, gi back in time and use it against this person, or help this person.. I loved trying to solve the problem of getting info and also dealing with burdansall at the same time, and I loved that I got to keep everything I collected in between it all.. The forgetten city is one of the coolest story games ive ever played… it is definitey boring at times.. a lot of times.. I skipped more dialog than I would in a game really pulling me in with its story.. but I was still glad I pushed through to the end, to reveal the big twist.. If youre a fan of solving mysteries or just love a really good story, snatch this one up.. I give The Forgotten City an 8.5/10. I went in completely blind (never even heard of the mod) and loved this game. The story kept me interested, voice acting was stellar for such a small production and graphics nice to look at. Soundtrack was epic and you really felt transported to an ancient time with a lot of small details in world building. Only downside was the bow combat which is understandable since its not the main focus of the game and the tiny map, I would have liked to explore a bit more.. To those who never played the original Skyrim mod : this game is the most exciting, fresh, immersive, beautiful and cleverly fascinating mystery action game I've played in years. From a magnificent soundtrack to awesome story revelations, it's jaw-dropping in every way. To those who played the Skyrim mod : it's all we loved and hoped for, but different, fresh and ten times better in every way.. Thoroughly recommend this game. It looks beautiful, and the story is engaging. The game mechanics are unique and fun. I have spent a lot of time trying to piece everything together. Think of yourself as a Mythological Phil Connors from Groundhog Day. It's extremely satisfying when you figure stuff out and it all clicks together. I can't say anymore, as I don't want to spoil. Can't wait to see what is next for this dev team.. I've never posted anything on Metacritic before, but I made an account SPECIFICALLY to do so for this game. It all started with a Mod... and this game is an ode to that mode, while also being something fresh and original. It is one of the best mystery games I've ever played, with twists that kept me guessing, even after playing the Skyrim mod! The love they poured into this game is evident from the get go, with so much research and care having gone into it. The entire experience is like greeting a familiar friend, only to find out they're even more awesome. Modern Storyteller is a developer that I believe will go on to do great things... because they already have and frankly, they can only go up from here. Buy this game, LOVE this game, share this game to your friends.. I am genuinely so impressed. With a team of only 3 developers, they have managed to accomplish so much: Fantastic story- time concepts, history, philosophy, and an open-worldish type adventure ticked all my boxes. The content of the quests was also very unique; no fetch x quests, each was memorable Acting- both the animations and voice overs were very well done; it was super engaging. Each character felt real Stability- with time loops involved and the quests that are included, theres a lot of potential for bugs. Surprisingly, I did not run into any (except a money exploit that I used to my benefit) The only downside is that I felt it was fairly short, but that might be because I loved it I wanted to explore as much as I could ASAP.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love the idea of this game, and the score is my way of saying: I don't want to rate this. I want more games like this, and this is obviously the work of people who had a great idea, and talented writers and programmers worked hard to make it, and given the size of the team the result is impressive. But under the thin veil of a decent presentation and some nice writing even the short time span that you spend in the ""forgotten city"" - again and again - is enough to break any immersion with technical issues and shortcuts in it's mechanics. While the story and underlying mystery are certainly interesting and the characters well fleshed out, the developers cut too many corners when it comes to the consequences of your actions. The lack of interactivity and interaction in the city makes it feel small, dead and less and less believable. Every time you enter the market place that has no customers filled with nothing but silence, where nobody reacts to you or whatever happens - even when it's a shrine coming down on a lunatic with a weapon - it becomes harder and harder to feel engaged or take it serious. You can't screw around because the developers didn't seem to see any potential in that, and every interaction and every object is directly tied to your quests. You can't really experiment because everything is quiet straightforward, which also takes out planning or getting creative and the satisfaction that comes with that. When you change history you never get something like a butterfly effect; you are lucky if you get additional dialogue. Everyone seems oblivious to what's happening right in front of them, and with very few exceptions most people just stand patiently in place until something sets of the repeating Armageddon that you are trying to stop. On top of that the game has small technical issues like long loading times that make you think the game crashed whenever you move around and hit one of it's invisible inner borders that put another dent into the illusion that you are in a living, breathing place that is alive even when you don't do anything. There are only very few things to explore or observe or watch, and everyone sounds like they are reading to you. So yes, I don't want to rate this, but I also can't recommend it only because I want it to be good.","the plot of the game is interesting and leads to philosophical thoughts about life . the graphics are at such a level that I was happy to look around, and even if the gameplay is not impressive with the variety of mechanics, it did not prevent me from enjoying the game ."
"1,161.Kingdom Hearts","Kingdom Hearts (2002): A Timeless ClassicKingdom Hearts blends Disney magic with Square Enix’s RPG expertise, creating a unique, heartfelt adventure. The story of Sora, Donald, and Goofy traveling through iconic Disney worlds is both whimsical and emotionally gripping. Its real-time combat is fun but hampered by clunky camera controls, and the Gummi Ship segments feel underwhelming. Despite its flaws, the game’s vibrant visuals, unforgettable soundtrack, and themes of friendship and courage make it an enduring masterpiece. A must-play for fans of Disney, RPGs, and timeless storytelling.. A risk that payed off, I am so glad we live in the timeline where this game was able to make it past the idea stage. Considering what this game is, it is shocking to me to this day it exists, and it created my favorite franchise of all time.. The game is boring and dull, and the main character lacks personality, the combat system is boring. The Disney characters and tropes are boring.. The game is awful and it's only fighting. You'll fight the all time and it is not even fun.. Perfect game. A true classic. I highly recommend to anyonewhohas never played. It's a great story and a really fun time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A dizzyingly effective combination of Disney and Final Fantasy. Engaging action-RPG combat. Immersive worlds to explore. An all-time banger of a soundtrack and theme song. Great performances. Magical story. This is a classic and must-play for casual gamers and RPG fans alike.. On the same level as KH2, feels different in its combat, but in a way that makes it irreplaceable. I do not remember enjoying the length of the final boss, essentially carving out its entire own section, but I think if I played this again, I would appreciate the scale of it all. ""SUBMIT!"". I didn't pay much attention to this game at first. I thought it was for younger players. I thought it had a simple gameplay (jump, hit, collect points). But I was so wrong. This game is almost as beautiful as Zelda. Fun combat. Familiar characters. Various levels. Good boss fights. I was especially shocked when I learned about the secret bosses. It's very well done for 2002. There are Metroidvania elements. Various abilities skills weapons items. And most surprisingly, there is craft in the game. Depending on the year, these varieties are very good. There are a few things I found missing. I can't skip cutscenes. Since the secret bosses are very difficult, I can die and have to watch the cutscene every time. While fighting, you can accidentally exit the doors and the battle is interrupted. Space Ship could have been a little better. Fighting in space isn't much fun. At the beginning of the game, I was very confused and it wasn't clear where to go. Overall, I enjoyed the game very much. I will play the second game soon.. Endlessly charming story, amazing music and visuals with grounded and enjoyable combat. A game I'll always be able to find myself coming back to.. If we exclude the gameplay, that hasn't aged well at all, Kingdom Hearts would still, in 2024, attract tons of players that never experienced this series.. Anyone who remembers this game fondly remembers wrong. Don't listen to anyone who recommends this. It is awful.. If Kingdom Hearts 1 played as smoothly as Kingdom Hearts 2 this would be an easy 8.5. KH is charming and whimsical and captures the golden age Disney animation magic perfectly But it is just so hard to go back after playing Kingdom Hearts 2. Awful platforming, but the rest is some of the best for the playstation 2.. So many memories with this franchise. For its first outing, Kingdom Hearts is a great game, and in a bubble, an amazing game of its era. Despite being one of, if not the weirdest mashups in gaming, Final Fantasy and Disney (although more leaning on the Disney side of things for the first game), Kingdom Hearts strangely works. The game, as well as its main original characters, strike a good balance between the two seemingly clashing art and writing directions of its creators, with Disney's whimsy and childlike adventurousness and Final Fantasy taking care of the serious and more engaging parts of the story. Speaking of the story, the first game in the series is a lot lighter than the rest of the franchise, which came as a bit of a shock to me, as you always here horror stories about Kingdom Hearts' convoluted story, which is what made me pick up the 1.5 + 2.5 HD Collection on Ps4 (In case you're wondering, the HD remakes are the way to go with this game. Better graphics, more moves that make the game less frustrating and more fun). The story has main protagonist Sora going on an adventure with Disney's Donald and Goofy throughout various classic Disney films, such as Hercules, Peter Pan, Aladdin and more in order to find and save his friends Riku and Kairi, all of which were separated due to mysterious shadow monsters called the Heartless. On top of this, Sora can wield the magical Keyblade, a key shaped sword that can rid the Heartless for good. Like I said, its a lot simpler than the rest of the franchise, but it just about kept me interested until the end. Emphasis on the ""just about"", as the story tends to take a backseat during most of the Disney worlds, where Sora goes about helping the characters from the films in their on condensed story, some original to Kingdom Hearts, and some just straight up being the films they're based on. Its alright for a first game, but nothing ground-breaking or incredibly interesting until the later parts of the game. Gameplay-wise, the combat is quite fun. Sora can attack with his Keyblade in melee combat, or use it to cast classic Final Fantasy spells. This being said, I never really used the spells except for the first couple of times using them. This was when I realised that the offensive spells are very underwhelming, and not worth using when you could use your MP for healing or protective spells, or your time going up to the enemy and using the Keyblade. Melee is really the only way to go. There are also various summons you can use. Summons are unlockable moves where Sora calls upon a Disney character and they help out in the fight, such as Simba from the Lion King attack enemies with his roar, or Tinkerbell providing continuous healing. I used these moves every now and again, as they require having Donald and Goofy as party members, which means giving up having the Disney character from the world your in, which is a shame because they don't show up again after completing the world. As a whole, the gameplay is fine, just feels slightly dated in some parts. In conclusion, Kingdom Hearts is a game worth your time, and definitely a must play. While it pales in comparison to other games in the series, it still just about holds up today as a legendary start to a legendary franchise. Stick with the game and the series as a whole, and you'll find a new obsession that you will not regret.. A true classic. One of my fondest gaming memories from when i was little. Still come back to it from time to time.. A game I will never forget. I loved this so much as a teen, every moment is ingrained in my memory.. Pretty sure this game spawned the soulslike genre from the simple question of ""what if an entire game was like the Sephiroth fight?"".. Easily one of the best PS2 games of all time. Great story, revolutionary gameplay, & incredibly creative blend of the Disney/Final Fantasy worlds.. Despite the fact that Kingdom Hearts is one of my favorite games, it is undeniable to say that it has some flaws such as the camera that sometimes does not work quite right, another flaw is the script which is good for the game but compared to the following games it is much simpler than the following although despite these flaws that I have just mentioned, it does not mean that you do not have fun with this game and also note that there are many details. Gameplay - 7 Plot & Characters - 5 Storytelling - 3 Pacing - 6 Music & Sound - 9 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. Mixing disney and final fantasy together with an original storyline and characters that melt your heart. A compelling story about friendship and forgiveness coupled with one of the most innovative combat systems seen in gaming at this point. Future entries expand on what is begun here but make no mistake this is a fantastic video game that will delight any age for hours.. Kingdom Hearts is nothing more than an extremely generic JRPG with Disney IPs plus some final fantasy characters copy pasted in. This is one of the most stupid and toxic fandoms on the entire internet. The reason why this game is so popular is because it's just collective nostalgia goggles of being the only Disney game where you can play out big scenes from Disney movies in a video game format. Because there are so many IPs from the different Disney movies, you exponentially get idiot fans from them all at once giving you the most amount of nostalgia points. Bosses are just ""die a few times until you figure it out"". This is not good game design, it just pads out the game needlessly. Thanks to this being a Square game, bosses have multiple forms which means another ""die"" point where they do something new. Usually it's an attack that kills you in one hit so, have fun watching the cutscene and starting over again. Diehard KH losers will tell you that this is part of the ""experience"". If you're playing on an emulator, use save states to make KH losers mad. You know for sure this was a bad decision because they re-made the game several times and added a skip cutscene feature, but KH idiots still defend it. You cannot open your menu to change equipment during boss battles. All this does is pad out the game with pointless deaths. Bosses have nonsensical abilities, a great example is Ursula who is underwater but she uses lightning? Once you figure that out you can equip lightning protection stuff but again, there's no way to know that beforehand and you just waste a boss run to find that out. You can't change equipment in battle and there's a lot of bosses that are like this, ie they are impossible or take a very long time unless you ""know"" in advance. Again, your average KH idiot has played through this game so many times and has forgotten this. Spending 20+ years to cope with how bad the game is designed and claiming it's ""part of the experience"" is not a valid argument to say the game is ""good"", that means it is ""bad"". Oh so very many of the worlds just ****. The entire Atlantica world **** very bad. The entire place has one texture and they draw yellow arrows to try to tell you where to go - again, very bad game design. Everything looks the same and you get lost very quick. Even people who've played through this game 5 times get lost here. Monstro (Pinnochio's World) is similar but not as bad in this regard. Atlantica has the infamous dolphin kick ability which is extremely janky and stupid and gets in the way more than it helps you for one boss fight where you need it. Tarzan's world completely **** and so does Wonderland and they are smack right at the beginning of the game to really put you off. The game is chock full of jank. Tarzan's vines are jank, jumping on any kind of moving platform is jank, targeting is jank, the fire spell is jank, the menu is dumb. Why do they limit you to 3 spells in the quick cast menu when you have a controller full of buttons? The answer to that is again to make bosses a one way death experience, to pad out the game some more when the solution was to assign a necessary spell to quick cast. Again KH losers tell you this is part of the experience. The entire Gummi Ship thing was pointless and 100% unnecessary. Again, more padding out of the game, and they even knew it too before it was released - the entire Gummi Ship blueprint thing is entirely unnecessary. The game flips its difficulty much too quickly. There is a certain point in the game where you get a few critical spells which essentially constantly refill your resources. Before you get these spells the game is incredibly difficult (at least on the hard difficulty), because every boss is walking on eggshells where one hit can take you from max health to death, completely skipping the health alert stage. After you get these spells, you essentially cannot be killed but bosses just take way too long. The tech system makes you feel like an idiot because it only works when you are swinging cluelessly. Sora's attack has a lag and isn't instant. Most of the time you are trying to learn a boss' pattern, and because Sora's swing isn't instant, you have to essentially take a guess and miss a lot and then take hits to the face. Seriously, 90% of the time when I did a tech it was on accident, so I started button mashing like a noob and then I started getting tech after tech. The central story is absolutely an afterthought ie, the main focus of the game was making the nostalgia goggles as thick as possible with the Disney IPs. It's something they made up in the space of a couple days. Just getting on youtube there are all these fan videos ""attempting"" to explain the story between games - my explanation video would go something like this: ""They made it up in a day to get you to not focus on the fact there is nothing tying all these worlds together"". Very overrated.. Nostalgia User, as good as i remembered ....................................... This is what every action rpg should inspire to be. Kingdom Hearts is like the smash bros of action rpgs. You get KH characters, Square Enix characters, and Disney characters in one shabang. Get ready for a cliffhanger and tears though.. One of the most versatile action rpgs of that generation, Kingdom Hearts breathes fresh life into the genre setting a standard for those to come even today. A magical combination of Final Fantasy and Disney may sound ridiculous but mixes fluidly in the context of the game. Kingdom Hearts is filled to the brim with charm and whimsy and brings out the kid in anyone. The story of Kingdom Hearts has become an absolute joke nowadays, but the first game has a pretty fun and exciting story, in some places anyway. To say this game is without flaw is to deny it of its charm, and makes it more appreciative the longer time goes to where the controls feel like it was just released weeks ago. If you ever get a chance, definitely pick up the HD Remix.. This game is the second kingdom hearts i played and its feel small compare to the rest of the games of the series but knowing it was the beginning i give it a pass, overall a good start to a successful franchise and music as well.. Good game, with a good history, immersed in a Disney world which makes it more passionate. The mechanical could be boring, and some bosses are difficult considering it for a kid's game. Really fun game. Definitely has its flaws. Kingdom Hearts is an Action-Adventure RPG set in the worlds of Disney settings and characters while also mixing in with some Final Fantasy characters. I had a ton of fun with this game. Some abilities I never used. I love that you get different ""Keyblades"". The story is kinda corny with it's ""friends forever and friends do anything for each other and we will be evil with the power of FRIENDSHIP"". If you can I'd play this on the KH 1.5+2.5 ReMIX. Basically remastered for PS4 & Xbox One. 7.3/10. While combat mechanics aren’t very deep, the intricate level design and semi-coherent story make this the best in the series. The soundtrack and visuals are legendary, I don’t really need to say much more. It was the best use of Disney IPs in a video game when I first played it 20+ years ago and that remains true to this day.. One of my first games and it still holds up as an absolute classics. Say what you will about the series it clearly started out pretty strong.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As soon as I saw Final Fantasy x Disney, I hoped on that good stuff faster than the speed of light. Simple plot compared to the rest of the series, a great first JRPG for people who don't like JRPGs.. Crazy that they mix Disney and Square characters and it works, the video game. 65/100 Kingdom Hearts is a charming videogame. A unique, whimsical epic tale of friendship, heroes and darkness. Its strength isn't a complex storyline but a cast of great characters with heartfelt interactions and a strong emotional core, enhanced by an enchanting soundtrack that expertly blends solemnity and magical whimsy, giving the game a distinct personality. Combat is fun and satisfying thanks to Abilities, frequently adding new layers and variables to combos, a balanced, diversified Magic system that offers various different ways to approach a fight both offensive and defensive, and last but not least a great enemy variety, although a bosses are of extremely fluctuating quality: some great, others very plain. Level Design smartly works around the modest size of its rooms with rewarding level design with a lot of depth and variety. Every new area has a simple but pleasantly distinct type of progression with different maps, puzzles, platforming challenges and many hidden secrets that add content and flavor to the exploration. The presence of many secret bosses after the main campaign offers an additional great challenge for the more daring players. The weakest point of the experience are definitely the sections piloting the spaceship called Gummiship: a very cute idea to add variety, but so slow and tedious that it would've been better to just put that development effort somewhere else.. Kingdom Hearts is one of the video games of all time. Don’t change my mind.. even on a first playthrough there's something about this game that just feels nostalgic. the best game ps2 graphics good level design good scenario taking a secret cutscene for regular players too bad there are only disney worlds and not final fantasy. Absolute classic ****. For a 20 year game it trully held up to the test of time. With its epic boss fights, Cool attack animations, Memorable story, godtier music. Whats not to love.. Playing this game for the first time is a incredible experience, especially if you already are a fan of Disney and Final Fantasy; there was nothing like this before. Some problems such as the platforming sections and the bad camera makes me not give a bigger score, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a big experience that started a fantastic franchise.. Kingdom Hearts is very fun at times, but quite boring, repetitive, and confusing at others. The designs are very pretty and have a lot of charm to them, which is always a plus, but interacting with the world feels clunky and, oftentimes, strange. The game hardly ever makes sense when it comes to what to do next and has you interact with items and set-pieces in strange and convoluted ways. The combat is fun, but surprisingly tough and manages to be quite unforgiving. This isn't a bad game, though. If you have a guide by your side, and a lot of spare time, the characters, story, dialogue, and world around you may be enough to pull you in.. On paper, Kingdom Hearts should not have worked, yet the end result is a winning collaboration between two very unlikely partners. Kingdom Hearts is pure joy from beginning to end, with an accessible yet fun real-time battle system and a charming story with fun characters. While there is fanservice galore for both Disney and Final Fantasy fans, Kingdom Hearts doesn't rely solely on its fanservice to deliver a strong product.. PS4 version here. Good game but sometimes frustrating, probably due to its age. Sometimes you don't know where to go and keep moving at random between the rooms to advance the story. Endless waves of heartless can also be tedious. Still, good game. Don't think it's an easy one because of the Disney characters, I found it more difficult than most of the final fantasy I played.. Fantastic story, very simple and easy to understand. Visual art style at it's best! The harmony between Disney and square enix is fascinating to say the least! Music is top tier, characters are well developed and you really feel like you are bonding with them! Only bad thing i can say is that after a while combat gets a bit repetitive, but its not that tragic, and the camera controls are horrific. Still that won't stop you from enjoying this amazing game. This video game will always remain a masterpiece in my mind. Nobody was quite sure what to make of it at the time - a Disney and Final Fantasy crossover featuring a spiky haired young boy who swings around a giant key? Well, it somehow made it work! Everything about this game - the world, story, battles and more - all contribute to a perfect experience. The only thing I didn't like was the battle menu interface and the camera but these were minor.. The quality in kh1 is very good, the combat is rough after you play the next numbered games, but it's not bad, and it didn't aged poorly. The Pacing is Very good, every disney world feels connected to the whole plot. I still prefer 2 slightly, but they are in the same spot in my Kingdom hearts Tier list.. That was my first Kingdom Hearts game and I can say that it was good enough, especially for a 2002 game. I will certainly play KH2 and KH3. I give this game a 6,4/10 rating. Kingdom Hearts is an action RPG that mixes Final Fantasy and Disney. I really appreciated to see different Disney worlds with unique features. I think also some worlds are really well done and the exploration part can be interesting for a few of those worlds. However, here is the less good about this game: 1. The camera is bad and it will have a negative impact on the combat 2. The combat is really clunky in general which is a difficulty factor to consider 3. Some worlds are ugly. I almost quitted the game when I was in the jungle world 4. At times, game is not intuitive and you don't know where to go 5. There are giant difficulty spikes near the end which I wasn't prepared for...(See my recommendations in the end of this review) 6. Story is average, a bit ****'t expect something like Final Fantasy However, I still had a good time with this game. If you want to take full advantage of this game and has a smooth experience, you can consider my recommendations: 1. Don't rush the game ! For exemple, if you finish a world, take the time to revisit the previous worlds and grind a few levels. You will also have the opportinity to unlock new areas or open new chests 2. There is an important difficulty spike for the last world. Be sure to do a lot of optional content (upgrade all your abilities, find all the dalmatians, synthesise more items, etc...) 3. Don't bother with the Gummi ship garage...I didn't find this part relevant 4. Do your first playthrough on normal difficulty (Like I said, bad controls is a difficulty factor) 5. Take this game for what it is. It has important flaws but has something unique. Personnaly, it reminded me of my childhood and great Disney movies.. The 3rd best KH game behind KH2 and KH3:ReMind and those two for me is 2 of best games of all time! KH1 is not one of the best games for me but it doesn't mean its not amazing! It's the origin of the franchise which gives it a lot of respect for it but gameplay is lacking in a lot of ways with several rough edges.. Where it all started... This game has a great nostalgia effect on me, but it's not just nostalgia, this game is a forever classic. What make this game unique compared to other games in the series is the perfect combination of Square Enix and Disney in a balanced mixture. It's magical story is something you won't experience again in the series. It's definitely a must-play.. Honestly one of my best memories as a kid picking out the box and not knowing what kinda game i was getting. So much charm and colour with interesting characters, worlds and gameplay absolute masterpiece later games kinda diluted the magic down but on its own a masterpiece.. [ENG] I really liked this game, despite having some ''bad'' graphics for the ''nowadays'' time, I got used to the graphics, and what impressed me was the great story developed about friendship, companionship and adventure, I found the game very difficult when fighting the bosses, but it was a very fun challenge, I recommend it a lot [PT-BR] Gostei muito desse jogo, apesar de ter uns gráficos um pouco ''ruim'' para a época de ''hoje em dia'' eu me acostumei com os gráficos, e o que me impressionou foi a ótima história desenvolvida sobre amizade, companherismo e aventura, achei o jogo bem difícil na luta contra os bosses, mas foi um desafio muito divertido, recomendo demais. Great combination of the worlds of Final Fantasy and Disney. I was shocked when I read the announcement. FF and Disney? This can not go .... But it worked. And it came out perfectly! Divine (for ps2) graphics, divine music, divine storyline, divine combat system, divine gameplay ... DIVINE GAME. I would recommend it to everyone!. this game is a MASTERPIECE so iconic even today, ireally enjoyed the ps2 version even more on the 1.5 !. The most boring start possible, the most clunky, horrible controls, awful camera. Just unplayable. It started so bad that I just couldn't play any longer. I'd have more fun working my way through a pile of ironing then stabbimg my eyes with a pencil.. Amazing game for sure. Kingdom Hearts 1 was a childhood game for me but even without nostalgia, I would hold it in high regard. It looks great, has an interesting story, charming characters, interesting Disney based worlds, a somehwat simple but satisfying combat system and nice boss fights and music. I love the HUD, I love graphics, I love the magic/MP system, I absolutely love that idea of having a key as a sword that changes with certain keychains and overall, this game is a must have for Action-RPG fans.. Its **** awesome, I play this game since I have memory and ever I finish I love it more. Easily one of my least favorite games to get platinum on. I got it because I always heard great things about it but aside of the nostalgia of Disney characters that I've always known and loved everything about this game fell flat for me. I didn't care about any of the original characters, the story was a borefest, and the mechanics were awful. Then again, I never played them during their time so that could be why I'm not looking at this game through rose-colored glasses.. Wonderfull This is the start of one of my favourite series of all time. A great story connected with an woderfull open world.. Exploration is dull and boring with hardly any directions given, combat is slow and time-consuming and while the story is good, its not enough to make you want to play this game. Buy this game only if youre 100% sure you want to see what kingdom hearts's story is all about. Not if you want to play for the gameplay.. Kingdom hearts is a great game but far from perfect. the camera can be uncooperative the combat machines can get repetitive at times in the first half of the game. But in the second half there's a handful of upgrades to your abilities there's nice amount of depth to your arsenal you can get a lot of Useful items and magical powers and your party members can also be helpful... the battles themselves are so much fun and the bosses are some of best thing the game can offer they're challenging in good way and required some serious skills to win and it feels so rewarding when you win and you get better and better at this game. the biggest flaw in the game are the unskippable cutscenes it's so annoying especially during the hardest boss battles after you die you need to rewatch them again. it's easy to get lost in some of the levels so you need to pay attention to the story.. the story is great I love the characters and the plot and the Disney worlds are great they are well designed with catchy and amazing soundtrack.. Kingdom Hearts 1 is the first game of the series and is doing a great job in introducing the characters and the gameplay. Since it is really old nowadays, the controls are a bit clunky. But Kingdom Hearts is an experience which is mixing Disney and Square Enix in such a quality, that the experience is really worth it in my opinion. I enjoyed Kingdom Hearts 1 a lot. I recommend it to everyone who likes things like Action RPG's, Disney or Anime. You could also say that Kingdom Hearts is ""Disney meets Anime"". The game is also on Game Pass right now, so you can give it a shot if you have it. Also the collection ""The Story so Far"" for PS4 and Xbox One is a lot of content, which also includes KH1.. I don't really understand the praise this game gets. My main problem is that the combat is monotonous and even mind numbingly boring during the games harder sections. It's a button masher where you occasionally have to heal, so you can imagine how dull it gets throughout this 25 hour long game. This isn't to even mention the camera either. When it did impress me, however, is when it layed off with the combat and instead indulged in it's adventure aspects by letting me treasure hunt and find secrets within it's levels. The levels themselves were still fun to play around in, even though they're horribly lifeless by today's standard. It's story is also nothing to write home about. It's nice, but nothing amazing. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning as a highlight of the game. Although i had fun here and there, the combat was simply too prevalent to really enjoy it. I simply spent most of my time mashing the x button mindlessly over and over again for minutes on end.. Kingdom Hearts is quite the unique game, linking the two beloved worlds of Final Fantasy and Disney. Despite neither catching very much of my interest throughout my life, I always had a fondness for Kingdom Hearts. Its a very nostalgic property for me. I used to play KH1 and KH2 a lot as a child but never got very far, always getting stuck due to difficulty or lack of knowledge as to where to go next. I finally decided I would stay dedicated and play through the whole game. Despite what most fans will tell you about the controls being outdated and future games being generally better experiences, I still had a lot of fun with Kingdom Hearts. It was pretty difficult at times, especially with the final boss but I managed to get through it on normal difficulty. I've played through most of KH2 at the time of me writing this (November 2019) but I'm stuck on the Roxas battle. Even without having completed it, I definitely prefer the sequel for it's improved gameplay and more interesting worlds to explore. Regardless, the original is still very much worth playing. I beat this game in February of 2019.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its been a hot minute since I played this game, but I can't wait to replay it in the Final Mix version I got. Still, the basic premise of Kingdom Hearts is amazing and lives up to the anticipation of marrying Disney with action hack and slash games. The story is enthralling (especially since I understand it got significantly more complicated following this first entry in the series). Gameplay is fun from each Disney world to the next, and I particularly remember enjoying the Colosseum battles. I never got into the gummy ship mini game between worlds and honestly was more or less waiting for those intermissions to be over. Still, this was truly an adventure to experience and I can't wait to replay it with a fresh coat of HD.. Of course it's Kingdom Hearts!. What could've ended up as a ridiculous mess just to get Disney fans into Final Fantasy, has turned out to become a fun, engaging, and heartfelt adventure filled with familiar faces we all know and love. As well as original characters we've come to love as well.. I love the first KH and its hold a lot of memory, funny I started with the final mix as I thought it was cool to have English voice with Japanese subtitles. The battles and storys amazing iv played this game so","despite its flaws, the game’s vibrant visuals, unforgettable soundtrack, and themes of friendship and courage make it an enduring masterpiece . Considering what this game is, it is shocking to me to this day it exists, and it created my favorite franchise of all time . the game is boring and dull, and the main character lacks personality, the combat system is boring ."
"1,162.Frostpunk 2","Forget everything you knew about the original because it simply doesn't translate to the sequel. I can appreciate all the new things they wanted to try but they changed too much, too fast. Frostpunk 2 comes off as a loose Frostpunk clone rather than a true successor.. Best Survival Strateggame, great sequel especially with the involvement of politics in the game. Very unique in every factions.. Honestly I like it! Frostpunk 2 is a pretty solid sequel to the amazing first game. For real, I’m vibing with almost everything here. Every mechanic got a major overhaul, and most of the time it’s for the better. One of the coolest changes? Time is tracked by days now, not hours, and the population isn’t counted in dozens or hundreds anymore—it’s in the thousands. Yeah, some people are throwing shade, saying it feels more like Cities Skylines and that deaths don’t hit as hard emotionally. But honestly? I’m all for it. The sequel isn’t just a rehash of the first game, and the massive city scale makes it feel way more epic. Bottom line? Totally worth the price tag.. Tedious gameplay mechanics, atrocious user interface, mediocre story. Everything feels convoluted. Colony management feels like a chore, especially given the bad user interface. They took away the fun parts, and added extremely boring mechanics instead. Stick to the first intallment.. A true successor to a genre-defying game, only shackled by it's unfortunate suboptimization. Whether it be the jaw dropping graphics, or the incredible depth of the political-like system implemented within the game, the Main Story will have fans addicted, hanging for the next twist in the plot, with those who wish for more able to take advantage of the game's sandbox mode. The game adds to what it was previously, bringing a new perspective to a much larger, broader horizon, managing tens of thousands, rather than a few hundred. Making individuals less meaningful, and rather forcing users to satisfy the collective was a much welcome change, and will have anyone appreciate the piece of art put forward. Hopefully, in the near future, the overall performance of the game can be improved, otherwise, a strong argument can be put forth in debating this piece of media in terms of perfection.. Frostpunk 2 builds on its predecessor’s brutal survival mechanics, immersing players in a post-apocalyptic world where managing resources, society, and politics is key. The game introduces new challenges, such as faction management and the “Idea Tree” for technological innovation. The beautifully detailed world, set in an industrial late-1800s style, adds depth, while dark humor provides moments of relief in an otherwise grim atmosphere. However, the complex systems may overwhelm some players, making it a demanding but rewarding experience for fans of intricate city-building games. A great game in general. However, it suffers most in direct comparison to its predecessor, which I value the better of the two. Frostpunk 2 is not quite up there where it could have been.. Confusing, boring, unoptimized. Feels tedious like crazy work and not something entertaining. Boring, confusing and overall disappointing plus extremely demanding. UI panel is a mess without any explanation of how gameplay elements work the game leaves you to make a guess. Too many stupid texts to read blah blah do this blah blah blah do that. Many crazy factions appear suddenly always have demands and you have to appease them or else they cause trouble. Too many unnecessary research for mostly useless things. Game feels like a chore i can't recommend. Great visuals but not so polished like first one also i like FP 1 a lot more simple because you connect with people and they are visible all the time..This one in same cases felt like just spamming buildings,still a great idea for a game , maybe dlc will add more,for now a solid 8. all the fun parts,robots, exploring, cold visual arts, have been removed from FP1 then isolated & uncooked elements are added.. Good overall and a lot of depth and difficul choices. It does build suspense well here and there. However, I did not personally prefer the move to the Civ5 hexagon approach to the city building. I also found aspects of the mechanics to be cryptic and not well explained. Finally, what really hurts it is some pretty bad freeze/lag when you switch from one settlement to another. The game will just freeze in the top down view without being able to zoom in until things load. There is no indicator for what is happening, it just looks like you don't have a settlement there.. FP2 shouldn't even be called a sequel. It's an entirely different game that lacks the charm of its predecessor. The new one feels like a Paradox game, and you need a master's degree to play it. 4/10.. One of the generator upgrades is bugged (not fixed for an entire month it has been known) and the council is uninteractive, includes a save scumming promoting rng element and does not add anything to the game. **** performance and generally buggy mess. Not a single braincell was spent thinking about game mechanics, and whether they are enjoyable or entertaining, and certainly no one that probably isn't a simp for the studio/game has been hired to actually playtest, at least, the campaign from start to finish. Try it on xbox game pass if you want, but do not buy it for the insulting full price.. As a dedicated fan of the original Frostpunk, I approached Frostpunk 2 with both excitement and scepticism. Unfortunately, the new systems felt like a far cry from its predecessor for me, resembling more of an Anno in the snow than the gritty survival game I adored. The developers’ attempt to innovate is understandable, but in doing so, they've alienated many loyal fans. The once-charismatic city now feels impersonal and anonymous, stripping away the charm that made the first game so captivating. Individual characters seem insignificant, lost in a faceless crowd, which makes it hard to care about their fate. I don't ever care about the weather anymore. The districts are redudant and restrictive. The new mechanics give the game a completely different vibe. Despite giving it a fair shot, it just didn’t resonate with me. It feels like Frostpunk 2 has lost its unique identity, and with it, a lot of what made the original so special. Nonetheless, I wish the developers all the best and hope that the next game from 11Bit matches my taste again.. Needs some time but has plenty of new ideas to develop your world. Fantastic performance.. Needs some tweaking, but very glad that it is an evolution from the first game. Thematically coherent and enjoyed thestory mode, Hope that they will add more. I don't know why I can't get into other builders but I really enjoyed this one (and the first) Date Completed: 2024-10-09 Playtime: 11h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: Yeah. Great Game! Frostpunk 2 has undergone a significant evolution compared to its predecessor, offering a completely new experience that brings freshness to a familiar world. It’s definitely not just ""more of the same"" – rather, it’s a step forward that delivers new challenges and excitement, making it particularly engaging. One of the game's biggest strengths is the increased difficulty level, which requires players to think strategically. Planning several steps ahead, ensuring synergy between districts, and dealing with unexpected challenges all contribute to a highly satisfying experience. Every decision matters, enhancing the sense of responsibility and achievement. Although the cold mechanics have taken a backseat, I believe this has worked in the game’s favor. This shift has made room for more complex elements, such as politics and resource management. These additional aspects enrich the gameplay, adding depth and a wider range of challenges. The expanded resource system and innovative approach to harvesting them make the game even more captivating. While the focus on politics has received some criticism, it's worth noting that this aspect has been implemented quite effectively. Managing factions, passing laws, and handling political nuances add another layer of depth to the game. Even if a law gets rejected, you can always propose it again, which makes the game more realistic and gives a sense of control over the events. A definite improvement is the overhaul of exploration and colonization mechanics. The new system for managing outposts and bases is intuitive and doesn’t overwhelm the player with external tasks, allowing them to focus on developing the main city. This makes exploring the world more satisfying, and the game benefits from smoother and more dynamic **** conclusion, the new installment offers deeper, more strategic challenges that can engage players for hours. With varied mechanics, well-implemented innovations, and the satisfaction of management, this is a highly successful sequel that has the potential to pleasantly surprise both fans of the first game and newcomers alike.. an excellent continuation of the first part, every aspect of the game has become better felt except for the atmosphere of hopelessness. but otherwise. The game has stepped forward. Frostpunk 2 is a deep strategy game that tests your ability to manage resources and make complex moral decisions. The tension between the different factions and the consequences of choices make each game unique and engaging. Despite some technical difficulties, the game offers an intense experience, where every action can determine the fate of your city.. I love this game! No... they didn't remake Frostpunk, so if you're looking for that, then you'll be happier just playing the original with it's DLC's. Frostpunk 2 is larger in scope with different mechanics, but at it's core it's still Frostpunk. If you like survival RTS games and politics, then it's definitely a buy.. A perfect sequel. Like Aliens after Alien. A good sequel is simply not a rehash, just prettier, more colorful and technically better! A good sequel creates something new, expands the basic idea and surprises.Frostpunk2 did all that. I thank the developers for their courage and their ideas. The first part was a fantastic experience because it made the community's struggle for survival so transparent, touched me emotionally like hardly any other game and confronted me with moral decisions. And the 2nd part takes strengths from the first part, but sets a new focus! Expanding the scale and adding a political part was a brilliant idea! It takes the dilemmas that were part of the fascination of the first part to a new level. Even in the first part, the question was always: what do I sacrifice for survival? In the second part, it is elaborated even more: The question is: how does our society want to live, but also and above all how do I keep a society together! Few games have reached this depth for me! It's also a very good building game and I like the graphics and sound/music very **** me, it's the best game of the year so far!. Frostpunk was a masterpiece a true brutal survival game , the best game in terms of morale choice's , and frostpunk 2 was a perfect sequel the transition from the city most survive to the City must not fall was awesome. After getting addicted to the game a few days I have to say I am disappointed. The game is too easy on hardest once you figure it out. Way easier then the first. Big fan of Unreal Engine but weird choice and implementation is VERY VERY demanding for no good reason, more so then many 1st and 3rd person games done in UE5. Even with lightning and shadows to low and DLSS to balanced I cant get 60 FPS where I get that in other UE5 games with DLSS on quality! Visually it seems to take style and visuals over gameplay, and that is bad. And I do not even think the game looks that impressive, they could just stick to Unity and have a more clear look. FP1 was more pleasant to look at and IXION even better, both done in Unity and run better and its all that is needed. You build in tiles, not really bad BUT you have to press a key to even see where your buildings are, you have to hover over your districts to even see where there start and end, its annoying. The city builds itself and the devs are super proud of this fancy dynamic city that builds itself based on where you placed things but its weird. Same goes for trails and skylines, it picks style over play ability as its not easy to see where you already build and it actually builds not where you place things but dynamically near that. Mechanics are flawed and annoying after a while. Massive illusion of choice as you are basically forced to just do what your factions demand most of the time on harder difficulties. I failed a few times figuring out how the game works but after I finished the story I finished two ""Utopia Builder runs on hardest (Captain) difficulty and easy finished them both on the 2nd try after I figured out he map and resource limits and things. All the end game mechanics are totally meaningless and irrelevant. The game is decided LONG b4 that, its not really well thought out. And choosing different factions barely effects anything really. There is no ""playstyle"" its just tiny bonuses and things that you get at the very end when you already made it. The first and 2nd storm are the hardest, and the game is very forgiving even on captain you can lack every resource I basically NEVER have anything stored but as long as the deficit is not to high you are fine. Sadly if you really play the game for long you find out how flawed it actually is. Its very much like the 1st game, despite what people claim. Lots of things are exactly the game. Generator, fuel, heat, cores. It just feels more sandboxy and has a bigger scale and more mechanics that in the end give you way more opportunity to turn things around. In a way this is a good thing but it lacks serious fun challenge, its not easy but its repetitive, gets boring and annoying and the endgame is really filled with lots of things you will never need. Maybe DLCs and mods can save the game but probably not. FP1 on hardest was too hard for me actually, it felt like if you made one tiny mistake in the beginning it all spiraled to the end, it was too much like ""turn heater on in that exact second or die"" type of gameplay that was not that good either, but at least it was like constrained and thought out very well so it was actually very challenging. FP2 just offers so much stuff without giving it actually an opportunity to really shine. And overall I think the first game is better in both graphics (for gameplay) and the gameplay itself. Again UE5 is great but a game that tries so hard to look fancy that it ends up just looking confusing annoying. It took me a while to get used to it. The UI is stunning but also has like shifting elements after clicking it that are not very good for gameplay. Also why TF do I not get the generator view by default when clicking the generator? So annoying. Also the ""switch between city/settelements key simply do NOT WORK, last patch 1.0.4, bind them to different keys, nothing happens when I press them. Its also annoying to sit through the annoying ass voting animation 100 times. If you just play the game for a 9 hour or some story then this is more for you but if you look for some deep engaging RTS this is sadly not really it.. It shifted gameplay to another level. Instead of building every single house you're managing multiple colonies. I very liked Frostpunk 1 and i also ejnoed very much second part. It's different game now but for me even better.. Frostpunk 2 is a great game with a fresh, non-standard approach for a sequel. While I still think the first game was a little better, it’s close. If the original was a 10/10, I’d give Frostpunk 2 a solid 8/10—probably because I miss the intense survival pressure. The district/city scale makes things feel a bit too easy. That said, it’s still a must-play with an excellent story and fantastic multi-city mechanics.I also agree with many people who point out the lack of story development and the number-focused gameplay, which misses the difficulty of moral choices and the attachment to individual citizens. The emotional stakes just aren’t as high as in the first game, which detracts a little from the overall experience.. Very good atmospheric game. Great setting and drama. Will the city survive? Factions are well tought-out. Exploring the unknown is a great idea. Music is very well composed and suits the dramatic atmosphere very well. It never sounds repeating. Graphic is nice and steam punk style. The only critic are the slowdowns when the game saves. A real must have for people who like survival.. Extremely dissapointed, all the fun building aspects removed and it's basically a politics simulator. No thanks, refund.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really enjoyed my time with Frostpunk 2 and loved the grander scale the developers pursued. I want to applaud the team for trying something new and different. Of course, it may not satisfy fans of the original who preferred similar gameplay with improved visuals. I believe Frostpunk 2 has taken a risky path and come out successful. Perhaps in Frostpunk 3, the developers could merge the best aspects of both the original and the sequel for a more solid experience. My main issue with the game is its poor performance and QA errors in the text. I encountered multiple instances of grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences. For a game where text is the primary way of communicating the narrative, this QA oversight was disappointing. All in all, I recommend players give this game a try with an open mind. Think of it as a radical experiment in the genre, rather than a faithful sequel.. Even with an above average system, it cannot provide the expected performance at 1080p resolution. (i5 13400 - Rtx 3050-32 gb ram) You will have to lower the graphics to solve the fps drops. As a result, in a game where you want to watch beautiful city views, you will be left with a muddy city view where no details can be distinguished. Optimization problems destroy all the gameplay fun. I left it, I wish all i9+4090+4k monitor owners good games. (sorry for bad english). I am a huge fan of City Builders and Strategy game and this is such a good balance of both. With a great story and such a unique blend of balancing various factions and politics, I would say this game is a must play!. Great game, haven't had any performance issues or bugs. Yes the game is different but they couldn't just make the same game again. I think it's a good direction to move, expanding on the scope massively and I'm looking forward to future content.. Graphics- 10/10 it's a BEAUTIFUL game, the graphics are deep and you can see your town come to life and see the devastation of the snow covered plains. Gameplay: 8/10 the mechanics are put together nicely, but I wish it would have had more towns and locations to build upon. You needed to keep up with the resources, and keepyour town from imploding, but once you've balanced out your resources, it doesn't really have to much more to it. Story: 4/10 The story.... felt lacking. Don't get me wrong the premise is there, but it ends as fast as it starts and you are left with one question... is that it? I've finished the story rather quick and it didn't really have any engaging toss and turns, just felt like I was a kid reading a 100 page short story. Overall I recommemd this game for it's gameplay and graphics, but if you are looking for an engaging story, this wouldn't be right for you. a perfect continuation of the first part, different than 1st but the same good. I have a 4080 laptop with frame generation on and I really think this needs to have better fps. I like that this game is confident trying new mechanics which are way different than the first game. Be warned, this game is addicting, slept at around 11am in the morning. This is on the high end of 8, around 8.8.. Despite what some of the more negative reviews are saying, I think that 8 Bit Studios really maximized on their Frostpunk I.P. 8 Bit did a great job changing up the gameplay while writing and expanding on the great lore through in-game events. The gameplay is now at a much larger scale, which makes sense logically since it takes place 30 years after the predecessor. The constant loop of frostbreaking to gather resources, worrying about workforce, balancing the books of politics are what make this game just as great, if not better than the ladder. I also liked the outpost mechanic, which made it seem like I was managing multiple cities at once. The story is also enticing, with each event and decision affecting you, your people, and your cities. The political system was a great addition, often reminding me of my own country's politics and their supporters. Lastly, I rarely write reviews at all, but when I do, it's usually for a really great, or terrible game. This being one of the greatest games because as a gamer, I can't think of the last time I have sat down and ""binged"" an entire game in 3 days. Usually I switch games games around or don't have enough time to really play them, but this game had me on for 3 days straight. That, to me is a sign of a 10/10 game.. Game feels like a series relaunch after some failure. Nothing original in mechanics, only confirmed successed features. Managing peoples destiny became managing numbers and raitings. Nothing happening in the city gives any emotions. Houndreds died - it doesn't matter, because thousands were born. Some people left the city - it doesn't matter, because more people arrived from nowhere. Story mode does not provide any story at all. Explore ice desert to search something somewhere to survive some winter storm. It is free game mode, called as story mode for some reason. No desicions feels right becuse some faction will be angry. No desicion fells wrong, because their approoval now just numbers as resources in stock. Personal stories completely disconnected from your decisions, irritates even more then ""new features"". I have no idea what sense is in global strategy mechanics if it is a still a city in the middle of nowhere.. This game is harder, more complex, and visually more appealing than the first. I felt lots of emotions while playing. However, while the first game was more focused on people's emotions and atmosphere, the second game focuses more on citybuilding and managing problems both in the environment and in people.. Many reviewers have written - it is missing the soul. Yes, this is exactly the case here, you do not see people any more, just nice buildings. It is bigger, colder, more complicated and more distant. The game evolved into a frosty, political-resource manager. Is it a good direction? I don't think so.. First-time Frostpunk player through Xbox Game Pass on PC. I have never played a city-builder (like Anno 1800) that is this immersive, or anything else for that matter. The faction-based 'politics,' researching new ideas, exploring the Frostlands—everything works really well together. A few things I wish were handled differently: 1. I miss a level of detail for buildings/districts. I would love to see citizens going about their daily tasks (like you can in Anno 1800). You have the option to zoom into buildings/districts, but it feels clunky. 2. I would have liked a bit more time to research ideas, explore the Frostlands, and expand in general. The story mode events felt compressed into too short of a time frame, in my opinion. I have really enjoyed my time playing Frostpunk 2!. This game is simply amazing. Most of negative comments come from fans of tre original Frostpunk, and this game is different, but in my opinion it is a step in the right direction. It is more complex, but I didn't find it too hard, despite the fact that I rarely play RTS games and almost never survival games.. Game differs in some aspects, sometimes i like FP1 more sometimes i like FP2 more however i have the same level of fun playing Frostpunk 2.. The management aspect of the game should differentiate it from the first game, especially the trading between cities, but the poor performance and constant crashes make it very disappointing.. This is an excellent game! In times of remakes, short-cuts, risk-averse solutions and feel-good entertainment, very few have the courage to tell us uncomfortable truths. We no longer see originality in anything. Our opinions are no longer confronted. We are no longer asked to think for ourselves. Well, Frostpunk 2 is different. It does not treat you like an idiot. It does not take the easy way. It does challenge your views; makes you doubt what you have taken for granted so far. It doesn’t necessarily have to change your mind but it makes you rethink your opinions in ways you rarely have before. It asks uncomfortable questions that help you understand the wider spectrum of consequences for your most absolute truths. Most of all, however, what this game does best is make you realize how there is no solution that suits all. How every decision can be right for someone and wrong for another. How every idea has a cost. And that is worth a lot in a polarized world of absolutes.. Nice game. I hope Frostpunk 2 will have some DLC-s because is is a pleasure.. Personally, I'm disappointed. I really liked the graphics of the game environment, the game mechanics compared to the previous game made me feel that this wasn't worth spending money on. As a hardcore fan of the first installment, I am sadly disappointed.. Great game. Maybe a little difficult at first, but later it's hard to break away from it. A worthy successor to Frostpunk 1.. It's impressive that 11 bit took the bold step of creating a sequel so distinct from the original. While it retains a similar atmosphere, the game expands significantly in scope compared to FP1 and executes it effectively. Managing the city on a broader, macro level feels natural and works well. The art direction and soundtrack, as always, great. On the other hand tutorial and optimalization are quite bad. First time Frostpunk player and I am loving the game. Hours just disappear while playing.. I really like the atmosphere and new bigger scale of the game! I already loved the first one with all its dlc‘s and Frostpunk 2 feels like the right evolution. Frostpunk‘s biggest strength is the questions it asks. What are you willing to sacrifice for the survival of humanity. Will the society that has survived be worth living in?. Fun. Bigger. Better. Evolutionary step in the gameplay with new elements carefuly fit into the game. Having a blast with Frostpunk 2.. What is this garbage, nothing is obvious, everything is a struggle. I don't mean the difficulty of the game, but just the general UI, to do basic stuff like build something to produce food, it so clunky. Thing shut down but it doesn;t say why, you need things but it doesn't highlight what you need, you need more heat but doesn't how how to produce more, just nothing is obvious, it just garbage. Who ever had a hand in designing this clearly didn't work on FP1, and if they did, they must have hit there head.. There are more complex Mechanics like the Democratic Parties/Systems, a Far Greater City and i think the coming Mods are gonna make the game much greater.. It's completely different than the first game, but it is its natural evolution and I think gameplay wise It's ultimately a better game, however since the scale is grander it's more disconnected and doesn't feel as personal as the first instalment. The management mechanics are well done and are deep, the game is beautiful (I was particularly impressed by the civil war state). Its tasks and quests that you are assigned are more intricate than the first game and present a challenge. However you have tens of thousand of people living in your city so your decisions don't feel like they do as much as they used to. The previous game had a lot more very personal stories for example you sent out workers during a very snowy day to collect coal since the hole city would die of cold if you hadn't and now 20 of those workers had their limbs amputated. You sent children to the mines to improve their efficiency and the mine collapsed. Because of YOU the workers had lost their arms or legs, because of YOU the children died. In this game you just have a pop up informing you that 176 people where knifed tonight. You just don't get stories that hit this hard in this title (not to say this game doesn't have great stories it does). The laws you can erect are great and a lot more varied than in the first game and what's more interesting you have to vote them in first. In order to do this you (usually) need to negotiate with the various factions that are in the city. You will need to promise them you will build or research something or that you will vote on another law next. If you neglect a certain faction they may start revolting and destroy a district, but maybe another factions praises you and are willing to fight with them for you. The factions and their interactions are definetely the highlight of the game and are well done. The gameplay is a constant state of balancing between your promises and the city's needs and its great. The framerate does start to pick down after the first half of the game and I needs some optimisation, otherwise the game is bug free. In my opinion this game is an evolution of the previous title. While it lost some of its charm it is still a great (slightly less) memorable experience if you don't expect a Frostpunk 1.5. This game has a different atmosphere than the first part. It evokes other emotions. This game is no longer about the survival of a handful of people, it is a game about the survival of all humanity. The scale has increased greatly. Combined with extremely cool visuals, music, style, gameplay (too pumped up a lot, especially the political component), this game deserves the highest rating. One of the best games in its genre.. Bravo to the team on creating a true sequel, not a rehash of the first game. It's this kind of bold choices that push video games forward instead of serving us same games over and over. Support AA and Indie Devs if you want to see more fresh stuff in video games.. Why not give it a fair shot? Of course it’s different—that’s the point! While some may miss the familiar feel, I think it’s great that that they took a bold step to innovate rather than recycle. Come on, folks! Dive in for a few hours, take a moment to appreciate the new direction, and then share your thoughts honestly. Sure, the game has some optimization quirks right now, but what game doesn’t face a few bumps along the way? I trust these will be smoothed out soon enough.. The best game I've ever played in the last 2 years. I felt every bit of despair.. Hahaha, Frostpunk 2on PC is better than GOD of War Ragnarok :D the difficult is high but gameplay ruuuulezzz. Whaaaat a climate !! For me the game is better then first Frostpunk. Great soundtrack and gameplay !. The game lacks soul and detail compared to its predecessor. Art, music and performance all disappoint. Mechanics seem simplified and the terror is gone.. This isn't Frostpunk 1. It's a sequel. Too many sequels are scared to try anything new. This one makes a bold choice to add elements of new genres. This time around the game feels like a grand strategy game. This change has caused much butthurt in a small, crybaby sub-population of gamers. They seem to have expected to be spoon-fed an exact replica of Frostpunk 1, like toddlers in a high-chair afraid to try more than apple sauce. If the essence of Frostpunk 1 was theme and story and choice, those are present in abundance here. Frostpunk 2 has added an entirely new layer of political drama. Now it is less game-like and more realistic: you are not so much a dictator who can click out orders freely, and instead a leader who must balance the threats and desires of competing factions.","the main story is a true successor to a genre-defying game, only shackled by its unfortunate suboptimization . the game adds to what it was previously, bringing a new perspective to a much larger, broader horizon, managing tens of thousands, rather than a few hundred ."
"1,163.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales","Story isn't great. The game even years later is buggy. This would fit better as a DLC than as a full game.. Great game overall, but not quite on the same level as the original. Some of the storylines started to feel a bit repetitive or frustrating toward the end, though the conclusion was satisfying. Still, it’s a solid experience and definitely worth playing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me, the previous game was a 10/10. This game definitely falls short by comparison. As pretty much everyone points out, it's short. It ran me 8 hours and I was by no means plowing through the main story. I think if you were you would probably wrap up in something like 6 hours. The other huge issue didn't really become apparent for me till you start the final chapter at the point of no return. Once you get there, bugs, bad combat encounters, bad boss encounters, and full game freezes are all at an all-time high. I had significantly fewer of all of those issues in the first 2/3rds of the game. Sadly, the longer you play, the worse the game gets. Story, combat, performance, everything. So you have a game that starts as a 10, and by the time you finish it, it feels more like a 7.5. Definitely worth playing, just not at full price.. While being the weakest entry it is not bad by any means. The game tells a great story with the same great traversal and combat system as before. The biggest downfall of this game is the very short story. I was wanting more and since release there has still been no dlc additions.. It is good and funny but I've only one proplem it's the boss between every boss is long Time and it's booring. Will look into it on ps5 since played on the ps4 and I really enjoyed it but will need to play it again on the PS5.. This was the first game I played on my PS5. I think it has a great story with great characters. The combat is satisfying and I like Miles’ character development from the first Spider-Man game. Some say it’s too short but that’s only if you skip all the side missions. Overall, I think it’s a pretty good game.. A nice addition to the franchise but does feel a bit too short cause the story being told is great and left me wanting more.. Best game of all time. The game end will make you cry. Its perfect, in all senses possibles.. A good game but it feels a lot like a DLC, I was left with that impression but it has a really cool story and it's still fantastic to throw webs around the city like Spider-Men. Since it´s marketed as a game, I´ll judge it as a game. It´s just a 6-7 hour DLC. Not worth to pay as much as for a whole game. Also, the story wasn´t that interesting, the side missions are boring, they don´t lead to anything interesting or another story line, just finishing skill trees, getting suits and powering them up. Miles´ voice is annoying. Another bad thing, he has literally the same personality as Peter and less development, which makes him the same as Peter just less experienced, clumsier (he´s 17) and ""urban"" (hoods in most suits, makes beats, lives in Harlem. That´s IT. Gameplay is of course pretty cool, swinging is amazing, ""exaggerated swagger of a black teen"" is real. Fight mechanics are truly amazing, the reason why it at least has a 5.. In my opinion this is better than the first game. it does not have the same fleshed out story but what it gave us was great and I'm really happy with all the content it provided. A damn delight from top to bottom. Miles' journey as Spider-Man is vastly different from Peter's and this game reflects his personality and surroundings well. The story is really engaging, right up until an ending that nearly jumps the shark in absurdity. However, the gameplay is tight as ever and Miles' extra powers are fun to utilize. The side content is just as engaging as the main storyline.. What I thought was going to be a basic side game turned out to be a pretty fleshed out and good experience. While not as much content as the original game, everything it does have is quality. Story, characters, writing, combat, movement, they're still great. You won't be disappointed.. Epic, short and a little unpolished. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful continuation of Insomniac's Spider-Man.. It doesn't fill like a separate game, more like a DLC to the first Spiderman. My biggest concern is that even in 2024 it's buggy as hell. I have to restart at least 5 times because I was stuck between invisible walls. During car chase crime a couple of times I had to restart the game because landing and fighting buttons didn't spawn and I couldn't proceed. Climbing the walls doesn't feel so smooth, Miles often tries to jump off when you cross the wall corner.. Compared to the first outing this one was inferior in almost all aspects, with annoying protagonist, woke ensemble of characters, tropey villain and repetitive mission design.. The game is really nice with brand new spidey stuff for Miles. Gameplay is once again fantastic and graphics are amazing. The story is kinda weak and the game is really short. Definitely a great game but not perfect. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. awesome game but to short. I higly recommend to play it on PS5 not on ps4 because of performance, visual, loading time and Thanks to haptic feedback in the PS5 controller, you can feel the power of the spider webs with your fingers.. Game ofKim Play DistrictSuperstitious but whoThe story is bad and very short. A masterpiece! Perfect Story, perfect world, perfect graphics and perfect gameplay. Everything a game can be.. you can really feel the swagger of black teen great combati and amazing world traversal. Game is alright, least favourite of the three but still a good introduction to Miles’ powers. It's a good Spiderman game. Traversal and fighting is fluid and fun. Miles is a likable enough character and the plot is interesting and engaging. It's got a shorter story mode as well (about 12 hours to complete) but that's ok considering it's a good plot and it's nice to get a game that doesn't over stay its welcome. If you're a fan of the insomniac series then just a warning that it's best to stop after this game in the series. Spiderman 2 is very controversial in the way it handles Peter Parker.. Sweet baby allways wasting a perfect game why they are interfere with game story. Really Good Game! (Masterpiece) | Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales | 95 Points (4,5 Stars) | Story 8P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 8P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 9P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. A technical marvel at times with the camera in fights and the animations of Miles on another level, but the game follows clichés with awfully written characters that beg to be put on mute at times and this kinda ruins the experience.. I actually loved it, really nice side game. Defo not a main dish, but its really enough for the price. Absolutely love this game and it was the second game i completed on PS5 after Astro's Playroom. Even if the game is super short compared to the2 other entries into the series, there is a reason i platinumed this and it was because of the amazing swing mechanics and fun combat system. The story was also surprisingly interesting especially for such a short game and the ending is quite powerful.. not as strong as marvels spiderman but still very good, story felt very short though. it feels like watching a film, the scenes are very detailed and the storyline is compelling. the fights are a lot of fun and Miles' moveset is very broad and leaves room for creativity in **** setting is well-rendered even if I would have preferred to have explored the interior outside the missions and swinging between the **** of NY is really relaxing, in fact I never used fast travel.despite the game being very short I really think it's a great game and would have liked to immerse myself in Manhattan a bit more. Unfortunately too short and I couldn't enjoy it every aspects. But overall it's a good and fun game. The Spider-Man sequel features Miles Morales with a new set of powers, and playing as him was a fantastic experience. The storyline is equally engaging and captivating, making you want to revisit the game and explore everything again.. DLC for a Spider-Man 2018 for a little more than 20-25 hours. Medium storyline, nothing new in gameplay compared to spider man 2018, NG+ need for a platinum( I got it). bro, this is a spider black man game, thank yall for making a game for black young childs <3. ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" had the potential to be a compelling addition to the Spider-Man gaming franchise, but it ultimately feels more like an extension of ""Spider-Man 2018"" rather than a standalone title. The game's mechanics and environments are nearly identical to its predecessor, raising the question of whether it deserved its own **** of the most glaring issues with ""Miles Morales"" is the lack of innovation in its gameplay mechanics. Players familiar with ""Spider-Man 2018"" will find themselves treading very familiar ground. Swinging through the city, combat, and side activities all feel recycled, with only minor tweaks to differentiate Miles from Peter Parker. While these core mechanics are solid, the lack of new elements makes the experience feel redundant and **** gameplay changes that do exist often make the game feel too easy. Miles' new abilities, such as his bio-electric Venom powers and invisibility, are powerful and fun to use, but they significantly reduce the challenge. This lowered difficulty can make the game boring after a while, as players breeze through encounters that should feel more engaging and rewarding. The sense of progression and accomplishment that made ""Spider-Man 2018"" so satisfying is diminished **** story of ""Miles Morales"" is another area where the game falls short. While it aims to delve into Miles' personal growth and his journey to becoming Spider-Man, the narrative lacks the depth and emotional weight needed to make it compelling. The characters, including Miles himself, are uninteresting and fail to resonate. Attempts to explore deeper themes often feel forced and superficial, leaving players disconnected from the story. The supporting cast, including friends and foes, are equally unremarkable, with dialogue and character development that fall **** game's environments, largely a snowy re-skin of New York City from ""Spider-Man 2018,"" do little to differentiate this title. While the winter setting is visually appealing, it doesn’t offer enough new content to justify a standalone release. The missions and activities scattered throughout the city also lack variety, further contributing to the sense of déjà **** conclusion, ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" feels like an unnecessary standalone title that fails to build on the foundation laid by ""Spider-Man 2018."" With mechanics and environments that are nearly identical to its predecessor, minor gameplay changes that make the game too easy, and an uninteresting story with unlikeable characters, it struggles to justify its existence as a separate entity. While there are moments of fun to be had, particularly for fans of the original, ""Miles Morales"" ultimately disappoints as a follow-up, offering an experience that is more repetitive than revolutionary.. A cool spinoff from the Spider-Man story, but I don’t think it was necessary. I liked the story line, but Miles Morales as a character doesn’t really do it for me. Like… no one could tell he was Spider-man from his voice? That nasally, nerdy African American kid COULDN’T be Spider-man, right? I just thought it was funny (won’t spoil anything). Combat mechanics are a step up and are admittedly cooler than the first game. However, the skill-point leveling system was pretty lackluster. I found myself not focusing on it as much as I did the first game. Side quests are more diverse and are actually mission-based, which can be a fun change-up compared to the first game. However, some side quests are tedious (Pidgeon Chaser: meet Sample Finder). Villains are also pretty weak, and definitely don’t compare to the original game’s roster. This game can be a lot of fun! But by the time I got to the end, I was looking forward to it being over so I could play through something else.. Crazily fun and addicting. I beat this game super quick and got super invested in the story. I love the characters and villains you stumble upon. 10/10. incredible game i finish game in 15 hours and i will take platinium cup gameplay is amazing swinging around buildings is better than spiderman remastered you can play on ps plus it is cheap and game have good side quests all side quests is fun and they are totally different Using venom powers is very relaxing and 15 hours is okay for aaa game its not boring it had a great week for me gracias spider man gracias rio morales. Laughable main story content for a $50 release in a game that recycles so much from its predecessor. The main quest is artificially lengthened forcing the player to play the secondary (yet mandatory) objectives of Finks' thin storyline inbetween real main missions. The main and mandatory missions take less than 6 hours, in the recycled map of the previous Spider-Man game, just this time there's snow on it and some Christmas decoration. You'll find yourself in walking conversational or investigation parts quite often, which usually add pretty much nothing to the plot or characters' development and tend to feel like they are just trying to bloat the length to make you feel you didn't waste your money. Somehow, the thin story still manages to hold a good amount of clichés, deus ex and surprisingly bad writing outcomes. If you enjoy the quite simplistic and guided combat and movement mechanics, you can clock in around 15 hours in uninteresting, repetitive sidequests. I score it a 6/10 because it's not all bad. The gameplay is enjoyable, the ending is powerful and you can play longer if interested in the secondary content. But hey, unless you are a Spider-Man or Marvel fan, there's a gazillion games you should check before playing this notoriously expensive, glorified DLC.. It was the most enjoyable superhero game I've ever played. Walking around the city, the combos, the final... It's a really successful game.. Great game, it’s a filler tho, totally recommend to get the ultimate edition so you can experience the first spider-man and this is just a nice extra to keep the story going (not as cool as the first one, but has its unique touch after all!). I loved this game. Story was awesome, Miles was awesome, gameplay was awesome. Wish we had more amazing videogames that are short like this and don’t take ages to make.. The game pretty boring(campaign level design,story,villain)thank god it was a really short game,worst spiderman game so far,not reccomended its a lot worst than other 2 games,yes we know its a filler but really??.... Multiple cut scenes, villains are shallow. Story telling is average. Most of the time instead of playing in action with spider-man, we just watch him jumping and preforming acrobatics on his own in a cut scenes. They really lost me when a old (girl)friend of Miles introduce to him her girlfriend saying that ""he is my boyfriend"". Really? Do I really need to hear and see that mambo jumbo everywhere?. This is exactly what a spin off game should aim for it took everything good about the first games combat and improved on it the story is the weakest in the series wich is expected as it’s quite short and 1 and 2 have 10/10 story great game overall but the price is ridiculous. Beautiful game, beautiful games, wonderful game! Unparalleled gameplay especially with the PS5 controller, surreal graphics and perg gameplay. Apart from Spider Man 2, the others from Insomanic are a 100% positive .experience.This game is worth 1000. The city looks great, gameplay is good as first one. I really enjoy this series. One of the best series.. The game is fun, but very repetetive. Also, there is Genenation Z or whatever vibe, with this constant social media BS we have to do, constant phone calls and oh my God, this Miles guy is SOOO annoying, he's got this whining high-pitched voice... oh my Lord, that pissed me off so much... I dont know, I hink I would enjoy the game more if it was on mute. I wanted to like the game more, but I didnt. Nice ending though. I bought it on sale, finished, but still have to replay to platinum, but no desire to do that.. Although the Miles Morales character can feel childish and cringe at most times, Overall a great game with great gameplay. Would be my third preferred of the three Spider-Man games despite mostly enjoying it.. I played this game directly after getting the marvel's spider man's platinum and this one looked like a really conservative long DLC sold as a stand alone game. I felt directly familiar with the city, controls and gameplay and it had the same Batman Arkham + infamous vibes, maybe more Infamous now due Miles non spider related spectacular superpowers. The story I did not like a lot and it was really weird seeing this cringe worthy attempt of inventing a ""new"" spider man in an universe where Peter is still alive and active. The"" be yourself"" motto contrasts with having a main character trying to be spiderman, wearing spiderman suits and fighting Peter's enemies, Why on earth somebody considered that race-age-gender swapping the Tinkerer instead of creating a new original antagonist for Miles is something I still can not understand. Also it tries to hard to build the community feeling that it fails miserably, like for example when Miles and his mother speak ""Spanish"", also some agenda with the trope of white bad guy, the LGTBI activists or the non Christian Christmas is present as usual. At least this game has way less filler than Marvel Spiderman and we don't have to play the insufferable stealth MJ missions. In summary a direct, enjoyable game with great graphics and another terribly mild story that you will forget very fast.. Like its predecessor, the realisation of the main character is fantastic. I like everything about it. However, the game gets a small deduction due to the rather boring antagonist. Otherwise, a great game in the Spider-Man series.. Both the protagonist and the villain feel forced. Players want to see Spider-Man, not a lesson in political correctness.. The mechanics were the same as the last game and the story was short. it was a fun playthrough. Though short, Spiderman miles morales is more of the same insomniac Spiderman action that was in the first game. If you've played that and enjoyed it then I recommend playing this as well, even though the story is shorter and not as impactful.. I got this game when it came out, and I loved it. I beat it five times on the PlayStation 4, once on the PC, and once on the PlayStation 5. This game is so fun; it's better than Marvel's Spider-Man or Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is such a fun game. If you have a computer that can run this game or a PS4 or PS5, make sure to try it. I remember I used to just jam to the soundtrack on my TV because it's so good.. The game overall is good... interesting gameplay, beautiful music and graphics.. Excellent work to draw NYC. But thetory is very short, puzzles are very easy and big concern about this game that I felt it is like movie more than a game especially with too many cenimatic scenes that you can't skip.. It was basically a dlc for the original game, but sold for a high price. The main villain was dumb, and the story was bad too.. Fun game but too racist and discriminatory for my like. The game told me that us Native Americans, the Hispanic, Latino, Indian, and any other ethnicities poorer than African Americans don't matter, only the rich black people do. And I hate that woke tokenization of the LGBTQ community and others. Had the game kept clear of outdated American politics, I would have given it a 9, but because of it's bigoted messaging, I had to take some points off. If you can get past the woke bigotry, it is a really fun game. Makes you feel all warm inside helping people in the community as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.. The open world activities make this game just another average game full of bored achievements. They made on that way just to charge us the DLC as a game tag price.. this game is too short and not longer like ps4/ps5 spiderman the one good thing about it's the graphics miles story is **** 10 hr isn't enough for me. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is woefully short and stumbles as it starts, but, past those pain points, a tightly tailoured, grounded, and heartfelt origin story revels in its sense of community as Miles fights to shed the imposter syndrome he faces being the 'second' Spider-Man. Gameplay and combat mechanics welcome past players with familiar abilities while slowly electrifying them with distinct and individual flourishes that better suit Miles. Sadly, side content still needs some tender love and care while its cinematic moments aren't well suited when in smaller spaces, but, overall, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an unmissably fun and emotional adventure that provides a nice bridge between the first and second games.. I loved Spider-Man, and as far as gameplay goes, Miles Morales is a great continuation of that game. Miles is a good character, but this game really loses me with it's sappy story and side characters. The first game had some sentimental moments, but it served the story. In M.M., there's this constant bombardment of sappiness that just comes off as cheesy. I'd say it's manipulative, but that would suggest it's capable of evoking the desired emotions from the player. For me, I was rolling my eyes constantly. Either there were different, less experienced writers for M.M., or they just didn't put much as much effort into this game. Another aspect of the bad writing is the fact that Miles is constantly making everything worse- he either screws something up by acting careless, and then the mission we play is cleaning up his mess, or he ""saves the day"" in a wreckless way that adds more danger to the city. Obviously there was a bit of this in the original Spider-Man, where Peter is in a big fight that destroys buildings and stuff, but at least then we got the sense that he was trying to contain the damage and danger. In M.M., we play as this kid who just stupidly adds to the destruction, and yet we're supposed to root for him, and feel like we're in his shoes while playing. I understand that he's young and just coming to grips with becoming (a) Spiderman, but I don't want to play as a superhero that **** and is constantly making mistakes. I kept getting the sense throughout the game that Miles should really just leave this stuff to Peter, which is too bad cause I think he's a good character in other ways.. Finished main campaign, feels like a hangover after cheap alcohol…thanks for 10h of my time wasted. Beautiful game, but the story mode is extremely short, it's practically a DLC from the previous game, and that's really bad, but on the other hand, the game has a much greater variety of stunts from the previous game. but despite that, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Just play it. The game has a great main story filled with emotions, twists, and good writing. The secondary activities are better resolved than those of the first. Its big problem is that it is extremely short. Keep that in mind.. Marvel Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an extremely short yet great game the play style for Miles Morales is familiar yet unquie, Peter Parker is more tactical with his approach on combat while Miles is more of a power house with his new found bio electricity, the graphics on PS5 is great to look at, the whole ecstatic in Harlem with the winter theme is just beautiful, the story in my opinion is quite lacking the tinkerer which is the main villian is quite underwealming, and the conflict between Phin and Miles seemed quite forced (again just my opinion). a bite sized Spider-Man experience compared to the first game, but still fits in a lot of great content. Miles is a really interesting protagonist and its interesting to see his perspective on being Spider-Man.. I found it just as a dlc to the first game. It just doesn’t have as much potential as people set it out to be. The lead up to the second game was good but’s it just left me without any interest.. Too short (for my) but i love story written by Insomniac Games so: very good game!. More of the same spider man game, but with Miles as the protagonist, the story is lame and the main villain is not good enought, it feels more like a dramatic narrative game than a super hero game, but still a good game.. The game is very monotonous, judging by myself I can say that the player will not get into the plot, the mission is monotonous, fly there and defeat the bad guys. Yes, of course, there are bosses there, but they are so rare by the standards of the game, and you won't even feel that it's some kind of boss, you'll feel like he's the same bad guy, just with his little peculiarity. Yes, of course, you can achieve relaxation by flying around the city, but the game is not worth it, and such grades, I couldn't pass it to the end, I just didn't care. in a lot of ways I prefer this game to the first games its shorter and the map is almost exactly the same as the first games but the story felt more personal and the weather made it feel like an almost completely different city for me and since I love the aesthetic that snow can bring in games that made it feel even more enjoyable to explore and gather all the collectibles. Good game but looks like a DLC of the first Spider Man. Fun combat and great exploration.. the gameplay is 10/10, very fun and engaging mechanics, short game tho. the story is terrible - cringey dialogue, cliche nonsensical story progression. the main villain is very poorly written, yet the writers desperately tries to make you empathize with them. I wanted to skip so many awful cutscenes but there is no option. Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales is a spin-off To Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, the original Was one of the Best PS5 (Or ps4) Exclusive titles, lets see if Miles Comes close to Peter. The story is a heartwarming christmas tale with thrills and chills (pun intended) its a spectacular spidey tale even if the villain is awful. The gameplay is fun just like the original, the OST Is absolutely wonderful and great, the traversal is even better than the original with even more air tricks and speed.Overall the game may not be as good as the original, it makes its own identity and it shows that Miles Morales Can be just as a Good Spider-Man As Peter Parker or even better. 8/10.. Meh. Feels like a DLC with unlimited budget. Despite this feels as stale as the recent Marvel movies.. Rather short but action-packed and full of exciting moments, Spider-Man: Miles Morales shows what PS5. The game and story are like an 85%, but its the mechanics and next gen tech that rounded it to a 90.. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a master piece. just not a fan of all the ability's there are. Good game. 9/10.. The game was good from the combat to the traversal to the story but it does have it's negatives to the story was good but not as good as spider-man PS4 and was shorter butyou should check it out if you're a Miles Morales fan and loved Spider-man PS4. What a great game from start to finish. I recently went back and played this one after finishing Spider-Man 2 because it had been a while, and it was a joy to run it back. I like the more stripped down move sets and gadgets. I like the shorter story and more condensed map. I think the story is pretty good minus a few parts here and there. Web slinging is just too fun in this game. I don't even use fast travel. I think this might be in contention for best game in the series to be honest.. -7/10 story -8/10 gameplay -8/10 environments -8/10 characters -8/10 music. Spider Man: Miles Morales had a complete and compelling story through and through. The motives of Phin are clear and concise. The game presents an emotional ending which is refreshing in a superhero based game. However, the game lacks length and a compelling side missions system. The quests from the spider app were quite unique, but crimes tend to be repetitive and boring. The game lacks content to justify its pricetag, but it is available for download on Ps Plus. Stealth also seems to be too overpowered, though completing your playthrough only via stealth takes quite a long time, so pick your poison I guess. Good game, but not great.. The story in this game is just lackluster. I was bored a lot during the cutscenes, and when I learned I had to play through the whole story again to get the platinum trophy, I was just mad. Nevertheless, the ending did had some emotional value, so they wrapped it up nicely. The combat and traversal is really well made though. Definitely the strong point of this game. The side missions are a fun distraction, but the FNSM tasks seem to have been put in just to pad the game a bit more. Having the numerous collectibles (time capsules, caches, mixtapes and postcards) in here was to be expected, but it grew stale after a while. If you have PS Plus Extra, this game is worth it. I wouldn't pay full price for it though.. Fantastic game, only held back by it's short length. Takes everything good about the first game and improves upon it.. a game with very fun gameplay by the way, traveling around the city of New York with webs and swinging from side to side is one of the best parts of its gameplay! I can't say much about the combat, which is weird and certainly not the developers' focus for this game. It's not bad, it's just not the best, combos that do almost no damage to enemies and to kill an enemy you need to throw 20 punches. overwhelming and boring at times, maybe it's me who doesn't know how to play the combat of miles morales, but I don't feel much affection for the combat of this game, on the contrary, the story is captivating, full of plot twists and with a good narrative, interesting to go from mission to mission to find out what will happen next, like on Netflix where we wait for what will happen in each episode of a series. Another negative part is stealth. the game is extremely massacring and if something goes wrong without stealth, death is certain. It's the most annoying part, having to go to a completely silent site and kill enemies from above with attacks that don't attract attention. I'm a player who likes action and the stealth in this game wasn't what I liked the most, besides the boss fight is very good and fun! I had fun playing Miles Morales with the exception of the parts where I needed to use stealth!. A lot of bugs, like the latest side mission when you have to chase a car of kidnappers that got a lady in the trunk. And when stopped them, I cansee she is mowing her lips but no words are coming out of them... And this ain'tthe only bug I've encounted.. great game idk what else to say besides its a great game -(:/)/- improved mechanics from the first but just too short. Definitely more of a Peter Parker girl but this game was something else i don't know how insomniac is so good at making emotional endings I don't think I've ever not cried to a spiderman game. Never played a spider man game so I thought I'd try this one out and it's really enjoyable! Love the fighting mechanics and the Venom ability to use on enemies and for solving the puzzles. Although I haven't finished the story as of typing this review it really pulls me in and will for sure finish it and even maybe a 2 time for how good it is.. The game already shows several improvements compared to Spider-Man Remastered. And it's really fun to play as Miles Morales. It's a shame the game is very short.. I","sadly, the longer you play, the worse the game gets. story, combat, performance, everything . the biggest downfall of this game is the very short story . the combat is satisfying and the ending was satisfying ."
"1,164.The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth","Greed got that ASS. .............................................................. An overall poor expansion that fails to meaningfully expand upon base Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.. This is a wonderful game, every visit is like a new world, something new all the time. Very interesting I advise. Sometimes texture bugs are possible. I've put more time into the binding of isaac than almost any other game I can think of. Probably the best roguelike that I will ever play, with almost infinite replayability.. Fantastic DLC expansion for an already fantastic game. Lilith immediately became my new favorite character. Afterbirth adds a new mode, Greed Mode, which changes up the rules a bit, but is a lot of fun. We get new enemies, items, floor models, room styles, added to the base game as well. A worthy expansion from a great developer.. I think the producers wrongly believed that the only way to improve their game is to make it harder and harder. I really liked Rebirth and I've spent 100h+ playing time to get the platinum triumph on Vita. And then came the endless nerfs and a boring, punishing DLC, I just can't find any joy in playing anymore. I know this is a hardcore game, but a good gameplay, even for a hardcore game, should be much more than purely punishing.. This is what DLC should be like. A lot of new content, and adjustments to pre-existing mechanics make it definitely worth the price if you are a fan of Rebirth.. Okay, Afterbirth. Personally, as a newbie, I bought Afterbirth DLC and Rebirth together. But, yeah. It was fun, but I then thought it wasn't worth it. It's 11,500 KRW (Rebirth is 16,000 KRW), but I personally thought well it's too expensive for an additional package which adds just a few of features (well I personally thought that). Yes. The game is fun, but the price is too expensive for its expensive price. If Afterbirth † comes out, I am going to purchase it, as I am a fan of 'The Binding of Isaac'.. New items, new bosses, new mechanics. If the just the game was endless, with this new DLC a huge number of hours have been added to this AWESOME game. I have been 120 hours in this game and I have completed only the 80% of it. I'm late to the party on Isaac - only played it recently. I can understand the adulation the game gets, as it has very tight controls, very unique visuals and addictive gameplay due to the roguelike nature of it and the varied playstyles. It is far from perfect however. The game is repetitive after a few short hours in terms of bosses and enemy gameplay mechanics (the game would benefit massively from probably double the amount of bosses currently available). The second issue I have is with the pickup system - I get that the style has been done deliberately to add something different beyond just ""health up"", ""power up"" etc, but so many items have absolutely no explanation as to what they do whatsoever, resulting in a frantic Google search. Yes, you'll learn them through trial and error eventually, but you shouldn't have to do that - there should be an in-game encyclopaedia or a better designed tooltip to give you a heads up. For the price point, it's one of the better indie titles and a game you'll regularly go back to when you want a quick 20 minute blast of gaming action. It will be interesting to see if the dev can build on a really solid foundation with this idea further after the Afterbirth expansion and make this a really varied, legendary roguelike twinstick shooter in the future.. This is the most worth it game of all time Biding of isaac rebirth + DLC = 20€ and I spend 175h on it ! I really this game, it is a very challenging game !. The waiting is over, the Binding of Isaac: afterbirth is finally here! So, was all the waiting worth it? hell yes! With loads of new items, cool new floors, great new music tracks, a new playable char and brand new game mode (greed mode). This DLC has added so much more enjoyment to this already awesome and highly addictive game. One of the best features to be added is daily challenge runs where you can compete with friends for best score, its loads of fun. Even with a few bugs here and there (hopefully to be fixed soon) I'm very much enjoying this DLC and would recommend it highly.. Good for horror and sadists and that's about it. Just pure evil. There is really no reason to create games like this one. No ones head should have such imagery.. It's what you love about rebirth, but more. Not only are there new items, bosses, a character and modes, but also new synergies and touching up on rebirth. For example, quad and triple shot go together to make a shotgun blast of seven tears. It's great, and worth your money and time.. Great DLC (despite the launch glitch, but I don't mind) containing huge amount of content and great Greed mode. I have yet to complete it and I am 30 hours in.. A huge expansion for an already massive game with unending replay value. Not only does the DLC add well over 100 items and a whole new game mode but all of the new mechanic tweaks and items add a whole new level of fun to the game, allowing you to get a much wider range of weapon combos that I think I'll be discovering for years. An essential DLC if you enjoyed Rebirth.. DLC released with time gated content and major bugs, dev doesn't care and just play with community with hints about ""secrets"" that didn't released yet. It's a shame that this is the worst The Binding of Isaac installment and probably start of milking franchise since they will announce next dlc soon.. This is the best DLC that has ever existed. It brings a hole new game mode, more than a hundred new items, new combos, cards, awesome challenges, etc... In one word: AMAZING. If you liked TBOI: Rebirth buy this DLC. It´s just 10,99$. A great expansion to Rebirth with plenty of interesting content to keep coming back to. There are a decent amount of bugs at the moment but hopefully these will be fixed with patches to come.. The binding of isaac :afterbirth is the best roguilke game for all the time . Games has been great mechanisc game amazing gameplay and unusual climate","afterbirth adds a new mode, Greed Mode, which changes up the rules a bit . we get new enemies, items, floor models, room styles, added to the base game . a lot of new content, and adjustments to pre-existing mechanics make it definitely worth the price ."
"1,165.Amnesia: The Dark Descent","a masterpiece in horror, people who weren't there at the beginning and play it late won't understand why i say that but let me just say Amnesia: the dark descent is a major factor in horror games today. This and P.T were major players in todays horror industry. I was surprised by how well put together this piece is. It was 8 hours, and the perfect length for what it offered. I leave this game pleasantly satisfied with what I got out of it - which is what every game should aspire to accomplish.. The atmosphere, music, story of the game are increadable. The masterpiece of horror survival 100%. Utterly terrifying. I dreaded going around every corner. Making the simplest action was anxiety-inducing. The sanity meter is diabolical - light is needed to see and to prevent a game over, but it makes you more noticeable to the monsters... who can also cause a game over. The story is a gothic nightmare. The set-pieces are incredible. This is a must-play for horror fans.. best horror game i played the story and the ambiance is so good also has great voice acting. Nearly fifteen years after release The Dark Descent remains a fairly unique horror game, but in terms of graphics and having to navigate rooms that all look pretty much the same it hasn’t aged particularly well. If ever a game was ripe for a modern remake, this is it!. love this game. played in the dark with headphones on purposet it definitely sent chills down my spine, totally recommend it!. Playing it in 2024, it is very stupid, very hard to navigate, and unbelievably boring, even in a dark room with headphones. It's a reminder of how easily impressed we were even just a few short years ago. If you're coming to it now, skip it. It has not aged well.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a classic horror in the style of Lovecraft. This game should be played by all fans of horror games.. As compared to Outlast, Amnesia TDD is all atmospheric. You feel the loneliness of the castle and get to explore horrible places while always feeling vulnerable of whatever is looking for you. One of the greatest games ofall time. Amnesia is one of the most revolutionary horror games, youtubers like pewdiepie and markiplier were born thanks to this fantastic game, I spent hundreds of hours on the game and its custom stories, Original setting but perhaps a little repetitive, tedious but interesting puzzles, monsters are 3 but still manage to strike terror. The lantern is always etched in my heart. Rating 8.5. One of the greatest horror games of all time. There isn't another horror game that compares to the sheer atmospheric terror that you get from this game. No jump scares... just the way I like it. Don't let youtubers/streamers deter you from playing it because of how they act. They are there to entertain you, please play the game by yourself and enjoy it.. That's the best horror game I've ever played. It's a truly scary game, not like most other games that call itself horror games.. I did not expect such an great game ! Atmosphere is amazing with very good grapics and sound quality. I recommend it if you want to play with your brain in coope :). Not a big fan of such games but it's decent. Pros.: - Story. - Suspense. - Variety of endings. - Super stable game. Cons.: - Just boring (for me).. A defining horror game, Amnesia really did a great job of raising the bar and making their game equal parts skin crawling, intriguing and terrifying. The story was compelling, and the gameplay terrifying.. It was a decent experience. It was an important step forward 13 years ago and inspired important games like Outlast. By today's standard it certainly shows its age. I did not find the game particularly scary (Outlast had me sitting on the edge of my seat a lot more). The story is good. Graphics are dated, some mechanics quite cumbersome. Difficulty is more on the easy side; I had a lot of unused resources in the end, and enemies get adjusted to you, so if you die, they bother you less. Puzzles were nice, there may be more here than standard horror games. Some editions come with the Justine DLC. I didn't bother with that one much as this side story does not save your progress, so you have to finish it in one go.. I can't describe how amazing this game is, just what a perfect game, I will play again. This game redefined the survival horror genre. Play in the dark with earphones on. Make sure there is no connection to the outside world. I was so scared I could not finish. A beautifully executed image of being hunted by the unknown set in an old creepy castle.. This is the game that defined a genre for the better or worse. It is still one of the most haunting games to date.. Scripted ****. Broken difficulty. The true Penumbra 3.0 Gameplay: combat mechanics 0/10 stealth 3/10 atmosphere [stupid consolish checkpoints/loadings] 9/10 Gameplay as immersive horror (prison only) 5/10 Story [amazing plot, awful presentation] 8/10 Graphics 4/10 Sounds & music [annoying ""scratching bugs"" sound] 8/10 . There are no innovations or ""well done"" points. Just a journey.. Brah, not like the other horror games, this game doesn't try to scare you by cheap jumpscares. It scares you with tension. Absolute masterpiece.. 10/10 is not an exaggeration, this game shaped what we know today as horror games, it is a masterpiece of the game history, and it deserves its spotlight. I think there is no other game that has me to engaged for so long and so amazed on its mechanics.. This is the scariest game of all time. It is the father of all of those ""defenseless"" horror games out there now, such as Outlast. The monsters are frightening and creative, the sanity mechanic is threatening but fair, and the story is incredible.. King of horror games. From a certain point after 1-2 hours i couldn't play it more. The game offer so much stressful moment, which defeat me. I watched the walkthrough, so i can say the story behind the horror is surprisingly good.. A well-planned linear plot, memorable locations and musical accompaniment make this game a worthy representative of the genre.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror adventure video game by Frictional Games, released in 2010 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems, in 2016 for the PlayStation 4 platform and in 2018 for the Xbox One. The game features a protagonist named Daniel exploring a dark and foreboding castle called Brennenburg, while trying to maintain his sanity by avoiding monsters and unsettling events. The game was critically well-received, earning two awards from the Independent Games Festival and numerous positive reviews.. Best horror have I ever played. Maybe not best game but it is really scary. Can' t stop playing.. the game is awesome i really enjyed it: atmosphere, plot, ost, graphic is good. there was a few scarry moments, few hard quests, i really liked it. It has great atmosphere; the visual design, the voice acting, writing, sound design, music, and insanity effects all come together to create a really cool vibe. But the actually gameplay is sad. Puzzles that are either really easy or involve searching around forever, or running away from things. That's it.. This is pinnacle of horror game category with another 2-3 games. Story is intriguing but not much. Background is studied and game has good background story. It takes your attention. Main character is ordinary man and game don't eloborate on main character but it is not important. Villian is goodwriten character and game teaches you about villian adequately. Not much told about villian and this is good because its mystery remains. and most importantly location: location is key factor that makes this game so much good. Brennenburg and its atmosphere magnificent. It makes you feel extremely alone and performs essential part of the horrifying experience. It was a nice experience and I was scared the first half of the game, I would recommend this game to you if you like to be frightened the only problem with the game is that I had to use some walkthrough to find out what I was supposed to do, the best thing about this game is the atmosphere that effects and sound effects they are phenomenal to make you feel uncomfortable and frightened. The only problem is the half way through the game the enemy stop being scary because you killed by dem and you Begin to get killed by the multiple times it loses the terrace effect and just become another game enemy. It's a game I would recommend and even better it's very cheap. I really like amnesia due to its atmosphere after all, the game has amazing sounds and music. that you seem to be in this ancient castle, but if the storyline in this game would be longer and there would be more scary moments, I would put 10, but I would put 9/10.. dull walking simulator like all previous games from this dull series how boring trash can be played. Does not provide the entertaining ability to save progress. Which means its entertainment value is a big fat ZERO. Uses the survival lame argument as an excuse. Additionally, the game main purpose is to try and upset your stomach. Because the 3D and general movement aren't too bad, they keep using tricks like blurring things, shaking things, rotating things, and constantly taking control of the character away from you for short moments, which is very, very irritating; and rude. Additionally, the game is way too dark. The cheapest trope of the cheapest genre, sure to scare more people than spider sprites, but a waste of the word ""video"" when you can't see a thing, and the best sign that a writer has nothing to show. The trope comes from movies trying to hide their low SFX budget; it makes no sense in a game unless your texture artist is lousy.. Love it so much. So much great atmosphere i can not stop playing it, so exciting. Good game, I liked the system of interaction with objects. Due to the lack of the ability to counteract the monsters, an increased sense of helplessness is created. Monsters in general are not scary, because half of them are invisible :). This game... perfection. No horror game will ever beat this magnificent piece of art. The story is amazing, atmosphere, puzzles, gameplay, characters, monsters and above all, its scary as all hell. Now i've played a lot of horror games (outlast, layers of fear, silent hill, P.T, blair witch, resident evil, phasmophobia etc.) , but nothing has ever been as scary as this game. And the other amnesia games (Machine for pigs and Rebirth) were nothing compared to this, when i played them i felt like i was at a daycare, playing this i felt like i was in a damn haunted house. This game should be the standard for horror games. I wish this game went on forever so i don't have to keep replaying it over and over again. I would rate this 100 if i could.. Great classic horror game with a bleak and twisted story, and interesting morally ambiguous characters. Playing this game exposes oneself to not just fright scares, but a lot of uncomfortable emotions. This was crafted with love by people who know a lot about horror. The reason I can't rate it higher is that it's a clunky game. The engine is just functional, and monster encounters are more annoying than they are scary. They come out of nowhere, you can't really avoid them a lot of times, and the best way to deal with them is to get yourself killed so they despawn. This game has a great insanity mechanic btw. It's only second to Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.. You can not ask for a more consistent, atmospheric, horrifying game experience. On top of that, a breath-taking storyline in an incredibly well-made world, complete with the interactive gameplay that allows for alternate endings! This is simply the best horror game that has ever been made, and it will doubtfully ever be bested. But it is worth saying that some people may find it's puzzles complicated, it's survival aspect too demanding, and the ""questline"" confusing. It's not a game that necessarily holds your hand, and it may be overwhelming.. There are many reasons this game is sometimes called ""the best horror game ever"". Interesting story, spectacular sound design, terrifying atmosphere, this game has it all. It's a must- buy. Really creepy atmosphere with quite a compelling narrative but unfortunately feels extremely dated at times in its gameplay which also is unbearably repetitive at times.. one of the best horror games. Good: Great story, creature design, soundtrack, fear at all times in the dungeons Bad: the artificial intelligence of the enemies sometimes fails and the puzzles become difficult because the pieces are difficult to get. My opinion: If you are looking for a horror game, I definitely recommend this game. Best survival horror I've played. It really succeeds in building up that tension with a haunting and eerie athmosphere. Very good and interesting story.. The Dark Decent is currently one of the best horror games I've ever played. Throughout the entire game I was terrified but I had this motivation to keep pushing on. That motivation was from how interesting and fun the game is. The gameplay stands out a lot in the horror genre. You could say it's a simple walking simulator, but as it gets more in depth it really shows off how unique it is. One of the mechanics is sanity, if you don't keep your sanity high enough you may start experiencing problems with the mind, causing hallucinations and an inability to see. As you can tell, it can get really scary if your sanity isn't high enough. Light plays a major factor here as well. You need to make sure to manage light, if you don't your sanity will fall and dangerous consequences may stop your path. The enemies are also an interesting factor, sometimes you're just relying on sound, with the option of seeing them. Each type of enemy has its own sound, so you'll be able to tell if you can hide or outrun it. There was one sound that I never saw the enemy that matched it, it sound a lot heavier and I'm glad I never poked my head around the corner. I didn't quite understand the full story after I finished it, but from what I played I could gather the basics. The story is presented through collectable notes and voices inside your head, so if you are not paying attention you'll miss the plot. It was interesting enough to keep me playing till the end. It's probably something I'm going to read and watch a lot about. There were a few technical problems, like audio randomly being in my left ear only or me falling out the map. However, it doesn't really make the experience worse but kind of adds to it. When I feel out the map I thought it was a feature and crapped myself in the process. To conclude, Amnesia: The Dark Decent is an amazing and unique horror game that has left an impact in the horror genre, possibly inspiring many more games I haven't played yet. It's a master of visual and audio immersion, which in combination creates one of the best horror games of all time.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is the best game I've played. In this game, an unrealistically cool atmosphere and music, by the way, I want to tell you about the plot separately. It is based on a very philosophical story that is presented in a very interesting way. The plot was divided into three parts: beginning, middle and end. I called the end conditionally, this is the period in which we play. The beginning of the story is given to us through notes, and the denouement of the story is already in the memories. For those looking for a game, I recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you will not regret the time spent.. Pretentious and doesn't really have a plotline. Most scenes are too badly lit that I can hardly figure how could players find their ways in this never-ending labyrinth not to say finish the game. Think I better have my eyes checked after this.. Really good. It's easy to say ""it's just a walking simulator"", but it's a really scary one if it is.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is nothing short of amazing. In a time where most horror games settle for cheap jump scares and underdeveloped convoluted stories. Instead Amnesia: The Dark Descent takes its time to build tension through sounds and its setting building its atmosphere of unease and dread while utilising its monsters in effective ways to frighten its players without it ever seeming like a cheap predictable move. The gameplay while simple is entertaining and not hard to understand. Puzzles are designed in a way to challenge you without ever seeming impossible as long as you pay attention. Additionally, the plot present in this game is not only intriguing and scary but it is also shown during the journey through letters leading to both the player and character Daniel to understand what brought them into the situation they find themselves in together. Lastly, the release of the same development tool kit used to make the game allowed for players to have fun creating their own disturbing stories. The only problem I had with it at points was that sometimes the story could end up feeling extremely confusing as you tried to piece it together which led to a bit of frustatrion and a sense of ""Wtf is going on?"" but at the end of the day it led to a good pay off once it made sense. In conclusion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is nothing less than a horror classic that revolutionised its genre and was the inspiration of many games that followed it.. There is a new Amnesia being released soon so I wanted to relive the original experience, I had fittingly, mostly forgotten (/repressed). I have played a lot of horror games since Amnesia's first outing, but I'd never got close to feeling the sort of nerve-wreaking terror it offers. Its brilliant, and this time, I also made greater effort to understand the plot, rather than just running from place to place, holding the underside of my pants. To my surprise, the game exceeds what of it I had recalled. Its survival horror through and through. Brennenburg Castle is dark, labyrinthian and imposing. The enemies are horrific. Both aspects of the game are far better established and relevant to the plot than most other horror games. Like Silent Hill 2, a classic in the genre, you're inability to unpick what it what all means adds to the impact of every moment, whether its reality or the fantastical nightmares of a desperate and vulnerable playable character is always impossible to know. The literal descent, brilliant pacing and brooding sound design adds greater intensity to the atmosphere. The intensity, as it should, aims to tests the player's willingness to continue through the game's path and seek potential answers that might explain whatever evil that lurks within. The player's ability to manipulate even the smallest aspects of the environment, the way you literally have push and pull doors open, realised through a solid physics engine, ensures constant immersion throughout. Its easily the scariest game I've ever played. Its not a perfect game, greater enemy variety and more interesting puzzles would have been nice, but as a pure horror game, there aren't much better.. Great story, top-notch atmosphere, harrowing immersion, and consistently pretty scary. It's a tight experience that also feels epic in scale despite its closed quarters. I love most of the puzzles, but some of the more physics-based ones are a slog. Early on you have to stack and climb boxes to leave a room, for instance. There's also the issue of key points of progression or interactivity being hard to spot - like a window you have to break or a pipe opening you have to obtain oil from hidden in the shadows of a room filled with pipes pouring water. The endings are also kind of underwhelming, but the journey and the sense of accomplishment getting there are incredible.. The father of the horror game in the first person game, the great game and the great ost i have player. Quite good horror with atmosphere of danger and scary moments. Cool puzzles and feel of fear before monsters. Good physics and unique mobs. If u want some adrenalin - you must play in this game.. The game mechanics are a little clunky but over all had a good time with this one. If you want to give an old game a go this is one of the good ones, if you like new games then stay away, this one does not hold up when compared to modern games like soma.. Scares you properly. Makes you think and read to come up with solutions to puzzles. Scares you some more. Compels you to uncover the mystery. Frightens you. Good stuff.. The game is very scary and interesting. The story is great and brutal. It kept me on the edge if my seat especially whenever a monster was close by.. This game showed us what a horror game should be like. Remarkably few have followed suit. Still one of the best experiences of its kind. It is an experience you do not forget and the atmosphere is truly fantastic. That's why the ending is a bit disappointing.. Super atmospheric horror game which is one of the bests to this day. Many games try to copy it's formula to this day (SOMA, Outlast etc.).. Excellent horror and survival game that already has an intriguing story but still wins with the stories that the community creates in its mods. Mandatory for lovers of the genre.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is not another survival horror game where you have to hide from a monster and look for a way out. It is, in fact, the ""survival horror game"", one of the games that laid the foundations of this genre, having a macabre atmosphere and a very well written story.. Was definitely on a another level to other first person horror games and it makes sense that this started the FPS horror renaissance. However, the title isn't very scary and the art direction is mediocre.. Best horror game out there, build up is great and game elements add to the admosfer, it can get really spooky if you play in the dark. Only minus is bad graphics and sometime other gameplay elements can get a bit dull.. It's so great that the horror elements alone make it a masterpiece worth playing.. Only the light will help you overcome your obstacles. Want to escape a dark room, what do you do? Turn on your lamp so you can see the rocks blocking the door of the room you're in, so you can escape the frustration of being trapped. But you better hope you have oil in your lamp or a tinderbox handy. Sometimes you can make it away from the invisible monsters without your lamp, but just barely.. BEST BEST BEST horror with Resident evil 2 remake and The evil within 2 all rest horror game is boring.. The game crashed in the lower dungeons and I was so frazzled and mentally drained that I never carried on.. Wonderful story and atmosphere and quite disturbing indeed. By the end of the game I was really frustrated by how obtuse many of the puzzles are. I had to look up the solutions a fair few times, and often the solution is just nonsensical--throwing stones at an object to move or a break it, when a stone could clearly not move or break said object, as a generic example. That sort of thing tested my patience and took me out of the game, especially near the end, but it wasn't enough to ruin the experience.. The best horror game of the decade. I can safely say that as 2019 is coming to an end. The only game that could beat it was Silent Hills but #Fuc Konami happened if you know what I mean. Modern classic still unsurpassed after 9 years.. No other horror game will make me as scared as this one. THIS is how horror games are made!! But, don't take my word for it. Play the game and see for yourself... IF YOU DARE!!!! FYI, my hands are still shaking after I've completed it. That's how **** scary this game is.. This was a great horror game. very easy to run. pretty spooky and had some great puzzles. it had good sounds, neat music and a very interesting ending. wish its predecessor was as good as it was. one of the things that i liked was how the game did not drag on for like 20+ hours its usually around 8 no matter what ending you go for.. I don't normally like Horror games, but Amnesia: The Dark Descent really did it for me.. Is one of the best survival horror games in history, like Penumbra Franchise. Great Game 8/10. Game lacks environment to the point of being boring, repetive and tedious. The fact you realise it about severeal minutes after starting the game doesn't really help. The plot of the game is pretty minimalistic, you are in some sort of old generic castle and you have to find the way out, which you never did. You also lost your memory because writting an actual plot is probably next to impossible for the creators. During the game you remember bits of your memory, find some old journals, revealing some really small bits of the plot. I'm gonna be as honest as i can, the plot isn't unique, interesting or even original, it's slow paced, very dry and despite what many biased people like to say, it's cliché. The game doesn't allow you to fight whatsoever, despite the fact you will pass dozens of object that could easily be used as weapons such as shovels and knives. The game also allows you to light candles but you can't carry, which leads to a question, why? There's no real reason for players not to, 99,9% of times lighting them is a waste of time, they're reasonable source of light and it would actually make sense to use them as an alternative source of light over a garbage lamp oil, that runs out of oil as quickly as strawman fanboys of this game out of arguments why i should think this game is scary. There's also sanity system which is pretty weird, step in a shadows/bit darker room for a second and our protagonist is about to have heart attack, but when we stay next to a monster that got stuck on an object he'll be just fine! What kind of fear of the darkness is this? As for the monsters they're not scary in the slightest, if anything they're hilariously ugly, their models look outdated. Not to mention their AI, it's so bad it's actually embarassing, monsters will either, get stuck on any object on their way, or completly forget about you once you get out of their sight, they become predictable so fast, they're not challenging. Horror games should encourage exploration, but this game does not, it's straight foward it forces you to go into directions it wants you to, either that would be with monsters, puzzles or simply blocked paths. The puzzles are simple, predictable and easy.. This is probably one of the best horror game out there. Its different from any other horror game. The story is amazing aswell.. As you begin the game, you will find yourself in a sp00ky castle, you've lost your memory and you need to find out where you are and a way out of the castle. During the entire game you'll never leave the castle and almost at all times, all of the game environments looks similar. You can tell rooms have actually be reused. After awhile it becomes very tedious. As you progress through the game, you'll remember bits of your memory or find old journals, revealing more of the story. I'll be honest, the story is not unique, it's not witty, the writing is very dry, slow paced and clichéd. I never once found myself interested in the story.While a survival horror game would surely encourage exploration, this game does not. It's fairly straight forward and basically forces you into the direction it wants you to go, either with monsters, puzzles or blocked off paths. You can't fight at all. You can't even shove things away when you get close. You can't pick up any sort of weapon despite passing dozens of reasonable objects like shovels and knives. This leads to a problem. The lack of different environments makes the game stagnate almost **** for the scare factor, it's non existent, monsters are easy to avoid, unless you let them get you purposely,if they try to get you on their own they will just get stuck on a barrel,chair or literally anything,the puzzles presented in the game are simple, easy and predictable. I actually found myself rolling my eyes at some of the puzzles in the game. The atmosphere is mediocore at best, the darkness is shoved in your face like an annoying ad on youtube, everyone keeps talking about how terrified they are by the atmosphere and noises the game makes, but what's so scary about sound of wind and water drops?Never took a shower or went outside before?Or maybe those generic sp00ky sounds. It's not a horror game, it's a puzzle game that tries to be **** you bother to try this game unironically you better get yourself a coffee. That goes without saying but this probably the most overrated horror game in the existence. I'm really sure by now most if not all the people saying this is the scariest game ever made are either very young childrens and fans of youtubers or complete cowards.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a good example from what a horror game should be. The game is immersed in a mysterious story, full of puzzles and scary moments. The game is challenging and intense, it is quite likely to have one or several scares especially if you play it with headphones with the volume at maximum. Graphically it is not bad by 2010 standards, I highlight the ""light and dark"" effects that are sometimes quite well designed. Overall an excellent experience, with a good story, which kept me interested even though I am not a fan of this genre of games. Here is small YouTube vide with the first minutes of the gameplay if you wanna check it out: ****/q-V8_uvbG2s. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a critically acclaimed first person horror game which breathed new life into the genre. Those who played earlier titles of Frictional Games, namely Penumbra series, could probably see this coming as it was already clear that Frictional Games was trying something different, focusing on immersion rather than classic gameplay. The first thing that was new with Amnesia was the use of darkness as a core design element. Rule 1: You are scared of what you do not know. Having a very low range of vision means the player won’t see the monsters lurking around until they are very close and as soon as a monster becomes visible, the player gets to turn back and run; which brings us to the second innovative idea: removal of combat. Rule 2: You are scared when you are desperate. In Amnesia, you are weaker than everything else. You are basically a coward, a chicken that loses its mind by the mere lack of light or by facing a monster. Finally, the immersive sound design -as in most other successful horror video games- helps to create a scary atmosphere. Having said all that, I still did not love Amnesia as much as the first two Penumbra titles. I have found storytelling lacking in comparison to the aforementioned games, which was a big blow to the overall immersion. Also, the more I played the game the less I got scared because it did not take long until I figured out how to avoid monsters. Towards the end, the game felt much less scary to me than other horror titles I love such as Dead Space or Silent Hill. In any case, one has to respect Frictional Games for having the guts to try something new and achieving to make a game that has influenced many others. I don’t think Amnesia is the scariest game of all time as many others seem to believe, but it is a good game nevertheless, a must play if you are a horror enthusiast.. Really scary. No jump scares or gore, just perfectly demonstrated feelings of isolation in face of undefeatable danger. In last third it looses it's atmosphere (because by that time you're used to anything the game throws at you) but overall this game is strong experience.. Very cool psychological horror with a cool storyline. Best psychological horror game!. Horror is a very hard game genre to master. Unlike shooters, or open world games, Horror is focused on manipulation of human emotion. Its very hard to create an enjoyable experience while keeping what makes a horror game truly terrifying, and there are very few games that do just that.. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games. Everyth",amnesia: the dark descent is a classic horror in the style of Lovecraft . it's a must-play for horror fans . sanity meter is diabolical - light is needed to see and prevent a game over .
"1,166.Project Gotham Racing","Pioneer in its genre with circuit in real streets. He gave a kick in graphics, speed and gameplay to PS2 Gran Turismo. Project Gotham Racing is a great arcade race. One of the first projects I met as an Xbox Original. Yes, after 20 years, the game is hardly anything, it can attract a player. Project Gotham Racing is outdated both technically and gameplay. The level of complexity is of course difficult to call average by the standards of modern games of the genre. There is no full-fledged campaign here, which is disappointing. All gameplay in the game is reduced to the accumulation of Kudos points. For 2001, the game has excellent graphics, despite the fact that the game was originally designed for Dreamcast.. Good racing game with a Kudos system that was very different at the time of release. Microsoft has brought that in a certain way into the Horizon series now.. it's fun but not much reason to play it today with a bunch of games that came out later plus it doesn't have a fun multiplayer","after 20 years, project gotham racing is outdated both technically and gameplay . there is no full-fledged campaign here, which is disappointing . for 2001, the game has excellent graphics, despite the fact that the game was originally designed for Dreamcast ."
"1,167.Fable (2004)","The best rpg for it's era. Incredible story telling and characters with some fun choices and side content. I loved it when it was released. It gave me many, many hours of fun. I remember beating it many times.. One of the greatest RPG franchises ever made. A much better fantasy series than Elder Scrolls.. It's okay, the charm is all there but the gamplay is bland, the UI and HUD is bloated, and the story is completely empty. Overall there isn't much to speak of, but I see the blueprint for what the franchise would be.. As a kid playing this, it quenches the fantasy need. Its simple enough but still a world filled with wonder.. Fantastic game, one of the best RGPs of all time, actions have consequences and the game itself is also very fun.. love this game this was my first ever game and holds up nicely with a wide arrange of combat from swords bows and magic you can pick how you want to play want to be a sneaky assassin fine want to be an evil wizard with horns you got it, want to be in a dress with a beard don't know why you would but fine this is how an RPG should be a game to go and **** around in I don't know if anyone still has an og copy but if you can get one and play it. Here's my Fable. Once upon a time there lived a greedy Microsoft Publisher and his lackey Lionhead, and once they released Fable 1 on the PC, and they did not give the second a chance, they fed us with expectations, and then there was silence, and here in the courtyard 2k21 and still silence, I think that it's time to remind the world that there was once a good game, and in order to remember everything good in it, you need to release it on your pc, only then people will go to buy a new Fable. This is how they say, and my Fable is over, and may my words not become dust in the eyes of Microsoft and the entire fan community of Fables. ~ MY DREAM IS NOT FULFILLABLE ~. Was it over hyped? Yes. Is it still a great game? Yes. The fact you can be pure good or pure was great, being both was also possible. Plus, Jack of Blades was a good character as a lead antagonist.. Best fable forever in the legend the gameplay is so innovative for the time we need the new fable to be like this one. Fable is masterpiece. Fable is a open world role playing game set in a fantasy world. The main quest is great and the side quests and activities are also great.. As of right now, this is my favorite video game ever created, with its great story and gameplay being the highlights of this game. Play it, it’s just that amazing.. A truly amazing, heart warming RPG. Great story, combat, and world to explore. This is one of the best games that the original Xbox had, I enjoyed the good-bad mechanics it was a game-changer, I have played this game about ten times, and is a great and different adventure that every gamer should try.. I'm very happy to review this wonderful trilogy which has birthed many memories for myself and millions of players around the world. As we eagerly await Playgrounds take on Lionheads classic RPG series, let's take a closer look into each Fable game. Beginning with Fable for the Xbox, the first in this legendary series. Fable is everything you would want from a fantasy RPG. Great world, combat, powers, and story. I have completed this game many times over and each play-through feels different and unique in its own way. That's the beauty of fable; Those decisions, big or small, that make each experience different and fun in its own way. The game continuously tracks your deeds both good and bad to determine who you are. Evil and good are both present in this world and it's up to you to decide which path you'll take. You can choose which lover you want to marry, which house you'd like to buy, which business you'd prefer to own. You decide. What separates Fable 1 from 2 and 3 is the wonderful villain, Jack of Blades. No other Fable game has had a villain on the level such as Jack because each game tries new things. His performance was spectacular and memorable. Fable is a magical world, with love-able villagers, fantastic humor, amazing soundtrack, and the Hero of your choosing. I will have much more to say about Fable 1 in my Fable 3 review where I'll wrap up the series.. The Fun of this whole series is the fact you can be anything. While Fun i cant give a ten Its a bit glitchy but what do you expect it is a fairly old game. also the voicing of the characters is pretty bad but overall i love it. One of the better games on the original Xbox. Awesome game that still holds up pretty well to this day. When this first came out i was very pleased with the purchase.. Yes it is! Best Game ever! Best action/rpg with awesome atmosphere, story , humor , lore.... And CHOICES! Peter Molyneux is a real genious, hail to him :) This game is my childhood.... Tier 2 + Offers a fun visual experience for its time + Unique action RPG gameplay with a wide variety of mechanics to be selected from ? Gameplay doesn't have long-lasting staying power despite some unique hooks ? The proposed player freedom is a lot more restrictive and shallow than what was promised - World feels somewhat shallow and empty in spite of its aesthetic accomplishments. This game is better than its successor in only one regard: the story. And that's not saying much. In every other regard it falls short. It's clunky, uninteresting and leaves very little lasting impression. I honestly believe this game is way over-hyped simply because it attempted to take RPGs to a new place. Unfortunately, that new place isn't exactly as shiny as they claimed it would be. There are some fun bits, like the arena, but mostly it's a slog-fest. I'd recommend giving Fable a try just to see if you like the style of gameplay, but I wouldn't recommend buying the game until you know.. You're a hero. Your family is killed. You have to avenge their deaths and stop a guy named Jack from obtaining a powerful, world ending sword. OK. So, this is an action RPG, the first in one of three games. It's a fun game, but not the greatest in the world. It has a lot of errors and there are general hair pulling tasks. Also, the save system is just terrible. But it's not without its merit. This is the father of Fable II which is one of my favorite games of all time. Check it out.. Ignore the low scores. Most people who give this game low scores has literally given every other great game low scores as well. This game is one of if not the most replayable game of all time. You can create so many different characters and choose different combat styles each and every time. I've played the same way through probably 5 times and still love it. I played it when it first came out and still play it now (2014). The combat multiplier is great and so is the fighting. It uses the ""z targeting"" that Zelda: Ocarina of Time implemented. I recommned this game to anyone. Give it a legitimate chance and you will love it.. All the positive reviews for this game make me loose hope in humanity. This was a very bad game.. By no means was it good. The story was awful, and the good and evil aspect was very poorly implemented. The only reason it sold as massively as it did was due to the insanely over hyped advertisement campaign. The game did not in any way live up to a single one of its boasted features. When I see this many positive reviews for what was a very bad game I call shenanigans.. Due to years in development and endless promises from creator Peter Molyneux about reinventing the role playing genre Fable arrived on the Xbox amongst a huge amount of hype and anticipation. In the end the title ended up as a cross between an RPG and an adventure title that removes many of the more complex character levelling elements found in PC titles and instead focuses on creating an open world playground for the player to inhabit. As a result the game is far more accessible to the average gamer. That is not to say however that the game completely lacks any of the features associated with RPGs. For example completing quests and defeating enemies provides coloured orbs that help improve your players magic etc and different weapons and armour can be equipped to improve your characters abilities. Plenty of side quests are also provided and the player is free to choose whether they wish to veer towards good or evil when tackling these in the same way that Mass Effect of Star Wars: KOTOR allows. While the main quest helps to pull the play along it is the open for exploration world of Albion that is perhaps the games defining feature. Villages, forests and mountains are always full of life and the characters that inhabit these places are full of verve and no shortage of charm. With plenty of mini-games available as well as the option to buy properties, get married and even start a family it is easy to find yourself spending hours just seeing what you can discover. While Fable is not exactly the revolution that was promised, it is still one of the best RPGs available on the Xbox and will certainly satisfy those looking for fast paced game with a little more depth and freedom than your average action title.. This was the game that convinced me to get an Xbox. Such a fresh idea and so well executed. A bit short with a lack luster ending, but thanks to the Lost chapters, it is now a complete game. Great visuals, great storytelling and a total joy to experience. But, on the negative side, I did feel the story was a bit directionless at times, at times the game felt morel like a collection of side quests. Also your character's aging happens far to fast and it does get a bit unbelievable that a 80 year old man would be in that kind of physical shape (not impossible, but also not really plausible.) Overall: Fable 1 was a great start to the franchise. It was flawed and far from perfect, but had enough charm and character to make it stand out.. One of the best game I've ever played. Learning curve is very well balanced, the game bring you in the world of fun and you are then addicted to it. Graphic and voice are all immersive. You cannot miss this experience.. This is a fantastic western RPG and easily one of the best games on the original Xbox. While other games have imitated many of the original Fable's mechanics, this game still feels fresh years later. Here are my 2 cents on it: Pros -Story: Simply amazing. The plot is simple but the way it was told was unrivaled at the time. Lots of colorful side quests as well. -Atmosphere: Fable somehow makes the fantasy setting feel fresh and unique. The game has a sense of wonder and discovery that few games manage to capture, including the later installments in the series. -Combat System: Its not the most complex combat system, but its one of the most enjoyable. The skills and leveling system fits the warrior/rogue/mage fantasy archetypes, but most players will eventually end up being all 3. Huge variety in weapons and spells. Enchanting weapons adds an extra layer to the game and certain spells can switch things up. -Side stuff: Marrying multiple wives, buying and renting properties, playing the gambling games, and large number of side quests. -Musical score: honestly, just YouTube the music. Cons -Game length: its a little on the short side for a western rpg. Don't believe the exaggerators saying its only 9hrs; story is 12hrs and you can get 7 extra hours of side stuff. Still short compared to the sprawling open worlders. Grab the game with the expansion and you can tack on a few hours. -Linear: Not necessarily a fault in most games, but Fable tries to ride the line between open world and being linear. The game is pretty open and nonrestrictive, but level design doesn't allow for a lot of exploration. -Combat: Simple. The variety of spells and enchantments try to make up for this but the combat is simplistic at its core. Difficulty is also a bit low for gamers that like a challenge. Still, more challenging and complex than the two sequels in this respect. -Broken Economy system: No matter how you play you'll end up with more money than you can spend. Making some evil choices for money will make this even more apparent. Being able to buy whatever you need along with an easy combat system can make the game a bit of a cake walk. -Customization: Only reason this is on here is that you can't choose gender, race, or facial features. Of course, the later games only alleviates the first problem. Otherwise customization is a strong point. The game has its positive and negatives but its honestly an amazing experience and I think it definitely deserves a higher metacritic score. Even if you disagree, pick it up on amazon for PC. Its $15 for the expansion pack edition Fable: The Lost Chapter. Its definitely worth the price. What does the feel like many years after the overhyping? Well, not great, but not terrible either. The story is very uninteresting and the hyped things about good and evil could have been made a lot more important aspect to the game. It doesn't affect story at all, which is a shame. Now it's just more like a simple detail. The story is too short and doesn't allow you to continue after having completed it (You can only continue with your previous save files). It does have a logical reason though. The combat is good though and I like the way of leveling up. Instead of leveling up, you earn XP for specific skills, which are earned in different ways (By using magic, close combat, ranged combat). The game is still too easy though. The game is worth trying. It doesn't amaze you, but it's still worth trying.. If only it wasan't so easy this would be a perfect RPG, however the fact that i got this game when it first came out and im still playing it now shows just how good it is. Fable isn't the most amazing game out but it is still a good game. I've had a lot of fun playing it over and over again. The combat still holds up today but the quests can be a clunky. Gets an 8 from me, a worthy purchase.. If it's hype over freedom and mechanics hadn't been so incredibly hyped I might of been able to enjoy the game more. It's a linear game and way too kiddy. It does have some imaginative ideas in it though and is solid in it's gameplay. Also, too easy.. Really over hyped but its still a good game and is one of my favorite RPGs out there. The story was alright but a bit too generic. The combat was fun and addicting. There were plenty of quests to do as well as other things that kept you busy through out. I enjoyed it.. MY GOD! Nothing i have ever played yet can match the originality and pure fun possessed by fable. Combat multipliers, tattoos getting drunk! Still lionhead studios cannot create such an experience worthy of their name. Out of all the game in the universe THIS one deserves a perfect 10!. After playing and enjoying Fable II and hearing from just about everyone how the first Fable was better, I couldn't wait to pick this up and enjoy the ultimate Fable experience. It didn't happen. The game has a better storyline than the sequal, I'll grant that, but the graphics, combat, magic and ambiguous inventory system says to me that it needs to stay in the previous Xbox generation of games. Over all, the choices given to you are rather simple and have too much in black or white consequences, it doesn't have the same humor as the sequel and the npc interaction is only a quarter of what you are able to do in Fable II. This game really didn't invoke any emotion from me at all. It might have been great and revolutionary when it came out in2004, but personally it left me rolling my eyes. Fable is a game of ambition and is partly successful in it. The setting is great but feels very limited as there is little chance to go off the beaten track. The combat, magic and archery skills give the game a nice variety and give it replay value. The plot is largely forgettable, although the game makes the effort to keep it there regardless. The degree of choice you are given is nice but it would be preferable if it was not so linear. For example, the right and wrong choice are always clearly defined, with no ambiguous gray area to make players really think about their next move. The game is over too quickly, with the ending feeling rushed.. While the graphics do show a LOT of age and the controls are bad, this is still a game that is a lot of fun, the story is awesome, as is the feel of the world, it has some really fun quests, and cool locations, characters, and weapons, if you like RPGs and have an Xbox you should get this game.. well this was suppose to be the end all be all of RPg's coming out back in the day. i remember hearing all the things you where gona be able to do in it and how every story on this game was building it up saying 5 years in develpment and there is gona be so much to do! well it was all BS! what we got was a game that takes 10 hours to beat 12-13 hours if you do every thing in the game . a simplistic hack and slash combat system with a GOD AWFUL lock on system . a story that is pretty dull and 2 lame endings.a very small world to explore . the going of good or evil really means nothing out side of some rude gestures you can make and the way your charicter looks. the graphics do look good . the enchantments on wepons is cool as it also makes the wepon look sick and give it bonus damage . this game is playable dont get me wrong but its a piss poor mediocore RPG that looses alot of points for all the lies the develpores have spread on what this game was gona pull off. as far as RPG's go you could find alot more RPG;s that are far better then this .","i loved it when it was released. it gave me many, many hours of fun . gamplay is bland, the UI and HUD is bloated, and the story is empty . i think it's time to remind the world that there was once a good game ."
"1,168.Forza Horizon","Playground's debut game delivers a rich driving experience to both casuals and enthusiasts. With a huge variety of cars and events set within a colorful open world, there is never a dull moment.. Forza Horizon is still a banger a decade later. It has such a distinct festival vibe that I’d argue none of its sequels were ever able to recapture.. Coming from the ""rags to riches"" era you have to earn all the supercars and work your way up the bosses in the festival- this is the last time you'll see that gameplay in any Forza Horizon game. After this game the developers started handing out hyperarcs like Halloween candy. Horizon 1 runs at 30fps and it is solid but, come on. 30fps? Gross by today's standards. The lighting is bad too- shadow quality is awful. Otherwise, one of the best open-world racers ever.. Forza Horizon is a great game that keeps things simple and enjoyable. It doesn't bog itself down with unnecessary complexity, unlike many other racing games. I loved the game's story, which combines racing with a festive, party-like setting.. Graphics/Visuals: 9.5/10 (for standards back then), Gameplay: 8/10, Sense of Speed: 9/10, Soundtrack: 10/10, Atmosphere: 10/10, Map Design: 9/10, Replay Value: 8.5/10, Story: 7.5/10, Characters: 7/10, Overall: 9.2/10, might just be blinded by nostalgia tho. The Forza series ditches Gran Turismo purity for Need For Speed style thrills and it works well. A refreshing change of pace that breathed new life into the series.. I really like this game. I like the bossfights with rivals and a also really like those illegal races. What i dont like about this game is som bushes shouldt have collidions in my opinion and there are only 3 radio stations eith very few songs. Aldo the servers are offline but the game is pretty old now so i can understand that.. Perfect open world racing game, best in the series and it’s not even close.. The perfect Forza horizon. It gives you the vibes, songs, excitement, it adds conflits with the cocky oponents. 10/10 After this one, for me, the series went down the hill.. I love this game due to personal reasons so objectively it may not be the best, but in spirit it always will be, FH2 and 3 were fire tho.. An outstanding game that was the first in the greatest racing series in history.. If you like cars and adventure, this is your game. The original was Test drive unlimited.. A beautiful and truly awe inspiring take on the traditional Forza franchise, the open world gameplay is incredible.. A game ahead of its time! I played very little but I already had the basis that this game is wonderful since it has beautiful graphics, good gameplay and a mind-blowing draw distance for the time of game. I wish they made this game here for PC. This game is the best game ever i wish it could be available on the Microsoft store. Spoiler alert: games kinda good, maybe get idk. ‏‏‎ ‎ ‏‏‎ ‎ ‏‏‎ ‎ But actually this is a game that change Forza forever, and it’s a damn great one with it. Sure, compared to newer instalments of Forza Horizon, this game can look pretty **** but if you remember this is on a 2005 console, it’s pretty good looking. I don’t know what else to say because if you have an Xbox with a disc drive and get a copy cheap for around 20 bucks then go ahead and start playing this game as soon as you can because it’s a really good game and showed the new face of the Forza franchise.. the start of an amazing franchise! note: *if you skip the 2nd and the 5th game. best forza horizon of all time.............................................. This first Horizon game is great! You don’t feel like you are being spammed my messages or suggestions of what to do. In the other Horizon games you are bombarded non-stop and the games are bloated.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. By far the best Horizon game ever made. Only Horizon game that has any sort of story and progression. You actually start with a slow car and have to work your way to achieving faster cars on the way to becoming Horizon Champion. Far more engaging than any Horizon to date. The soundtrack, crowds at event signups and sponsor rewards also add to an incredible festival atmosphere. The multiplayer is also unmatched. Only Horizon title to include Motorsport Custom lobbies. Why PG ever went to garbage adventure modes in FH2 amazes me. This system was already perfect in FH1, why remove something that works? The car classes were also way more balanced. R1/R2/R3 system is far better than the X/S2/S1 system in later horizon titles. If the Horizon series is to ever improve the developers need to return to the aspects that made this game such a masterpiece.. This is my favorite racing game of all time. The sense of progression throughout, the reward factor of unlocking new cars, and the load of additional content is awesome. I wish the newer games carried on with this sense of reward throughout, as they tend to just hand you your dream cars at the beginning of the game. XP and Credits are far more valuable in this game, straying away from the inflated nature of the newer Horizon games.. Cool game! It is fascinating to drive so many top racing cars that I could never afford to buy.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 8 Music: 9 Story: 6 Total: 8.00. The first horizon franchise and one of the best in my opinion. Very long game, tough races and good storyline. Played this on original 360.. This was one of my first games for xbox 360 and what else can i say than beautiful. This whole game is just a racing masterpiece. If you haven't played it you should because it's one of the most quality racing games ii have ever played. It so happened that by launching the first part of Forza Horizon, I managed to play in all subsequent ones. I did not expect anything special from the original, but it is still very clamped on the Xbox 360 in terms of technical capabilities. And how wrong I was. Personally, for me, the first part is the best in the series, perhaps it will now seem very small and short. There is not as much gaming content as in the 3 or 4 part. There is very little free space outside the roads. But she came out on the generation of consoles the year before last and it was in 2012. In 2012, there was nothing similar in the genre of arcade racing. And the subsequent parts of the franchise did not go very far. Just the best race on Xbox 360.. Beautiful, fun, good sim-arcade handling, simple, well-designed, good story for a racing game, lots of interesting cars, first Forza to implement nighttime.... Never thought this could be done so well but man, Microsoft did great with this one.. Forza Horizon - 9.5 / 10 {highly recommend} The game that revolutionized the genre, and brought this different theme of open world with racing, with no need to run from the police, you could run, take breaks with other runners, admire the landscapes, in a place where everyone was runners like you, a unique experience, with perfect music, perfect, and challenging design. It’s just not perfect for some physics issues in racing, but it does not affect the good experience that you will have playing.. ---{Graphics}--- ☐ You forget what reality is ☐ Beautiful X Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{Gameplay}--- ☐ Very good X Good ☐ It‘s just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{Audio}--- ☐ Eargasm ☐ Very good X Good ☐ Not too bad ☐ Bad ☐ I'm now deaf ---{Audience}--- ☐ Kids ☐ Teens ☐ Adults X All ---{Difficulity}--- ☐ Just press 'W' ☐ Easy ☐ Significant brain usage X Easy to learn / Hard to master ☐ Difficult ☐ Dark Souls ---{Story}--- ☐ No Story X Some lore ☐ Average ☐ Good ☐ Lovely ☐ It‘ll replace your life ---{Game Time}--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short X Average ☐ Long ☐ To infinity and beyond ---{Price}--- ☐ It’s free! ☐ Worth the price X If u have some spare money left ☐ Not recommended ☐ You could also just burn your money ---{Bugs}--- X Never heard of ☐ Minor bugs ☐ Can get annoying ☐ ARK: Survival Evolved ☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs. Horizon was polarizing when it first came out, but the game quickly became a sort of spiritual successor to both Need for Speed Underground 2, as well as the Project Gotham Racing franchise that had been axed a few years earlier. Horizon isn't a particularly challenging game, but an enjoyable, flowing map mixed with Forza's trademark customization/storefront options and only the best street cars on the Forza Motorsport roster made for a title that was worth playing long after you'd concluded the rather simple campaign mode.. perfect game, if u have time and money, go and play, nice graphics, soundtrack, car sound, races, 10/10. This game was a amazing racing arcade style game. The radios, the visuals, graphics and the gameplay is all top notch. The good: Here I start all open world races without the need to put cops, custom progression, a festival many coordination hubs, confrontation against super-Stars, crazy events car vs jet car Vs helicopter, car vs hot air balloons ..., ground-ground Mini -maniac, licensed soundtrack, hundreds of events, illegal street races away from the festival, landscape and car photography events, you start as a nobody and must climb to defeat defending champion Daryus Flint, Chain of Skills, The Seasons 3 Seasons initials (Horizon Pulse and Horizon Rocks), Serious and normal or crazy driving, day-night cycles. There is still community playing it. It is backward compatible. It has a 4K upgrade patch X for Xbox One X that makes it look like a current generation game. Its Rally and Club 100 expansions add many more hours to the game. All the cars have a view of the interior cabin with hands and gloves and a level and Forza-Vista color bracelet (at that time Autovista) and no ""premium cars"" or ""Gold cars"" or ""diamond cars"" from other games. One of the best licensed video game soundtracks. The bad: The game forces you to run dirty, to be closed to competitors, to do more arcade things even with the physics engine of Forza Motorsport 4, this will get you off the hook in the first races, until you get used to or leave the game. That in the next review of song rights it may disappear from stores. The backwards compatible base game does not include the Rally expansion or the Club 1000 expansion. The more time passes the less people will be in the multiplayer. The great Latin Spanish dub is erased in the backward compatible version and we will hear the same characters with tones and accents of Spanish Castillan (Peninsular Spanish) and their **** idioms The Meh !: No, it is not in the GamePass. If you are one of those who came to the Horizon Festival in games like Forza Horizon 3 or 4, this game will not seem like much. A lot to throw flowers at Playground Games, but the basis of this game and the models, the physics engine and the recreation tricks of the tracks and circuits are from Forza Motorsport 3 and Forza Motorsport 4 of Turn 10, there it is in the box and they are never or almost never given the credit they deserve. the forza with a unique atmosphere and although we are already in 4 installments of forza horizon, it is still a unique forza. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: GREAT.. This was the best forza game for it's time. Now in 2020 I wouldn't recommend it very much but I'f you want a really cheap game you can't go wrong. This was the first game I got for my xbox 360and it was great.. [x] Perfect [ ] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. this game is one of the best and most racing games I have ever played the races are so much fun it's realistic but not too realistic and it has more of an open world feel than most other racing games it's a must buy. The first **** series of racing games. However, especially in hindsight, the setting is lacklustre.. What a great game. Had so much fun playing this. One of my all time fav racing game and series out there. Pickens out.. Forza Horizon is probably my favorite racing game as of right now. I love the massive amount of cars.. This is one of the worst forza i played of all time. Lack of cars, way too many dlc. Why did they even made this game? The other horizons are better.. Im not even a racing games fan. I find them boring. so when I tell you, me, a non racing fan, like this game is because its awesome!!! if you are collecting for the Xbox 360, this is a must have!!! amazing graphics, soundtrack, gameplay. just get it already !. Forza Horizon took Forza Motorsport's realistic mechanicals, Need For Speed exploration and put many racing games in its generation on the shame.. Horizon may not be as socially capable as some open-world games, but it's still a terrific racer. It's hard to overstate just how beautiful the world is that Playground Games has created. From the foothills of the Rockies to the winding roads that scale desert cliffs, it's an absolute delight to put your car through its paces as you explore every last inch of asphalt. Horizon's occasional missteps may clash with the machinelike precision of the Motorsport games that preceded it, but its ambition and untethered road map more than make up for those faults. This is a game that understands the thrill of the open road, and in delivering that thrill it's an unqualified success.. Very good racing game. For being an Xbox 360 game looks like an early Xbox One game. The soundtrack fits pretty well and the open world is really good in this game. You can do a lot of things in this game, it never gets boring. The only problem is that the game should have more cars. FM4 had a lot more, but I personally prefer FH. 9/10. Tried this just because it was a free game with xbox live, totally disapointed at this game. Seems like a rip off of Need for speed drift. Even the narator sound alike. The races are wayyyyyyy to looooooong. Boring as H. Thank god it didn't spend a dime on this game. The only flaw with this game is invisible barriers. but honestly, without those this game beats forza horizon 2, due to its flawless racing mechanics, which in all fairness, do not match real life, but hey its a game. I had my doubts. But the truth is that the game shows that even if the Forza for the general public this led me excellently. the game has a lot livertad, many cars, lots of customization, many races, good sense of speed and on Line fantastic.. Honestly saying this is the best console racing game of las gen . It is just a pure fun to ride across Colorado, watching at the gorgeous look of its places. Personally, I dislike Gran Turismo (Specifically GT5 (Not to be confused with GTA5)) and have always preferred arcade racers (Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, Burnout Paradise etc.), so when I went into Forza Horizon, boy was I surprised. Pros: The setting of Forza Horizon is stunning and unique. No other game (aside from Horizon 2) has the same fantastic atmosphere of being in a racing festival. The feeling is gratifying and atmospheric. Along with the great atmosphere, the visuals are also fantastic to look at. Not quite up to Halo 4's standard, but lighting is great and environments look very good. The actual driving is very nice. Much better than Gran Turismo. The controls are very nice, the scheme actually makes sense and difficulty is generally balanced, even though you can change it. Sound design, unlike Gran Turismo, is great! The right cars have the right amount of auditory aggression to them and its great! There are lots of things to do at Horizon, from races to PR stunts to RACING HELICOPTERS AND PLANES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is a lot of variety to the game and you will not run out of races to do. There are lots of cars to buy and choose from. Not too sure how many there are, but there is a good variety of car brands and racing purists will spend ages looking through them. The online modes are actually very surprisingly good. They are generally fun and you can get into some games, despite many people not playing the game anymore. (Possibly because of Horizon 2 being out). Nitpick: Personally, the music is not to my taste and just reminds me what this world has come to. It doesn't affect the game though. In conclusion. Forza Horizon is a fantastic game and is on par with Halo 4 as my 2012 Game of the Year! Darn, Microsoft did well for me in 2012 :D 10/10. This game is awesome a must own for any racing or top gear **** has a lot to do and a nice car list and well-designed world,the one weakness is that the main campaign will probably take 6-10 hours which is not long enough for a racing games.. This is a brilliant game with so many good features in **** got good driving physics and beautiful graphics with a pretty big map. It has really good music too. This game has a special feature, you can rewind time when your in a race or free roam so if you crash you can go back. Its a great game.. While visually very nice and I like the idea of the open world racing game, Forza Horizon never offered anything that would be fun or captivating, it all felt like a mindless racing around in some random races, until I just completely lost my interest. I would stick to NFS series for quality racing games as far as I'm concerned, recently played Most Wanted that handled the racing entertainment in the open world much better imo. 5/10. I just came back to this game after tossing out its disappointing sequel (360 version) and was reminded of what an excellent game it is. The selection of cars, setting, music, graphics, driving physics are all brilliant and that is no exaggeration. It is without a doubt the most fun racing game I have played on the Xbox 360, and probably the best I've ever played on any console.. A really fun game with AMAZING graphics. It has great colour to it, and the shining sun looks ever so beautiful shining on the cars. The multiplayer is great fun, and I mean GREAT.. Forza Horizon 2 on the Xbox 360 is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced, you see all the amazing new features and cars, then get onto the 360 and realise they're only for the Xbox One, there are bits of the map that are inaccessible, poor landscape graphics, cheesy starts to races with the arcade noises and missing cars that are unavailable on the 360. This made the game a huge disappointment for me, I couldn't wait to try out some of the amazing rally cars and drift around the docks and warehouses but you can't go there and it makes the game horrible. If that isn't enough, Turn 10 have put so little effort into the 360 version that you go online (which no longer contains online free roam unless it's private with friends) that people have already hacked the game to gain maximum level and credits. If you are going to get this game, don't get it on the xbox 360. So after getting this game 2 years ago, I can still pick it up, put it into my 360 and have as much fun in it as if I only got it a month ago. I have like 20 other racing games that I've collected since 2007 for the 360, and 18 of them I haven't even touched. So why did I pick up Horizon again after over a year? Because the virtual driving experience that it provides is really unique and thrilling, and there is no other game out there that can provide such an experience, not until Horizon 2 drops in a few weeks. That experience is having robust sim-cade car handling on the open world. It may feel like an arcade racer at first, but get in a RWD supercar, turn off all the assists, select cockpit view and try to drive as fast as you can while sticking to one road lane, and you'll discover something that you've never experienced before in any Need for Speed game.. Forza Horizon is a fun open world racer using more realistic physics than it's competition. The soundtrack is first rate, and the car selection (compared to other racers of the type) is commendable as well. Also, Forza Horizon again packs loads of modifications into it's car builds. The game offers a nice variety of tracks and challenges that contribute to some pretty solid gameplay time. All of this would make you think that Forza Horizon should be an 8 or a 9, and if you are unfamiliar with the Forza family of games you would be absolutely right. I am not unfamiliar with Forza, I have played Forza 1-4, and this game is a 6 for me. 1st-The story line is better than other Forza titles which have none, but is not an adequate story compared to other open world racers. 2nd-If you are very familiar with Forza, than you will be disappointed by how few cars there are. 3rd-If you have to play Forza games at max difficulty, this game will infuriate you. You will hit races where you have only one or two car options and neither will seem fast enough. You will smash your head against a table after your 30th attempt to complete a 2 minute race. 4th-And finally, Turn 10 are crooks and dangle DLC cars in front of your nose constantly. Add to that Rally upgrades and races not available until you get the DLC. Add to that Tokens that you purchase with real money to get crap add-ons like fast travel anywhere and treasure maps. Couple this with the recent Forza 5 ""Day of DLC"" that cost almost as much as the game just to give you a proper amount of cars for a simulator and you have fairly conclusive evidence that Turn 10 makes games with as little content as they can get away with and then spend the rest of your gaming time trying to milk you for every dollar. (And breathe...) This game is a de-contented twist on an excellent franchise that seems doomed to drown in it's own greed. It is still a good game but it could have been great. Can the next racing simulator franchise please stand up.. The game is ok but their is no tuning board the fine tune your car. you can buy all the upgrades but how the hell are you suppose to truly fine out how powerful your car is with out tuning radiculous.. I love that this game is expanding the audience from a typical gear head Forza. I like arcade type games and this one hits the spot without making me feel like I have not grown up. I would suggest that anyone looking for something a little different in a racer but still likes it to be grounded in reality to check this game out! I can't wait for the next one to come out on the ""horizon"" .... Thanks, I will be here all week, try the fish!. Forza Horizon, a nice twist on the original forza Motorsport series. Changing from a track based racing same to a free roam. With over 150 cars to choose from this game is no exeption. It has a slightly different racing style to forza 4 but it has the nice arcade feel ive been wanting from forza which they can improve on in their new release of forza Horizon 2 at E3 this year. Looking at the cover, I didn't expect an engaging, fast, fun and incredible game. Nothing is better than driving strait down the interstate at 200 mph taking in all the Colorado scenery than pulling off a fifty foot drift and into a fence . There are still flaws like the amount of invisible walls, the crash physics and how you can't use half the sweet cars you buy in races. But, that is ignored when I beat my friends speed zone record.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best game i've ever played on my xbox 360 so realistic, when you've got xbox live you can get 193 cars and the most legany car on the planet is in the offline gameplay. lots of dlc cars to download and car packs ect, rally pack witch is deffantly worth the £13.67 you get 5 diffrent cars to start off with and lots of different parts for when making a rally car. GET IT. This game is awesome just awesome the best graphics ever and the cars are so life like it is insane. But finding the barn finds is pretty hard I think.. Forza Horizon is a great game. A beautiful open world that immerses you combined with strong racing elements makes for a breath-taking experience. The barn finds in the game, also, are extremely enjoyable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Keep doing what you do best, as this shows clearly fine art. I have played this game since day 1, and I love it. A few minor details that have room for improvement even though the bar has been set so high because of this game. PROS: Beautiful scenic drives in different locations, real time traffic, great camera views, and good selection of cars CONS: Sound! Huge deal for me especially on 5.1/7.1 dolby, needs more depth, more projection from engine noise such as when your doing 120 mph through a section of buildings or even full throttle in a 500-1000 hp vehicle it would be extremely loud, sound waves bouncing off every object, and tons of commotion to where you cant think straight with a pair of Sennheisser or Turtle Beach PX51 headphones. Also more car selection like the older cars from previous games such as mazda 787b.. If your thing is playing a game that could have been so great but ruined by the collision physics on multiplayer, i had about 15 online races with one being clean and that is because the collisions were off, no matter how much you try and keep clean and play fair your bashed purposely by everyone and come off worse 9 times out of 10 despite being the good one. What a shame they failed with this aspect of the game which makes it an utterly useless addition to any serious gamers collection, unless you can deal with the full contact racing if not i strongly advise to look elsewhere.. Forza Horizion is a poor game for many reason's, The price of the DLC's for one, 4000 msp for the season is a rip off, the cars are all the same, there's not enough cars on the game, too short of a career mode. This game is not worth the money. stay away from it.. this game is fantastic! reminds me of need for speed underground last generation but with a huge open world and a tonne of great cars. graphically the game is great and the environments and cars have that great feel. the difficulty of the game can be adjusted in a number of ways to ensure the game is never to hard or to easy. throw in a tonne of customization abilities, many racing modes and open world events such as random challenges, barnyard cars and speed cameras this game has a lot of content.. Why does this game have so many good reviews. This game isn't even really made by Turn 10. It's boring, repetitive. I was hoping for a realistic open world racer and that's not what I got.. Exactly what IGN said. 'It's the game we've been taught not to expect'. Great map, great cars, great detail, overall the game works amazingly. Only bad thing I would say is how they approach thew DLC. It's good, but only 6 cars for 400MSP is a bit bad. People complain about a small car list, but c'mon. How many games nowadays have 140 cars? With a lot of them being great cars, and not 50 odd Nissans and Hondas. The game was short, around 15-20 to complete, but there was still stuff to do after you finish. And that was improved apon even more with the free 1000 club expansion. Amazing game. Forza Horizon is an open world concept racing game that is set in Colorado and is centered around the Forza Horizon music festival. The main objective of the game is to well... race and earn wristbands and challenge other drivers. The driving handles pretty much like any other Forza title. In Forza Horizon you are able to travel on dirt roads, city streets and a highway. Graphically, the game is nothing less than breathtaking. The scenery is fantastic and the day to night transitions are beautiful. One interesting feature is the different challenges in which you can race against planes. There is a wide variety of different vehicles to choose from to keep you satisfied. All and all this is a great effort by the folks from playground games and turn 10. There are a few complaints I have with this game that are relatively minor like not truly being able to explore areas, because it is fenced off. I would consider it more of an open road game than an open world game. Weather effects would have been a great addition, travelling in the snow capped Rocky mountains with snow falling would have been fantastic. I would have liked to have seen more vehicle damage and windshield cracks when crashing head on with another driver. As people of said, it is more like a Need for Speed title, but Forza at it's core. Overall, Forza Horizon is a great addition to the Forza Motorsport series. 8/10. Best racing game to date, also arguably the most realistic and the best looking. Perfect combination of cars, tuning and customization, location, story, events, realism and detail. Other developers should take notes.. a game that should have gone under a different name, because of the Forza title I am holding it upto Forza standards, giant lack of cars on game release makes it massively lacking in the variety area compared to earlier games given massive amounts of car packs but who wants to spend more then the inital 60 when previous titles already contained more. Also game contains the Bugatti. Any game that has that car without actual full blown race cars in it is ruined in my opinion, nothing can match its speed and pretty much your goal is to just get that car because once its in your possession you have the best car in the game. Lack of customization is also a issue, previous titles had much more in-depth customization that I don't feel should have been left out. This game is not a true forza game instead a cheap knock off and I do feel it can be called a knock off since its put under the Exact same title. Would be a 7 of 10 instead if it wasn't just riding the True forzas fame to get sales on a wanna be. So first look into horizon, I'd have to say the only negative complaints are this. There's no split screen multiplayer, and the sound of some of the cars (You're reading a review from a gearhead, keep in mind) aren't very accurate. It almost appears like the FH team focused on the big, expensive cars more than the little ones. Of course, the Pagani Huayra was straight on cue, but the smaller, slower cars aren't given as much love! Other than that, still my favorite racing game, just as good as FM 4, but in a completely different perspective. The only thing I wish I could fix is the noise and the multiplayer features.. This game is awesome, they introcued a new side series for Free-Roam in which made users travel around the city beating Racers on the Road to earn cash and also beat the Speed Cams. A amazing game this is.. The game is so much cool 150 cars a smalest collection comparing with fm4 and its dont have the co op multiplayer but this game is really fantastic the graphics are so beautiful and the story is so perfect and the multiplayer was the same as fm4 but its so nice. Great stuff, lots of diversity in the races, runs very smooth for 30hz. It''s good to look at as a companion to FM4 - it's frivolous but probably more fun, just less intense - so it depends what you're in the mood for. It's technically remarkable, kudos to the devs. To put handling like this in an open world sets a precedent. All the hip urban festival stuff is bulls**t, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the game.. Such distances from the original series are often not good, in this case, however, lived up to the task, and Microsoft has done a really nice racer. Interesting festival atmosphere, very pleasant driving model, interesting races, open road, and most importantly, the view from the inside, so that the game is really fun. The game, however, has its drawbacks, we feel terrible constraints on the choice of cars, not used for racing at night, do not admire artwork and designer to the power of imposing additional races. My Rating - 8/10. ","forza horizon 1 runs at 30fps and it is solid but, come on. 30fps? Gross by today's standards . the game's story combines racing with a festive, party-like setting ."
"1,169.Chaos Reborn","I backed this game on Kickstarter and got mostly what I expected and more. The team just kept adding more to the game and suddenly it transformed from the simple little strategy gem i admired into a full blown campaign with lots of rules and multiple styles of play. It is a fun little game for fans of X-COM, Archon, or any similar turn based strategy titles.. Chaos Reborn is a perfect blend, taking the fine art of risk management/mitigation from timeless games like poker and adding a turn based strategy fantasy theme. The game is so good I have left my wife and job and I have not eaten in 9 months, I see this as a positive. Chaos allows you to build your own sets of equipment, shaping the likelihood of what spells you receive and creating unique playstyles and almost infinite possible load-outs. There are realms to explore and co-op play with friends with social ranks and guilds to come The real strength of Chaos however, comes from the PVP aspect , I have read reviews and comments about the RNG system making Chaos overly reliant on luck, this is nonsense. % chances of spell casts and combat resolutions are displayed on screen and choosing the timing and method of attack, which spells to boost the % of or discard, when to bluff with an illusion and which tactics to use to give yourself a +expected value for victory are skills which are all required to make a good Chaos player.. Lovely and unique approach to TBS genre from a little indie studio headed by established maître of this genre Julian Gollop. Originally created as a re-imagining of good ol' Speccy classic, this title managed to bring fresh air in almost every aspect of classy strategy play. While core mechanics seems to be purely luck based with zero skill involved at the first glance, in fact it requires from player to re-flash his wetware in order to master sophisticated witchcraft and wizardry of risk management, short-term planning, bluffing and even behavioral psychology, keeping massive impact on improvisation and enthusiastic play style. This little gem does not hesitate to constantly treat you as a newbie, without concessions. Things never will work like you want them to; for someone watching his precious 90% cast failing could be a punishing experience. The key is - hope for the best, prepare for the worst! Still, if you can't wrap your wishful thinking around Chaos Reborn, it will be better for you to stay away from RNG sorcery. That said, if you've desperately wandering around game market in search for deep and thoughtful game with unique mechanics of chess and poker - rejoice! No doubt this game has it's own flaws, but most of them could be classified as first attempts from inexperienced little indie studio. Come on, fellow wizard, join me in this zingy journey of blobs and bolts with almost infinite replay ability and tons of fun!. Julian Gollop returns to form with probably the best Turn Based tactics game on the market right now. Finely balanced multiplayer action for up to 4 players (unfortunately no longer 8 like in the original game). The game plays out like a cross between chess, poker, and wizards, you've got a strong tactical element to game play (like chess), but with a percentage chance of each move you make working or failing. This in itself would make for a quite simple game, until you then add in firstly a bluff mechanic (like Poker, or Liar Dice), and secondly the possibilities to both store up magic and affect the alignment of the world that you're fighting this in turn lets you mitigate your future future luck (like real Wizards do) Btw - It's technically not possible for an rng to be broken, only to be programmed, a 90% cast will be successful 90% of the time. From my experience of playing the game >600 hours, this is exactly what happens. The trick is to be prepared for that 10% chance of a fail and plan your game accordingly. It's like Russian Roulette, if you've a 1 in 6 chance that you're going to shoot yourself in the head is that a chance that you're willing to take?. Snapshot Games introduces their own theory of probability. You expect that spell with 90% success rate will be casted? You shouldn't. 80%? Nah. Once my wizard failed to cast 3 spells with 80% success rate one after another. The other side of this coin is for example you may think that your buffed shielded wizard will survive one hit from silly rat which have only 13% to success. But he won't. So my point is when you say that some event will happen with 80% success than it should be exactly 80%. Otherwise its nonsense. I would not recommend anyone game with such broken random numbers generator.. The way the game plays is absolutely great. I love mixing a Card Desk Game with Turn based strategy combat. Take any Youtube video to see how the game plays. It will tell you much more than words. Why 7 as a mark then? Because of the cons: - only 60 spells (of which only 24 creatures) to cast. This is ridiculously small... - from this point: you are not able customize your desk. Your desk has about 15-20 cards in combat. The cards you have in your deck are completely randomized. You can slightly adjust deck creation randomness with Talismans and Staves, some of which can provide you 100% chance of getting a certain card in your deck. This is a 20E game, not a 5E one... Why so few spells? Why not being able to customize your deck? 20EUR... No real single player campaign, only 60 spells, no faction / race, no customized deck creation... I'm sorry but this is a RIPOFF!! At this point I am sorry to say that Etherlords is by far superior. Ok Etherlords is a pure Card game but it has a campaign, it is a very good ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" style game (map, buildings, resources, enemies on the map) with a great combat system (card like). Etherlords has 4 races, more than 300 spells, it has heroes and battle mode allows you to fully customize your deck. And it trades for 5EUR!!!! If Chaos Reborn at least triples the number of available spells and creatures and adds more ability to customize your desk it would be a REAL 9/10.. I don't get this game and stopped after playing though the tutorials and completing the first map conquest. The game is ridiculously random and this is not a good thing. All of combat seems to be ""who can cast gooey blob the other guy first"". That's it. Seriously, gooey blob kills enemy mages in 1 turn, making tactics kinda pointless, it's run up, cast gooey blob, wait for the enemy to die. After I complete the map, I don't really see much point in continuing - it does not appear like I can actually build my deck. I can pick some staves that have certain decks linked to them, I can add amulets that add certain cards to the deck, but other than that, it's purely random cards.. Amazing turn based tactics game. It reminds me of poker in a lot of ways because of the risk/reward nature of the percentage based combat. The multiplayer is the highlight because of the mind games you can play against a real person, but the single player is fun as well, incorporating an rpg metagame. Overall, amazing.. Single player campaign with or without other players if u are online and like other to help you in your campaign that is a hell of fun in this game. I really like the turn based strategy in this game which where just one match againt an AI wizard doesn't take hour but between 10-20min. Besides the magic battles also the overall strategy part where you manage conquering your realm is very immersive and fun. The game didn't catch me until I discovered the campaign thing which is to much hidden in the menu.. Easily one of the best tactics games of the last decade. Decide for yourself: Am I a whining scrub who doesn't understand probabilities and cries at the first sign of challenge and adversity or rather a seasoned gamer who appreciates tactical richness, enjoys the challenge of reformulating a plan in the face of unexpected setbacks, and values replayability? I'll see you on the pitch.. This is the ultimate definition of ""taking your chances"" type of game. You'll lose many tutorial battles based on missing 4 attacks in a row with a 60% of hit-chance. Other than that it's a solid game and if you like number crunching you should give it a try.. This game is an absolutely fantastic hybrid of Heathstone, Xcom, Final Fantasy and Poker (mostly poker). Like Poker, it is a game of chance that has the base mechanic heavily steeped in RNG. However, also like poker, there is a massive amount of skill that goes into playing mind games with your opponent, bluffing, and using the various RNG management mechanics to make sure that you achieve victory. This is not a game you can simply win by being lucky. It requires thought, practice, and a lot skill to be good. I can't recommend this game enough.. One of the best tactics games of all times. Every outcome is game is binary, so it can seem like luck will either give you everything you ever wanted or destroy all your hopes and dreams, but the more the you play the more you realize that everything is very clever calculated risk and mind games. The best players win over and over and over and not through sheer luck. Sure, some games will go better and in a really close game luck can be the deciding factor, but for anyone who has played a tabletop game like Warmachine I would say the luck dependence for high level play is similar. The single player game is more of a communal RPG then anything else, which for me has been very engaging and very a unique experience. There is progression and customization, but for the strategy purest, all tournaments are played on a completely even playing field with no pre-game customization. I won't go in to more detail, but one can find out plenty about the game through any of a number of articles that previewed the game.. An absolute ""must have"" for fans of turn based strategy. I would describe Chaos Reborn as Chess meets Stratego with a M:tG skin. You just can't grasp the amount of depth to the game without playing a few matches for yourself. The videos won't do it justice. Matches last anywhere from 2 mins to half and hour and they are all enjoyable. Any diehard fans of the original X-com: UFO Defense should probably know Mr. Julian Gollop for crafting challenging, well-balanced games with just enough divine intervention from RNGesus to keep you on your toes and Chaos Reborn is no exception. At the time of this writing I have a mere 88 hours on record, easily worth the $20 I initially paid. I enjoyed it so much I happily contributed an additional $30 to support at Wizard Lord status (granting me exclusive skins, forge tools and few other goodies, but no tangible gameplay advantages). If you like turn based strategy, board games, or X-com then grab it up.. A great mix of turn based strategy, bluff and double bluff. Great game play involving a combination of multiplayer and single player modes. Highly recommended. There is probably only one man on Earth who could have played the original ""Chaos - The Battle of Wizards"" and thought, ""I know how to make this better"". To improve on the most perfectly balanced, addictive, and downright fun game of the 8-bit era was a Herculean task, but Julian Gollop has done it. Chaos Reborn captures the spirit of the original perfectly, whilst surpassing its visuals and mechanics in almost every way. This is marriage-threateningly good.. The original Chaos for the ZX Spectrum was my favourite and most played game out of around 1000 games that I have played in my lifetime. This remake has brought the game up to date whilst keeping all of the core mechanics that made the original so endlessly repayable. I usually play games single player but this game is best played multi player as the A.I does not give you the same challenge that human opponents can. I like to constantly have around 20 asynchronous games on the go and find this to be a nice relaxed way of playing multi player as you can make your moves when you want and can take half an hour over your move if you so wish. Most complaints about the game are down to the RNG but this is what keeps the games so interesting and makes no two games the same. To become good at the game you have to become a master of risk management and bluffing to manipulate the luck side of the game. I would not hesitate to recommend this brilliant game and if you are a fan of strategy games and have the patience to see past the initial impression that the game is all luck then I am sure you will love this game too.. While it has many good points solid turn based system the real problem is in single player and how they decided to implement and force you on a set path of coop if they wont change that i am against it. Turn based tactics game with a very unique game system that's designed for easy to get into, fast playing turn based fun! Comes with a well balanced multiplayer pvp mode and a single player mode that lets you explore realms created by the snap shot company as well as community members. Alot of online based systems that makes playing the game a blast whether pvp or coop. There is a coop system that is darksoulesque (ally/invader function) it really is the closest thing you'll get to xcom meets dark souls which is a combination i never thought would be so awesome! Check it out!. A turn-based battle of wizards! Slay dragons! Summon the hydra! This is Chaos Reborn. Updated for version 1.00. Summary: Fast-Paced Wizard Chess With RNG You start in an arena with one to three other wizards. You have one of several staffs and a plethora of spells. You can summon hordes of creatures and send them into battle while you support them with your magic. Or cast Divine Blade, hop aboard a manticore, and challenge the enemy wizards in personal combat. You can bluff by summoning creatures as illusions. Entrap hostile monsters with the gooey blob. Singe your opponent's eyebrows with a magic bolt. There is a great deal of strategy involved, but luck also plays a big role in the game, making every match unique. The Luck Factor Every spell you cast has a percent chance to succeed. Every attack you make has a percent chance to kill. There are no hit points in Chaos Reborn. An action is either wildly successful or a dismal failure. This makes for exciting swings in fortune! One moment you might be sitting on top of the world because you've cornered your opponent with a sapphire dragon, unicorn, and giant spider. Suddenly, your opponent's magic bolt kills your spider, your opponent runs the unicorn through with her sword, and your opponent's rat somehow manages to slay your dragon (an 8% chance!). Now you're on the back foot and have to do some fast thinking to salvage the situation. The luck factor can create some ridiculously funny situations in Chaos Reborn. My most fun and memorable games have involved wild swings in fortune. That being said, careful planning is still a very important aspect of the game. You must be constantly aware of your chances, maximize your odds, and prepare a backup plan in case lady luck doesn't go your way. Bluffing can also help control the influence of luck. (See below.) Bluffing! Although all spells have a percent chance to fail, you can choose to cast any creature as an illusion and automatically be successful 100% of the time. An illusion behaves precisely like a ""real"" creature: it can attack, defend, fly, and carry you around on its back if it is a mount. But perhaps an enemy wizard suspects that huge dragon you summoned last turn is an illusion. He casts Disbelieve on your dragon and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. That's the downside to using illusions. If the dragon had been real, the Disbelieve spell would have failed and your opponent would have wasted his turn! If you are a great bluffer, you can probably get away with summoning lots of illusory creatures. If you are a very perceptive person you can probably deduce which creatures your opponents have summoned as illusions and Disbelieve them! Graphics I am a big fan of the graphics in this game. The art direction is distinctive and avoids the typical visual cliches associated with well-known fantasy creatures like unicorns and dwarves. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Law tend to have cool colors and a rigid crystalline appearance. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Chaos tend to have warm colors and an ""entropic"" aesthetic. If you like unique art direction, you will love this. If you prefer predictable visuals that you can easily associate with character models from other games, this will probably not be your cup of tea. More to Come! There is a great deal more to be added in the coming months. There will be a social rank system with orders (guilds), demi-gods, and gods. Have you ever wanted to be a God? Well start gathering your worshipers because you will have that chance in Chaos Reborn! What the Game Is Not Some folks seem to be under the impression that this is a deck-building game similar to Magic: the Gathering. It really isn't. Chaos Reborn does not have thousands of spells to choose from, and you will probably never have full control over the ""deck"" of spells that you bring into duels. While this game is clearly a ""10"" for me, I also realize it is not for everybody. If you do not like turn-based games, or you dislike random number generator mechanics, this game might not be your cup of tea.. TL;DR: I enjoy this game immensely. This review summarizes some reasons why. THE THEME: At the end of the 14th century, Earth **** into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflict over who controls the many, surviving realms of old Earth. Each realm holds the promise of ancient artifacts, lore, and power to fuel the ambitions of wizards and gods alike. It is a feudal, dystopic society of magic users. THE DEVELOPER: Chaos Reborn is a rebirth and reimagining of Chaos: The Battle of Wizards (1985) and Lords of Chaos (1990) by their original creator, Julian Gollop. Mr. Gollop is more known for creating the original X-COM: UFO Defense (1994), the widely acclaimed classic which inspired XCOM: Enemy Unknown and many other games. The classic Chaos and X-COM games were rooted upon deep, tactical play. Chaos Reborn is a true successor to both legacies. TACTICAL GAMEPLAY: I cannot really do the basic gameplay experience justice in a short paragraph. It has too many tactical layers. But at essence, the game involves duels of up to 4 wizards. Wizards can invoke flamboyantly magical spells and summon creatures. Yet wizards themselves are fragile and must be protected. Imagine a three dimensional, multi-layered game of wizard chess with variable numbers and types of pieces which can come and go, and where each attack has a very real chance of failure. But if you lose the wizard, then you lose the game. Sometimes you will lose despite your best efforts, and sometimes you will win because you were lucky rather than good. That said, this game is tactically deep and, over time, rewards players who come to understand and appreciate all of the many, varied tactical approaches to gameplay. TUTORIAL: There is a tutorial labeled “Wizard Training” in the main menu. It comprises a series of gated set-piece encounters which gradually introduce you to the fundamental mechanics and tactics of the game. Having played the game for hundreds of hours before experiencing the tutorial, I still found it enjoyable. It’s not often that I can say that about a tutorial. ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES: Multiplayer wizard duels can be played live or asynchronously with up to 4 players. Matches can be friendly or ranked. And matches can be played Equipped (with custom equipment) or Classic (with standard equipment). Ranked matches allow you to qualify as an ""Archmage"" at which point you will be given your worldwide rank computed by an ELO scoring method. League standings reset in monthly seasons. Whether friendly or ranked, matches generally go quickly. As for the asynchronous games, these are my favorites. You can have up to 20 asynchronous games going at any time. Each player has many days to complete their turns in a match, but I find matches generally go more quickly than that. After ranked matches were first introduced, I completed 35 ranked async matches in just 3 days, and this was gameplay I managed in bits of free time that I had rather in continuous sittings. (I love, love the asynchronous functionality.) Additionally, players can create custom private, friendly matches, changing the parameters of the game. ONLINE SINGLEPLAYER/COOP MODE: There are developer and player created Realms of Chaos which you can explore online with your wizard. These Realms vary in size and challenge and come with a rating system to help determine which are worth exploring. The essential aspect of this game mode is to explore the map to find and defeat all of the Wizard Lords (AI-controlled mini-bosses) in order to reach and defeat the Wizard King (AI-controlled boss) of the Realm. While you are doing this, the Wizard King and his Wizard Lords summon reinforcements. And if you take too long, the Wizard King can banish you from the Realm. This game mode should not be considered a full-fledged RPG. Think of each of the Realms as puzzles to be solved, and some have stories to tell. OFFLINE HOTSEAT AND SINGLEPLAYER GAME MODES: There are offline game modes which allow hotseat gameplay against any combination of human or AI-controlled opponents. GRAPHICS: The game uses the Unity game engine, which should be compatible with most computers. The custom art and animations are quite pretty. And the game really does have its own, unique graphical theme. Don’t rely on me for too much input on this, as I was playing the game when wizards and creatures were represented by crude, unanimated placeholder graphics. But if you really care about graphics, the graphics are good. IN SUM: As-is, the game is a gem. If you like tactical turn-based games, then spending $20 on Chaos Reborn will get you one of the more fun games in your Steam inventory. If you’ve read this far and the game still intrigues you, then you should get the game.. If you are a fan of strategy games, you owe it to yourself to give this a chance. Yes, it can be quite RNG heavy but there's ways of mitigating that. Like poker, keeping a careful eye on your opponent and playing the odds will see you winning more games than losing.. An exceptional game of turn-based tactics, built around a unique mechanic of casting creatures and other magical spells to combat other wizards, where you control and influence casting chance and even whether to deceive your opponents using illusions. Robust multiplayer options, plus a solid single player experience give this game enormous longevity. This is from the same designer as the original X-Com game, and he knows how to design compelling games that you'll be playing years from now. Highly recommended.. It's a must have for turn based games lovers. Fun and very polished, and without nasty micro-transactions. With a price under 20$ it's one of the best value-per-dollar games out there.. Just a great game and I hope more people discover it. My only complaint is that as someone who likes a solid single player experience I would prefer if it had a properly scripted campaign on top of everything else. However, I don't think even this would matter to 90% of players.. I've been a fan of turn-based strategies (TBS) as a kid and this really is one of the best TBS' out there. Overseen by Julian Gollop himself (creator of XCom, Chaos, Rebelstar Raiders, etc ...), this game really stands out amongst a sea of mediocre games at the moment. I've put a huge amount of time into it and pretty much shunned all my other AAA titles for it. Build up a wizard and fight to the death against other wizards, or work co-operatively to bring down enemies. Each spell has a percentage chance and you can boost them if you collect mana points. Each wizard also has an alignment (Law, Chaos, etc) and you can manipulate this to favour your spells. Overall it will be the best money you ever spend as no two games are the same, there's great strategy and tactics and it has pretty much THE friendliest community of any game I've ever played. Brilliant stuff.. Awesome game, played over 850 hours so far and absolutely love it. So much re-playability. All about tactics, positioning, spell selection and smart use of mana. Best TBS game for a long time, really friendly community too.. My most played game ever and that's just throughout early access. Fast-paced tactical combat, strategic depth, friendly community, very high replayability and varied gameplay requiring frequent adjustments on the player's part. Highly recommended.","the game is a fun little strategy gem for fans of X-COM, Archon, or any similar turn based strategy titles . it allows you to build your own sets of equipment, shaping the likelihood of what spells you receive . there are realms to explore and co-op play with friends with social ranks and guilds to come ."

"1,171.Shadow Hearts: Covenant","+ Great cast of characters+ Scenes are more alive than most in games+ Battle system is engaging+ European art style is refreshing+ Great rock soundtrack~ Relies on original Shadow Hearts for best experience~ Voice acting is a mix of good/bad~ Side Quests are often humuorous~ Story is confusing yet heartfelt~ Complex combo system overshadowed by simple tactics- Unbalanced roster- It's so dark, legit dark souls dark- Randomly silent scenes / areas at times- Dungeons rely on backtracking- Very little Area of Effect attacks. What a masterpiece ****! I had high expectations after playing 1 but 2 is so much better in every way possible. Definitely give it a try if you can find a way to get your hands on this gem. I wish games like this would come back with modern graphics and some QOL improvements.. A must play one of the best rpg on the PS2, great story characters and the gameplay is fun. Such a forgotten gem. I really loved it on the PlayStation 2. It's probably my favorite jrpg on the platform after ff10.. This is the best. game. ever. I first played it back in 2005 and it's still the best JRPG I've ever played. It's hilarious, sad (moved me to tears) and epic, referencing real events (World War 1, Rasputin, Lawrence of Arabia) in an alternative world where there is magic and demons. Yuri is a wonderful protagonist who is powerful (with this demonic fusions) and funny with a sharp wit despite a tortured soul. The story is epic, the cutscenes amazing, and the characters memorable - a vampire, a white wolf, Anastasia Romanov to name a few. Each character has a detailed side quest that reveals more about them, and the gameplay is the best of any game. Turn-based but with a judgement ring that requires times key pressed to get the best out of it. I recommended this game to two friends who were Final Fantasy fanatics and after playing it they both changed their minds about which is the best. game. ever. It's Shadow Hearts Covenant.. A true hidden gem and one of the best games ever. Easily like top 3 stories ever in videogame history. The gameplay is solid and rewarding. The characters are fantastic and enjoyable. The game is perfect.. This game is only a 9/10, because I cant give it a 9.5/10. I remembered this game from my childhood and all I ever achieved was getting to france. After that, it disappeared. One day I found it again and purchased it and god damnit, this game blew me away. Right now, it is my all time favorite JRPG of all time. I played through it for 70+ hours and still wanted more. That says a lot about a RPG, which in m optinion normally should only last 50-60 hours. The game starts off pretty tough but becomes easier the more you get used to its skilled based batlle system (referring to the timing based judgement ring). I was amazed, the first time in an RPG in the beginning, I actually had to use and stock up on healing items before dungeons etc. The combat is damn satisfying, the bosses are cool, the music is insanely good, making me hear it in my head for hours. The magic system feels very different to what I have seen so far and its pretty cool. Characters are all unique and lovable, sidequests are interesting and the story is great. Normally I dislike changing villians throughout the campaign, but for some reason, in this game it worked to its favor. This game made me buy the sequel and making me interested in picking up the prequel, hesitating because of the price though. For every RPG or JRPG fan out there, this game is an absolute must have. One of the best games I have ever played in my life.. I always come back to this game. Definitely the first to come to mind on the ps2 and one of the best RPGs ever made.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. A great Shadow Hearts game, but doesn't pull it off quite as well as Shadow Hearts 1. The plot and characters feel more anime-esque, and the plot and scenarios have that feel too it, and just do not feel like they hold as much weight as the original. Still a great game and improves the length of the story significantly as well as the battle system, but the dark atmosphere and plot are toned down a few notches for this one, will appeal to some, will detract some value to others who found Shadow Hearts 1 entertaining in its gritty and depressing atmosphere.. Shadow Hearts Covenant isn't a revolutionary game but it took the ideas from the best JRPGs combined to make a consistent solid experience that has a perfect length in where it doesn't feel neither short or a slog to make one of the best RPG experiences i have ever had. Gameplay 10 -> Turn based RPG with a unique and refreshing battle system called the Judgement Ring, beautiful towns with interesting side quests for each party member that never feels repetitive, amazing dungeons that never drags or feels to long with some interesting puzzles and a dark mysterious atmosphere. Graphics 9 -> While not the best looking game in the ps2 it's definitely an improvement from previous games, world is beautiful, some characters have good detail while others could be a little better. Sound 9 -> Amazing overall sound quality even for it's time and amazing music by great composers such as Yasunori Mitsuda and really well done voice acting, the only small and minor complaint i have is it could use some more music variety in towns and dungeons but nothing major just a minor touch that doesn't impact the great experience in this journey. Story 10 -> Mature writing is what i like to describe this journey always keeping the player interested on what is going to happen with it's amazing unpredictability, tone of story keeps changing throughout the game to make the player engaged and to never feel bored, it changes from seriousness to humor to heartbreaking moments and some unexpected twists to make it an overall unique and accomplished story. Overall 9.2 -> Coming from a person who rarely gives games a high score and never gives a 10 because i think nothing is perfect, i highly recommend to any turn based RPG fan to give this game a try, one of the greatest hidden gems i have ever experienced. Interesting Characters with an amazing lead character Yuri who experiences a lot of different emotions throughout. Like i said above this is NOT a revolutionary game that did completely new mechanics or anything for it's time but it really does an amazing job of capturing all the goods from previous RPG to make an solid, interesting and unique experience. Worthy of more recognition by JRPG fans and definitely should get an HD release on current gen systems and Steam.. Great art, music, story, gameplay. This game does everything incredibly well. I only wish it could have more depth and content.. + This is the best Shadow Hearts game. + When thinking **** JRPG other than Final Fantasy, this is one of the first to come to mind. + The story in this game is so fantastic. + The game is very dark and unique.. I just love this game, it's the best one I've ever played, the best story ever, the characters have such a great development like no other. I hope that someday there'll be a remake of the trilogy and Koudelka.. Fantastic experience. One of the best JRPGs of all time imo. The real world atmosphere with a balance of dark and light-hearted themes make this a more than worthy sequel to the original!. One of my favorite RPGs of all time. Story is great. Wide range of characters. I don't believe I've ever enjoyed a story so much. They added quite a bit of comedy with some characters. Battle system is more than just clicking through menus. Makes the battle system engaging and entertaining. There are options to increase or decrease some functions of the battle system for those who want more or less of a challenge. Monster design in the Shadow Hearts games are amazing. Creepy monsters all with lore. Plenty of side quests, and difficult battles for completionists.. This game starts out with really boring military cutscenes. The game doesn't get going very quickly. Japanese anime characters are out of place in WW1. The gameplay is basically a golf-like reaction system, but a bit harder. If you are old or feeling slow you won't be able to play this. It makes sitting down to play on a lazy afternoon an impossible annoyance. The interesting characterization just isn't there, as typical as later Japanese RPG games. This is why Midway went into bankruptcy. Not fun.. I liked the battle system, the characters and the humour but SH Covenant pus new things to the SH Story, which just don´t fit. It was also way to easy, probably the easiest game that I ever experienced. But it is still a good RPG with some memorable events.. It took everything that made the first game great and made it better. While in principle it play very similarly to the first game not really adding too much new, that isn't a bad thing. The first game was fantastic so why change the formula. But the real star here is the narrative. The story is utterly gripping. Yuri's journey is really touching and dark (to be honest I nearly wanted to cry by the end.) The rest of the companion characters are unique with fully flushed out characters (Joachim is just a laugh a minute.) The story and atmosphere aren't as dark as the first game but do have more depth and drama. If I had to mention one critique, it is that the relationship between Yuri & Karin plays out in a VERY similar way as Cloud & Tifa's from Final Fantasy 7. Again this isn't really bad, just noticeable. Overall: A terrific RPG that is just as good as the first one, if not better.. Gems like these presents the ultimate jrpg experience, the combat system is unique just as much as the story telling. The atmosphere present in the game is unparalleled.. This is an excellent role-playing game! Never has a game made me laugh and cry so much!! SHC is the total package. It has a compelling story with the perfect balance of funny and lighthearted to dark and mature. The characters are so endearing and funny, especially Joachim XD. The combat is also creative and fun! I can keep going on about how excellent this game is, but you'll need to see it to believe. SHC is the best RPG for the PS2 since Final Fantasy X!!","it's probably my favorite jrpg on the platform after ff10 . it's hilarious, sad (moved me to tears) and epic . each character has a detailed side quest that reveals more about them . the gameplay is the best of any game ."
"1,172.Solium Infernum","Solium Infernum is a game that lets you unleash your inner devil and compete with other archfiends for the throne of hell. It's a turn-based strategy game with a lot of depth, complexity, and replayability. If you like games like Civilization or Crusader Kings, but wish they had more fire, brimstone, and backstabbing, then you'll love Solium **** game is set in a Milton-inspired version of hell, where Satan has mysteriously disappeared and left a power vacuum. You play as one of eight archfiends, each with their own unique abilities, attributes, and personalities. You can customize your archfiend to suit your playstyle, whether you prefer diplomacy, warfare, sorcery, or treachery. You can also recruit legions of infernal creatures, champions, and artifacts to aid you in your quest for **** game is not easy, though. You'll have to contend with the harsh terrain of hell, the whims of the infernal conclave, and the schemes of your rivals. You'll have to balance your resources, your prestige, your demands, and your vendettas. You'll have to make alliances, break alliances, and betray alliances. You'll have to be cunning, ruthless, and adaptable. You'll have to be the best devil you can be.Solium Infernum is a game that rewards careful planning, strategic thinking, and creative problem-solving. It's also a game that rewards being a jerk. You can insult your enemies, steal their stuff, curse them, frame them, and even challenge them to a duel. You can also play dirty tricks on them, like sending them a gift of a cursed artifact, or sabotaging their rituals. You can even try to corrupt their champions and turn them against them. The game is full of devilish humor and dark comedy, and you'll find yourself laughing at the misfortunes of your foes and the absurdity of the situations you'll **** game is best played with friends, though. Solium Infernum supports both synchronous and asynchronous multiplayer modes, where you can play with up to six players in a single session. Playing with friends adds a whole new layer of fun and challenge to the game, as you can communicate, negotiate, bluff, and deceive each other. You can also form pacts, trade favors, and share secrets. You can also stab each other in the back, of course. The game is a great way to test your friendships and see who among you is the most diabolical.Solium Infernum is a game that deserves more attention and praise. It's a game that offers a unique and immersive experience of ruling hell. It's a game that combines strategy, politics, and betrayal in a compelling and satisfying way. It's a game that will make you feel like a true archfiend. It's a game that will make you say, ""Hell yeah!"". Truly amazing. I've been playing the original since release and that is still immensely fun to play. This version is no different. There are so many variables that even if you think a game is lost there is usually a way back in. Or at least a way to take down someone before your own journey to the abyss.. Good implementation of mechanics, game visuals, music and gameplay. Unfortunately, the single player game won't give the experience you need as the bots here are extremely bad, but with other players it more than reveals itself. It's not a hellish Civilisation clone as many players and journalists have called it, but rather a visualisation of a board game for friends (which sort of even exists). The game has too few mechanics and too little variety for Civilisation, but for a board game, it's just **** you like competitive games or unusual style - then the game is definitely for **** the starting price, of course, is a bit high, so I recommend you to take it either on discounts in half a year or for a full price, if you really like it.","solium infernum is a turn-based strategy game with a lot of depth, complexity, and replayability . you play as one of eight archfiends, each with their own unique abilities, attributes, and personalities . you can customize your archfiend to suit your playstyle, whether you prefer diplomacy, warfare, sorcery, or treachery ."
"1,173.Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There's not much in the way of innovation over the previous instalment but it follows a winning formula with a new story and levels to complete. More an expansion than a true sequel, but it's probably slightly better than its predecessor and well worth picking up for action/stealth fans.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Patchy memory about this game but it was a nice addition to a beloved franchise of mine. Since I played this side by side with Dark Mirror, I couldn't tell which is which but I surely enjoyed playing.. Beautiful continuous **** game from the past! SYPHON FILTER: LOGAN'S SHADOW highly recommended!. Best PSP game . Beatiful graphics for psp game 2007 , interesting storyline and good gameplay . This is easy action-adventure game . I love this game .. This game is just fantastic. It has a brilliant storyline, a fabulous design and an awesome gameplay experience! This is a must have game in your psp. Undoubtedly the best third person shooter game in the psp. This game is definitley better than dark mirror. Logan's shadow is the best game syphon filter has made so far!. I really don't have a lot to say about this game other than it's definitely a game you need to play if you own a PSP. The storyline was thrilling, except for the ending. It left on a cliff hanger. I wish Sony would hurry up and make a sequel to this game. I hate cliff hangers.. The sequel to arguably the most amazing portable game ever, it doesn't disappoint. Leaving everything that worked as a base, it fixes every minuscule problem and builds upon them to make another astounding game. Employing comic book writer Greg Rucka, the story is a vast improvement, and plays as a very enjoyable spy thriller. The graphics for the cut scenes have increased immensely, while the added swimming levels work excellently, which is something I never thought I'd see. Multiplayer's been made better as well. Overall a great game - even though Dark Mirror will likely have higher scores because of the shock it caused, for my money this game's just as good - and as good as a sequel could be.. This is easily one of the best games on the PSP. It defines what a shooter should be on the PSP. The pros for this game are many. First, the presentation. Graphics in this game are excellent, and the ragdoll physics do well. The sound effects and score of this game are also great. More important is the gameplay. The campaign is lengthy and fun, and boasts great replayability. One can find themself replaying the campaign more than three times to boost their career stats and unlock bonus levels. The story is typical, though, as Logan finds himself fighting waves of enemies and encountering super model secret agents all en route to free his partner Lian Xing and her scientist husband. Besides the main campaign the game has some of the best online play availible in the PSP. Both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure are availible with up to eight players per match. Online has many levels and modes, including DM, TDM, CTF, and Rogue Agent (where the player tries to kill the rogue to become the rogue). All of these online modes can be played with different weapon sets(sniper being a favorite) which depend on the host's liking. The gameplay is tied together with a solid control scheme which works beautifully when coupled with the cover system. Given, aiming with the face buttons will take some getting used to, but is fine once mastered. This game as a whole is a complete package which deserves your time and money.","more an expansion than a true sequel, but it's probably slightly better than its predecessor and well worth picking up for action/stealth fans . employing comic book writer Greg Rucka, the story is a vast improvement, and plays as a very enjoyable spy thriller ."
"1,174.Football Manager 2011","It is 2022 and this remains the best game I have and will ever play. Yes it has it's minor flaws but it is the only game I could play forever if I had to. Has kept me entertained for thousands of hours and will continue for years to come despite new releases. It takes maybe the first 500 hours to really understand what it takes to be good at the game but I promise you when you find the perfect system it is a beautiful thing.. If you've ever played any of Football Manager titles from the last four or five years this 2011 version will not really hold any suprises for you. There is the odd evolution from last year, the most important being more detailed and realistic transfer and contract negotiations with computer controlled teams and players now far more willing to budge from their initial demands. As you would expect the teams are also fully updated up to the September 2010 transfer window. As before it is still a little easy to take a lower league team to the top of The Premiership but my biggest complaint would still be the lack of control over youth development. Yes you can improve your scouting and facilities but you are still relying on luck when your players are randomly generated at the start of each season. Why can you still not see your youth players before they are 16 as Total Club Manager did years ago? Despite these minor gripes Football Manager 2011 is certainly the best management sim you will find, just be prepared to lose hours, days and even weeks in search of glory.. Football Manager 2011 provides a large database, tons of stats, and lots of variety when it comes to tactics. A revamped contract system adds even more depth to this classic series. However, the media interactions as well as the player talks should be considered for what they are, trash. The match engine is poor, but not the main issue. What it comes down to is that this game turns out to be more like work than real entertainment.. This game keeps bringing me back. I have spend hours managing teams and have enjoyed it a great deal. I'm yet to find a single flaw with this game and the player negotiations are great, the players feel like they have a personality now and are not just a name or number in your team. I am very excited for the new one to come out and will be excited for the one after, this title will always be the one I look out for. Also for those who have trouble starting out I recommend editing the data base, I have put a teenage version of me in game with a lot of potential and it has been great watching him develop over 5 seasons. Toon Army!. Good game, not the best in the series for me though. Next year's version will need to be a bit more polished. Match Engine needs a big improvement.. Immersive, deep and challenging. A brilliant football sim, despite the weak scouting and press conferences this game really is fantastic and will **** many hours away from your life. Definitely the best version of the game so far and it is head and shoulders above any other football management game. The match engine has dramatically improved both graphically and in actual game play however there are still some problems that need to be eliminated. The scouting system still seems to work on players overall reputation and ability rather than the players you need to fit into your team and the training system still does not seem to have the impact it should on players. The worst aspect of the game is the media area and in particular press conferences, with too much repeatability of questions without it seeming to make any difference to the game.. Improved compared to previous Football Managers. The game is really great and enjoyable. Highly addicting. I spend many hours playing this game and I'm still not bored of it. Pretty realistic, although the game may crash sometimes and there are few bugs, though I believe they will be sooner or later most fixed in patches. Many tactical options to choose from, many teams to play as. It's so different to play as a team from lower division from a poor country, than playing as a top premier league team, yet it's never boring, it's always fun. Summary. Pros: -Realistic. -Just what you need if you're a football fan. Cons: -If you never played it, maybe difficult for you at first. -Highly addictive! -Some bugs.. The best game yet with a brilliant match engine and level of detail, dealing with relationships, agents and the media is great fun, a must for any player of the old class of football manager or championship manager games - 10/10. football manager is a really good game and as the years have gone by it has got easier to use. I like the new updates like when you score the player does a celebration. And they way they are celebrating i think its going to beat fifa in the rankings.. More polished than previous versions and the match animations in particular are much less formulaic. I enjoyed it a lot even if there is nothing groundbreaking in this years release.. Finally i feel like a proper manager. The game is the most addictive i have ever come across. Its a must for the football fans who think that they know something about tactical and strategical football. Best game ever, no more words only m/. Good game, and quite a lot better then Football Manager 2010. Though the game might need a overall overhaul after 5 years of the same kind of gameplay.. Its as simple as that games just do not get any better than this!! Year after year the game never fails to disappoint. Just when you think that it cant better the previous year, it does. Fantastic game!!","it is 2022 and this remains the best game i have and will ever play . despite its minor flaws it is the best management sim you will find . the match engine is poor, but not the main issue ."
"1,177.South Park: The Stick of Truth","The game is extremely fun. It's full of dark humor, sarcasm, and absurdity that complete the game environment. This is a good example **** where one doesn't care about graphics or physics because they are redundant here. There aren't many game mechanics but the present ones are great. The fight is a turn-based strategy with many unique skills for different characters. The plot is simple but very fun. ""Omnipresent fun"" is how the game can be described in two words because it's literally crowded with a lot of fun in every detail. It's clear that the devs and everyone related to the game knew what they were doing and the result is worth it.. Damn, this was actually amazing, for a stupid game about a stupid show, it's really funny, has a great story, good combat, and is one of the best RPG games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have never laughed so much playing a videogame, very funny story and gags.. The first South Park that acutally is as good as the series itself. The gameplay is simple but the game design and the story are superb.. An amazing and charming game that fully captures the feeling of South Park while also having great, interesting, and satisfying turn based combat. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horrible controls, one of the most overrated games ever, boring and tedious most of the time with half decent way too exaggerated ""funny"" combat and stuff. Overall it's funny and enjoyable but even the diehard 10/10 Steam reviewers have barely 20 hours on **** much to really play or do, it's a console game for idiots that like controllers and consoles, as someone that played better games 10 years before this released,I am not impressed at all. It gets points for all the bonus funny moments and stuff, if it was cheaper it could also be higher.. This was really good. I'm biaised since I'm a **** for this kind of humour but they did a really good job.. Great game, story plays like a long South Park movie and rpg combat is basic but solid. Took me 16 hrs to beat but perfect time, game ends right around when I was getting close to wanting to be done with it, about the overstay more welcome. Difficulty was perfect for 3/4 of the game, but then the last quarter it became too easy. This game is amazing, it's like being inside on the best South Park episodes. Obsidian knocked it out of the park with this one.. Funny game but had to replay 3 times for plat. Also a weird lack of adults in the game. A very good game, but a short one. You could tell that Obsidian put a effort into it. Worth every penny and every hour of your time. I recommend it to all RPG fans.. I never quite got into South Park and only saw it on occasion, but always enjoyed what I saw. So, why I didn't get all the references this game throws at you, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The core combat is fun, which is the key to the games success, as you cannot run solely on jokes. Although, **** could run solely on jokes this might be able to. There is so much there and if its your style of humor then it will work for you, but you are not going to all of a sudden like it if you don't care for their specific brand of humor. So you can come for the humor and stay for simple yet satisfying combat.. The game itself has a lot of South Park-ness in it. There's some actually funny moments all throughout the game and a lot of references for fans. But the game itself, as an RPG, is actually not that good. The combat is mind-numbingly boring and broken, there are a couple of broken things you can use to pretty much win every encounter, from the very beginning of the game. Traversal is also bad, the game plays like ****, it feels like an old Flash game on browser. I spent 10 bucks on it and I regret that, I can't imagine paying full price for this game.. really funny and also the gameplay was really enjoyable and fun and the story is nicely written must play. As someone who has never really enjoyed turn-based RPG games in the past, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through this game. With the familiar characters from the South Park universe, as well as all of the hilarious jokes and puns that you would expect from South Park made this game a blast to play through.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. I love the show so its a little bit biased but i don't care game was great had good bit of fun jokes were just as good as the tv show.. funny but crude at times with rpg mechanics tacked on to market it as a South Park RPG. It's a good play but won't hook you in too much. Meticulous adaptation of the great show packed with solid RPG mechanics. Must have for fans of the series.. Its like a massive south park episode, it has solid rpg mechanics and a great story full of laughs. Can't miss it! Only downside is the level of censorship but that's not obsidians fault. Really the best description of this game is: incredibly crazy and funny, but you'll love it. I've never watched South Park in its entirety, but the game really made me have a good time. South Park: The Stick of Truth is everything I would have ever wanted in a South Park game. It’s ridiculous, it’s crude, and I love it in spite of anything it might be missing. It feels almost exactly like playing through an interactive episode of the show and I could ask for absolutely nothing less.. I never heard or watch South Park in my whole entire life because it was never shown in my TV channels as a kid until I discovered this game. South Park Stick Of Truth is the most derogatory but still a great game to play. South Park maybe South Park by its nature and I am not much of a fan of South Park but there are pros and cons that I can say about this game. The character creation is very simple and very good for making my South Park protagonist. The combat is absolutely amazing that is both turn based and interacting moves to know how effective its is, the comedy is really good even though there are offensive parts and the animation in the game plays absolutely just like South Park like I am playing a video game while watching TV. While they are some very offensive parts like Cartman's faction name which good thing I am from the Philippines. Ally summon assists felt very useless because it won't let me use in boss battles and collection spots like Chinpokomon will always be permanently locked when going to different locations. And a very rude forced name. If you are a true South Park fan game then this is one of the great games in the South Park franchise.. This game is amazing, it's like being inside on the best South Park episodes. Obsidian knocked it out of the park with this one.. This game has something for everyone. Fun rpg elements. GOT references, farts, references south park fans will really enjoy.. South Park: The Stick of Truth writing and visuals remind you of both the innocence and ignorance of childhood. It feels like you're playing a season of the show.. A hilarious RPG only held back by it's easy/exploitable combat system, and lack of post game content.. This game is mind blowingly like south park, and I love south park. It has good gameplay. it funny. One of the best games i played recently and the best south park game. Game has a tons of easter eggs from show. Interesting plot. Worth it's price.. Story -Main story 4/5 -Side Quests 4/5 -Story Direction 5/5 -side characters 5/5 Gameplay -Controls(controller) 3/3 -Combat 4/5 -open world 3/5 -general gameplay 4/5 -optimization 5/5 on my record : 20h. Great sense of humor combined with great turn based combat system. If you like South Park, you should play this game. +I think this game's story is better than Fractured But Whole.. This is a short, simple, yet fun game. I'm really glad Obsidian and South Park Studios didn't try to pad this game out with too much filler. Instead, we're treated to what feels like an interactive episode of South Park where you play as a new kid in town with the power to make a lot of friends. This allows you to immerse yourself in the game's world and enjoy all the jokes, classic South Park references, and absolute absurdity of the South Park universe. The game plays like your standard turn-based RPG. However, it's certainly much shorter than most games in this genre which might seem a tad unusual, especially for players who are familiar with this genre. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, with an animation style on par with the actual show. Apart from one area that is stylized around 80s/90s era RPGs. Overall still impressive nonetheless. The soundtrack borrows a lot of tropes from Lord of the Rings as well as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim which makes sense considering much of your powers are meant to parody the ""shouts"" you unlock in Elder Scrolls (this game came out a few years after Skyrim so makes sense I suppose) Apart from a slightly clunky blocking system, a lack of much side content, and little difference in your decision whether to join Cartman or Kyle's factions. I'd say this is a great game to sit back and relax with. It's short, it's simple, but at the same time, it's charming, funny, witty, and enjoyable. My best recommendation is to buy this game at the sale price and not MSRP as the $30 price tag is a bit steep for such a short game.. The first South Park that acutally is as good as the series itself. The gameplay is simple but the game design and the story are superb.. This game is underrated, its for me one of the most fun rpg games, its simply too stupid to not like and the gameplay mechanics arent overshadowed by the narrative.. It's a fine JRPG, but it's very repetitive, and everything is so tedious and takes ages, and you're sort of drowning in worthless junk along the way, and the story is so simplistic that once you've played through the game, there's no joy in it.. cool jokes, cool rpg, cool story. my favourite game tbh, but just can’t give 10 without felling that im stupid. Late to the game again - i still haven't finished the game, but so far it just feels... so... South Park! What else is there to say?. (note: this review is for the Switch version but I had to post it under the PC page instead as there isn’t an article on this site for the former) Was good up until the Taco Bell security guard part and the end of the ManBearPig side quest. Game is now so difficult that one doesn’t get any enjoyment from it whatsoever which ruins the playing experience entirely. Anyone who has beaten this game *likely* has an above-average IQ (that or I'm just **** and don’t know how to game properly). Shame really as South Park is one of my all time favourite shows and this game was very enjoyable for the first 10 hours or so that I spent playing it.. this game is just perfect with that beautiful music , characters and atmosphere. The interface is wonderful. You have so much information immediately available to you. Google Maps always has a minimap in the lower left corner, which gives you a good overview of the area. Getting information about people gives you a clear, clear window. Hacking offers a menu with easily recognizable icons, so you always know what your button presses will do.. I like South Park so I bought the game. To be honest, I don't have high expectation for the game, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, it is one of my favorite RPG games. It feels like watching a long South Park movie and I am cracked all the time.. Very good game. In my opinion, it's not as good as it's sequel. The end boss battle was really annoying as well.. funny but buggy ok game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. Carbon monoxide RPG with a bunch of unexpected and vraty elements, in the end it starts to choke. South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of the funniest and most entertaining games I've ever played, based on The Lord of The Rings role playing episodes from the show it's humor is dark and raw, just as the series is and it never disappoints. On the other side, the gameplay is superb, being a turn-based combat it's dynamic and stays on the line of what the game is. This is a must-play, not only for South Park fans, but for everyone who likes a good RPG littered with funny jokes and offensive humor. The map can feel a bit empty but the rest of the game is just perfect, the combat is simple and enjoyable, exploration and combat elements are nicely mixed and the story even as it gets a bit odd is enjoyable. South Park: The Stick of Truth is a RPG based on the world of the popular TV show South Park. Honestly I was not expecting much from this game, but boy was I wrong. The fact that this game was written by the show's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, is crucial for understanding the game's quality. The dialogues, the story, the characters, all these are exactly the same quality as South Park itself. But there is more. While you might expect Parker and Stone to write a good story, you might not expect that the gameplay will be fun also. But it is. The combat is an old school RPG turn based classic and while this game certainly does not go in depth with its RPG elements, it offers real pleasant experience throughout. The graphics is classic South Park and so is the music, featuring the best South Park songs. Now to point out some negatives, there certainly are not many. The RPG element is not that well balanced and most combats towards the end of the game might get boring and repetitive, but that is a common problem with most RPG games. One thing I would like to point out is the length of the game, it is not great and specially for a full priced game. However those are pretty minor details, overall I was positively surprised with this game. There are no microtransaction and obviously no SJW crap. I think many people were surprised just how good this game is all around. Final verdict: 86 %. basically south park if it was a LARP mixed with and the story is good and the item stats really make you think on what to use in combat. Amazing Game. Typical South Park. I really enjoy it. Dark humor and i love it. Do you think a game where farting is our superpower be bad? I don't think so.. South Park: The Stick of Truth was a clear choice for me. Not only do I really like animated series, but I love South Park. It was all the more a surprise to me that the game is not just a money changer under the name of a famous serosh, but that it is a really good RPG. You will create your South Park character from the very beginning, which is absolutely brilliant. I really enjoyed creating myself in the graphics of my favorite series. Your character doesn't speak, which I've criticized in many games, but somehow I didn't mind. It's either that I'm a fan of South Park and I simply don't see any mistakes here, or the authors really succeeded in the game. I was also very interested in the story. How to say it. I called myself South Park. It's going to be a lot of fun, but apart from the great one, the story was really great. I swallowed the whole plot and unraveling at the end. This game just combines everything I like. It's an RPG, so you start at zero and gradually improve to a good deal with the best items, there are ****, which I, as a Wolfenstein fan, only welcome and for me it is perhaps the best thing in the game and it's all over wrapped in South Park style. But. I love this game. I finished the game on a PC once, but a few years later I bought the sequel The Fractured But Whole on PS4 and I just got The Stick of Truth. I thought that I would repeat the previous one before the newer work, and when I already knew what and how, I thought that I could try to collect all the trophies and I succeeded on the third try. So I went through this game four times together: D Well, just South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of my favorite games ever and I remember it very much. If you love South Park like I do, don't hesitate. This is a clear choice. If you don't need South Park at the moment, I still think that the game is worth considering, because overall, this is a great RPG for me.. {Personal Experience: Personal Experience} 9/10 {GamePlay: World/Level Design, Game Mechanic Aspects, Item/NPC Variety, Quests/Missions/Objectives, Co-Op/Multiplayer Aspects, The Characters, Controls} 8/10 {Narrative: Dialogue, Cutscenes} 10/10 {Visuals: Graphics, Motion Capture/Voice-Sync} 10/10 {Technical: Bugs, Performance} 10/10 {Story: The Story} 10/10 {Replayability: Replayability (Alternate Endings, Secrets, Multiplayer, etc)} 10/10 - Good. ☐ 5/10 - Bad. [STARTING PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: When going into this game, my hopes were not set as high as fans of the TV show would have had when this game first came out. This is because i tried to play it when it came out and got bored after about 3 hours into it. But i decided to try it again, and for some reason, i really enjoyed it this time. By the end of it i consider my time well spent playing this game, and got, what i in some ways feel, the experience of being in south park.] [MAIN REVIEW NOTES: The Level Design even the world design portrays the show perfectly and it feels like you at South Park the small town. The game mechanics(RPG) in this game fits well with the game. There is a large variety of items in this game, distributed between gear, weapons, and weapons. It even has a great number of customizable items like beards, glasses, and hats. It even got junk items for you to make quite a lot of money from. The Objectives fits the game perfectly and feels like something the TV series would do if this was an episode of the show instead ****. There isn’t really a multiplayer or Co-Op mode in this game. Only the singleplayer, with a well-made story. The Characters are who you are used to seeing if you are familiar with the TV series, with the exception of your character. There isn't really any need for Character Development as the characters are well known if you know the TV series itself. The controls are easy to get used to, and pretty straight forward. The Dialogue really fits this game perfectly, I'm convinced the script for this game was written by the same team that wrote for the TV Series. The cutscenes are definitely made by the creators of south park. The graphics are perfect and look exactly like if it was a South Park Episode. I don't think it uses motion capture for obvious reasons, but the voice-sync is perfect as well. I encountered no bugs or performance issues during my PlayThrough of this game. The Story is great, and it really feels like you're watching a South PÅark episode at times. It’s well made and does the game justice in many big ways. The replayability is good, given that there are 4 classes that you can play. The replayability is there as well. It is a set story tho.] ""9/10 – Fantastic. I enthusiastically recommend that you add these games to your to-play list. As it doesn't hit A Perfect Score, It is an extremely good game. I highly recommend getting this game."" ~DeathKillerNOR~ ️ IN MY OPINION ️. Traveling around the world of South Park in this game is incredibly fun. This is probably the first game that attracted me so much that I played it about five times to collect all the collections. The plot is interesting, the dialogues are funny, the gameplay is awesome. What else is needed?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you want to be killed by a collective fart in the toilet, than it is definitely the best game to achieve your dream. Unexpectedly cool game based on awesome TV series. The RPG part of it is a bit too simple though.. Amazing game, I had a very good time playing this game and finished in only one day. This game is funny and have a great storyline. Ok i had it set to the lowest difficulty and i cant break my friend out of detention which is one of the mission i say **** it this is total nonsense,i’m used to using the arrow keys,and with no way to change the key bindings it will be over in a year unless you are used to playing games with the wasd keys if you cant then don’t bother with this the jokes are funny and i have had a lot of enjoyment with this game but im still not going to recommend it to anyone who is new to computer games if you want to buy a good rpg game get yourself a nintendo console and buy a pokemon game it will probably provide a lot more enjoyment. South Park came around and finally found a real home in the turn-based RPG world that is The Stick of Truth. This game was a joy to play with fun gameplay mechanics that could rival many other games in the genre. The artistic design was perfect, really making it feel as if I was playing an actual episode from the show. The plot was equally as bizarre as some of the craziest episodes of South Park with jaw-dropping final bosses in the game. And all of that on top of the incredible humor packed into the entire game ... wow! This game was a joy to play, and the biggest complaint I had was that the PC version of the game had several glitches and bugs--most of which were just noticeable things that didn't *really* disrupt gameplay. However, there were a few that did force me to quit the game at inopportune moments. This was frustruating to say the least. Had it not been for these glitches, I know I would have rated the game higher. But que sera sera. Nevertheless, The Stick of Truth was a ton of fun to play and I would like to replay it in the future, just on a console version of the game.. Amazing Game!, Great humor, Great gameplay. Basically it is like an episode of SouthPark but in videogame form. I would 100% recommend this to anyone even if they haven't watched the TV show.. a man goes to the doctor. says he's depressed. he says life seems harsh and cruel. says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. the doctor says ""the treatment is simple. the great clown pagliacci is in town tonight. go and see him, that should pick you up."" the man bursts into tears. he says ""but doctor... i am pagliacci."". I have to say, it's one of those rare games where you never get bored. They got so many things right. I enjoyed this game 100%, funny, fast paced, NO grinding. Im going to give it a 10. Bought the game on sale recently for dirt cheap and got what I expected. It has a surprising Fun combat system but I was disappointed by the lack of any real challenge, even on hardcore. The story was what to be expected from south park, but in a few parts it felt like it was trying too hard. Most of the quests have the same structure and were somewhat boring. The dialouge is what really carried this game If you find it for under 15$ it's a good deal with lots of replay value.. I was very surprised that this game was this good. I did not think I would enjoy it so much. It was really funny, but I really liked the rpg style and the combat system as well.. is the definitive epic game from south park, one of my favorits series, i am not fan from RPG games, play in turns is bored, but this game is very funny, the attacks are very complex and funny, the game looks good, the original animation and voices make it an immersive experience, in conclusion, if you play this game you will a lot of hours of funny, battles and laughs, and bizarre history.. Very fun game that is a must play for all south park fans. There's a lot of references to older episodes. It's like playing in a south park episode where some of the events gives you hilarious cutscenes.. A strong but simple RPG experience with good dialogue, characters and satisfying gameplay.. it was one of the funniest game of all time they did their job the fight battles was weak but with their funny jokes they made it ok. The game is rude, crude, vile, and has some of the dumbest story you'll ever see. All while being brilliant. I am not even a fan of the show, but I really enjoyed this game. It's a JRPG style game, though with some input and timing during the commands so that it's not all passive (similar to Legend of Dragoon). There's lots of side areas to explore, items to collect, quests to accomplish, etc. It isn't the longest game ever, I beat it in under 15 hours, and that was with doing a hefty chunk of side options. It's also not the most balanced, with the DOT abilities being over-powered to the point of necessity against some enemies. All in all, yea, it was a fun game. I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the show, or is a fan of RPGs and doesn't mind a bit, no, a lot of blue humor.. Fantastic little game. A must play for South Park fans. The story is fun and interesting. Combat is engaging enough - I personally love strategic turn based combat. The gags and the jokes are ott as expected and are top notch. Why 8? Too short, a bit simplistic in terms of what one can do and towards the end not very challenging as my character was OP. Enjoy it.. Stick of truth is like you're immerse in the south park episode itself. The comedy and RPG is really immerse for me, the only thing that I complained is the tactical gameplay, because to be honest, Butthole's mechanics are much fluent than Stick of Truth.. A great combination of the classic tone from the TV series with a nice turn-based system.. In about 5 first hours i had a lot of fun in this game. Its a fresh breath to and RPG genre, and you are laughing at all the jokes and your favourite characters from the show. But then as i continue to play its still the same, the combat is the most boring thing ever, i could play original Pokemon NES games for hundreds of hours, but i just cannot finish this game because of the boring gameplay. Don't get me wrong it takes good parody of almost everything about RPG and much more, but if you just make fun of things that doesn't create overall good game experience. For me big disappointment better to go and watch the show than play South park game.. The Game is amazing. It showed up when South Park was good, and the game sticks to the climate. You can feel as a citizen of South Park.. I found myself bored and unamused at how little there was to do. It is possibly worth it if you get it on a massive discount. However, even then I'm just super unimpressed with the lack of effort put into this game. Disregard the positive reviews. They are hype. Sorry, South Park. I do typically enjoy some of your stuff, but this was pretty lame.. South Park: The Stick of Truth manages to please even someone who is neither a turn-based RPG nor a South Park fan, and that says a lot about this hilarious but fun RPG dished out by Ubisoft. While the RPG elements is quite simple, the creativity applied during development is what makes this something to check out, especially if it's on a huge sale.. This game is a classic. If you haven't played it, I recommend you to do it. As a fan of the show, I loved everything about it. The only problem were the controls... sometimes the game shows you which buttons to press and these aren't the buttons you should be pressing. Everything else was top notch. Pickens approves... and shut up Kenny.. 9.5 (score) It's a good game, and it's very addictive. I felt like I was welcomed when I played for the first time.. If you like the tv series you definitely have to play this game. It's just like the show. The only problem I have with this game is that it is a bit short for an RPG.. The Stick of Truth is an attempt at perfectly recreating the irreverent magic of the television show: it’s a side-scrolling turn-based RPG that looks and sounds identical to an episode of the show. In the Stick of Truth, you play the new kid in town, and as such, you get to craft your own South Park character. The game gives you the freedom to create a pretty damn good representation of yourself in the classic cardboard South Park style. Your character never speaks throughout the game, a point that actually aids immersion and becomes a running gag throughout the plot. As expected, you are quickly assimilated into the infamous gang of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. The plot largely concerns a small tree branch known as “The Stick of Truth”, which frequently changes hands between the fantasy-clad children of the video game. You’re quickly let loose to explore the entire town of South Park, Colorado, and the game’s strengths become immediately apparent. The recreation of the town is perfect, crammed with references to episodes and characters from the show. You can spend hours exploring the various houses, shops, and locations in the city, and there are plenty of secrets and gags that await you. Exploration is usually worth it, even aside from the clever humor: you’ll frequently find weapons and items to help you on your journey. The characters you pass around town will frequently say humorous things; the immersion is pretty high, overall. The game follows a fairly standard quest system. The main quest contains the bulk of the cutscenes and follows the plot of the game, but there are numerous side quests you’ll find throughout your journey. As every quest fits into the context of the preexisting South Park universe, it all feels very necessary to ensure a proper recreation of the show. The gameplay is a humorous rendition of a standard turn-based fantasy battle system. You utilize melee, ranged, mana-based (all which involved flatulence), and power-based attacks against your foes, and you fight most battles with a buddy (e.g. Butters, Cartman, Kyle) that can be swapped out before/after or during battle. Each buddy has a unique set of powers that you can freely trigger on their turn, and as each opponent will have a unique set of strengths/weaknesses, you will learn how to use each character effectively as you play. The make things even more interesting, many of the power-based attacks involve timed events that you need to execute well to maximize your damage. I rarely found myself getting bored of the streamlined yet engaging combat system, which honestly felt more satisfying than most turn-based RPGs I’ve played. The variety of powers (based on a standard character class you choose at the start of the game), weapons, armor, etc. you can unlock is pretty staggering. I can’t imagine that any two playthroughs would leave you with the same loadout. While you can only have so many copies of the same item, your inventory is otherwise infinite, a design choice that takes a lot of tedium out of the game. Once again, South Park: The Stick of Truth streamlines gameplay in every respect, and this makes the game move quickly and keeps things interesting. Besides turn-based battles, the game is chock full of gameplay twists. One quest is a humorously satisfying stealth endeavor. Another quest portrays the country of Canada (of course) as a top-down 8-bit Zelda-like adventure, and this is recreated flawlessly, guaranteed to generate some belly laughs. Many other quests take the nasty vulgarity of the TV show to its extreme, which is a bold statement to make for a game based on the controversial series. This leads me to confidently proclaim that South Park: The Stick of Truth lives up to the funniest, most intelligent, and best moments in South Park history. The game comes across like a 10-hour top-tier episode of South Park with barely a lull to be encountered. The cutscenes are indistinguishable from scenes from the television show, with the exception of seeing your character embedded in them. If you enjoy South Park at all, this will likely be one of the most humorous video games you will ever play, and you are forced to actively take part in some very graphically questionable moments (usually as quick time events). However, if you don’t enjoy the vile, hard-edged nature of South Park’s jokes, steer clear. Trying to come up with shortcomings in this game is extremely difficult. One obvious one is that it uses save checkpoints instead of allowing you to save whenever you’d like. This is a minor frustration, however, given how frequent most of the checkpoints are. Other than that, the game is South Park, through and through, and there are","the game is full of dark humor, sarcasm, and absurdity that complete the game environment . the story plays like a long South Park movie and rpg combat is basic but solid . if it was cheaper it could also be higher, it gets points for all the bonus funny moments ."
"1,178.World of Goo 2","That's a gift for all who played the first one long ago. Love the new ideas in this one, the creativity level is high. Too sad that it's pretty short.. Does not support devices with touch screen. Which is pitty as it seems like a perfect game for such ones.. world of goo 2 is an excellent game the new mechanics and fresh new artstyle and captivating soundtrack makes this an incredible experience. The story is fresh and a unique twist on the original and perfectly co relates on all the other games from tomorrow corporation. Worth thr 15 years of wait. A great successor to the original. Most good things about it can be said about this game as well. The fluid mechanics are fun and well fleshed out. However, this game does not have the whistle from the original. Without the whistle, it is extremely difficult to move the goo balls how you want them to move. The goo balls only seem to gravitate to newly placed structures. If you are trying to optimize levels to use as few goo balls as possible, this means that you cannot move the goo balls without lowering your score for the level or waiting and doing nothing for a bit. There are also sections of the game where you have to wait for goo balls to wander to a specific place, which makes short sections of the game quite boring. This leads to players feeling frustration not at the difficulty of the game, but at the random movements of the goo balls. The whistle in the original allowed you to click and hold somewhere to attract the goo balls, and this would entirely solve my issue with the game.. This is a game that came out 15 years too late. I have a special place in my heart for world of goo. In the dark ages of indie gaming, many years before Terraria, FTL, or even minecraft, all indie games on pc were exclusively ports from the iphone 2-3, mindless gamblecore tier nonsense like peggle was the peak. When this game originally came out it sold developers on the idea that a small group of developers could take a simple concept and make an amazing game. In 2008 this was effectively seen as a novelty, a one-off in an industry driven exclusively by AAA developers pushing multi million dollar budgets. The problem is it's not 2008 anymore. This exact game would have been a 10/10 in 2009, maybe 2010, but waiting 16 years for a game that at best feels like a soft remake? The industry has changed a lot since the original came out. 90% of games are made by small teams with small budgets, and AAA have become overfitted in their own slop of regurgitated failure aside from the occasional passion project like cyberpunk or bg3. I feel like the worst crime this game commits is against its legacy. Where once it was on the forefront of a concept of small scale development this sequel feels like EA bought it, rebranded it, and we're 12 sequels deep in a regurgitated ocean. The game makes this joke with the detective bits but it feels like it goes past parody and just becomes exactly what it's complaining about. Overall a mundane experience, not much in the way of new ideas or clever innovation, just an unreleased dlc someone found from a bygone era.. Hate for this game is absolutely unjustified. Perfect artstyle, remixed (in a good way) music from original, new mechanics, more levels, better quality. This is just wog1 but better in every aspect.. In a vacuum this game is pretty good, smart puzzles, fun art, neat features, but this game is a sequel and not a great one.A lot of the puzzles are just slightly altered puzzles from the first game but just less fun and more frustrating. The puzzle design hinges a lot more on you having very limited amounts of things and it feels like making a genuinely stable goo structure just isn’t encouraged. A lot of the levels feel long winded and unfun to inevitable restart. None of this is to mention the artstyle which has been totally butchered from a vibrant, saturated and often times experimental look from the first game to a new more ‘modern’ look with soft lighting and washed out colours. This game ain’t worth it, both the price and the wait. - The far less interesting sign painter. I personally absolutely loved it. The physics especially are so much better than the first game.. this is a disappointment. it's just a copy paste from the first game! wth i expected a little more something new the levels are the same the art is the same no graphical upgrade or anything music is same and so on.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. More of the same with fresh ideas, polished gameplay and graphics. It's a good sequel. For me a bit short, but it's longer than the first one. I miss the Tower of Goo, where you can build a large tower. I don't need the online highscore, but just offline for me. Or another endless mode. In the first game, you needed to collect Goos from individual levels for this tower, which made sense. In the new game, there's no need to collect Goos, only to finish the level. - You could try to achieve the OCD challenges, but I don't like how it becomes incredibly difficult and not fair like hidden areas. I'm also not a fan of time pressure or counting moves. Yes, it's optional, but it feels like a judgment on your skill. - The Black Stain episodes are a funny idea, but more annoying because you expect and want a World of Goo game instead of a point-and-click adventure. - Overall, it's a great game with nice music. I like the Green Hills music. But I wish there were more options for adjusting music and sound effects volume and for disabling the screen edge scrolling, since you can scroll by dragging. Despite some issues, I can recommend the game. I would play it on iPad btw. The screen of Nintendo Switch is too small and the motion controls is a handicap. Anyway, if you liked the first game and just want to play more levels, this is a great expansion.. World of goo 2 takes the premise of the first game and pumps it up to 100. Everything in this world is fantastic. The game feels alive and is just a joy to play. The story is well done, the new mechanics are just wonderful, this game is soo goo-d! The first game was already as close as you could get to a perfect puzzle game, but this sequel is equally as incredible as the first one. Not to mention the soundtrack composed mainly of remixes of the first game, it's beautifull! Underrated gem. If you want to check it out, you are goo-nna have a fantastic time..

I have 3 issues with this game, 1. Its 2024, all games should have SOME settings, not having any is crazy. 2. There's still some annoying issues from the original returning with the selecting goo and their positioning. 3. The difficulty and complexity of the levels never reach their full potential, so the chapter 5 as well as some of 4 is very disappointing, and the game peaks with its gameplay at the 3rd chapter. Besides that, really cool game, well paced, and has my favourite OST of the year.. World of Goo 2 is nothing short of an incredible experience. Everything about the game is perfect. The music is simply beautiful, all the instruments and the tiny little details in the ****'s just perfect. The art is splendid. The **** be difficult sometimes, but once you get the hang of it, everything works out. The story is also phenomenal. World of Goo 2 is a very enjoyable experience, and it is worth every cent. Tomorrow Corporation really knows how to make masterpieces.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I've been waiting this game for 16 years. I finished school and college, I got job and find the girlfriend, my hometown has been destroyed and my country is in war for 2 years. After 16 years ""2D Boys"" decided that this is the time. The time to bring back my childhood and remind me of my carefree times. And here I am again, 12 years old, reading notes from The Sign Painterand building Goo Towers. I think for many people like me, this is not just a game, but a bright message from the past. And it's still as gorgeous as the first game in 2008. I was very surprised that there are so few reviews here and that so few people knew about this game. Maybe 16 years is too long, but there are still people in this world who are waiting for Half Life 3. World of Goo 2 is something like Half Life 3, and I'm so glad that developers decided to make it. Of caurse 10/10 The Sign Painter","world of goo 2 is an excellent game the new mechanics and fresh new artstyle make this an incredible experience . without the whistle, it is extremely difficult to move the goo balls how you want them to move . this is a game that came out 15 years too late ."
"1,179.Clive Barker's Undying","Just the best horror game ever made.. Old but skillfully designed game which to this day inspires modern classics. Fond memories.. I have great memories from this one. The FPS exploration/story/music was amazing.. It's a good game for the year it was made. Very immersive game, I did not get bored while playing. Its story, location and enemy designs. Variety of weapons and spells. Voiceovers, dialogues, animations, atmosphere, music are very good. On the downside, I encountered a few bugs, I had to go back to my previous save all the time, the flying and jumping mechanics were not good, the boss fights were bad, especially the last boss was disappointing. But I hope there will be a remake or sequel to this game.. This game is really bad by modern standards, but at its time, it was top graphics, top quality, top atmosphere, and top gameplay. It is really a professional job, and I'm very surprised that it doesn't have sequels. When a real writer works with game developers, it is almost always something amazing happens. I give it 10/10, but in its era. By modern standards, it would be about 2/10.. Clive Barker`s Undying lives from its brilliant atmosphere. Graphics and sound perfectly play together and build dense horror. Unbelievably entertaining!. This is not a game, it's a journey. The unique atmosphere in Undying is one of a kind and hasn't been replicated yet. Graphics might be outdated, but it doesn't change the fact, that it's one of the best games out there. It's an experience no one can miss. Pickens approves. There used to be a time were EA games made great games, complete titles without ant bugs, frequent updates to keep expanding the game, DLC's or loot crates or micro transactions. One of this great games was a small collaboration they had with autor and filmmaker Clive Barker to create a game that is consider one the scariest games of all time... what an achievement for EA back then (2001). Clive Barker's Undying is a unique first person horror. you play as Patrick Galloway a WWI veteran and private paranormal investigator who has to uncover the mysteries of an ancient curse surrounding his friend's family. The gameplay... is a first person shooter with the ability of dual weapons; in one arm you carry fire weapons and in the other magic spells that will help you defeat monsters and to progress through the game. This spells can be upgraded with amplifiers that you can find through the level, but keep in mind that this amplifiers will only upgrade the equipped spell at that moment, you can not choose which one you want, some spells are kinda useless and once you use them you will provably not use them again after know their purpose. The story is intriguing and it's mysteries will unveil as you make your way through the game. The game is full of scary sequences and visuals that comes along with an great soundtrack, both of this makes an eerie atmosphere. The lighting in this game is most cases scarce, you will be in total darkness and again the feeling that a monster will attack you will makes you paranoid. The game was developed using the Unreal Engine 2, it has awesome level design and texture work, which helps the setting being creepy. This is a true horror gem, now a days most horror games don't do this anymore.... they are opting to be more walk simulator driven than this. Go and check it out, you can find it at **** at a pretty cheap price and runs like a charm in modern hardware.. I have troubles with this game. My main concern is that I find it archaic, but it's hard to me to blame it for just that - being old. How about an astounding ability to neglect your saved game states accompanied with a crash that will inevitably happen when you alt+tab? Luckily the solution is simple: just don't do this. And pray it wouldn't corrupt your save for some totally random reason, forcing you to use cheats to restore your progress, which in turn can be mitigated by utilizing many save slots. Or just don't buy it. Yeah, it would be an appropriate solution if it weren't for it's brilliant ambiance and engaging gameplay, which may be a bit of a stretch given that it's a shooter that fails to deliver. I find it mediocre, yet I love it and I'm considering replaying it in the future. A truly undying title. + a journal + the main music theme + Oneiros + level design - you fight flying electric eels cross-breed with piranhas - using cheats may be your only chance to restore your progress and it messes with your difficulty level - obnoxious HUD - frequent loading screens - bugs - the final boss, when you think about it. This is not a game, it's a journey. The unique atmosphere in Undying is one of a kind and hasn't been replicated yet. Graphics might be outdated, but it doesn't change the fact, that it's one of the best games out there. It's an experience no one can miss. Pickens approves.. 8.8 - Amazing first person shooter, has lots of horror elements that are done pretty good for a 2001 game. Also, lots of variety in terms of the locations, weapons and enemies that you face throughout the game.. If this game deserves something, it deserves a HD Remake. The same game with better visuals, some minor glitches corrected and better controls. It is a real gem that waits to see the sunlight. A real pleasure to play it, especially when you get tired of too much AAA s**t and want to see how a good game should be. What are you waiting for, EA?. This is by far the best horrorFPS game ever made and stands in my opinion alone in both having good enough story to stand the test of time. but also good enough engaging gameplay to stay good even today. The story is well written and is typical Clive Barker. Its dark, its scary and it got a nasty twist. Its a horror show and the many eastereggs and hints you get in the game using your wits or your ""inner eye skill"" gives a huge amount of lore and content. I still remember to this day when i Scryed the full family photo of the coventant family and saw the ""truth"". As a story game this is a clear 10 but the gameplay is suprisingly clever as well. There is a XP system that works great, and if you find allot of secrets and really dig into the game. you find yourself feeling pretty powerful by the end of the game and its satisfactory to really slaughter the enemies that killed you allot in the start. Since combat is fun, and there is always new scripted evens, it never gets boring using the ""overpowered"" melee weapon you will get , to really ravage the enemies. or use on of your many spells to ressurect fallen enemeies or blast them apart with living skulls. All in All, if you are a fan of games, Clive Barkers Undying will be worth 10 times what you will most likely pay for it. Buy this game, it will blow your mind. I wrote an e-mail to the developers 'The Astronauts', that made the incredible new game called The Vanishing of Ethan Carter 2014. I asked them to consider remaking Undying for their next project. With the Unreal 3 engine, I can only imagine how ridiculously good that game will look, feel and play. Especially with the talent that folks at the The Astronauts have! Not sure if my e-mail will get through, but hopefully it will be read and considered. Hint *Some of you might wanna put your two cents in as well to them :)* Hell, they can't think it wouldn't be a good game to redo! It would put them on the map both for, having the balls to actually remake a classic, and if done correctly, being THE best Horror game ever made. PERIOD!! What do you say folks? Undying - The Return sounds like a good title, eh?. Clive Barker's Undying is a perfect example of horror-FPS. It's scary as hell - I finished it a half of dozen times, but every time I play it, I still prefer to do this by daylight, I'm sure you'll understand why :). It's a must-have for those who love horror games: it has a fantastic creepy sound track, a nice story, a perfect voice-over, an incredibly abominable enemies, a lots of weapons and magic spells (heck, you can use them both simultaneously), a nice but fearful locations (a half-abandoned Irish castle, a monastery and its catacombs, a magic world, etc). It's hard to buy a physical copy of the game these days, but if you don't mind about a digital copy, just visit GOG.. Best. Horror. Game. Ever. Wish they would remake it!!!!!!! FPS shooter including magic and a wide variety of weapons. Amazing enemies. Cliver Barker you da man.. Its kind of amazing that 13 years ago approximately, we saw a game like Undying even out on the PC. After all it was the end of the golden late 90's era of videogames, ridiculously good (and sometimes bad) titles were coming out left and right. However, Clive Barker's Undying could've had any box art or title it wanted, it was just one of those examples of how well an actual videogame can look, play, sound and ""be"". Even compared to the seminal Medal of Honor Allied Assault, which though equally brilliant and great when compared to Undying, it wasn't exactly as original. So surprisingly original is Undying that its a little hard to believe more people don't talk about it, especially those that took the mechanics from it, ripped them like appendages off a lifeless corpse, then sewed them together into their games and pretended it never happened. Well it did. Bioshock wouldn't have been the game it was without Undying, same as anything else that ""borrows"" similar gameplay mechanics as well, but I'm getting a little off topic here. In the game you play as a real Irish-man Patrick, a man who has unfortunately been drawn into occult rituals, is able to use often spooky magical abilities without much explanation at all, and holds his pistol in his left hand- Single-handedly pissing off right handed players everywhere. Now Patrick has decided to take his sweet time getting back to an old pal of his, (and if I were him I think I'd know why) but he owes him a favor from many years ago as we are informed during the introduction- whilst Patrick takes a boat over to a rather large island where Jeremiah's mansion is located. Upon entering the mansion that is only a smaller portion of Jeremiah's estate, its fairly obvious some bad juju is afoot and you are there to find out why. Throughout the island you will fight all sorts of strange beasts, ghosts, demon's and accursed creatures. You'll also have a lot of fun killing them with the wonderful assortment of weapons, spells and items you'll be finding as well. I don't remember the last time a game had such a fun arsenal, not since Half life 1 at least. You will gain new spells, unlock secrets, gain amplifiers to ""level up"" spells even and locate journals that expand upon whats going on as their isn't really much of a narrative after the beginning of the game. In fact, it is highly recommended that you actually read what's going on, since its immensely well written for one, and for two- its going to make the story flow a lot better as you get close to the end. Undying does just about everything right, from its level design, to its weapon design, enemy design, sound design and general aesthetics. Its very hard to this day to find a game that possesses the kind of ambiance, tension and revolutionary game play all wrapped together with a great story and impressive dialogue. It still bugs me that hardly anyone has played the damn game though.. This is one of the most obscure games you will never hear of and should have played. The game play mechanics and visual designs/animations were years ahead of it's time. One wonders how many other games' play mechanics have been inspired by Undying without credit where it's due. The game holds up well even today and is one of the more atmospheric games out there. Pro tip: play it really late at night when you'll have more concentration and less distractions.. Undying is one of the most memorable games ever produced. Its a game of horror. The story is quiet interesting while it may not be as awesome as other Barker's work but in terms of being a game and the time this game was published I should say he did an awesome job. Gameplay is what Undying is all about. one hand with guns and another hand you can cast different magics. it lets you to decide how to kill your enemies. Today we see this kind of mechanism have been extended and improved in games such as BioShock. Undying atmosphere is creepy and dark. Game was produced with Unreal Engine 2 i bevlieve and by the time this game was released it was a top notch game in terms of its visual. I still own this game and I still have it installed on my PC, sometimes i go play it and I still enjoy it. What a great game and one of my all time favourites. Sadly it didn't receive the acclaim or following it deserved at the time of it's release, but if you can get it installed it's still worth your time. Awesome.. This game is combination of great story that is not there to ruin anything a skill level system work really well, and magic combined with shooting is beautiful, first time I finished it on normal and did not read journals, that was a big mistake, I played it again with different skill build and now on hard difficulty I found most of journals. Story was excellent, this game sets an example oh how video games should be made. Design of the game is excellent and I found game scary in good way. Fun - 9/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Controls - 10/10 Graphics Design - 10/10 Story - 10/10 All Time Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 10/10 Music - 10/10 Replayability - 8/10 Graphics for its time - 9/10 94/100. The first third of this title is pure masterpiece. A chilling atmosphere, haunting sounds and great dialogue all work together to make the hairs on your neck stand up. The gameplay while navigating the corridors of the mansion are intense and frightening. You're never quite sure when a Howler is gonna jump at you. This horror concept has been done to death by now, but back in 2001 this was revolutionary and pants-filling stuff. The game begins to suffer when you face human (or humanoid, in the last level) opponents. The game becomes a much more predictable and standard shooter. The humans don't spring from the shadows with a growl and a flash of claws. They just kinda run at you until you shoot them. Yawn. While the gameplay suffers during these levels, the atmosphere and writing remain top-notch. I recently (2011-2012) replayed this title and was pleased at how well it has aged. Recommended!","clive barker's undying is considered one of the scariest games of all time . it's a unique first person horror with a unique atmosphere . it's not a game, it's a journey and an experience no one can miss ."
"1,180.Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge","Just like the Special Edition of the original Monkey Island, this is also an excellent graphical remake that makes it the best way to enjoy this classic today. In any case, it doesn’t reach the level of the first installment, but it’s still an excellent adventure.. In many ways, Monkey Island 2 is better than the first. It ups the graphics, it ups the humour and it ups the story. It uses a similar formula to the first game, with some changes mostly for the better. This manages to be a much darker game than Monkey Island 1, yet still appealing to the same audience. The hint system is still there, which annoys me, however it still manages to be my personal favourite in the franchise. Lucas Arts perfected their brilliant sequel and will go down as one of the best adventure games of all time. If you liked the first Monkey Island, you will definitely love this one.","if you liked the first Monkey Island, you will definitely love this one . it uses a similar formula to the first game, with some changes mostly for the better . it is a much darker game than the first, yet still appealing to the same audience ."
"1,181.Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones","Another game that is very solid, but I can't appreciate in its entirety because I am bad at it. I always struggled with classic Fire Emblem and its permadeath.... This is my personal favorite Fire Emblem game. I might be a bit biased since it is the game that got me personally into the series, but I just love this Fire Emblem game in particular. Just like FE7, it has great sprite work, amazing music, great cast of characters, etc. I would argue that, of the Fire Emblem games I've played, it has the overall best map design (I can only think of 1 or 2 levels that are iffy). I like how you actually get to have a choice in your branching path (unlike in FE6 and 7 where the unlock requirements for certain maps are very arbitrary and forced upon you). It's also neat that even when the two paths converge, there are still differences in the story and maps between the two. It's also nice that every character in the game is accessible despite which route you pick, since the two characters that show up on each route during the split will join you when the paths converge. Some argue that the game is too easy, but I think personally that the difficulty is fine and levels up in difficulty at a really nice pace. However, if you are looking for a super hard challenge, the Hard difficulty is no pushover. I would argue that this game is the best one to introduce players into classic Fire Emblem. A couple small nitpicks is that it is definitely on the shorter side (being around 20 chapters when the average FE game is around 25-30) and that the postgame is a bit on the weaker side (though on the flipside of that, FE games hardly have a postgame to begin with, so having a postgame at all is a plus for those who want it); it's really only a novelty for if you want to collect and use the various Creature Campaign exclusive characters. I have personally beaten the game countless times, fully completed the sound test, gotten every single Creature Campaign character, obtained every single last support in this game (remember this is a game that only lets you get up to 1 A support per run) and completed both the Eirika and Ephraim routes on Hard Mode. This game holds a special place in my heart. If you're either an FE fan who hasn't played this one yet or are someone who is curious into getting into FE and wants to play a more classic game, I would highly recommend playing this game.. Sacred Stones is a slightly easier game than FE7, but it does offer more tangible changes that improve upon the formula from the previous game. The ability to choose which class your characters can change into, stages to train in, post game content, and the addition of skills help make Sacred Stones a more robust title to the predecessor.. I enjoyed this game for what it was , and although the story was simple it was still fun. I liked all of the characters and the challenges the game presented.. I like it! It is different to the one that came before, but I think it is still enjoyable and replayeable... and the sprite animations are nice.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Easily the best game from the GBA era of Fire Emblem, at least in my opinion. Despite having a simplistic storyline, the fun characters and map design make up for it greatly. With some of the best villains the series has to offer, I’d recommend Sacred Stones to anyone looking to enter the Fire Emblem series. The Fire Emblem games on the Advance are all so similar they're basically interchangable, If you like one, you'll like them all.. An incredibly accessible and engaging entry among the GBA Fire Emblem games, and arguably the best of all 3. While not offering a groundbreaking story or mechanics, Sacred Stones offers plenty of new features while also toning down the difficulty in non-contrived ways (like adding opportunities to grind). Such innovations, in combination with an above-par story, a branching story and moderately compelling characters, helped this game defy my expectations for what I could get out of a Fire Emblem game on the GBA. While perhaps archaic and dated when compared to modern entries, Sacred Stones is a fantastic Fire Emblem game.. I have this ported on WiiU rather than on GBA. What a fantastic game. FE done right. Story, combat. OST is amazing. Easy 10. Loved it straight away.. A game that continues with respect to its previous release. Its larger mapping takes away the weight of the story. Despite not reaching the level of its previous installment is still one of the best games of the GBA and one of the best of the series as such.. The was my first Fire Emblem game, back in the day, and it still holds up really well.. Absolutely love this game. Defined a good part of my childhood. The handheld versions of fire emblem have their own unique charm.. my favorite Fire Emblem game , and has many unique features from Fire Emblem Gaiden has just done it right. One of my all-time favorite games. I love this game biasly. Absolute brilliance and grace in story telling as well as gameplay.. Best FE game. Stay mad, FE7 babies LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. This is a great tactical RPG from when Fire Emblem was still a great tactical RPG series. With two branching stories, the level of replay-ability instantly doubles to see the events of the game from two different points of view. The customization of units has a little more depth this time around, due to being able to select one of two classes upon a class up. As with the earlier Fire Emblem games, the plot is thick and rich, interesting well designed characters, and geopolitical conflict that moves the narrative forward. If you love tactical RPG games, don't pass this one up, there are a lot of extras and unlockables to achieve even long after the game has been completed!. While it may not have as good of a story as fire emblem, it more than makes up for it by providing a world map where you can grind, a cast of good characters and retains the same charm as of the other fire emblem game on GBA, one of the best strategy rpg as well as one of the best in the fire emblem series.. So you will know what type of gamer is writing this review, I'll list three of my favorite games. Danganronpa Fire emblem Atelier Totori THE GOOD: GAMEPLAY: Fantastic gameplay, loads of fun. There are a lot of recruitable characters, I would say about thirty in game. You can recruit some in the endgame as well. Support conversations during battle delve into their personalities. I'll delve more into gameplay further down in this review. MUSIC: Music is violins and trumpets and keyboards mostly. Nothing stands out as great as far as the games music. STORY: Story is good but not great. Intriguing at certain moments but mostly a very average storyline. GRAPHICS: Graphics are what you would expect from a gba game GAME LENGTH: Lots of gameplay time. I spent about 65 hours in this game but that includes the bonus content such as recruiting the extra characters after completion of the game. THE BAD: There wasn't anything bad to list about this game in my opinion. IN DEPTH REVIEW: The gameplay is strategy based. You first prepare your army such as picking the recruits you want to take into battle and equipping weapons and healing items to them. Each recruit can have five items on their person at a time. You can scan the level beforehand to see which recruits are best for the level and also see the enemy's items and also to see if there are any recruitable characters on the level. Some recruits can be missed and not recruited if you do not talk to them with a certain recruit. You can also change your recruits starting position before you begin the level. To actually play the level, you must meet the requirements to beat that level. Most of the time the requirements are to kill all enemies. To do this, you move your units around a grid based level. Attacking enemy units or retreating when necessary. Enemies also come for your party so building a defensive wall is important at times. The weapons you combat with matter in this game, swords are better against axes, and lances are better against swords. Magic also has its weapon triangle guidelines. There are also archers in this game and healers. A couple of special units as well such as a dancer which can give one unit an extra turn during one of the players turns. I'll list some character classes, Troubadour: a units with great movement that can heal only. Knight: a unit with little movement range but great defense. Archer: a unit who has an extra attack range but cannot attack back when in close combat. Mage: a unit who can attack one or two spaces away with magic. Cavalier: a horseback unit that can use lances and swords. Thief: a unit who can open chest and steal certain items from enemy units. Can also attack but not very effectivly. Units can change class after reaching level 10-20. The advanced class has many bonuses including an extra 20 level ups the recruit can obtain and sometimes the recruit who changed class can use extra weapons or magic or staves. Every recruit has two classes to choose from when they change class. Each with their unique strong points. When a recruit dies on the level, you LOSE that unit PERMANENTLY. This is the Fire Emblem way. There are arenas in this game on certain levels that let's you fight for money and experience. You can max a recruit or all recruits at these arenas but your unit will be forever lost if you die in the arena. You can suspend on levels and then soft reset the system to save your progress so you will not waste hours at the arena when a unit dies. Simply load the suspended data and restart your progress from that point. I spent many hours at the arenas, it was one of the things I liked most about this game that isn't in every Fire Emblem title. SIDE NOTE: Also, this game is rare now and most copies for sale are very expensive. I lucked out and got a copy that works from **** for about 20 dollars. Most copies were in the 100 dollar range as I recall. That just shows how great this game is I suppose but I would recommend this game at the 100 dollar price tag. That how great I think this game is. You will likely play it more than once so you could put over a 100 hours into this game which equals out to a dollar an hour to play. Not to bad. Also, the other Fire Emblem titles are very expensive as well except for Fire Emblem Awakening and Fire Emblem Fates which were released rather recently. That wraps this review up, hope it helps.. The Tower of Valni! If there was one beef I had with the first Fire Emblem on GBA in America, it was the leveling of my characters. The Tower of Valni addressed this in such a wonderful way. No matter which characters you took with you in the main chapters to battle, the Tower of Valni made it possible to max each character's level before continuing to a challenging chapter. Also new to the series are the skirmish battles around the world map, which weren't necessary to advance in the story, but good for leveling characted and testing out new strategies. -The gameplay is as addictive as ever. Nothing new added to the series here as you can still plot out your moves and see the odds of success before each battle. You can also see your enemies range of movement during each turn giving a great advantage over deployment. Characters can encourage one another on the battlefield by using the talk command between two compatible characters. However, I did not take advantage of this feature as much and it's definitely not necessary, just a useful tool at times and if you're looking for extra dialogue. -The Story is very memorable, although the dialogue can get to be a bit tedious at times and you may find yourself wanting to skip ahead. It won't take you on any kind of emotional roller coaster of sorts. -The cast of characters are plentiful. Which is necessary as character permadeath is still here, and if you lose one of your favorite characters in battle, it can be a devastating thing to experience. Sacred Stones balances this well as many times, you will get caught off-guard by enemy reinforcements, and if you've spent over 45 minutes on one chapter, getting close to the end and one of your characters die; you have a choice to press forward or start that chapter all over again. It's sometimes a hard choice to make. -The amount of content is incredible, not only will the Tower of Valni make you invest hours upon hours of gameplay, all the while improving your troops, but the skirmishes and the after game content is incredible, not to mention the two paths that can be chosen in the middle of the game. If you want to go back and experience the other main characters separate path, you have that option to play it all over again. This is a classic in the Fire Emblem series and not much can be said in the way for areas of improvement. If you're a strategy RPG fan and a fan **** story, definitely play this game.. Fire Emblem is a tactical turn-based RPG that hasn't been replicated in any other series and is quite unique. Now this series has been made from the NES era all the way till now with its newest addition, Fire Emblem: Awakening. The evolution of game play is more noticeable from the switch to NES and SNES to the Gameboy Advance. That means that some are just glossed over while others become more popular due to timing. Sacred Stones suffers from this same problem. Sacred Stones is a stand-alone game in the series and arguably the darkest of them all. The story is centered on the continent of Magvell which is ruled by several monarchies and political systems. The politics enveloping the land is just a small side-story of the entire game with its numerous sub-plots. The story develops in a depressing manner as the themes of death and loss constantly rear their ugly head each turn. This allows the player to feel ultimate triumph and at the same time melancholy as you see the destruction of lands and people around you. These mixed feelings make you ask questions while at the same time gives you some understanding of the time period. Like all the games before it, once you lose a character they will be dead for good and in this one some scenes are lost through said loss. The story changes and hinges on your ability to keep your allies alive which is an awesome feeling. Evolution wise it came right after the game changers and was the last on the GBA era of Fire Emblem games. While the maps in previous FE games were just for helping you place where you are in the story, in Sacred Stones it is more than that. This time you move around the map by your own volition and enter the chapter when you feel you are up to the task. This map didn't stop there; you had monster encounters, buying of weapons on map, and even challenge areas for the end game. It featured duels against other people as you choose your best units against theirs. If that wasn't enough, it added monsters unique to the game such as Centaurs, Skeletons and more. Now the nuances; this game has a large cast of characters that like most Fire Emblem games don't get much time to flesh out. In the past two titles, they added in support conversations for characters if you took the time to do them. I found that they perfected them in this game since each one allowed you to see sides of your unit you didn't know and allowed some sort of depth beyond the nameless face. It introduced crossroads in classing up units. Every unit had two choices to choose between. If you were a knight, you could either become a general or a great knight. As well as having the three units who could class up twice, this was an addition to the game that allows the player more choice than the past ones. Despite this being an interest road to go down, they ruin it later on with the overuse of this game mechanic. The OST has some of the more memorable songs for myself including the gentle ones like Lyon's theme and the dramatic encounters with a powerful opponent. It made it that much more satisfying as you finally finished off those who did you wrong. Graphics wise its not really different from the other GBA Fire Emblems. The only things to point out is the awesome opening and the ending boss' design. This game was a masterpiece and allowed Fire Emblem fanatics and new-comers a story to get enveloped into and to feel for. It adds onto the previous additions and makes further advances. Even though it was glossed over, Fire Emblem Sacred Stones certainly holds up, even to today's standards of handheld games. Story: 10 Gameplay: 9.6 Sound: 9.5 Visuals: 9.5 Overall: 9.6. My favorite game in the entire series. Fun gameplay that improves on previous entries. Memorable characters that you will find yourself restarting the game for, so as not to lose them. An opportunity to strengthen characters at the Tower of Valni which helps if you're struggling. And lastly, fantastic replayablility seeing as you can have a completely different team that you focus on in each play through. Its easy to pick up and play even for newcomers to the series, I would strongly recommend it. The only problem with this game, its the items to make the promotions, you need to think very smart and pick your favorite characters. But still fun and the choices of histories are great. Great fun. Nice gameplay, great story and very, very addictive. Hard and infuriating when you lose a great unit, but still one of the best strategy games I have ever played.. After the relative success that was Fire Emblem (Rekka no Ken, to be precise), Nintendo decided to release it's successor, The Sacred Stones, in the west as well. And, let me tell you this, it was the right decision. The game's art style is a bit darker than before, and the story is a bit more straightforward than Rekka no Ken's story was. The cast of characters has also been reduced, allowing for a deeper view on each character this time around. Gameplay wise, this game plays exactly like it's predecessor. The only notable differences are special class skills that some classes inhabit, and, most importantly, the world map. The world map feature allows the player to visit shops freely after clearing a certain chapter, and it also grants access to what most people would call training grounds: The Tower of Valni. It allows the player to go through it over and over, thus training your units. This can be used to make the game easier, or to level up characters post-story. Concerning difficulty, this game should be a good one for beginners, as it is a bit easier than other Fire Emblems, not only but also thanks to the Tower of Valni mentioned earlier. The replayability is, as one would expect knowing the franchise, very high. Not only can you continue playing after beating the story (to unlock certain characters, for example), but there are also two main routes to follow the story on. One has to play the game at least twice to get to enjoy all chapters, which could tick some people off, but shouldn't be a big deal, as this game is very addicting. To conclude, the game is one of the best in the franchise, and one of the best games for the system as well. It manages to be absolutely ""Fire Emblem"" while adding some spice with some small changes and attracting new players that are easily frustrated by the other installment(s). If you own a GameBoy Advance or a Nintendo DS/DS lite and are at least remotely interested in turn-based strategy, this game is a must have.. Amazing game. I was a bit skeptical at first, but when I finally got to play it through the 3DS Ambassador Program, I was floored. This game is addictive as hell! The replay value is definitely strong in this one.. Tenouttaten! Truly the best game I've **** story is well written,the graphics are well done and the game play is superb.With 2 to 3 characters of every class and each character being individual statistic-ly and personality wise,each play through is different and fresh.Amazing. Pretty damn good. I still prefer most of the other games, but this is still well done. The characters don't have AS MUCH life to them, but they're still great.. One of the greatest RPG games I've ever played! Amazing storyline, interesting battle animations and fantastic music as well. This is a must have for RPG lovers!. The game is one of the most addicting original gameboy games I have. Everytime I go on vacation, I always pack my DS and this game. I have gone over the campaign multiple times, on different modes and various challenges and tasks for myself. The campaign is well thought-out and thrilling, and the graphics can definitely satisfy your eyes. Even in 2012 you should buy it, as it is worth every single penny.. Definitely a weaker entry after the absolute masterpiece that was Fire Emblem, but manages to be good on it's own. It's a good entry on the series, but i find the Tower of Valni being more of a con than a pro, it makes the game just too easy. That's more or less what'r wrong with it, the rest is superb. more classes, more things to do. It's great.","this is my personal favorite Fire Emblem game . just like FE7, it has great sprite work, amazing music, great cast of characters . if you are looking for a super hard challenge, the Hard difficulty is no pushover ."
"1,182.Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition","good game, very bad port but understandable since its their first port to pc i wouldn't play again but still good game but bad port.. What else is there to say about this masterpiece, its fun in a overcoming your own weaknesses and become stronger because of it, dark souls puts you through the ringer and if you beat the game you will feel great, if you play this game be sure to play with friends.. A perfect start to a perfect trilogy, a life-changing experience. Greatest world-level design I've ever experienced. Truly a masterpiece.9.5/10. The game has some issues regarding how well this new style of gameplay is done, it's not nearly as smooth as in DS3. And has some physical problems and bugs. Other than that, perfect experience.. One of the most important videogames in history that marked a change in the creativity of developers and in the approach of consumers, inventing a new genre that combines the complexity of hardcore RPGs with the intuitive dynamic mechanics of third-person action. The experience is set in a high-fantasy open map with large interconnected areas that transform the game map into a real dungeon, always difficult but always readable.. Easily the best game ever created in the whole history of video games. I say this without exaggeration. This game is so overrated and it **** **** Old ass mechanics and boring start to finish … just some nerds overrating a shiit game. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 100/100 amazing design beautiful world.. This is a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a video game masterpiece and also a game that changed a generation. it just made one sub-genre in aRPG itself, and excels all the descenders even today. This review focuses primarily on boss fights, combat, and leveling. The game has 26 bosses, including 4 from the DLC. Great boss design encompasses the following: easily learnable mechanics, counter-able bosses, most if not all setups will be viable against them. Dark Souls does very well in the easily learnable mechanics realm, is moderate in the counter realm and does terrible with build viability for bosses, there are some setups that will just NEVER work against certain bosses. My favorite boss is still Artorias, my least favorite Black Dragon Kalameet. Dark Souls could have been a 9/10 game if the game had focused on making fights more interesting rather than just punishing. A fight should never feel impossible and can still be challenging to overcome.. Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition is a milestone in the history of video games. Its excellence shines through various aspects. Pros: Rewarding Challenge: Extreme difficulty is offset by the sense of accomplishment when overcoming obstacles. Intriguing World: Lordran is an interconnected world, full of secrets and submerged lore. Deep Combat: The combat system is precise and strategic, allowing for various approaches. Immersive Atmosphere: The dark ambiance and melancholic soundtrack create an immersive experience. Story in the Margins: The narrative is fragmented and requires exploration, enriching the experience. Cons: Technical Issues: Some bugs and optimization problems hinder gameplay at times. Steep Learning Curve: It can be intimidating for novice players, deterring some. Final Verdict: Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition, despite some technical issues, is unquestionably the greatest game of all time. Its complexity, challenge, and narrative depth create an experience that transcends any other title. This game is a masterpiece that will be remembered and cherished by generations of gamers.. It's the game that ruined Action RPG's for me forever. No world design in gaming has stacked up since. An imperfect buggy unfinished masterpiece. Single-handedly the most ridiculously good level design in ages. Fantastic worldbuilding, unique and genre-defying gameplay. The ultimate experience for its generation of gaming. 10. 8.5 . Amazing game, i didn't really notice the downfall on the second half of the game cause i played it many years ago.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Gameplay - 10 Plot & Characters - 5 Storytelling - 8 Pacing - 10 Music & Sound - 9 Replayability - 9 Performance - 7. Those who gave low marks clearly did not know how to take advantage of the essence and its real message. Regarding the controls on the PC, there are no conditions to play a game of this size on the keyboard. Furthermore, this masterpiece still has an impact on games today. To those who complain, I hope you have a good reasoning to understand everything that happens in this work while resting at the fire. PRAISE THE SUN!. one of my favourite game of all time!!! insane world design, excellent boss design!! too much unforgettable memory! all the NPC are so interesting too! Ash lake is still most breathtaking area of souls series and one of the best in gaming history!. This is a very good game. Fantastic beginning of the Dark Souls series, and the best of the three.. DS1 is an instant classic. The way the game presents challenge and storytelling is revolutionary for the whole games industry. Some might be scared off by the game's difficulty and lack of direction, but once you overcome that initial learning barrier, the game opens up as an incredible skill-based RPG with a fantastic underlying story and a mythical and hostile world waiting to be conquered.. this is my favourite game but I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 7.5/10 It's beautiful in a sense that it's not actually as hard to learn as people make it out to be, it's just that applying the knowledge to new areas of the game manages to stay as punishing as the start of the game when you don't have that knowledge. that's a good learning curve my friends or it is a good learning curve until the second half of the game, where it seems that they ran out of money, one area is cast entirely in darkness, it's almost like they didn't have to design a place one is a lava field filled with dragon asses (this is not hyperbole or a joke), it's basically just a stack of pointless reused assets, one area is a single room which would be clever if it were implemented properly but it rather unfortunately is quite a dull area. it doesn't help that by this part of the game your character should be somewhat overpowered in comparison to what should be the more interesting individual encounters. Furthermore the game is nigh impossible to penetrate the ideas of, while it's fine for the story to be obfuscated behind little details, a lot of quite important gameplay details are completely unclear. This paired with the fact that when buffs are most useful (early game) is when buffs are also completely non replenishable makes the barrier to entry quite high and not just because it's designed to be hard, but because it's pointlessly obscure what does what. One of the stats you can put points in is legitimately useless. Furthermore there are nearly gamebreaking weapons that have a 1 in 5 drop rate from enemies that don't respawn that there are only one of, so first timer success can be contingent on luck. So those are the negatives and ultimately they're not all that negative, this game is very enjoyable to get good at and a lot of enemy designs and environment designs are amazing fun to look at. So yeah, git gud, play dark souls, but do it with a strategy guide cause it's probably impossible without one. The beginning of a delicious series of games and creative brethren. The graphics and combat don't hold up as well post-Dark Souls 3/Sekiro/Bloodborne, but this game still holds a place of honor for being the birth of an absolute CRAZE in new gameplay design. It did for action/adventure games what FNAF did for horror; it changed the way everyone looks at the genre and forced the entire game industry as a whole to shift, so much so that Steam now has a ""Souls-like"" category. That should speak for itself.. great game, you really wanna take it slow. the multiplayer meta is a bit dependent on a single build. Truly one of the greatest games of all time. The pc version needs the dsfix mod though to be playable.. Dark Souls, how I love you. Dark Souis, how I hate you. I know these days there isn't really a new take under the sun, but with the circle jerk it surrounding Dark Souls, I still feel as though it's blasphemy to say any part of Dark Souls isn't amazing. I personally think a lot of Dark Souls isn't amazing. The main foundation that manages to uphold the game is its feel, no other game captures the same atmosphere of Dark Souls. However, at the end of my most recent playthrough, I think I've become convinced that's all that's good about Dark Souls. Dark Souls has abysmal combat. A lot of people say that it's skill based, no it's absolutely not, each weapon has such limited implementation, trapped to only a few basic attacks each. Its more of a memory game, becoming comfortable with a specific weapons attack patterns and adding in the knowledge of enemy attack patterns in order to equate to being able to attack the number of times that the enemy's recovery time allows. This however, very often has you using the same weapon for the entire game, and this is not a short game. In a game that seems to throw variety at you, begging for experimentation, anytime I picked up any new armor or weapon and I was curious enough to test it, I would get stomped out while trying to essentially relearn the combat of timings of each weapon. And I'm specific about saying 'timing', because there is no variety from weapon to weapon, a weapon either thrusts or stabs, thats it. The only thing that changes is the animations that play when a characters swings. It makes the game feel stale very quickly, and the last few hours became a slog. I changed weapons all of one time to fight a boss that was easier to overcome with quick attacks rather than high damage ones, but that was one boss out of a plethora of big, slow moving tanks, and I'd argue that its one of the most unfair bossfights in the game anyways. Despite my issues, I can't bring myself to hate it. I've never gotten more angry at the **** a game pulls than playing this game, but the design of the world and its characters are so damn appealing to look at, even if they don't make any sense when you put the specifics of it under a microscope. That's one last gripe, item descriptions aren't a **** story dude, not one of the damn Dark Souls games has a good story, i'd be hard pressed to say any of them have any story at all. And no, I will not watch a cringe youtube video to explain to me the lore that he made up in his head because you didn't put enough in your game. A bit harsh, but it comes from a place of love. If I didn't like the game, the things im not a fan of wouldn't stick out so much in my mind.. 5/10 game but absolutely terrible PC port. You can't play online with DSfix and controls customizer, which is why i rate it 3/10. Play Remastered version instead but even Remastered is not perfect.. Dark souls is beautiful at its core. Interesting game mechanics and combat system. However, the port itself is bad. 30 fps lmao. This game is the reference. It has technical limitations, it was not polished, but it was revolutionary. At a time, when games became more and more like movies and played themselves, this game singlehandedly changed the focus of game machanics in the mainstream. It was hard and not afraid to hide game elements, to reward the player at the end. for me the pc version is the reference because of the modding scene and randomizers available.. The game itself is awesome, but the PC port was horrible ( and still horrible).. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gotta give it a point for the art style and atmosphere - they're the only things going for it. I think this game is for people suffering to the extreme from 'sunk cost' fallacy ('I wasted so much time on this garbage, it has to be good! I will troll other people to feel better about my poor choices!'). Most of the enemies, I had no problems defeating with my tactics. But basically to progress, you are forced to grind - and it's the most boring slog **** I can think of. I'd honestly rather grind old NES JRPGs than a Souls game. The only thing that has routinely defeated my playing this or Demon's Souls has been overwhelming boredom by the third or fourth hour in. If it was a traditional action game, it'd likely be 100x better. As it is, it's just a bunch of poor game design decisions hidden beneath a nice coat of paint.. I love this game more than the other entries in the series just from the world design. The combat might be clunky but the connection to fire link shrine is epic.. Simply put, a masterpiece. Great one-piece plot with lots of engraved details. At the same time, the presentation is unobtrusively woven into surroundings, for the realism and atmosphere of which game designers deserve special praise. The combat system is fair and balanced. The player chooses his difficulty, but not by clicking on the menu, but by making in-game decisions. Some of the songs are beautiful, the ending can bring you to tears. The motivation it gives is unimaginable. There are flaws, but this is one of the few games that I'm willing to give 10/10. So I do it.. This port was a little buggy, but it was my introduction to the Souls series. DS1 has excellent level design, hard but fair gameplay, a ln intriguing approach to storytelling. I absolutely DS1.. Frustrating, challenging, and a nightmarish pc port. Bad controls, framerate, and a camera/lockon mechanic that betrays you oh so much and the primary antagonist in this game. That is.... It's still dark souls man. There is still fun to be had with its outstanding combat. It can be fun. Probably best enjoyed in its other iterations though. A classic, it has an awful port on PC but the simple mod called DSfix fixes everything and also improves a lot to the point you can make your own Remaster.. It's 2022, From Software still haven't fixed a single thing wrong with this game. Running it on today's hardware with dsfix is still an optimization mess. Instead of putting out any patches they tried to sell us a remastered version. Ha.. I love this game, this game opened another world of story and gameplay to me along with its challenges, of course, this version had a terrible quality in terms of FPS and some technical areas, at least on my laptop, of course For thick skin like me, it was enough to be a part of this game :). Without exaggeration, this game saved modern game design. It made challenging and unforgiving gameplay and gloomy and oppressive atmosphere comercially viable. Might be the most influential game of the last decade. The port is terrible, but the gameplay, world and atmosphere are a work of art so giving it any less would be a disservice.. very good game with a lot of potential but poorly **** fps,terrible pc port and don't even bother to even test it without controller.some of the port problems can be fixed by dsfix but this isn't an excuse for these major problems.. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. Awesome game with one of the best combat system ever. Truly rewarding experience.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 93 IIIIIIIIII====================. It's a bad PC port but with some mods It's easy to fix them, especially the graphic mod. To get the best experience you are pretty much forced to use a controller. After that you will play a game with one of the best designed open worlds, in which the areas are interconnected. Throughout the game it's usually a challenging experience and you will have to learn the movement sets / reaction of enemies and bosses to beat them. While exploring a dark and atmospheric world with it's history and quests hidden in plain side. One of the main issues for new players is probably the backtracking at the beginning of the game, which will only be solved in mid game. Besides that the only possible disappointment is the area where they rushed the development with a corresponding boss fight.. ds1 is probably the champion in the ds series considering both the challenge and the originality in creativity. ds series in general is probably the best action rpg combination and what makes it even more compelling are the dark characters, stories, enemies and atmosphere in general. although game mechanics slightly improved during the series, there are a number of differences that are in favor of ds1, as for example the limit of weapons/rings in use (which makes the game more difficult) and the lack of the vigor stat, which makes xp harder to find and levelling up not so easy. In addition the game map is the most intelligent in the series as it is a well 3d constructed world, and the game can purely be considered as open world (in contradiction with the rest of the series especially ds 3 where the game became more linear). Open world game-play provides more tactical options and overall makes the game more fun. ds1 is probably the top of the top action/rpg ds game series. the remastered version is highly recommended. Dark Souls is a game to be considered a masterpiece unquestionably. It's atmosphere, built on evocative visuals and mesmerizing sound design, magically keeps you deeply submerged into the strange, somber world filled with mysteries so ancient they've become irreparably lost - even to themselves, in case of it's memorable characters. The story, hidden in plain sight within obscure remnants that serve as your gear, is written with broad strokes and with no intention to give players answers - but with one to invoke some interesting questions. And, of course, the jewel in the crown - the gameplay that came to define a whole sub-genre and redefine what we expect of some fundamental aspects of a video game. It's slick, and deep, and satisfying in it's cruelty, and after you've defeated another boss it makes you feel the wave of something you'll struggle to find elsewhere. But you'll be looking, because, given some time, you'll fell in love with it. The way it influences the industry on it's own makes Dark Souls something to be talked about for generations of gamers to come - but it does not redeem fully the game's lack of polish in the later parts, so there's a 9 out of 10.. Dark Souls pioneered and defined a genre of action RPG that future generations of game developers, apart from the very makers themselves, have continued to fail to emulate and surpass. It's hard not to love Dark Souls. The game presents itself as difficult to add a degree of realism, but also stays within reason by offering mechanics that allow you to exhibit your skill and mastery of the game (or lack thereof, hehe). The vast arsenal of weapons and builds you can create allows you to play however you wish (although ranged, my favourite type of gameplay in video games, is severely clunky and underwhelming). The maps are vast and exotic, and the central hub with each region branching out and intertwining is simply a masterpiece in world design. No two areas are the same, meaning there's always tons to explore. Unlike other games, even if collecting items may seem mundane at times and even unnecessary, the abundance of secret passages and areas off the beaten path urges you to explore every nook and cranny just to see what is there. The game is incredibly lengthy and definitely gives you insane bang for your buck. It also came with one of the best PvP systems in history: invasions. Dark Souls (and its sequels) deserves every bit of praise and hype that it gets. FromSoftware will be forever famous, and they have genuinely earned their place.. This is one of my favorite games and the first game in the ""Souls"" series, I liked this game for its complexity, although I was stuck on Nito the Lord of the Graves and the Iron Golem, the rest went from 1 to 3 attempts. The game also has a couple of very dark and heavy locations(but you will find them yourself). And yet, I really do not advise you to play the game on the keyboard and mouse, I myself started as well, but it was very difficult for me, having moved to the gamepad, I began to play much better.. very very very terrible port to PC and very disappointing... you must download DSfix if u wish to play the game... FPS is capped and no input mapping you must download mod for it... overall awful unplayable port and poorly optimized if it was even optimized at all after playing dark souls 3 I wanted to play the 2nd one it didn't work at all so I tried the first one and its even worse **** just sad. Master Piece !!! Great game engine , challenge always the gravity, every fighting is memorable . Excellent Map design, amazing when you find the shortcuts and how each areas are linked. Amazing story telling. 10/10 , should not miss this game. DSfix helps to improve graphics a lot, but still has a frame rate drop in the Blighttown.. My final dark souls review, this game is great on pc because it was mod potential. Best consoles to play on: PlayStation 3 Xbox One X Switch Pc. Hard? yes. Fair? barely. Obscure? hell yeah. God tier level design? You have got to be kidding me. It does have nice moments and it envigorated the RPG genre. A lot (and I mean vast majority) is derivative of Demon's Souls though, so I guess credit is misplaced. It is still a worth experiencing, especially the first ""half"" until getting the lord vessel.. Definitely the best game in Dark Souls series (and the hardest!). The atmosphere and mystery was unmatched by later games. It **** that it ran only in 30 FPS though.. One of the best rpg and dark fantasy game with big world where every new location different from previous - so many characters and so many storylines... Creaters of this game is geniuses. This applies to all chapters of ds.. Masterpiece. Would be a 10/10 if not for some porting and technical issues.. Although there are numerous problems with the pc port of Dark Souls, they are easily alleviated with dsfix. Dark souls still has the best world design in the series 8 years later. Sadly though the lock of rolling to 4 directions does make the combat feel rough around the edges. As well, the run back to a certain boss being quite absurd, and Lost Izalith being unfinished. The game is still host to some of the most iconic boss fights in history though and proved that there still was a commercial interest in difficult games. It is most definitely one of if not the most important game in the last decade.. Its the first souls game I played and its one of the best games I have ever played. Combat is amazing, bosses as well. You wont forget anything from this game. You need some tools for pc to make it playable but after that its really an exprience everyone should go through.. My best game of all time. Created a genre, and defined a generation needed dsfix though. I'm not gonna say much because I talk about it so much but i love dark souls it's my favorite game of all time. I'm a huge fan of the artworks that's why i played this game. But it turned out as a nightmare. Not because of the difficulty (ok maybe a little) it's more the fact that this game is not that friendly to new players like the second or the third (which I played multiple times). Also the fact that you can't travel around, till the half game is ""over"" is really annoying.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Outstanding atmosphere, mechanics and overall gameplay. Very hard on the beginning, but after grinding very enjoyable :) Best in the trilogy :). This game is SO difficult. Its really tough to beat guys. You're going to lose a whole lot. Its so good guys. You're seriously going to lose a bunch. It really is a tough game this one. yeah. Man this game is really good because its hard, and because you die in it. Yeah, its really good. Its hard. Its a hard video game. (As long as you have DS Fix and don't plan on having your multiplayer features function properly, this is probably the best port of the game. Also, the game isn't that hard, Jesus Christ guys). all dark souls games dark souls 2 and dark souls 3 shows this gane far better and have complex map design others dont have es dark souls 2 lineer like game and start to end like game dark souls 3. pc score is not shows enough it was better than anything else execpt skyrim maybe. for many better than skyrim bcosue its more deep and you can be chracter you want. pc port was issues but with easy mod it was better than consoles.. dark souls 1 very outdated game mechanics and copy paste level designe, stupid key mapping for keyboard and mouse menu is unfriendly unplayable. Combat might seem janky at first but eventually comes to feel extremely satisfying. The plot is great to me despite some peoples claims that the game doesn't even have a plot and all of the lore written in the world is great, though it isn't told to you, you have to read and observe the world to uncover it. Almost all of the characters are great and the side quests are really good but the way fromsoft does them is kind of stupid. A lot of them require you to look up what to do or spend a crazy amount of time exploring trying to figure it out. There are moments in this game that stand out to me as some of the best moments in all of gaming. It definitely has flaws. Certain enemies, bosses and areas are lacking, especially in Izalith. But despite them it is still one of my favorite games of all time. The way that the world is built, along with certain items and unpatched skips makes it the most replayable action rpg I can think of.. lol so many salty people saying its hard its not hard just get the zweihander and its easy also if you didnt know your supposed to play with a controller. This game is pure phantasy at its best (66h first walkthrough). On the first look this game looks like garbage, it is unplayable with keyboard and mice, and it is hardcore difficult. However, when you haven’t given up after 2-60 min and have switched to a Xbox 360 controller then this game begins to look completely different. Positive: - atmosphere is really good (sometimes dangerous, sometimes lonely; did I mention bonefires?) - one of the best level designs (nonlinear, world is interconnected) - mostly not unfair, you need to be careful or you die - complex world, story, and class system - very good combat experience - you need to think outside of the box - very rewardfull when you solve a difficult challenge or puzzle - you are not rewarded every 30 seconds (the opposite still may be the case for stupidity/overestimation) - 4k resolution compatible, fog looks ok Negative: - 30 FPS - outdated graphics, do we have year 2000 again? (hmm, it was a good year) - some decisions can not be understood or known without a guide. This game has changed my video game preference. Just 10/10. Perfect level design, lore, music. Sif.. Prepare to cry.... Dark Souls punishes you for not knowing things you have no way of knowing yet. Punishment is performed by excessively wasting your time. Things that you have no way of knowing yet but will punish you come in many variants: - walking in the wrong direction (wrong-level areas, missing a checkpoint (which are sometimes hidden)) - traps and ambushes along the way - spending exp/souls on bad stats or weapons - basic rules of combat (invincibility frames, parrying, invasions, armour usefulness, enemy turn speed, some hitboxes) - behaviour of never before encountered enemies - enemy weaknesses - strategies that feel like they shouldn't be this effective in the first place - which enemies to better run past You'll get punished for not knowing this by either: - having to redo the last couple of minutes (this you will spend most of your time on) - wasting hours being in an area you have no business being in - having a weak character for the rest of the game - getting angry for having no way of having knowledge in advance how to circumvent the punishment - wondering if the designers of the game are actually trying to make your life worse - doubting if trying again is worth your time in the first place To fill the knowledge gaps needed to succeed you either use trial and error or one of the numerous guides which make most parts of the game easy and which most players seem to use. A big portion of the fun of exploration is destroyed by using guides but there is no fun in unfairly getting punished either so you have to pick your poison. In retrospect I regret not using a guide more willingly because it seems like a requirement to have insider knowledge about some aspects of the game (i.e. finding a certain door). If you look stuff up though then you miss out on probably the best part of the game which is the atmosphere of maneuvering through an unknown, grand and hostile world. Indeed the game world doesn't want the player to succeed which is surprisingly an interesting concept. It enforces a narrative of the player progressing against all odds by beating monstrous bosses and enduring senseless hardships by strength of will. This is funnily enough the beauty of Dark Souls. You will encounter a lot of reviews praising its difficulty from players who were captivated by this narrative and somehow didn't mind all those hours wasted by getting unfairly punished. But if you don't need a self-esteem boost or get one by enduring hardships and value your time then I can not recommend this game to you. Don't let your judgement be clouded by people telling you, you are bad for quitting. They might just be justifying having endured the punishments themselves. Most will quit this game and most will do so for good reasons.. An amazing experience. At first it seems very basic but this game's mechanics and lore are as deep as you're willing to find out.. Favorite game of last 6 years. This game reminded everyone what real video games can be like.. Background: Before starting dark souls, what my background on video games was. I had played darksiders, both 1st and 2nd and I loved them. I had played dota 2 which after putting **** of hours in I rediscovered my love for darksiders franchise. I was always into fantasy world things and these two games really helped me satisfy my hunger. But after getting almost everything of those games I was searching for new one and came across tomb raider. Another solid game but was shorter than I expected, with not so much of replayability. Then after doing a lot of research, I decided to give dark souls a chance, to see what all the fuss is about. And what I experienced changed my perspective of looking at a video game and I am glad to say, in a good way. Early Experience: I spent more than half an hour at character creation. And not for tweaking character body and facials but for choosing a class. It may sound dumb for experienced players who had already seen loads of games with character creation but it was a new experience for me. I wasted another half an hour after coming to firelink shrine trying to access area I can’t. Once I found out about the actual-intended area, I was stunned by the fact that even low tier enemies can kill you easily if ","""dark souls"" is one of the most important videogames in history . the game is set in a high-fantasy open map with large interconnected areas . i tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved ."
"1,183.The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth +","The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ on Switch isn't just a brilliant port - it's arguably the best way to enjoy a modern roguelike classic.. Without a doubt, The Binding of Isaac is the most varied, addictive dungeon-crawler ever made. As the most definitive version, Afterbirth+ is perfect both as a portable game for quick runs and as a docked game for lengthy plays. A must-have for Switch owners.. The greatest roguelike of all time remains an incredibly fun and addictive game for those just picking it up and for those who have been playing for over a decade. Classic dungeon-crawling gameplay coupled with hundreds of items, bosses, and rooms with Edmund McMillen's hilarious style and genius game design make for a true indie masterpiece.. The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ is a perfect fit for the Switch, and barring some framerate problems in local multiplayer, is arguably the best way to play this modern classic.. I think the game is supremely enjoyable, but it’s not for everybody. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to travel through Mom’s Scarred Womb and destroy what appears to be a giant fetus before taking on Satan. Toodles!. Too weird and repellent for a mainstream audience, too brilliant for any serious gamer to ignore, The Binding of Isaac has found a surprisingly natural home on Switch. It’s ideal for short bursts and longer sessions of handheld play, and the sort of title that only gets richer and more interesting the more hours and effort you put in. Edward McMillen’s cult classic isn’t for everyone, but if it’s for you there’s no better way to play it.. The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ is a perfect match for the new Nintendo Switch. Is easy to grasp and its pace suits perfectly the Switch portability. With hundreds of weapones, enemies, mysteries and rooms to explore... you got plenty to sink teeth into.. The points that makes the game special are the endless ways to reinvent it and the many forms to take a walk on your own path of chaos. This Nintendo Switch Version is a good way to upgrade ""the Binding of Isaac Experience"" which brought us Edmund Mcmillen 6 years ago. Perfect for those who never played it or who just simply want to have fun anywhere.. In my opinion this is the best example of a roguelike, every should tried, it’s true it’s a little hard but with enough practice anyone can enjoy it. This game has a lot of potential, replayability, content and challenge. But the RNG really can make everything seems unfun and unfair. I don't mind the challenge, but it really **** to feel that you die just because the game threw something insanely hard at you several times in a row. RNG is supposed to make the game fun, not feeling unfair. This could have clearly been balanced more than this because at some point it's just lottery. And you don't want to spend 40 minutes on a run to actually die in a inevitable way because of the RNG. This just discourage people. So since a game is supposed to be fun, I'll give 7 because it could be much more fun. A lot of time I'm like ''hey I wanna play TBOI'' et then 10 minutes later I might be just disgusted by the unfairness of the game. In brief, McMillan can make brillant games but he clearly lacks the dimension of the learning curve.. I don't like : the graphism, the history, the charcters gameplay is fine, game is very difficult in fact not for me. I purchased my Switch in April after lining up outside a Best Buy to get my hands on a limited resupply and was excited to finally play the new Zelda game. In the store, the salesperson upsold me on Bomberman and Binding of Isaac because I figured I wanted something else to play after Zelda. Once I booted up Isaac, I was intrigued by the intro story. I enjoy rogue-likes and thought the theme on Isaac would be interesting. After about 20 minutes of play and 1.5 runs, I had no desire to play further. I have this $40 game sitting on my shelf, collecting dust, because the gameplay just wasn't captivating. I dislike that there is no guidance on what various items do and wish there were more story than the short intro. It would be nice if the story was driven by successfully completing runs instead of simply unlocking new 'stuff'. I say 'stuff' because there's no ostensible context for the unlockables -- then again, I may be missing something after only a tiny amount of play. The most excruciating part about Isaac is the button-mashing. Admittedly, this probably wouldn't bother me as much on a PC (Steam) but it gets very annoying and tiring on the Switch controls. Halfway into my second run, I said ""screw this"" and just let the baddies kill me because I got tired of mashing the same buttons repeatedly. I then promptly turned the game off and put it away. I will be reselling the game at price because I just have no interest to play it again. The version I purchased came with a booklet and stickers, which I understand people are interested in. I know there is a fanbase for this game but it just wasn't for me.","classic dungeon-crawling gameplay coupled with hundreds of items, bosses, and rooms with Edmund McMillen's hilarious style and genius game design . barring some framerate problems in local multiplayer, is arguably best way to play this modern classic ."
"1,184.Tunic","The characters and graphics are so cute! The art style is amazing! If you like hard puzzles and like playing games that dont explain what you have to do, this is the game for you! The puzzles are very creative and some are really hard! You need to pay a lot of attention to discover what to do. You can also translate the language, which looks really nice and hard to do ( I didn't translate it ). It's an amazing indie game! An amazing experience!. This is basically Zelda + The Outer Wilds. It's an incredible knowledge-gated game with great explorations and puzzles. Other than the mediocre combat (which isn't the focus of the game), everything is so exceptionally unique.. Played on Steam Deck. I wanted to play TUNIC for so long, but it was years before I finally decided to buy it, guess all the delays made me lost interest. The thing is,now I have finally played it and was able to finish it (not 100%,got first ending) and I have to say even when the game is good, I was kind of dissapointed. The game is beautiful, the sense of discovery and exploration is very fun at least until the second half of the game, but that s pretty much it, combat and movement are kinda just okay, a little clunky for my liking, bosses arent that great neither tbh, and the game s also quite short of content. Hate to say this after years of waiting for the game, but unfortunately, this one is overrated IMO. 7.5 at best. Not Mediocre by all means, just an okay good game.. Tunic, a game where you play as a little fox in a big world. You have woken up in this mysterious world that is completely unknown to you and full of secrets. The world makes you impulsively explore the world with many mysteries to uncover throughout your adventure through a land of lost legends, ancient power, and ferocious monsters while collecting powerful items to aid you in this massive adventure that will keep you in the game for a long time with more secrets to uncover as you **** are a little fox lost in a big world unknown to you, stranded in this land beknownst to you. With only your curiosity to explore this free world, defeating powerful enemies to learn the secrets to being a powerful **** game has not many mechanics to learn in the start and teaches you new abilities throughout the game, making it more enjoyable and exciting with the new mechanics learnt to be able to defeat more enemies. The game has an instruction booklet built in, which you find the pages throughout the game teaching you about secrets, enemies, lore, controls, and the game itself as well as giving it the feel of an old Nintendo game with the manuals.Tunic is a massive adventure with many secrets to uncover throughout or when you finish the game, adding more mystery and depth to the game. The game is very lengthy, keeping you in for a while with an average of 12 hours to play normally with 21 hours to play the game to complete with all of the secrets hidden within the game (HLTB). Starting from being lost on a little island to fighting massive bosses, this game has many secrets to keep you puzzled throughout. The game can be compared to zelda due to its gameplay, setting and camera controls as you explore a unknown fantasy land and find ancient powers.Tunic is a massive game to explore; even replaying the game, you will still find secrets that were hidden in plain sight. The story, once played, becomes a bit predictable but takes a while to learn and more secrets to discover each time, and will leave you with an unforgettable **** game is recommended to play on a controller as there aren’t many controls to learn, and it’s easier to learn on a controller, as well as you experience much more of the game with controller features such as rumble. The game is a bit more complex to play on a keyboard and mouse in my experience, with the mouse not being used throughout the **** game comes at a pricey £24.99 for the entire experience, with no DLCs or in-game purchases for this game. With that high of a price, you expect it to be a well-designed game with a great storyline... And you'd be correct! This game is great quality, especially for an indie game with finely tuned graphics, perfect for the little fox as well as great sound design and an in-depth story with many mysteries to keep you deeply interested in this game for many hours. I think this is a great cost for this game and is well worth the **** a dreamy, isometric world with amazing VFX and attention to detail, the graphics look great. The camera’s view adds to the effect, showing how small you are compared to the massive world to explore and the size of the massive ancient powers and structures compared to you, truly giving the feeling that you are a little fox. The game’s graphics are going for a mix of retro games with present graphics, making the world look dreamy and fitting for the little fox on an adventure. The dreamy graphics make you want to explore the world more, with different styles of islands, it makes you want to see the entire world. The game’s graphics have a magical twist with the VFX, making the world look surreal and showing the player there are massive ancient powers that lurk underneath and many mysteries to **** sound effects are incredible, making the game a reality. The sound inside the game shows the true ancient powers between the little fox and the entire world. The sound design makes you feel like you are inside the game as well as gives guidance and hints to where you are and how to continue in the story, as well as warning if enemies are near or any **** game makes you feel like you’re in a dreamy but mysterious atmosphere with many secrets to uncover and to search for. The atmosphere also really pushes the fact that you’re a small fox in a massive world to explore that you are lost in with the language unknown to you while the world’s graphics and sound feel magical and unknown to you.However, Tunic is a massive game worked on by an indie developer. The game is very polished and gives the player a feeling of old retro games with the instruction manual and retro graphics mixed in a way making it incredibly appealing to the eye. With a long game to play through and many hours to keep you invested in this game, many mysteries to uncover, and a massive world to explore, I rate this game a 9/10 as its game and price didn’t disappoint but there is not much replayability after you have completed the game.. a true masterpiece, not only an innovative souls-type gameplay combined with puzzles, the devs went further and created a deep work with insane secrets. BIG W for this game I really enjoyed myself in like 11 hours. The manual was so fun to me. It let me discover the gameplay. For me is definitely 10/10 but for those guy who doesnt has game sense it kind difficult.. Has a magic to it that few games have anymore. Truly embraces not teaching the player and letting them learn things for themselves. Both to great effect and in certain circumstances, can be incredibly rewarding. An awesome time that I think anybody can enjoy.. Tunic is a masterpiece zeldalike and soulslike game that achieved a fair balance. Beautiful art style and an ambiguous world that makes you hungry to know more about it.. First 70% of game was fun, but then starting from burial grounds the game becomes annoying, not difficult in interesting way, just annoying. I felt very disappointed that they take away your upgrades, making all your time spent on leveling up pointless. All enemies 2 shot you forcing to replay tedious parts. Arena at the end of cathedral pissed me off, they just spam you with large groups of enemies, and if some enemies got lucky to hit you twice you have to replay all the waves from the beginning. I dropped the game. Very good exploring aspect but the combat is not that good. The game can't stand to it's difficulty because the mechanics in the combat don't work that well. I would give it a try if you like exploring, but you will find yourself not knowing what to do next, very often.. This game was very VERY Impressive. This game was so amazing that its now my favorite game of all time. this game with a mix of great combat and intense puzzle solving goes to make an amazing masterpiece and i will defend that forever. the way the story is all connected with the puzzles and gameplay makes this game 100x better than it already was and if i was to chose to play a game again for the first time, it would be this. This is one of the best and worst games I have played and for good reasons. Tunic is both very experimental and at the same time very traditional. The game design is very innovative and captures how video games used to be experienced. The old game was filled with obscure puzzles, unfair level design, and even a foreign language, which resembled the old Japanese game in which nobody understood what going on. Player has to scratch their heads to look for the game manual for hints and walkthroughs. In Tunic, the game manual is both a tool for hints and a puzzle to be solved. However, after so many years of gaming experience, I believe game designs are generally going in the correct direction, how the old game used to be experienced was a product of this time and would not completely click in modern times. Additionally, there are many game design choices I cannot possibly agree on, for instance, the maximum health-reducing enemy and even in the mid-game the game reset all player upgrades which basically ended the previous gameplay investment meaningless. The hidden puzzles are way to time-consuming than they needed to be, they are mostly not difficult to figure out but very time-consuming to map out the correct code. One single error can cost a player 30 minutes to 1 hour. Overall, it is a unique experience in the modern age, everyone should give it a try to see if they like it or not, especially I would those who have summer vacation to burn. 7/10 good game with serious flaws.. I have played through the game twice and both times I was awestruck by the beauty and craftsmanship that went into the audio and visual design. It's truly a marvellous gaming experience. On the surface it's a charming homage to Zelda but as you get into it, you realize the creators had something much grander in mind. It is relentlessly difficult but players are rewarded for committing to its mechanics. I'm still unsure how deep into the layers and layers of puzzles I made it but there is a lot to discover in Tunic's curious little world.. Game has a good feel at the start but has made several bosses much too difficult. Some of the late game secret puzzles do not respect the player’s time, or they expect you to simply look up the answer. The game has done many things right with an interesting way of slowly giving you information and a satisfying levelling system, however pairing that with “souls-like” bosses in the late game is extremely annoying.. good atmosphere great songs but its little boring and first 1 and 2 hour gameplay is very uncomfortable but its look like little zelda ı love that. Finished the a ending of the game but now scratching my head trynna figure our the golden path puzzle. Just as soon as I thought the hard part was over, another one came and crashed me xD.. Clunky, miserable gameplay renders Tunic a complete slog despite its gorgeous music and graphics. Furthermore, the mysterious nature of the title doesn't feel like another layer to enjoy on top of an already satisfying experience. On the contrary, it seems as though the developers knew Tunic wasn't any fun so they smothered it in esoteric **** to fool people into thinking that the game is deeper than it actually is. Do not play if you cherish your free time.. It is an interesting game with multiple little riddles to find. All the systems are kind of generic and there are very few new and interesting ideas. Moreover, recently I have watched a developer's speech on GDC that goes deep into the game content and, truth to be told, I did not get it while playing. I mean that if you are interested in solving riddles and searching for every small detail then this game is must played, but I am not such kind of a person to spend on a such small game too much time.. I loved all the puzzles in this game. The developers have really put a lot of thought into making a fascinating game.. Just imagine Links awakening but cryptic, Thats tunic. This game is amazing and is insanely underrated. This game has amazing gameplay and stunning world design, and the cryptic messages keep you thinking about the game after you have finished it. I would recommend playing tunic with no prior knowledge.. Classic Zelda but BETTER at times. first of all being a cute fox is amazing, and you have actual great dungeons. map design and genuine secrets in a dark fair and tough awesome world. The secrets are amazing and figuring out the puzzles with the exploration and putting the manual together is so clever. there is an amzing moment in this game when you figure out the mountain puzzle and more when you just go big brain.Insanely clever, charming, satisfying and cute/ fun. The bosses/ tough sould elements are just right balenced to make learning and beating it satisfying and fun. so many great abilities and moments without having to have traditionaldialogue. Game is an absolute treat! Follow the golden path.. this is one of the most underrated games ever . a great gameplay with a stunning world design . but i wish it had more bosses and a better story telling. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolutely fantastic game with a great looking world. Loved finding secrets hiding around every corner and in plain sight. The only issue would be the combat, as its not up to par with the rest of game, but everything else is so well done. Constructing the manual and learning along with finding those pages was one of the most satisfying things I have experienced in a game since The Witness or Fez.. Perfect score for this game, it deserves it. I love this genre but it was so much better in so many aspects with this little fox. Simple but beautiful. Secrets was my favourite part with the game. I only got a little bit disappointed that the game did not translate the foreign text on its own as you progress. I guess I feel too old to invest so much time just to transcribe the text. Maybe if there were more hints about the tunic language I would try to translate myself. Got me addicted to stay awake till morning during Christmas. Deserves praise.. Awesome game. I like this kind of stuff so I’m a bit of a quarter or more of the way through and happy with it so far. Its got a hyper light drifter vibe to it. If you like hyper light drifter and deaths door this is definitely worth picking up. I think the graphics on switch and steam is definitely gonna be better than switch lite.. To begin with the conclusion, I feel that if this game is hyped as the annual independent game, it is somewhat overrated. After playing for a few hours, defeating the first BOSS and ringing the bell in the western region, I compared it with video walkthroughs, and the progress seems to be around 1/5 to 1/4.Looking at the achievement completion rates:- ""One Stick"" achievement for real players (97.2%)- ""A Sword!"" achievement for starting players (82.8%)- ""Ring the Bell in the West"" achievement for players just out of the novice stage (54.2%),the numbers are frightening. It means that almost half of the players who spent money gave up the game without even passing the first BOSS.Some call this game ""Hulda,"" and while it does have some elements reminiscent of Zelda, if you've played the early top-down Zelda, you won't think so. The game lacks the sandbox puzzle-solving aspect, but it borrows elements from Dark Souls:1. ""Bonfire"" where you can sit, replenishing health potions while monsters respawn.2. Complex passages with various shortcuts and the overflow of ""soul essence"" on the screen.3. High-difficulty BOSS fights (varies from person to person).4. Low or high-difficulty small enemies (depending on the author's choices).5. Death burden (not everything is lost).6. Weak guidance + obscure storytelling.7. Familiar stamina bar **** theory, being like Dark Souls shouldn't be a bad thing, so why do I find it not enjoyable, or why did almost half of the players give up before even passing the first BOSS? I checked, and in Dark Souls 3, only 66.3% of players defeated ""Pontiff Sulyvahn.""I thought about it, and here are a few points:1. Difficulty relying on overwhelming enemies; the three-person laser floating cannon is memorable. Once activated, if not dealt with at the beginning, there are almost no remedies once the three separate.2. No parkour; after death, you can only systematically clear enemies. If you dare to parkour, you'll attract a lot of attention.3. The instruction manual system drags down the overall completion rate of the game. Some basic game design intentionally hides information, causing players to get stuck. - I'm not sure how many people, without looking at a walkthrough, know that the game has skill points and teleportation. Teleportation is granted after ringing the bell, but in reality, you can teleport early on. There's no button prompt when you stand on it, and I initially thought there was nothing there, and later I found out you have to press it for 3 seconds. If you wanted players not to teleport at the beginning, you could have disabled it before giving the explanation. Allowing teleportation but deliberately not notifying players is a questionable design. - Another more serious issue that can cause many players to get stuck is the author subtly telling you how to allocate skill points. The game can obtain skill point items early on, but the instructions for it are vague. The items in the system menu are all labeled as ""???"" and can only be used at the bonfire. There is no clear error message for using them elsewhere. The achievement for allocating points for the first time is only 58.9%, and the first BOSS has a pass rate of only 54.2%. If these fundamental and non-narrative features are hidden, players might have progressed if these were more transparent.4. Lack of depth in the combat system; the monsters' attack patterns are very simple, and our attacks are also straightforward. If it's one-on-one, it's easy, but in a group, due to the somewhat stiff character movements, it becomes chaotic. Zelda is simple too, but the maze puzzles are interesting. Here, it seems the focus is on appreciating Dark Souls-style map **** mid-to-late game may improve, but based on my experience here, I don't plan to continue.-Good- (about 1/4 progress):- Beautiful low-polygon art style- Manual design (referring to the UI part)- Well-executed soulful map design-Bad- (about 1/4 progress):- Manual design (part causing getting stuck)- Mediocre music- Similar to Zelda but lacks puzzle-solving- More challenging (annoying) combat experience than Dark Souls- Lack of depth in the combat system, stiff character controls. The best puzzle game I've ever played. From the artstyle to the care and experience, truly wonderful. Cannot recommend it enough.. nice, neat and tidy. Until I found out once you save, all hostile npc refreshed. Like BLACK SOUL. brilliant. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I wish there could be more games like this. Engine is great. It was fun from start to finish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I can say this game is my favorite from the last 5 years and will remain being that for a while. This game knows how to make you feel what others didn't even aproach to.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As the game is entirely in Spanish, you can't understand anything, and that's the best part. Using visual icons and an intuitive system, the game is built around the joy of discovering what everything does. I started playing Tunic just to pass the time, but suddenly, I found myself curious about everything, embarking on a quest to find the guide pages and unlock every feature. I highly recommend this game, not because of its complex plot (although that's quite a trip) but for the exploration and the amount of fun you'll have on the mysteries, unlocking weapons, and translating the guide pages. I know this game is compared to Zelda Link's Awakening, but I've never played that one, so this review is **** game is so good! I was going to play it expecting just another indie game, but quickly found out that there is so much to explore and it is done in such a way that I was amazed and feeling like a kid again. Things like ""wouldn't it be awesome to have a secret passage behind the waterfall"" and there it is, the secret passage!Also, the pages and the ""not holding your hand"" are a nice way to escape the standard ""go here and do a quest"" cliché.Finally, the accessibility options are perfect and even better because they don't affect the trophies! I was afraid of turning ON the option to not have stamina, but as soon as I turned it ON, the game was even more perfect for me.I'm planning on buying on Playstation to do a platinum!. Unfortunately disappointed. It starts with controls and ends with guiding through the maps. In addition I personally think the puzzles all related to the manual are making things unnecessarily difficult. The nice details get lost in basics that just dont feel right. I had it very often, that I needed to check seconds sources to check what to do next. A clear path was missing for me. Controls during combats in my eyes feel way too slow and clumsy. Sometimes it feels like things are just not reacting / working. All in all a very good try but price and basic gameplay do not match in the end. Its one of the rare games I stopped playing after a while because it wasnt fun anymore. Better basic gameplay, controls and a clear path would have made this game way better instead of adding all this puzzles in the manual. Its like the clear concept got lost at a certain point.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. An almost perfect game that kept me glued until I finished it. The only downside is that a few secrets are unreasonably difficult and would have benefitted from a few more hints dispersed across the world. This includes the language translation that felt a bit too much to handle, even with pen and paper and patience. It feels like dropping a few more hints would have made the experience more accessible without falling in the temptation of looking online, and without any detriment to the overall experience.. I love this game I have great memories of the first RPG games I played with a new look and charming animation and concept with an inmersive story but that's not to say it's an easy game I loved it.. 2D Zelda + Dark Souls with lovely graphics and a lot of soul and creativity. My only gripe is the end boss and in general the last section. Compared to the rest of the game it was a tad too difficult and obsure.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great tribute to Zelda and the indie industry in general, as well as a story of effort and determination according to its developer and creative mind.. I really love this game, the music, the art design and levels are all beautiful and it lulls me into a meditative state when I play it. Genuinely don't know why this is getting review bombed some people who ar3e giving this a 1/10 are being delusional. I give it a 10 to counteract the 0s and 1s, in reality this game is more like an 8.5-9.. I am thankfull that this game allowed me to experience the FEZ vibe of understanding a cryptic language in a mysterious world. However, I didn't enjoy any other aspect of the game. The zelda like progression is tedious and I had to frequently check the wiki for ordinary paths after minutes of looking for them because of the perspective. There is far too little item and attacks diversity to feel like your character is progressing as an adventurer. The graphics are alright but also very bland. The music is elevator-worthy at it's best. Some plot twist seem to be foreshadowed however there is no plot to twist. Also don't get me started on the dark souls mechanics and difficulty. I clearly don't want to suffer them for the mediocrity of the game after the first 5 hours.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is amazing on so many levels. Already the atmosphere and the music of the game are magnificent. Then the game is constantly tickling the player's curiosity. Indeed, in the game we do not know what to do and how to play. It's a game filled with mystery constantly. For me it's the best indie game I've done, even better than Hollow Knight. MAKE TUNIC, this game is moving Amazing.. Don't really understand the hype, but it's a not too bad. Let's hope Nintendo can show us again some day how it's really done.. Impressive game. Zelda + Dark Souls that is the summary of the game. Maybe the only negative aspect is you can get lost in some points.. Tunic is a combination of the best parts of The Legend of Zelda and Fez. While the game starts off as a standard action adventure Zelda-like game, it becomes something way more grand. The beginning of the game has you go on the standard hero's quest type game, get your sword, activate some towers, find some items and upgrades, and beat some bosses, and collect some keys. Then the game takes a turn, you turn into your ghost form self and must kill the final boss, but all your upgrades have been taken away. You then have to explain the same world you've been exploring except now it the ghost world to get your upgrades back. Once you get them back you can defeat the final boss way easier and beat the game. Sound pretty good, right? But that's not the turn in game that makes it so special. There is a secret in this game called the holy cross that elevates this game to a masterpiece. I won't explain what exactly it is but the secrets hidden underneath the games world that you don't even notice are incredible. The holy cross reminds me of the second half of Fez which is something I didn't think would have been able to be recreated again. For the combat the bosses are very fun and aren't total pushovers and take some effort. Uncovering the mysteries and secrets hidden in the game were an all time high experience in gaming in 2022 and I highly recommend this game to anyone who calls themselves a gamer.. I'm kinda disappointed by this game I wish to have the developer in person to tell him to calm down There's really no need to ""grout"" this unbalanced game with absurdly cryptic riddles This game could have been awesome... but + feeling the 1990 era + structure - movements - useless crazy riddles - battle system - too hard. I was excited to try it out since it was announced, and finally got it via Game Pass, and I thought I'll like this game, but I didn't. Kudos to the solo dev for releasing it and in a good state: runs smoothly, has nice graphics, and good however bland sound. Unfortunately it has game design issues that make it not fun to play. Due to graphics the world doesn't give you right cues about possible paths. Sure there should be secret paths, but in general main paths should be easy to recognise. Next problem is the world layout feels chaotic, disorientating and doesn't flow. Finally controls and combat feels sluggish and isn't fun, and the stamina makes it even more tedious. A similar Zelda inspired game with way way better combat and design in general was HOB which I recommend over this one.. Tunic is an adorably charming take on popular formulas with its own clever twists. While harkening back to old-school Zelda-style progression and Souls-like combat, Tunic also does quite a bit to distinguish itself from the inspirations it proudly wears on its sleeve. There includes a wonderfully mysterious and beautifully drawn in-game manual, for the player to collect pages of throughout their journey (written almost entirely in a fictional language, that is actually translatable if you have the time). From scattered booklet pieces, the player will slowly gain info on everything from controls and mechanics, to story, to maps, goals, puzzles, and tons of secrets that will all help you on your way. Its seemingly 4th wall-breaking inclusion actually justifies itself extremely well, and never overstays its welcome despite how much you'll be using it. You'll find yourself bouncing back and forth between the surprisingly large open-labyrinthian levels, and the game manual, throughout its entire runtime - as its contents serve not as a crutch, but as a puzzle to figure out all on its own. Every inch of every page seems to allude to something for the player to discover. The game is a challenge, and so is its combat. You will face a wide variety of locations, enemies, and bosses, and it will not hold your hand on anything - but it does so with a sense of intent and purpose. Tunic usually gives players just enough info to get by, with just a little expectation that you're the one who needs to ""figure it out"" on your own. And I found that kind of design philosophy both motivating, and endlessly captivating. Tunic is a game where even simple mechanics and weapons are learned through interpreting clues, so if in some instances one misses a piece of crucial info (either within the world or in the manual), it's possible they can find themselves stuck for a bit. But at the same time, it never feels like it's the game's fault - and usually with just a bit more patience, skill, exploration, or thinking, one can logic their way into a path forward (or possibly somewhere else). Tunic is one of the most interesting, charming, and fun games I've played in a long time, and I'm happy that it exists.. I want to give this a higher score, but its hard to do so. Its an interesting game though, a mix of Souls, Zelda, and Metroidvania. The Souls influence is present, but quite light. In an era where people associate difficulty with Souls games, I can see why people may think so. But there isn't much souls dna here apart from the fact that it is mildly above average difficulty. Dying has very little consequence though, unlike Souls. The combat is largely Zelda/Metroidvania, not Souls. One thing that is quite nice is the exploration and level design. However... it is also a bit disappointing. The game gives some degree of nonlinearity, but since certain levels require certain items, there is also a set way to tackle almost every part of the game. The level design is okay, but rarely mind blowing, and also its easy to not be able to see where you have to go simply from the perspective. Very annoying. Checkpoints are somewhat rare, which is nice, but the overall levels are small, and keep this from feeling like a grand adventure. I get it though, its an indie game. Ultimately the only thing that makes this game quite cool and unique is the guide book. Its a very cool idea and brave in an era of everyone using game guides and whining about not getting all the info right away.. This game is a beautiful masterpiece of world design and music. There are some issues with difficulty spikes, world progression/ exploration, due to the way the tutorial functions in game but all of these are by design decisions from the developer. Honestly I loved the game because it didn’t spoon feed you directions and made you explore and try out different things in order to progress. This one of my most enjoyable gaming experiences in years, and I felt like a kid again with my snes trying to find all of the secrets hidden around the world.. Literally a mobile game, unplayable with keyboard, disgustingly bad controls, guaranteed waste of time at least 5 hours wandering around figuring out what to do and where to go. Just don't waste your precious time with this crap mobile game.. A mix of two of my favourite games. DarkSouls and Zelda. Looks beautiful, plays wonderful.cpuld not recomme","the game is basically Zelda + The Outer Wilds . it's an incredible knowledge-gated game with great explorations and puzzles . combat and movement are kinda just okay, a little clunky for my liking ."
"1,185.Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","Love this type of game. There are many cons, like the characters, the story, its development, flexibility and achievements. Cons maybe some control issues. I enjoyed Desperados, was happy to find this jewel.. Exhausting .I hate this .The Play style is unique indeed .but no funny at all . felt like I am doing math homework .It is not testing my Patience but wasting my time . The enemy is fool like sitting duck waiting death .Of course I know time on target Tactics .Beside that,I don't think i can learn anything else ,Nothing inspire me .I'm suffering playing this game.. Awesome game! One of the best, if not the best stealth game I've ever played. Instead of controlling one character per mission, you control between 2 to 5. Each character has unique abilities, and you can pre-program actions to be executed when needed. The graphics are beautiful and timeless, the soundtrack and Japanese voice acting are great, and the controls are precise. It's a game that will definitely challenge you: the missions themselves aren't huge, but you'll hardly spend less than 1 hour on each (there are some that took me 3 hours). It took me about 35 hours to finish the campaign, but it was worth it. There's no way not to recommend this one.. I am too young for to have played the commandos games but i imagine they were just as fun as this one back in the day. Story of shadow tactics was really good definitely worth finishing.. This game was good but also very hard for me. Each level took me about 1:30 hours but all those hours were spent in fun.. Shadow Tactics has managed to bring me back to my old days as a commandos fan. It also made me have some serious fun. While doing all this, he also instilled in me little by little the samurai culture. A boon for genre lovers. It is a game that those who are not related or not interested in this genre should take a look at and give it a chance. For full review: ****/@shelyshelly20/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun-bfad4a40c10b. I picked it up years ago and only got round to playing it mid December 2021, having put it off for so long; prompted by the new Standalone Expansion I decided to give it a shot. It was amazing. This game contains some of the most rewarding strategic gameplay that you'll find on today's market. The setting and maps are all beautiful and well crafted, the voice acting (Japanese) is very convincing and immersive, the characters interacting with each other feels very real and doesn't seem forced at all. The characters individually have a plethora of skills that will all need to be utilised in order to get through this game. There is a quite a lot of trial and error but the Quicksave/Quickload functions means you don't need to worry at all about your shortcomings and can aim to a complete stealth attack mission to mission. The story, well, the story leaves something to be desired, it doesn't grip you from the start and you only will show interest around mission 8/9, but you shouldn't play this for the story, you play this for how good the gameplay is. This game does prove that as long as you have a solid fun game mechanically and technically, you don't even need a decent story, and although this isn't often the rule, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is the exception. This is my favourite game of 2021 and I cannot recommend it enough. 9/10 would recommend to anyone to enjoys strategy and stealth games.. My first game of this kind, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was definitely fun and engaging. Every aspect of the game seems really well-designed, from level design and aesthetic design, through the interfaces, music, challenges/achievements, to the rather small but engaging story. Optimal difficulty level in most places as well, which can't have been easy to achieve, with how much you can do with the few tools available to the characters. Still, despite being mostly pleasant and engaging, it wasn't really an unforgettable experience. Maybe need to be a fan of the genre!. This was my first game of this type and i loved it. You can spend many hours replaying all those levels and still find a chalenge.. Very good gameplay: Every step to your goal is like a riddle, how to knock out or avoid the opponents. The graphics is good. The setting in old Japan is very interesting. Just the presentation of the story could be better. I cleared Desperados 3 and turned on Shadow Tactics, which I bought and didn't use before As expected, it's fun. I only take the time to review games I really like. Shadow Tactics is fun, clever, well paced. Love it. The unusually high positive score is well deserved. I only play it for an hour or two at a time and plan on keeping it installed until its finished!. I was lucky to grow up in the golden age of realtime tactic/strategy games. From Battle Bugs, over Dune 2, Warcraft to Command and Conquer and Total Annihilation. However, after the overload of Realtime Strategy games in the late 90s, another subgenre emerged. It wasn't a totally new one as there was one, which is also of my all-time favorites: Syndicate 1 and 2. However, that it remained a niche genre, unfortunately. Then all of a sudden- Commandos- Behind enemy lines, stepped on the stage and I was blown away again. It was tough as nails and all in all with high difficulty, great presentation and setting a very challenging game. What followed where 3 successors, another legendary series called Desperados and Robin Hood of the same type of genre. All were awesome and fun- but had the same issues of the early 2000s- that was the controls which were quite unpolished and wonky. For some reason this genre dies quickly though. So then for the next 10-12 years all what was available were these games on GOG(THANKFULLY!). They aged well but the issue with the controls and graphics on modern displays was really bugging. Then all of a sudden, with a loud BANG, Shadow Tactics emerged. I quickly played the demo and was baffled- the controls are PERFECT, the setting is charming, the sounddesign, music and voice acting are top level. I mean.. what the heck? The gameplay and gamedesign is absolutely smooth. Buttery! Each level begins with an introduction and briefing. Each time I thought... dude, that's impossible- but then you start.. and can't stop. JUST CAN'T STOP! Every time I'm surprised about how that was possible. You carefully watch the scenery, remember what to do, re-read the briefing, fail as there are enemys everywhere, start again, find a tiny movement of your enemy to make use of... and succeed. Hat's off, MIMIMI Games! Ihr seid einfach die besten!. I had great fun playing this game. The levels could be more unique and the story could be better but overall it's a nice game.. Fantastic game. There's been a huge lack of stealth RTS games in recent years, and this has rejuvinated the genre. It obviously has parralels to the Commandos series of games and they've been a heavy influence, but it's also more accessible and open than they were. Contrary to a couple of bad reviews. Shadow Tactics is Commandos with ninjas. That’s a good thing, by the way. Very few games swim in the same genre pool as Shadow Tactics. There was the Commandos series, and the Desperados games, and that’s basically it. So all Shadow Tactics has to do is take the “shepherd 2-5 killers during their sneak-and-murder spree across a bunch of maps” to Edo period Japan to feel fresh and original. This means that there is only one question to ask if you want to know if Shadow Tactics is worth your time: Would you like to play more Commandos, or Desperados? For me the answer was “It’s complicated”. I played Commandos way back when. I liked the gameplay at first: Sneaking across the map littered with guards until you find the one unfortunate soul not covered by his colleagues and murder the bejeesus out of him, then moving on the guy whose back he was watching, and so on, pulling on the thread of the guard sweater until only a frayed collar remains… It’s like a beautiful puzzle that drips blood for every piece you set down. But the difficulty spikes were brutal, and at times the precision and speed with which a kill was only possible took so many tries for me to get right that I got frustrated and finally gave up on Commandos. These frustrating moments and difficulty spikes are in here, too, but Shadow Tactics does just enough to mitigate the frustrations that I stuck it out. The excellent quicksave system is one factor: not only does it remind you how long it’s been since your last save, it automatically rotates three slots so that when you save in a situation you don’t yet know is beyond saving, you can revert to an earlier save. The adding of banter between the characters is helpful, too. The story might be kind of rote and have a giant plot hole at the center of it, but the characters are well fleshed out, for the genre, and the dialogue script as well as the voice work elevate the game quite a bit. And yes, it helps that I sneak around ancient japanese fortresses and abduct the son **** from a Sento instead of traipsing around european battefields and assassinating **** commanders, again. Success in Shadow Tactics relies on split second timing at times. That can only work if the controls of the game are excellent, and luckily, they are: Switching between characters and ordering them to do stuff is effortless. The art is serviceable to good: Clearly legible, beautiful at times, but lacking any true wow moments. The sound is sparse but well done, the music unobtrusive and pleasing. The voice work is, as mentioned, well above average for this type of game. This game is for veterans of the genre with a taste for more, spiced with a bit of variation. Complete newcomers interested in the genre might as well start here: They might still bounce off Shadow Tactics, but in a genre with very few members, this is as forgiving as it gets. TLDR: Shadow Tactics is a great stealth real time tactics game. If that’s your jam, it has you covered.. Great game for tactics fans but has many problems. First of the difficulty. The game feels about as difficult in the first missions as it does in the last. Every map is full of enemies who always cover each others backs, leaving you little room to split them up or attack the one who isn't covered first. It truly offers some great challenges and it's fun to try speed run the levels through with multiple attempts, usually though failing from a simple misstep because you simply can't see everyone's vision range same time, and the way in big towns you're often missing enemies simply because their models hide behind some structure and you have to keep turning the camera around. This game could have easily been 9 or even 10 if they did tweak the enemies to be more visible, and controls were just slightly easier to execute. It has its great moments, but many times you feel stuck because you haven't fully played through the map yet so you don't know all the specific places to click or trigger from range. For someone who is patient and loves tactics based games this could be easily 9, but for me who has little patience for observing the area with magnifying glass to find every fine detail before making 3 steps forward and taking out a single enemy, repeating the process 50 times throughout all map, I don't find it that entertaining. There's not really great enemy variety either. The characters you're allowed to play have some variety to make them unique, but not always, and that's a little shame. Sometimes your character cannot utilize enemy robes and sometimes you can but every single path is blocked by Samurai who's able to see through you. So eventually you'll have to wiggle every single path through with 50 different executions step by step. In later maps it also becomes impossible to progress without using even a single path or it becomes very hard, leaving very little room for improvising. Sometimes you just feel you need to cheese through pulling aggro of individual guards one by one behind a corner for like 5-6 times just to get enough privacy to kill a single guard patrolling path ahead. I've tried collecting all the achievements level by level but I think in mission (rescuing Mugen) 10 I just got bored and never played again because of how frustrating the escape was in that mission while trying to desperately not use those vital weapons to advance faster. This is not a game that you can just chill and have a fun with, not even in Dark Souls fun way where you can progress by playing in your toes. In this game you can't make a single mistake or the entire army knows your location. I didn't really care about story too much but I guess it was serviceable / not bad.. Amazing... Thank You MiMiMi... I Can't Wait to See Your Next Project... Thank You.... Good game play, sometimes not fluent, a good puzzle game, sometimes i got bored.. It's a really good game. Its story is interesting, gameplay is fun. But although everything seems normal, Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun was my favorite game. Look, it's not the best, it's my favorite. It was my favorite game, although all the details seem normal. I was depressed when you ended. It will always be my favorite game.. Even a player who doesn't like strategy could love strategy, this game showed me that Don't say ""I don't like strategy"" just take a look. It's a very cool Stealth-Real time tactics game. I really enjoyed it! 32hrs on record.. perfect game if you want something like commandos . if u are not a fan of commandos doesnt matter definetly check this one out. This stealth RTT game has various amazing merits that are hard to deny -- music, art style, game design and story, etc. I had fun playing the Commandos years before and this game does not just remind me of it but also provides a superb fresh gaming experience.. Shadow Tactics is one of the best real time strategy games. It bribes with a sophisticated games set and a thrilling story. The characters are varied and fit into the setting. The game is highly recommended.. Shadow Tactics would be fun if the camera and controls weren't so not great. It ends up being frustrating. You can hold ctrl to kill and immediately grab an enemy and then drag him to a nearby bush, but if you ctrl click an enemy and ctrl click a bush to drop the body, it just doesn't work. You have to let go of ctrl, or mash the **** out of the mouse button 5 or 6 times before it actually gets the command to drop the body. It's really annoying when I'm being spotted in a bush and all I have to do is drop the body but the game just won't goddamn do it. Another fun thing is that bushes make you invisible, but only sometimes. I have no **** clue why. I can sit in a bush for 5 minutes, not move, have enemies walk past me, all is fine. And then just for some **** reason some random schmuck just immediately spots me out of nowhere. I'd be okay with them finding you during an alarm, but the game actively tells you to jump in a bush to stop a pursuit, so even then it seems bull**** and acts like it's broken. Speaking of attacking and bushes, you'd think the primary method of eliminating enemies would be surprise attacks, but when you whistle them over to a bush and then attack them, sometimes but not always, they'll just lay eyes on you and damage you. I guess they're superman or cyclops, because there's no attack animation or anything for them, they just straight damage you with eye lasers. I've done 5 or 6 levels (of 13), and while I'll say that for the most part it allows you to do things your own way, I've never had such a hard time trying to figure out what exactly the intended route is and what the game wants from me in a lot of situations. It has a bunch of bonus challenges per level, and I guess you don't need to do them all at the same time (Most you can't because it's different entry/exit points) but some of them I just don't get how they could be done. I really like stealth games but this one can be kind of frustrating, and the enemy vision cone is basically larger than yours so you're constantly being seen by enemies off screen. Enemies randomly spotting you in bushes is really annoying when you control 3 or more characters and they all get spread out, so you plant one in a bush for safe keeping and play another character, and then for no good **** reason they get spotted by an enemy. It's horse****. I ended up just save scumming which is not a gameplay style I particularly like.. Best game since comandos. Mandatory to play. High replay value. Everything is great, gameplay, story, characters, music.. It was fine to start with, but as I played on I ran into some annoying things that seem like they could have been identified and remedied by a simple playthrough. The game gets progressively worse and makes progressively less sense. Seemingly bugginess and inconsistencies & nonsensical design get quite annoying. To the point where I uninstalled it half way through.. ilable, and in fact there are challenges set for each mission which will encourage you to try different methods to collect all the badges. Stealth obviously plays a key part, but if y. Glorious resurrection of the long lost genre. Shadow Tactics Blades of the Shogun is everything a Commandos or Desperadoos fan could have asked for. It successfully captures the essence which made those games great & drastically improves it in every way. The levels are gorgeous to look at, the music & the voice over specially the Japanese one is really captivating & immersive which goes with the edo settings perfectly. Gameplay wise it will test your skill & patience. Every level requires you to be really observant of the enemy's behavior as the A.I is smart & merciless. Coming up with genius of a plan for minutes to deal with a situation but ultimately seeing it unfolding as an utter failure when you execute the plan is one of the most agonizing moments in the game. It will happen, it will happen quite regularly but as soon as your carefully constructed plan meets the shiny colored perfection, that agony will turn into irresistible pleasure. Also, the five playable characters, each of them with their own distinctive skillset are full of joys to play with. Their expressive banters during a mission will undoubtedly draw your attention towards them. The characters don't feel mundane but rather actually feel alive where you start to really care for them. In the end, people will always regard Shadow Tactics as the spiritual successor of Commandos/Desperados but in my opinion this game is more than that & it successfully stands on its own. Its interestingly creative world & the charming persona of the protagonists certainly says so.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good foundation but suffers from poor level design. Other than the first two levels, every level is built approximately the same. There is one linear starting path where you can only kill enemies in a specific order. Then you get to decide between two linear paths filled with choke points where you can only kill enemies in one specific order, separated by short linear hallways. The only ""strategy"" in the game is which tool you choose to kill. The whole game becomes finding the enemy you have to kill first, second, third, etc. And it would be fine if there were linear paths, choke points, hallways and threads of enemies that must be killed in one specific order, and it would even be fine if it was just Y path every level... if there were anything else to the game. But there isn't. It just takes away all creativity and well, tactics from the game. It's a puzzle game; the pieces only fit one way.. Awkward controls and bad voice acting made me loose patience with this one quickly.. I used to think my favourite (sub)genre was dead before encountering this gem. I've played many other such games (Commandos, Desperados, Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, Chicago 1930) and this one certainly stands out! Nice plot, great level design, amazing mechanics, diverse characters, tons of other favourable features, it has it all! And speaking of the characters, every situation may be approached in a number of different ways but you'll certainly feel like making use of the unique skills of each and every character on every mission. Unlike Desperados (which I still love, don't get me wrong), where I would have 4 playable characters on a certain mission but would completely ignore 2 of them for the entire mission. This won't be the case on Shadow Tactics. I really can't help but compare it to Commandos and Desperados all the time because obviously that's where it got its inspiration from. But it has taken only the best from all classic games, polished it, and improved further on that with some fresh and unique new mechanics. Oh, and that's not really common for the genre but it actually has quite a good replayability value not only because, as I said, every minor problem (e.g. bunch of enemies) may be approached in a number of ways, but also because on some missions you may progress by completing either of two sub-goals within the mission. So choosing for the other one while replaying it will introduce a completely new challenge. If you like the old games in this genre, don't hesitate trying this one for a second, you're gonna love it! I'm pretty sure newcomers to the genre will be able to enjoy it just as much, since it has a smooth learning curve and the tutorials form part of the real missions. In a nutshell, highly recommended, if anything can revive this genre (which I'm holding my breath on), it's certainly this game, couldn't have been a better step towards that! Hope we get more of this soon!. Shadow Tactics successfully revives the top-down tactical stealth genre pioneered by Commandos, Robin Hood and Desperados. It's amazing that the scenario has up until now not been given the genre treatment. The game has great, semi-stylized graphics and an awesome soundtrack and sound design, making for an all together perfect Japanese atmosphere, aided by the (optional) Japanese voice-over. The campaign takes you through 13 different levels (river valleys, snowy mountains, misty forests, bustling cities, i. a.) with multiple, varied objectives. There are optional challenges for hardcore gamers. It took me around 30 hours to beat the campaign. The characters are likeable and their skills work together well gameplay-wise. Review in one word: MORE! Definitely buy it!. Amazing game! Too bad that are few missions and no coop multiplayer! Would be awesome!. Shadow Tactics is by far the most difficult stealth game I've ever managed to finish. While Blades of the Shogun isn't for everyone, it is an expertly crafted experience that combines adept storytelling with complex yet easy to control stealth gameplay. I would highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys stealth games but, because of the nature of the genre, it is hard to recommend to newcomers because of the steep difficulty curve and its dependence on quicksaving/quickloading. It's hard to talk about the story without spoilers because it's only 13 missions long (and I don't know anything about Japanese history) but it at least feels more grounded in reality here than most stealth games. There are no magic spells, no ninjutsu scrolls, no ridiculous acrobatics to fly around the map. Your characters are believable human beings and while yes, two of them are actual ninjas, they just move more gracefully than other humans in their world. The only tools at your disposal that really require suspension of disbelief are actually the old sniper's gear. While the plot becomes predictable after the halfway mark, it is still motivating to watch it unfold even if your characters are going through constant suffering and strife. For hardcore fans, each mission has 9 badges for bonus objectives: 3 are mission-wide primary objectives (like not entering water or not using a specific character's skills), and 6 are secondary objectives that involve some mutual exclusion. This means even with perfect gameplay it will take multiple playthroughs for perfectly clearing a mission. Initially the gameplay can feel constrictive, as if there's only one way to play through each mission, but as your skills improve your strategy will widen and each map feels like a playground... Well, for most missions. Some of the latter missions had me ragequitting from the lack of cover and every enemy having 2 people watching him. The last mission also breaks away from the play style of the rest of the game and feels impossible without sneaking through long distances with one character at a time. Overall, the campaign is well crafted and enjoyable but certain missions I'm okay with never playing again (at least not without a walkthrough). The game is clearly designed for savescumming; if you don't want to be quicksaving and quickloading every minute or so, this isn't the game for you. Apart from that, Shadow Tactics is a beautifully crafted and well paced stealth game that only comes along every few years. This is a must-have for any fan of the genre and, with a great deal of patience, I highly recommend it.. Very engaging and thought provoking game. You need a lot of patience to play this game well and a good deal of creativity to get through certain problems, which is indicative of good game design. The controls can be a bit stupid with respect to the camera angle, if you click on a roof edge for example when trying to hide in a bush you'll squat in the middle of the road and be spotted, which can be incredibly annoying. The pathing can also be bad at times, if you click on the ground but there's a ladder you need to go down, you won't go down the ladder. One level I couldn't jump off a dock into the water when there was nothing stopping me, I jumped off a similar dock 5 minutes later. One level I killed a samurai while people who were looking over were distracted and for no discernible reason they lost focus on my distraction and alerted the whole firing squad. Apart from the stray bug here and there, the game behaves very well. The setting and art style is very well done, it feels complete and the environments are highly polished. The characters and voice acting are fairly simple and the story is somewhat typical, it's good but not great. Pro tip - Quick save before you try ANYTHING risky. I even bound one of my side mouse buttons to be F5 just to make it that much easier.. Fantastic game. A more than worthy evolution of the legendary Spanish saga Commandos. Lots of different paths to victory. Very interesting and innovative mechanics, like the lights in the night. Very nice graphics and engaging story. I like the characters as well. All in all, a very well finished stealth game.. Amazing stealth game that loosely follows the footsteps of Commandos. I've read some extemely positive reviews before buying it, but I didn't think it would have been *so* good. It's well written, has great characters (I kinda hope to see the cast in some other game) and great dialogues. The setting is feudal Japan, it's quite original, fresh and always interesting. The stealth mechanics are near perfect, and the character abilities are amazing and all of them have a place in the game and are fun to use. The mission design is great, with every mission adding something new and fresh to keep the interest up. On the challenge level, it's always pretty hard but never frustrating. The UI is an absolute gem: simple, stilish, practical. Doesn't end up in the way of the gameplay. Only issues with it it's that the ""shadow mode"" is not a great addition. A tactical pause would have been way better. Only real flaw is that sometimes, as someone else pointed out, the game is more of a puzzle game than a stealth game: you have to guess the exact way the developers thought to pass some zones, and that can be annoying and may deter from the sense of freedom. Even a split second more (I'm not exagerating) would have made a huge (positive) difference in certain situations. To sum it up: Amazing game that deserves all the praise it's getting.. Five Word Review: An indie gem, solid challenge. Favorite Thing: I was really surprised by the quality of this game. The voice acting, visuals, challenge, story, and gameplay are all top notch. Least Favorite Thing: Clicking on hotspots can be frustrating. It's a minor nuisance, I know. Completion Date: 2017-04-29 Playtime: ~ 22h Enjoyment: 9/10 Recommendation: Yes. It's a solid and enjoyable game.. I was starving for a game like this. I miss Desperados and Commandos so much that I was so delighted to see a game like this again! Hard to do stealth and careful playing is so enjoyable for me. Amazing game. Must buy if you're even remotely interested in stealth/ strategy games. Might feel similar to Desperadoes or Commandos but it improves on that formula by a mile.. Good: - Many ways to complete a mission, you could just murder everyone on the map or sneak past your enemies without killing anyone, all is your choice. - The badges for each mission lead you to play a mission in many different ways, you wouldn't feel bored to repeat the same mission again. - Each mission and map is very unique, you will find village, temple, military camp, market, castle, none of the maps bear close resembrance to each other, In Commandos and Desperaos, you could still find some maps that are very similar and it is like doing the same thing all over again. - Musics are good, voice-acting is superb, some of the dialogues are very funny. - The game is very stable to run, no crash to desktop, no game-breaking glitch that would anger the players. Bad: - Not really a big problem, but I feel that Hayato, the ninja is pretty redundant beside his throw rock skill, I could use Yuki to do everything Hayato could do and she is much more useful with her pipe and trap combo. When both of them are present in a mission, I would only use Hayato to assist Yuki and Yuki would get everything done. Mugen is a great company to have, he is the only character that can kill Samurai easily, can carry two bodies at once and can run quickly while doing that and kill a patrol squad in seconds. Sniper and the spy are both useful in their own way, but Hayato is pretty forgettable. - At times, the angle of the camera could completely mess up your plan because an area you thought you could easily click on is actually blocked by some overlay objects and you actually have to rotate the camera before you can click on that area. - Throwing bodies off the ledge(except when using Mugen) is one of the most painful task to perform, after getting 9/9 badges on all maps, I still could not be certain how to throw the body precisely to the place I want 100% of the time. - Speedruns are frustrating to complete if you are a save-loader like me :( because time is still added after you load a game. This is actually a also pros because it forces you to develop your patience and improve your skills. - A building is just another place to hide your characters, there is no interior inside. All in all, this is a very polished and well-made game. fans of Commandos or Desperados shouldn't miss this game.. --RATING 0 OR 10 DUE TO HOW METACRITIC HANDLES USERSCORES-- Cons: - Could have used more levels. - Could have used more levels where you control the entire party. - Could have used larger levels with indoor sections. - English voice acting is a little lacking. Pros: - Good level design. - Great gameplay. - Varied characters that have a lot of synergy. - Polished stealth gameplay. - Quicksave timer. - Good music and visuals. - Story moves the game along well. - Multiple level solutions. - Good length. - Appropriate price. - The Tactics mode is a nice innovation for the genre. Overall: Resurrects the Stealth Tactics genre masterfully, the only downside being that there isn't more of it and that it doesn't go crazy with it's ideas.. Anyone who likes stealth, a slow and tacti","instead of controlling one character per mission, you control between 2 to 5 . each character has unique abilities, and you can pre-program actions to be executed when needed . each level took me about 1:30 hours but all those hours were spent in fun ."
"1,186.Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms","My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 9.. Great strategy game for its time. It is still a good game to this day, but it has clearly aged. The management of your cities for example can be incredibly painful when you have a lot of cities.. Good DLC for Medieval II Total War if you want some detailed short campaigns, also very useful if you are demanding some of the very fine mods of this game. An all round good DLC kit. 7/10 - Ben Hazelden. Adds more depth and content to what was already a stellar game. Simply brilliant and still one of my 'go to' games. Replayability is huge and the extra campaigns and factions round out a fascinating and absorbing look at this turbulent time in world history. You will not be disappointed especially if you loved the original game. Nothing really new here just lots of great additional content. Enjoy!. Great, just great. Improves the original game a lot. And there are 4 whole campaigns! Each one is really unique so you won't get bored. There are also plenty of new units.. I wasnt to amused with the new campaigns but mods of this game are amazing. Having played community made mods for countless of hours this is probably the single player game i have played the most in my life... A great addition to the original game. Good variety of campaigns and units. Unfortunately the American civilizations are too similar for my tastes. Just as good as Medieval II.. As expansions go, Kingdoms is actually quite good. Despite the updates, it does possess the same issue with the original Med 2 game in that the AI is either incredibly thick or incredibly stupid. The expansion is split between four campaigns; Britannia, the Crusades, the Americas and Teutonic campaigns, which I've listed in order of my impressions. All of them are at least enjoyable and offer a more distinctive vibe than the main game had. Overall though, Kingdoms is a worthy expansion despite not really adding much to the core gameplay.. Omg this game is just amazing i mean like its a lot of **** also you have to use your brain on it.!One bad move could ruin it all! But other then that the gameplay is pretty fun and the conquering part makes it all the more fun. Playing an aptly named Grand Campaign on Medieval Total War 2 for the past two years has given me a new found appreciation for the RTS genre. If you read my review of the original shogun experience, you would have thought Iâ","despite the updates, Kingdoms is actually quite good . it does possess the same issue with the original Med 2 game in that the AI is either incredibly thick or incredibly stupid ."
"1,187.WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain","Best Wrestling game ever created, hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Easily the greatest wrestling game of all time, and it will never ever be duplicated ever again. I’m giving it a flat out 10 out of 10. 100%.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. I've tried to like this game but I can't! It has a very rotten and outdated gameplay unlike the WWE 2009/10/11 which in addition to the beautiful graphics also has a great gameplay. Maybe if I had played this in 2003 I would have liked it better. This is the most fun and epic wrestling game ever! Even today in 2023 i have more fun playing this than the latter sequels. Plus it features all the best wrestlers ever.. Best wrestling game of all time. Roster its full of legendary wrestlers like Kane, The Undertaker, John Cena, Batista, Eddie Guerrero, Rob Van Dam, Edge, Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Ric Flair, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock etc. They din´t waste space on adding characters that nobody misses like Maven or La Resistance and dint flood the roster with unmemorable characters like they did in future games. The gameplay its fast passed and the matches are fire. Royal Rumble Match doesn't last an hour like in every other WWE game and its actually fun to play. Season Mode its re-playable and even in the 3rd o 4th run you can still find something new in the story-lines. The best experience for casual gamers or casual wrestling fans because matches don't last enough to get you bored, the game its still in 2023, 20 years later, the best representation of wrestling in video games.. Great career,roster,so fun and addicting.Really good mechanics, one of the best wrestling games of all time! Suggest you to play that game if you are a wrestling fan, NOW!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Legendary game great gameplay good graphics and fantastic rostar but the rostar can be batter overall one of the best wrestling video games of all time if not the best. Even today it is still one of the best wrestling games, having the release date, good roster,good season mode and a more entertaining combat system than current games. That graphics were amazingly good at that time, all the children here must have played this game, and at that time we were hype at our place. Still the best wwe games until now. Fluid mechanic, memorable song opening , and tons customizing is amazing. World's best wrestling game. Nobody can oppose this. Different stories each time and they're all really good (okay maybe not all but most). 2K needs to make a MyCareer mode just like the season mode on HCTP. But 2K is a very lazy firm.. Nostalgic game.played it and fell in love with it.best wwe game in ps2 console. This might still be the best wrestling game ever. I thought 2K18 and 19 were worth playing, but I haven't picked them up since they were a few months old. I go back and play HCTP every few years and love it. The lack of commentary is a plus in my opinion, because listening to Michael Cole just reminds me why I stopped watching WWE. The story mode is unbelievably entertaining. It's linear, so you can only play through once unless you want the same exact story to happen again, but they did a great job with it. The gameplay is pretty basic, but very satisfying. If they remastered this game and added the ability to give your wrestler custom music, I would play it every year.. The best WWE game, the sad part is that this a game of 2003 The replayability is just insane. One of the best if not the best wrestling game to the date it have a hectic addictive crazy and fun gameplay it have a great season mode wrestlers finally bleed and take a lot of damage and you can't wrestle even outside the ring in a city and do an insane bunch of stuf. As a kid I used to play all day at this game,it’s mechanics were perfect,pure fun and a must when you just want to play something because it will always entertain you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think this is the best wrestling game of all time. Even better than WWF No Mercy. I can see why people adore this game so much and why they want it to be remastered. The graphics were really impressive and realistic albeit cartoonish but have not really aged well. The soundtrack is perfect. The sound was so flawless. The gameplay is superb. Yuke's went all out on this game. We got the Elimination Chamber and Bra and Panties match types and they were very fun. I liked the revamped controls and move animations. The finishers looked so satisfying and brutal. The roster was near perfect. It was missing many notable wrestlers and divas. So many wrestlers you could play as and the inclusion of legends made it even better to play with friends. The career mode is phenomenal. The create a wrestler and moveset mode was a massive improvement over Shut Your Mouth. There was no commentary which was a great idea as it would detract from the game. The AI was incredible. A absolute must have for wrestling fans and I would definitely recommend it.. Great career,roster,so fun and addicting.Really good mechanics, one of the best wrestling games of all time! Suggest you to play that game if you are a wrestling fan, NOW!. I think 90% of the people start their PS2 experience by this game only. Classic game. Royal rumble system is a little too fast for the liking, but still, it is fun. And also, anything with tornado tag is fun.. WWE SmackDown Here Comes the Pain is the best wrestling game on PS2, not to mention WWE SmackDown VS Raw 2011 . Not really good graphics, but many different wrestlers and one ofthe best gameplay in WWF/WWE Series . This is first WWE Games (WWF not to mention) . On Cover for this game Brock Lesnar . Amazing wrestling game .. We have now 2016-and this games is even now in best 3 wrestling games ever!!!Cool unique modes,best rooster and great atmosphere!!!Great sound,matches,rooster, and modes!!You can have realistic matches or unrealistic matche for example in the middle of the street.. BEST WRESTLING GAME EVER!! not joking its better than any 2k 15,16 i still play it with it on party,s and its **** felling **** good and bought it at very low price.. Already spent about 12 years but this game still manages to be one (of all wrestling games) that gives me more pleasure and nostalgia **** incredibly long , but very cool to play, Season Mode contrasts with the dull General Manage Mode . The Exhibition mode is very simple: choose a wrestler and fight but becomes a lot of fun when played with a friend . The trips to places like behind the scenes , the locker room and abroad and the utilization of virtually all materials that are at our disposal make this a fantastic game.. Probably the best wrestling game ever.Hell, it aged so damn well. Great roster, exciting gameplay. Really an epic and also a revolutionary game at that time. There hasn't been any wrestling game since ""Here Comes The Pain"" that was better and more fun than that. A difficult wrestling game to top.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still the best wrestling game ever created. The character creator & character customization modes are chock-full of content. There are so many battle modes to choose from, and the controls are impeccable, it blows my mind.. This game is the best wwe **** game play **** sound **** music in the background is the best and way better than **** sound is **** only one thing bad about it and most users would have said it.There was no Jeff Hardy or Hulk Hogan.Most of the character overalls were not that **** season mode was the best thing about **** season mode was about 1 year long and it was **** could make your own character and **** could even play season mode with your **** music made in this game was the best.Commentary is **** every wwe game they should make music.I really hope they make another game like this. Thanks Owaisqadri100. KYR was fun, JBI was good, SYM was great, but HCTP was and always will be the Greatest Smackdown! Game of all time. Everything was awesome in this game.. This was like three years of my life, no joke all I played in middle school was this Here comes the pain, Pokemon Gold and that s really it. WWE SmackDown Here comes the pain is the best!!!!! I really do think this is one my favorite games of all times list. Like I easily put in over one million hours into this game and I never knew the whole time I played this game that the wrestlers where real people.....I'm not joking. The music was epic and to this day I still have the whole soundtrack memorized and I also still feel that this game has the best create a wrestler mode out of all other wrestling games I have played. The story mode is awesome but I have to admit after the first time you become the WWE Champion it isn't the same game. Your the best out of over fifty wrestlers and none of them can touch you. Another thing that kinda is broken about this game is that if you spend about fifty hours making a create a character with perfect skill points you can copy him and make a tag team that is perfect and can never lose. My one regret is that I never made my own WWE with perfect wrestlers and had them fight for my honor(that would of been so cool). I will never forget my hundred of hours that I spent hitting half naked dudes with metal chairs and sledgehammers. This is one of my fondest gaming memories and no game other than Pokemon Gold will ever be better.. Without a doubt my favorite WWE game and i played a lot of WWE games across the ps2, ps3 and the psp. This had a big variety of characters a decent creator mode and a big variety of matches, we had even more possibilities of matches in this game than the latest ones (Fight in the back stages, in the car park, etc). I spent long hours playing this game with friends and my sister, this was my second favorite ps2 game (first was GTA: SA). I laughed a lot with this game and will never forget it, and i still play it and enjoy it.. CLASSIC i didnt get this game when i was young so i always saw videos and heard it was the best i thought it might not be ture bcuz i was obsesses with the first sd vs raw but this game is AMAZING great backstage areas, TIMES SQUARE and very addictve gameplay and a great roster overall this is the best wwe game ever!. This game maybe addictive but this game does have some flaws to.Like first of all the CAW part of it is only great if you wanna create an old school wrestler or a cartoon.i tryed creating CM PUNK and tyler black and it didn't work out for me.also the legends don't have there own music so....Your gonna have to go to moveset to get a theme that fits all of **** all tho the game is a fun and really good **** it **** how shut your mouth had commentary and this didn't.Like seriously! Come on THQ.. Wow,lets get right to it and I have to tell you that it's August 2010 and I have yet to find a wrestling game or fighting game as good as this game.I have wwe smackdown vs. raw 2010 and that game is amazing but this game's game play is mind blowing.Especially for how old this game **** lack of commentary is the only reason I'm knocking off a 1/2 of a point,even though the commentary in all the wrestling games is terrible and the games weakest point,but to this day I play it and love it the best of all my wresling games,I give it a 9.5","Easily the greatest wrestling game of all time, and it will never ever be duplicated ever again . the story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning . i've tried to like this game but can't! it has a very rotten and outdated gameplay unlike the latter sequels ."
"1,188.Hot Shots Golf 3","The best golf game ever, and it’s not even that close. Not sure why this doesn’t have a higher score - it’s perfect in every way. I’m a big fan of the Tiger games (my favorite being ‘05), but this game is more true to golf. Love how you can pick this up and play it, but it takes more to become excellent. Learning how to craft your shots with the different, and always awesome, characters comes in handy for the different challenges within each course. It’s different than Tiger, and I feel it’s better. This version is also my favorite in the series - I feel like it’s fine-tuned perfectly.. A really fun golf game with cool characters and stages. Better option than Mario Golf imo. A decent Playstation title.. Such a great game and franchise that needs to get rebooted. Excellent for multiplayer moments.. This game is fun for a bit until you notice the glaring problems. Without any wind, it would say I am hitting 232 and I would hit full power and almost perfectly on and it would only go 209 yards and into the water below. The game does a terrible job [predicting how far your shot will go, in a game where feet matter. There is no excuse and no other reason why that should happen. Also even on the beginner courses the computer gets pars and birdies every time making it almost impossible to keep up. They should make the game more accessible and not make waste your time on 18 holes against perfect players starting out. Also even if you are just a tad off on the hit with the accuracy button it will go way short (doesn't even make sense with accuracy) or way off to the side. They can't expect you to be perfect and should penalize you as much for barely any error.","this version is also my favorite in the series - i feel like it’s fine-tuned perfectly . without any wind, it would say i am hitting 232 and would hit full power and almost perfectly on and it would only go 209 yards and into the water below . the game does a terrible job [predicting how far your shot will go, in a game where feet matter. there is no excuse and no other reason why that should happen"
"1,189.Monopoly Tycoon (2001)","Dedication will keep players coming back and the rewards make it worth returning. If a player finds it is hard for them to excel against the computer, then it becomes the right time to invite friends along to challenge. If someone has never played Monopoly, but likes to build or just loves the Monopoly franchise, this game is for him or her.. Can't figure out why this game isn't more popular. Sure it is rough around the edges, but it is very deep for its simplicity. The game is also ahead of its time graphically, even if it looks ugly by today's standards. If you are a fan of the simulation genre, I can not recommend this game enough, even with its steep learning curve.","cnn.com's tom charity has compiled a list of the best games he's played . the game has a steep learning curve, but it's very deep for its simplicity . it's also ahead of its time graphically, even if it looks ugly ."
"1,190.Shovel Knight","An homage to old NES classics but with better, more refined mechanics. Great style, great game design, fun as hell gameplay, amazing bosses, each stage feels unique and different, overall this game kicks ass. this is a fun game inspired by the best rock hard NES games of the past, like Megaman, Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, only the best, and it delivers a new story with fresh designs.. Pros: + perfect length + great pixel art + good music + great level design + fun to use powerups Cons: - some repetitive tracks. It is quite a simple game, but it is incredibly addictive and challenging, enjoyed it a lot.. Shovel Knight is a solid platformer with a few frustrating levels. The items add some leniency but are usually too inconvenient to swap between.. Shovel Knight: 8/10 great game, classic, feels the most balanced of all Plague Knight: 7/10 has some problems, like combat just feels inferior than others, but still quite enjoyable Specter Knight: 10/10 best combat, story and platforming, although has some **** moments imo King Knight: 5/10 barely could bother myself to finish, card game is unfun and both combat and platforming are also worst in the series. The ending was cool, though. Overall incredible platforming experience, highly recommend.. An homage to old NES classics but with better, more refined mechanics. Great style, great game design, fun as hell gameplay, amazing bosses, each stage feels unique and different, overall this game kicks ass. In my opinion one of the greatest games of this generation.. Awesome tribute to the 16 bits era. Great game, great bosses, and a f*cking SHOVEL as weapon.. an amazing throwback to the golden age of gaming complete with great visual, fun plat forming ,challenging boss fights and new game plus and challenge mode to keep you coming back all & all worth you time. Hear me, hear me, here is my love for a game that makes me rise my shovel up and pretend it's a good weapon. Always great feeling to kill someone with a shovel. MASTERPIECE 2/10. No, seriously, a masterpiece.. Let me address this before anything: My thought process for my reviews are obviously personal BUT I do take into account a lot of objective factors (Not other people's reviews though.) Just keep that in mind so you can understand why I couldn't give this game a perfect 10. Shovel Knight is my favorite platformer in the last 5 years. I don't think any other game comes close. However it is also true this game is just what I expect from my perfect platformer. So my perfect score turns into a almost perfect score when I take into account some factors. Rogue-likes and RPGs go very well together. Adding platforming to the mix is not an easy task. I really want to know how in the world Yacht Club Games made it look as easy as counting to three. Amazing art, Inspired enemies and levels, cool bosses and some over world goodies? Yes please. Shovel Knight does it all, and it does it great. I love this game and I love the creators for making it. I expect big things from them know, so I'll guess we will see. Shovel knight suffers from one thing though: It is not that original. It may seem like it, but I wish I had seen at least one mechanic that I would have never seen coming. That would make it a 10 out of 10 review worthy game. A 9 is still a must play with me.. A lot of great retro platformers have popped up recently, but few have felt as great to play as shovel knight. This game perfectly captures the ability of retro platformers to have fairly simple core mechanics but to scale immensely in difficulty. This is a game where every level felt super fun to play through over and over again until I had mastered it. Also, it has an incredible soundtrack :D. Overrated and extremely boring to play. The game play is not addictive and truly nothing special. If you want to play retro games. Pick up a real NES or just buy the NES classic. You can even emulate old NES games. Shovel knight is just a rehash of Duck tales and Mega Man with a new original story. However nothing is new about the game mechanics or style of the game. This game received so much fan fare and high ratings because of this whole retro gaming trend that is currently going on. Developers are taking advantage of this fact and allows them to release low quality games like this, and make a quick buck off retro nostalgia.. Anyone who reviews this game 10 should immediately go get an actual NES and play actual good oldschool games. The shovel knight just feels like **** to control, very clunkey, especially mid-air. The stairs just make no sense in this game, at all. You will die on nearly every staircase in the game. Level cycles are too random to be memorized. Enemies are RNG galore and always feel like they move faster than you giving you no time to react, UNLESS you wait for them. There aren't enough checkpoints. Should I mention the **** feel of the control again? Shovel knight controls like a rock. Just go outside, pick up a really big rock and move that around, and you will get the general feel of moving shovel knight through the levels. Game isn't bad, it's okay. The presentation is the best part of it, oldschool gfx are well done, especially the animations, they are amazing. Music is great too. They got so carried away with the presentation that they forgot to like, actually make the game.. TIER 2 + Obviously pays strong respects to that which inspired it, but comes out on top as feeling more polished, dense, and masterfully executed than many retro games. + A very good mixture of level mechanics and themes, and while the player has limited mobility and attacks, the levels provide new tools and experiences time and time again. ? The spell system is interesting in providing a variety of new tools, but ultimately feels like mixed bag random additional mechanics that reduce the tight execution of the title. ? The tedium of some of the boss fights makes it too easy to be tempted into using the invincibility mechanics on offer to cheese combat. - The base movement and combat systems, while true to retro games, often don't feel good to use. The lack of directional attacks make many of the enemies nothing but annoying unless you happen to click with what's on offer.. Rarely have I so enjoyed a game that so persistently made me rage, or made me care for an 8-bit sprite as much as I cared for Shield Knight, but Shovel Knight is just that game. An affectionate homage to the golden age of console gaming, Shovel Knight comes to us from former members of Wayforward Technologies, creators of the Shantae series. The game's incredibly varied stages play out like a greatest hits album of classic platformers. But unlike, say, Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania, Shovel Knight never feels cheap or punishing. The game is filled with a lovable cast of characters, excellent music (courtesy of the ineffable Virt Kaufman, the musical genius behind Contra 4, Scurge: Hive, Shantae, and several other games), useful powerups and hair-pulling jumping puzzles. The controls are extremely tight, and any mistakes you make are your own damn fault. The game rather mercifully makes use of checkpoints, only depriving you of money when you die, money you have a chance to retrieve when you make it back to where you died. And even if you don't, you can always farm for more, and you will need quite a bit to buy all the upgrades. I had to take a few breaks over the course of playing Shovel Knight to cool off, but I kept coming back until I was done. I do not regret for a second backing this lovely game on kickstarter. If you enjoy platformers and classic NES era gaming in general, then grab yourself a copy of Shovel Knight and prepare to strike the earth!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An absolute classic and masterpiece! Shovel Knight combines all the things we loved from the old classic 8-bit games like Mario, Metroid, Castlevania, Mega Man, etc. with some Dark Souls leveled difficulty even added in. This game has great action and adventure, lovable characters, great soundtrack, gorgeous 8-bit graphic, and an awesome story. An absolute must play and one of the best games of the year.. I have never owned an NES, I have never played an NES game yet I still love this game. It has solid controls and teaches through game-play instead of text. You constantly obtain new abilities in the game, and encounter new enemies and objects. The level design is extremely clever, teaching you something in a low stress situation, and later adding pressure to test you on what you've learned. The graphics and music and charming, and I think they're great even though I have no nostalgia for them. The story is simple and skip able, I couldn't ask for much more. The game become's very challenging, and even though it teaches the mechanics of levels well before you encounter them in a deadly situation, you can still die in some cheap ways. The game is full of adorable characters, and it never felt like it was wasting my time. If I didn't want to talk to a character I usually didn't have to, and if I did I could skip their dialogue if I wanted. This is one of my favorite platformers mostly because of the amazing level design. There is so much polish on every detail of this game and it's noticeable. It's fun, and even though the gameplay can be unforgiving checkpoints are frequent and give you some breathing room. This entire game is an example **** tutorial.. This game is old school Nintendo, at its best AND its worst. The problem is, no one makes games like this anymore for a reason. There's a lot of good to the game, the mechanics are interesting, the feel is very nostalgic, the sound track is amazing. ...The gameplay is not. It's frustrating, it's repetitive. It isn't 'hard'. Anyone can beat Shovel Knight. Anyone can walk through barbed wire. The experiences are very similar. Endure the pain long enough and eventually you win. At the end, you're unsatisfied. And bleeding. It boggles my mind the game is so well reviewed. I can only assume it's pure, unadulterated nostalgia blinding people to, what if viewed on it's own, would be a very average, flawed game, and this is coming from someone who owned an NES when it was new. Literally the target audience. Get Splunkey or La Mulana if you want a platformer.. This is one of the few platform games sold on Steam that are not spiritual successors of other series to get along in campaigns to raise funds and it was no wonder, the game is quite challenging, is with graphics that much resemble the 8-bit games, and has an interesting plot . I recommend this game for the nostalgic duty that has money to spend on Steam. Your money paid will not be in vain. Shovel Knight is a 2014 2D side-scrolling platform game, developed and published by independent video game developer Yacht Club Games. Following a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, the game was initially released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U in June 2014, and ports of the game for OS X and Linux followed in September of the same year.. Retro masterpiece! Great platformer inspired by amazing titles from the NES days. Being a fan of MegaMan, I can't help but recommend this little jewel. Controls are smooth, the music is cool, the graphics are nice and the levels are cleverly designed to entertain the player without frustrating him/her too much. The duration of the story mode is pretty short (5-7 hours), be aware of that. Still totally worth the money in my opinion.. Wow, I think this is the first time that I agree more with the critics than the users on this site. By now, thanks to the free DLC, I've now sunk over 20 hours into this game and it is still a blast. I don't get what's not to like about it. The controls are spot-on, the gameplay is retro yet modern (check points, automatic saving) and similar things go for the visuals (it's 8 bit style but animations usually weren't as refined back then and the color palette not as varied). Also lots of content and unlockables. This is probably in my Top 3 of the last few years.. Some people say it's a retro game, it looks old bla bla bla... . shovel knight is one of the best indie games ever and there is no reason to hate this game. great boss fight, great humor, great music and great graphic. some games like shovel knight are much better in 8-bit because for someone like me it brings childhood memories and for someone who never played old school games, shovel knight is something new. with great and challenging gameplay and unforgettable musics it's stupid to hate this game just because of the old school style of the game.. Awesome. Super fun from start to finish. The game as long as it needs to be without overstaying its welcome and proves to be difficult without becoming frustrating. The Dark Souls-esque gold recovery system is solid and the multitude of special abilities you gain are interesting and diverse. On top of all of this, the graphics and music are straight out of the NES era – many games try to nail this down but only a select few get it right. A charming, hilarious, and challenging adventure worth adding to your library.. One of the best retro graphics game out there. The combat system is good, the platforming feels fun, soundtrack is catchy and the sprites looks gorgeous. It's really great to play it. Truly a modern day platforming gem.. Overall impression: An excellent ode to the retro era. A must play for anyone who grew up with late 80s/ early 90s video games. This game is beautiful, fun, excellent to handle, catchy, and fair (people who played old games will know what I mean). My only problem was that is was too short (yep! in other words it was so great I wanted more).. This game has the best level design i have ever seen. The music is so good it is worth to download the soundtrack and the 8 bit gaming features are on point. One of the best platformers that has challenge and charm. My only complaint is that its a bit on the short side. (For me it only took 3 hours). But at least every minute I enjoyed.. Shovel Knight is an ok game that harkens back to the old school 8-bit games. There are some fun levels though I noticed they are mostly very short with some difficult platforming to take up your time. The music is good but repetitive (like the old school games) so I muted it after the first level. I noticed the keyboard controls are not very intuitive and responsive for platforming type games.. I wish I had a controller for my PC to see if it was easier to play, but my hands felt cramped and crowded by the AWSD keys and I wish there was a better way to traverse the menus and use your special power... which required hitting 2 keys which I would not time correctly very often. I played with the key setup constantly but didn't find one that I would like. All-in-all I found some levels to be extremely difficult though but the boss battles were easy. One level I just couldn't get through so I quit altogether, It was a fun few hours until it got too frustrating.. This game reminds me alot of Megaman, only with Megaman you had to defeat robot masters, with Shovel Knight you defeat different types of knights. Which Megaman you have Doctor Wilys castle and in this you have the same thing but not with Wily.. It's a good game, it's not perfect but it really took me back to the days of the NES. 8.5. Shovel Knight is a great game, both for gamers attracted by the '80s nostalgia, and for people who want a taste of what made '80s games so great. The difficulty is just right: very challenging ('80s style), but not offputtingly frustrating. The art style of this game is top notch, and the Mega Man-ish music just really hypes you up for the level. Seriously, the 8-bit styled atmosphere and music shows off real love towards all the classics this game was inspired by. And if you play with a controller, the controls are excellent. Level design is fantastic, boss battles are great, there are lots of collectibles in hidden areas. Also, the destroy-the-checkpoints-and-get-goodies-idea is genius. All that being said, the game might be a little bit over-hyped. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast playing it, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as some other people did. Nevertheless, this is a really original and fun game you absolutely need to have in your library. 8.5/10. Shovel Knight A must Play For all Shovel Knight is a beautifully charming action platforming game. Shovel Knights art style screams nostalgia sale, but I was happy to find that this game isn’t just here to pull money out of your pockets with heart strings, Shovel Knight is it’s own game, an instant classic. Shovel knight consists of 12 main levels all with their own boss battles, each level and stage getting progressively more challenging. The pacing is really some of the best ive ever seen in gaming. Every level has checkpoints, this may annoy the hardcore gamers at first, but you really come to appreciate them, platforming can get really trick for those of us that are impatient. These type of gamers are who the checkpoints are for, they are essentially training wheels. Shovel Knight is really more than just a flat forming game, it truly is an experience, and im happy these checkpoints exist so all can experience and guess what… checkpoints are COMPLETELY optional. Don’t like them? Break them, they drop cash so now you have nothing to complain about. I wouldn’t recommend doing such a thing your first time through as again, shovel knight gets increasingly challenging. Enemies will start throwing projectiles, youll have to dodge lava and spikes and look out for enemies while you seek out secrets. There are tons of secrets to be found in shovel knight that I wont spoil, but they add such a great deal of wonder to the game, you never know what youre going to find in a room you just uncovered from an exploding rat. It could be a music page for you to sell in the villiage, or a new relic waiting for you to grab to help you out through the rest of the game. I wasn’t expecting relics, but im so happy they exist, these relics all cost magic to use so cant really be spammed, but they are all varied and make you look at levels for better, more efficient ways to traverse them. You can also save your gold for armour and shovel upgrades, maybe increased magic or meal tickets to increase your health, the choice is yours, but unless youre completely confident in your skills walking into an unknown area you better make that choice before going back out, because every time you die you drop 3 pouches of gold much like in the souls series. If you want that gold back youre going to have to go grab it, if you die on your way back then its gone forever.. The risk reward makes traversing these gorgeous levels even more enjoyable. Not only did this development team due a great job with level design and enemies, but also with bosses. Each boss has its own attack style, so no 2 relics will be equally handy in these encounters, gratefully though, they all die the same way, hit them an x amount of times. Games can get in the habit of making bosses a little too unique, what shovel knight does so great is make the encounters similar enough to give you a sense of pride and feeling like you used skill to defeat a new enemy rather than you just got completely lucky. It isn’t common to die during your first encounter with a new boss and that is so refreshing. I wont get into story all too much, but I will say that it is there, there is reason to the madness and it, at least to me is beautiful. After you’ve completed the game and have picked every level apart for its secrets and treasures, you have the option to start a new game +. New game plus lets you start from the beginning with everything you collected in your previous play through, but this time levels are a little tougher as youll notice some checkpoints are missing, enemies do double damage, and there are no health pick ups. There are tons of challenging feats to accomplish in shovel knight. Totally worth the playthrough just to experience, a highly recommended game title to both casual and hardcore gamers alike. I truly believe that everyone can find something to love about shovel knight. For what it is Action platformer 10/10 and as an overall game my first ever 10/10. Terribly dated and simple plattformer in NES technique, with a frustratingly high difficulty. After having tried to like this game for about 20 hours, i cannot recommend this game.. I wanted to love this game, i always enjoyed old games, i bought a lot of them on steam and my 3ds. And i was really excited for this game to come out. But something about shovel night makes me so frustrated every time i play it, except the beginning. It may be that i played it on steam instead of my 3ds and it may be better with an xbox controller, but the games controls well on pc. so thats not a problem, the problem is that it is frustrating it can't be that its to hard, i play dark souls. I think its that some enemies in the game feel cheap like in risen 3, except hear their much easier to kill and can kill you faster, it may not sound that bad but i got so mad at this game that i broke my headphones by ripping the wire. But this game is good, it has great music great platforming and some amazing things that you can use or buy, i mean use because there are platforms that can kill you but if you're smart and you time it right you can use it to your advantage. if you have one, buy it on your 3ds, if not, i would wait for a sale. There's no doubt where inspiration came from when making this game and I love it. There isn't much that I want different with this game and that feeling of playing a brand new game that feels like it is part of something old really comes through. There isn't really much to say but O. M. G. !. A good retro platforming game. It has a few issues (such as the final fight being not very good and most of the upgrades not being useful), but overall it is a great fun from start to finish.. ITS PERFECT this game is great! from the simple controlers than can be aplied to interact in so many ways with the enviroment and enemies. the level design which is intuitive and fun to travel while creating new challenges and new ways for you to act in them. the boss characters have enough charm and personality to make themselves notable and their fights have great variety. the story seems simple at first but it turns deeper and much more rewarding than initialy expected i wont spoil just gonna tell you its great XD. the 8bit graphics are amazing, colorful and detailed enough to give off all sorts of characters and animations. the upgrades are not about making the character stronger but about giving you new tools for you to traverse the levels without breaking the dificulty. i just wanna say i didnt play the 8bit era of games so i can see that this is not merely nostalgia bait, its a full experience on its own I LOVE THIS GAME. I' m giving it an 8, but keep in mind that this game cannot compare with graphics of today. It is a pleasure for old time gamers that look into the past with nostalgia. The game takes the best of games like Super Mario Bros 3, Faxanadu, Zelda 2, Mega Man & others, creating a game that has a unique personality. If you want to make a leap back in the past and remember the taste of the 80/90's, you should really try this game out.. This is an absolute gem ****. Shovel Knight is a platformer built on the bones of the very best the NES library has to offer, polished with great modern game design. The graphics are marvellous, the controls are tight and the level design fantastically designed. The true highlight of the game, though, has to be the soundtrack, which is one of the best video game soundtracks we've seen in years. Don't miss this one.. In the last couple of years the obsession with old school games has led many developers to develop their own 8/16bit games. This attitude has flooded the market with mediocre 2D ”old-school” platformers and instantly became the ”go to” genre for most Indie developers, spawning hundreds of failed Kickstarter projects and all of that is not a case when it comes to Yacht Club Games, they’ve raised $311,502 and released their first game, Shovel Knight. The game delivers a visually appealing 8-bit aesthetic, an amazing soundtrack and smooth animations. Let’s talk about the story. The game opens up with the ”cutscene” showing the game’s protagonist, Shovel Knight and his partner Shield Knight, you can clearly tell that the devs put a lot of thought into the characters’ names. Following a tragedy, Shield Knight is taken away from Shovel Knight by The Enchantress and her army, the Order of no Quarter…I’m not making that up. The Order consists of eight knights, each of them is originally named, for ex. Mole Knight, Plauge Knight or The Black Knight…yeah. Back to the story, you grab your shovel…yes, a shovel and go off on an epic adventure to defeat The Enchantress. One of the things I love about Shovel Knight is how it teaches you how to play it without spamming the text boxes with ”TO JUMP PRESS THE A BUTTON” and things like that. The first few stages teach you everything you need to know without saying anything, this is great, it made me want to play the game even more. The stages play like in a Mega Man game, the monsters are not your only enemies in the game, the environments can get involved in the action too, for ex. the lightning effects occasionaly light up making moving from platform to platform that much more difficult, it got kind of frustrating but it was interesting. The combat is extremely basic, but satisfying, just like in the 8bit era–had to download an NES emulator to realize that. You have your basic ”shovel slash” but you can also do sort of a Duck Tales attack by leaping on top of your enemies. You can also use your shovel to epically dig out a treasure from the ground. Shovel is not your only weapon, throughout the game you come across other weapons that allow you to attack from afar aka fire wand. I really liked that the devs included the checkpoint system so that you don’t have to start from the start when you die, I’m glad that you guys did not go hardcore mode with your old-school roots. You also have an option to destroy a checkpoint for some loot, I have never done that but If you enjoy challenge then sure, go for it. The treasures you’ve collected throughout the game allow you to purchase certain things like health/mana upgrades. After each stage you are transported to a world map that allows you to access different levels, in order to advance to a next area you first have to beat one of the previously mentioned, originally named Knights. Each stage presents new challenges that make the game more difficult the further you advance. They each have a unique theme and sometimes, new enemies that act differently and force different approaches, it makes for a very enjoyable gameplay experience. Same goes for the platforming, it gets more and more challenging as you play. I need to touch on one more thing that in my opinion, might be the most enjoyable thing about Shovel Knight, the boss fights. Each Knight has a unique fighting style and requires a bit of thinking, you have to figure out a pattern in which they move before attacking. You can’t just spam the attack button, just like in the old days(so I’ve heard) you have to think before approaching. I can safely say that this game offered me the most enjoyable boss fights I’ve ever experienced. Big round of applause for that. Lastly, I would like to talk about the difficulty of the game. I’ve had two weeks to write and publish this review but instead it took me three. I really did not think that the game would be that difficult, I thought that I’d be able to swoosh through the game in a couple of days but no, that was certainly not the case. It might be because I did not grew up in the 80s, and I did not fully experience the true ”holy-f*cking ****, this is hard” era so, It might be easier for you old people out there but nonetheless I’ve had a ton of fun and I certainly will re-play it again, this time with cheat codes. (there are over 300 of them in the game).. Okay, giant disclaimer: I DID NOT GROW UP WITH ANY RETRO PLATFORMERS! But even that didn't stop this game from being amazing. Shovel Knight is an amazing game which really mixes platforming with combat well. It is VERY similar to Mega Man, and those games are great. It took everything that was great about Mega Man games, and polishes them and improves them. Dying means your money flies away, but you can get it back! Meaning if you're good, an occasional death is literally inconsequential. Its graphics really leave quite a bit to your imagination, but are detailed enough to be amazing looking! Oh, and the music. Ohhh the music. It's amazing. The bosses have telegraphed moves, but they don't have an order! Boss fights are therefore fun and challenging, and even a little enraging at some points. =D This game is a masterpiece, even without nostalgia goggles making everything look even better. The one point off is just the fact that it feels a bit short, but honestly, that's not much of a problem. Trying to get all those feats will CERTAINLY make you work hard and keep replay ability high. Short Version Pro: Excellent mechanics, fun enemies, tight platforming, heaps of replay ability, and a decent challenge! Con: A little bit short.. It's great! Cheap and easy to play. More involved that I originally thought. Great stuff if you miss the 16 bit era. A little short, but it's worth your time and cash. Enjoy!. A great Throwback title, the games bosses do not follow a pattern which in turn allows for more fun and interesting boss fights, responsive controls are great, and fun gameplay all in one package what more could you ask for? it really fits in with the retro aspect in gaming, excellent.. This game takes many of the classic NES games (Super Mario Bros 3, Castlevania, Megaman, Zelda 2) and combines all the best parts of them into a pretty coherent story with excellent gameplay. It does have items special to only this game and special skills that set the game apart from other stated games. It also offers a few side quests for items that are not necessary to complete the game.. first of all. This game is fun! I played a lot of games this year and Shovel Knight is in my top 5 list. I grew up with NES games, but when I play does games now a days it doesn't cut it anymore(most of the time). they are old, really slow graphics are not that great.. Anyway, I was a bit sceptical at first when people were recommending this game all over the internet. telling that this game was amazing. $ 15 is not that cheap but I had some money left in my account so I bought the game and started playing. From the first level until the last one all are really beautiful fun and innovative in there own way. It' felt like the first time I started playing zelda game. It looks retro but it doesn't feel this way. If your are looking for high end 3d hd res etc. don't buy it, but when you like a good platform game and can look through 8bit this is a game for you.. Great gameplay, solid story, epic soundtrack. Worth a solid 15-40 hours of memorable gameplay. Only two negative things to say about the game. I thought the price was a little high for the length of the game (I usually buy games on sale but bought this game full price on release). Also if you have a long history with platformers this game may not pose enough of a challenge on it's own, setting yourself extra goals or trying for the tricky achievements can fix that though.. The good ol' Megaman, Castlevania and Duck Tales merged into one game. Everyone who grew up playing NES should absolutely try it. And the soundtracks is just amazing.. Shovel Knight is a retro 2D platformer game deeply devoted to its aesthetic and its puns. Designed as a pseudo-NES game, it harkens back to a long-","this is a fun game inspired by the best rock hard NES games of the past, like Megaman, Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, only the best . it delivers a new story with fresh designs, and it is quite a simple game, but it is incredibly addictive and challenging ."
"1,191.Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster","This JRPG to me is the pinnacle of how to make a game. Like this was an extraordinary experience. From the graphics, acting, soundtrack, gameplay, story, mechanics, this felt extremely well produced. It’s really hard to find serious issues in this. This is simply amazing & quite possibly the best game I’ve ever played. Like if you haven’t played this yet then what you waiting for?! Everything in this is near perfect & deserves my rare 10/10.. I LOVE SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME it truly brings back memories of one of the best final fantasy games of the past it improves there where it needs to be improved but leaves the core untouched. One of my personal favorite Final Fantasy's and is the quintennial starting point for any newcomer to the franchise.. **Positive review of Final Fantasy X:**- The game features a captivating story with well-developed characters that draw players into its world.- The graphics, especially for its time, are stunning and enhance the immersive experience.- The gameplay mechanics are deep and engaging, offering a variety of strategic options for battles.- The music and sound design are top-notch, adding emotional depth to key moments in the game.- Final Fantasy X's world-building is rich and detailed, creating a vibrant and memorable setting for the adventure. This is definitely my favourite JRPG of all time️️️. The game is linear which I didn’t mind at all, linearity somehow works for heavy story games. The world does opens up a tiny bit close to the end of the game but I’m so used to just going forward in the game I didn’t really explored/revisit any city after it opens up. It does gets grindy as you progress and some of the battles are actually hard. Overall, I think the game has good pacing, amazing story writing and incredible soundtracks (except that *annoying* one in that particular dungeon), good cast of characters and the colourful world of Spira is beautiful.. This is a pathetic game. Casting aside the ridiculous side game under the water. If you're at the pub and there's some extremely annoying ****, you move away and if you're lucky, someone will spark them and they'll **** off home when they wake up with a bloody nose. Well Square Enix take that annoying little **** and put him at the centre of most of their games. In this case they picked the most annoying little turd of them all as the lead character. If it's someone I definitely couldn't be arsed with in the real world, I certainly don't want to pay money to have the scrotey little **** on my screen. Who the **** designs these **** characters? I'm just about done with Square and their **** casts. Sick of wasting my money. Everytime I see these huge score reviews I think, oh I'll give them another try and everytime it's the same ****. Some annoying little **** that makes me want to cave the screen in.. Square Enix have truly outdone themselves to remaster a game as good as Final Fantasy X worse than the original.. Most overrated FF game in history of gaming, I had to be honest and also give it what I think it deserves, I gave 7,9, 12 The Zodiac Age, 7 Rebirth, 7 Remake all 10/10 and praised it, But this game is the most misleading overrated turn based RPG in history, it is linear, boring, repetitive, the world is ugly and the remaster doesn't do the game no justice. 1/10 period.. The Remastered version makes this game one of the most newcomer friendly games in the series, the ideal way to begin your Final Fantasy journey. One of the best old Final Fantasy games, Tidus is a very charming character, and his romance with Yuna is done perfectly. The story is incredible with some tear-jerking moments, and the music is fantastic and fits well with the game. The gameplay mechanics are solid but a little bit outdated, and the grinding can be a very annoying. Also there are many difficulty spikes which make some parts of the game frustrating. Still, the game holds up pretty well for a turn based JRPG, and if you're a fan of the genre this is pretty much a must-play. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. Shadow444 must be **** (previous review). This is a beyond a doubt, the greatest FF game ever created, closely followed by 7. This is the worst final fantasy game ever. FF6,7,8,9,12,13,15 all have better soundtracks, graphics, story and combat. There is nothing memorable in this game, aside from a few songs in the soundtrack. The characters are annoying and uninteresting. If you want the most overated game in history, this is it.. It was as generic as it can come for JRPG. Nothing stood up, nothing came to my eyes that I said ""Wow, that's interesting"". It was obvious in every point of the corner and it made me grind just to fight a boss, before the final two bosses... In which you can never lose because you have eternal free auto-res. This was not a game that will stay on my head for more than one or two months, if less.... Final Fantasy X is an outstanding masterpiece. I can't stop thinking about it since I've played it, its music, art and story will always stay with me. In terms of gameplay, I think it is the most interesting of all the Final Fantasy games released so far, because it offers turn-based combat where you have more time to think and plan strategies. The characters are absolutely charming, each one has their own story, they are full of charisma. What fascinated me most about the story was that it was told by the protagonist himself. This character, Tidus, uses this type of narration (in the first person) to reflect his feelings, emotions and thoughts in every situation, which enriches the development of the plot. In conclusion, this video game surpasses excellence and is my favourite game of all time.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this tenth game in the series.. FFX While instantly aesthetically displeasing and having bad writing and bad voice acting [really campy b-movie level], it really did seem like it was an 8/10 early on. As the game goes on it becomes more and more abrasive for many reasons. -The random encounters are all rock paper scissors fights where you hit really heavy and so do they, so you have to manually heal your party after every single battle -They hype up this big sports game in the story, then when you finally get to play it, it is a rigged match made for you loose badly in, and then instead of that mattering for the story like they hyped it to, the game disappears into the menu at save spots as an optional minigame -there are very annoying puzzles with unnecessary menus that pop up anytime you want to do something -There are very few enemy types, they get reused often and in the same exact combinations -There are very very cheap enemies that can wipe out your entire party before you even have a turn later on, making them harder than bosses -the protagonist is exceedingly dumb -a sex scene happens completely out of no where with no lead up romance -there is a race of people who speak a different language, and you find books that teach you one letter each, and you never piece it together. You are supposed to combine the letters your friends have found on the same game system by combining the save files. So you go through the game watching all this dialogue in a different language annoyed that you can't understand it and are missing parts of the story. -the airship in this game is unusable -they didn't bother to lip-sync the characters to the english audio -an entire level where you have to constantly be on edge for lighting to hit you -and you can't skip cutscenes This last point brings me to where I quit. After a 5 minute long cutscene, I was faced with a boss that killed one of my party members before I even had a turn, and then later killed them all in one hit. When you get a game over, it doesn't offer to reload from the start of the fight or the cutscene OR your last save file. It goes back to loading the main menu. You have to click through to prevent the opening movie to play, load your game, walk back to where you were, and sit through the same poorly written, poorly acted cutscene again, only to face the same poorly designed boss. I truly do not know why this game is highly regarded, I am more disappointed in the community than the game. FFX-2 At first it seemed pretty cool. I could play through as a giant crab if i wanted to. The job system is cool. I love their goth friend. The way they tease each other is funny and lighthearted. But the more I played, the more sloppy the design became. I went to a place with a mission, it didn't tell me where that mission was, eventually I encountered a red ""go there!"" arrow on my mini-map, and when i went where it told me, there was nothing to do there. So I tried another mission and it involved going through an entire level you already went through in FFX just to have someone run away so you have to backtrack through that entire same level again, all with random encounters. This is a sloppy mess.. FINAL FANTASY X 7/10 - By far one of the better Square-Enix games in recent years. The game introduces the sphere grid leveling system for the first and only time which is a bit sad considering how good it was for the min-maxing completionist and gave the game plenty of reason for spamming the Battle Arena to fight some of the toughest enemies in the game. The story to the game is deep and was truly the last Final Fantasy game to date that really wanted you to see it's end. The musical score to the title was one of the series best. The game is packed with content and hands down has the best mini-game of all time; Blitzball. The major set back to this game was how slow the battle pace was during each fight. Great entry to the series and a title to be proud of. For the trophy hunters, achieving a platinum for Final Fantasy X is a walk in the park. FINAL FANTASY X-2 3/10 - The first Final Fantasy game ever to be a direct sequel and wow was this title pathetic. In short, this game is reminiscent to Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. Meaning, it is a game created specifically for girls or old men with cartoon fetishes. The story falls flat, dull, too light hearted and absolutely boring. The battle system re-introduces job based classes to the mix and is a lot quicker than FFX which was a relief. However, the sad truth is 90% of the jobs are useless and purely put in the game to watch the characters transfer from one skimpy outfit to another. Blitzball was re-introduced as a ""manager mode"" style which failed to capture the original beauty of the game. Although this title had alot more things to do in content the title fell short in every aspect. A game to miss. For the trophy hunters be warned, Final Fantasy X-2 is quite easy however annoying and will require a game percentage step-by-step guide to ensure a 100% play-thru on the first attempt. Combining both game scores this title has been given a 5/10.. Really good game. Lots of things to do besides the main quest. It is a pretty hard game though especially X compared to the usual games. It's more about skill when it comes to fighting rather than strength which might interest you.. 8.5 that's a shockingly low score i can only guess the same guy kept making accounts and gave this game negative reviews because to be honest i have played pretty much every RPG going and finished them and they don't get much better than this epically when you take into account the games age hearing peoples complaints about this really did make me laugh the graphics people really this game came out on the ps2 and looks 100% better than it did, and saying that it feels old and dated would lead to me question to why you bought the game in the first place its a remaster not a remake from the ground up and the argument about the graphics guys look at FF7 yes one of the best RPGS ever and graphically rubbish anyway enough of my rant. If your fan of RPG's you will more than likely love FFX and FFX2 even if the girl power theme is a horrible idea in FFX2 getting back to FFX the looks great the improved graphics and the remastered music takes some getting used to but i soon loved it and the comments again about the world leading you down a straight path well yeah for the start of the story the game pretty much leads you down a path which i wouldn't call straight until you reach the calm lands at which point you can pretty do as please, you will be revisiting areas to find new and hidden items, bosses, NPC interactions, hidden areas, summons, finding new player for blitzball, monster capture, so plenty of stuff to do and explore, anyway moving on to Blitz ball one of my favourite mini games of all time think football under water now you will either love or hate this mini game but its in your interest to like it as it pays out useful items if your team wins that is,i love the fact you can recruit NPC to your team as well i spend lot of time deciding what type of team i want. The story still holds up as one of the best ever as does the turn based combat just a quick note if you have never played ffx before be sure to have a guide handy or a friend who played the game combat can seem unfair at times if you don't know the tricks to defeat some of the tricky bosses same thing for goes late game lvling, If some reason you haven't played FFX drop what doing go get a copy and enjoy. Moving on to sigh FFX2 don't worry this will be short now firstly great combat system no problems the world and main characters also no problems apart from the way over the top girl power vibe which would not have been to bad if they did it differently, and then my major problem with FFX2 is the hellish trophies and then their is the Leblanc Syndicate aka team rocket no really they are basically team rocket the act the same predictably fail in the same manner and try and steal your stuff all while delivering bad lines and breaking up a story which mite be OK if they had less to do with it and the ending doesn't really help either and the nail in the coffin was ruining blitzball why, anyway the positives again the game looks great and in terms of combat the game is arguably much stronger than FFX so while it sound like i am saying FFX2 is crap it still one of the best RPG's i have played so finally my verdicts on the games FFX 10/10 FFX2 9/10. This games were released to the PS2 and now got a HD port in the collection, i'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy X, for me the best Final Fantasy making it worth the package for itself. Absolutely fantastic remaster of a classic game. The game has held up well in terms of gameplay, character and story. I think they could have done a bit more with the graphical upgrade and give the option to have the original soundtrack(not that the remastered soundtrack is not awesome) but besides these two very minor points its a fantastic game. Two games for the price of one and additions to the games as well as achievements added make this a well worth purchase of $40 when released and about half that price now!. A true masterpiece. The HD remastered version contains content never before released in America, and the graphics and story still hold up to this day. Unfortunately, this duology holds the travesty that is Final Fantasy X-2.. No. I just can't play this game anymore. I hate it. It's just so... bad. Let's start off with why I didn't give this game a 0/10: Reason 1: The story's... good, I guess. I mean, I like it, I just don't necessarily love it. Reason 2: The music's also okay... but more on that later. Now why it ****. Reason 1: Combat. It's so boring! Here is combat in Final Fantasy: Decide what you want to do. Press buttons. Wait for enemies to attack. Attack. Rinse and repeat. It's pretty boring. And sometimes these fights last FOREVER! You will be sitting on your couch mindlessly pressing buttons for hours. This is, without a doubt in my mind, the WORST example of turn based fighting EVER. Reason 2: The music drones on... and on... on an endless loop. The songs themselves are okay, but the fact that they loop constantly is annoying. Reason 3: The voice acting. I have no words on this topic. Goodbye. Reason 4: SIN'S. FREAKING. TAIL. WHY GAME!?!? WHYYYYYYYY!?!?!?!?!?!?! Reason 5: Let's get away from combat for a minute. Walking around the map is so pointless! I'm not kidding! Aside from ""secret"" treasure chests that you could find in a heartbeat, the game is so linear that there's no point to adding this to the game! I think that about sums it up. As a remake, it's really good! But as a GAME.... Don't pick it up. Just don't. The graphics are meh, the story is meh, the music is meh, but other than that, there isn't anything redeeming about it. I give this game... a 3/10.. The Final Fantasy atmosphere is there, graphics are OK, but characters have stiff movement. Main character is annoying and sub-characters hard to love. The skill upgrade system is unique and good. Fight system turn-based and feels dynamic. Music score great. Game pretty linear until you played more than 10/20 hours. Just can't bother finishing the second time I tried several years later.. Ahh the good old days. I have fond memorys of this game (particularly 10-2) But for sum reason it just doesn't do it 4 me now? It is 1 of the better ffs and u do get 2 games. U knows?. This game is really something else. This to me was the last great Final Fantasy title. The atmosphere was fantastic. A religion banning machina with a doctrine of living in a world where death is inevitable due to a specter of judgement called SIN. To save the world is to destroy it, a contradiction from a past war created a spiral of death that is **** is it? This is your Story! Beautiful remaster, Remixed Music, Sharpened 1080P visuals. Fast battles and a giant sphere grid to populate (Level up). This is a game of Celestial proportions do not pass the blitzball on this one!. A re-release of a very, very good game and a very solid game. The HD reskinning is hit and miss. The issue being a LOT of characters didn't get truly updated, they simply got smoothed out. So you often have high end PS2 modeled characters talking to well done PS3 HD graphical models and the difference can be quite jarring. Out side of that, if you enjoyed X and/or X-2, and you have a HD tv, this is well worth the money.. Divine game! All the problems with the original version has been corrected, the game looks more beautiful, the soundtrack sounds better. What do you want more? If you have a PS3 / PSV you have to play this game!. I was very exciting coming into this but a little disappointed. I never played FFX until I brought this game and I'm not that into it. Gameplay - My only problem is that I was stuck in Mushroom Rock Road with barely any items and I kept dying there should be more Shops available in the game to get items and icons for where to find these shops. I dislike the fixed camera and the random encounters I prefer the chase enemy or run into enemy kind of encounters like in FFXIII or Tales of Symphonia. But this is what you should expect from FF Random Encounters and Fixed Camera Points. I also don't understand the Sphere Grid System at all call me stupid or dumb or whatever I just don't understand it. For people who have played FFX before there's alot of extra's including the chance to fight Dark Aeons and a secret boss called Penance which is an extremely difficult Boss Battle. FFX-2 comes with the Last Mission Edition and some Gameplay Additions you now have the ability to control monsters and you can do other new things. FFX-2 Gameplay - This game shines in the gameplay department because its faster and much more exciting in my opinion. Too bad the bosses and story aren't as exciting or threatening as they were in FFX. Plus we still have fixed cameras and random encounters but that's to be expected of a 2001 & 2003 Final Fantasy Game. Graphics - I like the improved HD Graphics and the Main Menu KH1.5 had a similar Main Menu and I liked that one too. A Good Main Menu for an HD Collection always adds more excitement to play the game regardless of how good or bad it is and I always add points for this because some HD Collections have horrible Main Menu's like the Ratchet & Clank HD Collection. Lip Synching **** in this game. Story - The story for Final Fantasy X didn't really get me all that much but there are some twists and turns here and there to get you excited and more enticed to find out more. FFX-2's story isn't something amazing or exciting its a happy girls tale and 1 that I don't mind. When I played it for the PS2 I really used to hate it but as I play it now I don't think too badly of it anymore. Soundtrack - They remastered all the tracks for FFX which may sound good to some people but for me sounds terrible some songs didn't need to be remastered they were good the way they were. Change isn't always good so I drop points for this one. I'm not sure if FFX-2 had remastered tracks it felt the same to me regardless FFX-2's OST isn't really all that. I do like Memories of Lightwaves Mushroom Rock Road and Zanarkand Ruins Songs I can listen to those songs all day the OST isn't bad but not that great either. Characters - Tidus - The Clueless Idiot. Wakka - The Blitzball Fanatic Lulu - Simple Auron - Badass Yuna - The Chosen One Kimarhi - Silent but Tough Jecht - The Horrible Father FFX-2 Characters - Yuna - is happy and a little more badass Rikku - The Yuffie Kisaragi of Final Fantasy X-2. Paine - The Emo girl but also the Badass one. Replay Value - Moderate why? If your a fan nostalgia I'm not a fan so no nostalgia for me this is my 1st experience with FFX. For FFX-2 I have a little nostalgia. There's also alot of extra things to do in this game over 100 hours so yeah you'll be busy. For FFX-2 you'll want to replay the game to try out the different Dress Spheres and for FFX you'll replay the game again for the experience I usually replay games with long stories to get the full story experience because sometimes there's things you missed when you played the 1st time. Overall - Well in my opinion not your bias opinion its your average FF Game with a unique setting and a somewhat great story. Gameplay is good especially those Limit Breaks and the Dress Spheres adds some originality and fun to battles. Its not worth the $40 I paid for it + you don't get the Art Book and the manual is only 2 pages if you are me you would get mad just really mad. But since your not me you will get this game for $20 which is the price right now which is a better deal.. This game is such a classic. I remember my friends and I would play this game in the seventh grade. Brings back some excellent memories. Normally, I don't like it when they remake games on the PS3, primarily because they are copy and paste jobs, but this game actually is improved over its predecessor. The textures are smoother and they even changed the soundtrack a little. I liked it some areas, however I wish they would have given you an option to hear the original soundtrack. This game, at least for me, is the last final fantasy to be excellent. It's a shame that the series has gone downhill, however this game is good for the price. It's around 20 at gamestop now, so pick it up.. You must play this game, not only is the story line great and you'll get attached to characters throughout the game. You must watch the cut scenes and movie sequences as you'll learn quite a bit about some of the characters. Some parts of the game are just so beautiful and then some are very sad. It's definitely a very emotional game. At times the game can be very tough so my recommendation is that instead of just rushing through the game, stay around and battle stuff to get extra AP, this way you can level your characters up more to make the boss battles easier so you don't get frustrated. This is a must play game and one of the best for this system IMO.. Square Enix have re-released a masterpiece, here. It's unlikely that you will pay much attention to X-2 here, with X being the stand-out title. Impressively updated visuals and sound enhance the experience, along with the slightly improved interface. If you get on your hands and knees and really nitpick, you can find faults. For example, one could argue that not being able to skip cutscenes is a negative, and they can surpass five minutes. Or, the poor lip syncing, although this can partially be forgiven, considering they were PS2 games, and they have only been Remastered, not Remade. The original X way back on PS2 was my favourite game ever made, and this new bundle has flown beyond all expectation. It brings back memories, and deserves no less than 10/10, 5 stars, 100%.. This is based on only playing about 5 hours of X. I have not delved into X-2. I'll give it a benefit of the doubt on some stuff, like being ancient in terms of gamer time, but I doubt I will reach hour 6. Maybe it was more revolutionary back when it came out (I didn't play it then), but this has got to be one of the most ridiculously cut-scened game I have ever ""played"". About 12 minutes of the game has been actual gameplay so far. It wouldn't be so bad if I could skip the cut-scenes or if they weren't so f*cking stupid. I get that there are messages to be had and emotions to be felt, but this is about the least interesting and/or non-abrasive way in which I could receive those messages and emotions. I went in looking for a decent turn-based RPG (which seemed to be shaping up battlewise rather well in the miniscule amount of battle time there was) and ended with a 138 minute tutorial of blitzball I had no desire to learn. I would've stuck with it had they allowed me to skip the ****, but instead decided to put the final nail in the coffin that sealed away any remaining interest I had in the Final Fantasy worlds. I played and liked 1 and 7 (many years ago), but 13 and now this? No thanks.. Final Fantasy X is my favorite game in the series, in terms of story, battle system and character development. The HD version is clearly the version to get, while far from having spectacular graphics, the game has aged well. The improved and much sharper visuals improve the game significantly, because you can see the objects, e.g. chests, spheres, books etc. much better. The music, which was already great, has improved, too. Apart from the improved graphics and sound, the remake also supports trophies, which is nice since it is such a long and quite challenging game.. My favorite RPG of all time. Everything about the remaster is perfect, EXCEPT for what they did to Tidus' face. >.< I have yet to play an RPG that has a better story than FFX.. I was really looking forward to this and pre-ordered it in anticipation. I remember taking a week vacation when this first came out on the PS2 to enjoy it and beat it during that week. I was really looking forward to a 2nd jaunt through in HD and while it looks **** is not without it's issues. For one it runs a little faster on the PS3 making things that require timing/precision nearly impossible. Particularly the Lightning Plains dodging mini-game. Just to be sure I pulled out my original PS2 version and ran it on my PS2 to make sure it wasn't just me slowing down as I got older. :p It's not me. The time to dodge after the flash is FAR less than on the PS2 version making it impossible for myself and a couple of friends who also tried to get the 200 successive dodges in this new version..There are a few other issues including the odd crash but otherwise is fine and a joy to see in HD. I would give the original a 10 back when it first came out. This I can only give an 8 due to those issues mentioned that should have been resolved before shipping.. Neither game is nearly as impressive today as it was back at original launch. The remaster does some nice touchups but overall it still looks like a remastered PS2 game, and since the big draw of both these titles when they were new (mainly FFX) was how hard they pushed the tech, the game is left to rely a lot on the gameplay. Far too many cutscenes, watch more than you play for the first 20 hours or so. No cutscene skip, which should've been implemented for the Remastered version. Battles get repetitive fast. Needing to have every party member do something each battle to get XP makes grinding become very tedious very quickly. Music remixes are a nice touch but completely unnecessary, some tracks (like Via Purifico) are absolutely butchered in the new renditions, overall this was an unnecessary feature and I really would've appreciated an option for the Original tracks. FFX-2 is as painful to sit and play as it's always been. Cool battle system, but everything about it is incredibly embarrassing to play, even when alone. What's really odd is there are frame drops in certain areas, and during spell effects. The game runs at 30fps, but constantly has drops to 20 or lower when big spell effects go off. This wasn't the case with the original titles, this is a matter of upgrading the graphics a *bit* for the remaster, and then failing to optimize properly. If you've played these games before, or still have the original PS2 versions, I'd recommend waiting for a price drop before picking this up. FFX is still a very solid game overall which is what gets this a score higher than 1, but as a remaster, this package leaves a lot to be desired.. This is a beautiful remaster of an incredible entry in the Final Fantasy series. This package contains two very well fleshed out RPGs with amazing battle systems in both X and X-2 and an awe-inspiring world with fully developed, unique characters. The re-done character models look great, though the eyes do look a little vacant. The environment is vibrant and looks stunning in HD and the remastered soundtrack is terrific. X has an epic storyline that will grip any RPG fan. International content is added for those that didn't have access to it before. This includes new super bosses, abilities, job classes, a creature capture system (which add mounds of depth to X-2's customization options) and a plethora of other extras that will make old and new fans alike really enjoy this compilation. Very small issues such as unskippable cut-scenes in X and slightly longer loading times really do not detract from the experience. Though this package is great value for money, X-2's story did disappoint me quite a lot.. Here is a classic game. When it first released on ps2 I remember being extremely excited to play it, and I was happy to see that it lived up to the series name. Unlike any of the other Final Fantasy games I played I never achieved 100% completion with this one, and I'm happy to say that the HD Remake gave me the chance to correct that. Along with the greatly updated visuals, in particular the new character models for the player characters, which do look beautiful, all of the new content adds to that already great experience. If you're looking for a game to sink time into, or bang for your buck, this is the game.. Aside from the strongly anti-religious commentary found in FFX (which may offend or delight you), I will say that its narrative is quite excellent from a pure storytelling aspect. Hands-down the best in the series with several well-paced, shocking reveals that you don’t see coming and don’t feel contrived. If you play through it twice, you’ll notice a lot you missed the first time around and the ending will stay with you. Gameplay wise, it’s fantastic. It feels like they took the best parts of each previous game and combined them. Some reviews say it feels outdated compared to modern RPGs. I disagree. It takes strategy and more than simple button mashing to beat. The sphere grid system: wow. Unique among RPGs. It gives you total control over how you develop each character and takes planning to prevent having to do a lot of backtracking. Endgame leveling is an unparalleled experience and more than simply finding the enemy who drops the most XP and fighting it repeatedly. Additionally, ","i love so many things about this game it truly brings back memories of one of the best final fantasy games of the past it improves there where it needs to be improved but leaves the core untouched . the game is linear which I didn’t mind, but it does get grindy as you progress and some battles are actually hard ."
"1,192.The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition","Had a blast finally playing through this game and being able to play it solo. Is a short but very fun experience. Added content was welcome, I am fortunate to have this on my 3DS. Wish there was still a way to access this for a new audience.. The solo play in this game is amazing, too bad it's only available through the defunct DSi Ware.. I love the zelda franchise, every game is absolutely fantastic, Until I played this game.. This game was a massive disappointment. The zelda franchise doesn't work multiplayer. Would not recommend.. Game: The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition Genre: Action Adventure Developer: Grezzo Publisher: Nintendo System: Nintendo 3DS (3DS) Year of Release: 2011 Length of Playthrough: 6 Hours Total Score: 78/100 Value Score: 7.8/10 • Story: 5/10 • Characters: 6/10 • GamePlay: 10/10 • Graphics: 9/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 8/10 • Length: 3/10 • Replay Value: 10/10 • Player Value: 7/10 Pros +Single player mode added +Exclusive to the Anniversary edition is Realm of Memories and Hero's Trial which includes additional stages +Multiplayer centered Zelda with up to 4 playable characters via wireless play +Sound effects enhanced due to no longer being limited to the GBA's soundchip Cons -No online MP support -Very short -Story is weak with little to no cutscenes -Additional content has no bosses. Why this game isnt out in the E-Shop any more confuses me beyond belief. This might be one of the best Zelda games. It leaves a lot of untouched potential, like online play, and maybe more levels. But it is still amazing! It is Zelda, with emphasis on multiplayer! No online, few levels, the game not being available anymore, along with levels maybe being a little bit to long without possibility to save bring the game down from 10 to 9 in my opinion. Stlll a MUST HAVE! 9 out of 10. Only just got round to playing this because i was waiting for the opportunity to get four people together to play it. Although you can play single player you'd be missing the point a bit. It must be stressed that this was always designed as a multiplayer game and the way you have to work together to solve puzzles and defeat bosses is quite unique. It's a bit short and a bit shallow compared to the best Zelda games but it's still fun and it's FREE (or at least it was).. This game is pretty good when you play it alone. After awhile, it can get annoying having to switch back and forth, especially in the Vaati fight. However, if you have a friend with a 3DS/DS, than this is a must have. I LOVE the multiplayer option. And it's free! I mean, why not!. The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition for DSiWare is a remake of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords for the Gameboy Advanced (The game was packaged with Legend of Zelda: Link To The Past for Gameboy Advanced). This game is the prequel to Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure for Gamecube and the storyline sequel to Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap for Gameboy Advanced. The game consists of multiple Links working together with different items and utilites to beat enemies, gather a large amount of rupees, complete stages and challenge bosses. The main game is the multiplayer mode where you and 2-4 of your friends use local link feature of the DSi or 3DS (Wifi multiplayer isn't available) to work together to complete levels while also competing for the highest total rupees at the same time. When a Link is KOed, they need to pay a fee to continue playing and the fee will continue to increase to a higher ammount on each death. If the fee can not be payed, it is game over for everyone. New to this version is a Single Player campaign in which one person swaps between two Links. The unactive Link in Single Player is invincible and this tactic can be used to lure enemies or distract them. Some puzzles are modified in Single Player to make them possible to complete and in certain situations where both Links need to be controlled simultaneously, the artificial intelligence will take over the second Link and help you. There are multiple stages and levels with varying themes and difficulties. Abilities, new levels and achievements can can be unlocked by completing certain stages or gaining a high enough rupee total at the end of a set of maps. There is also a tutorial area for newcomers to practice and hone their skills on game mechanics, items and utilities. This game is it definitely high quality for a free release and a great way of celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series. Some fans of The Legend of Zelda series might be turned off by the drastically different feel of this game compared to other games in the series but this free multiplayer and single player experience is worth trying out while it is still available, you don't lose anything by trying it out so why not?. This is a great game for any Legend of Zelda fan and is perfect for The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary. I was unable to play the original Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventure bundled with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the GameBoy Advance, so this was a welcomed release. This game is fun and easy to play, but does have some challenging puzzles later on. If you have a friend with a DSi or 3DS and this game, it is even more fun with the multiplayer mode! You can't beat the price either: FREE! :-). Why would you give this game anything under an 8 out of ten? Firstly, it's free. Secondly it's great. I really don't see how anybody on this site could give it negative reviews! unless they are trolls (or something like that). Seriously, just download it, even if it does disappoint, it's free (until February next year of course).. An amazing game (considering it's free for now). Although there are plenty of levels to compete against with your friends, it is just a little too boring playing by yourself, which could be a bad thing for some. A must-have for any Dsi/3DS or Zelda fan!!. It may not be the best game out there, but it's fun and it's free. The puzzles are quite simple for the most part, but I found the ones with the Magnetic Glove to be pretty enjoyable. Randomly-generated levels provide lots of replay value, as do challenges like getting 5,000 Rupees in each stage. The graphics aren't top-of-the-line for 3DS/DSi, but they're colorful and clear. The music gets a bit repetitive after a while, especially if you spend a long time in a level. Since I knew this game was originally multiplayer only, I expected the single-player mode to be a bit awkward--but once I started playing I never had any problems with it. Actually, I think that single-player may be easier, since you don't have to worry about one of your friends running off to grab rupees instead of stepping on the switch you need to progress :) Anyway, it's free, so unless you're almost out of memory blocks on your DS, there's no reason not to download it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't know, man. maybe it's the music, or the gameplay, but this Zelda just doesn't feel right. Maybe it's because i'm playing it alone? Either way, it's dissapointing to see that nintendo reused sound clips from Minish cap, whithout even bothering to record them like in Starfox 64. And the overall game feels sluggish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a fun entry into the Zelda series. Although it is fairly short and not all that challenging, this game is not to be missed, especially since it is available for free.","the zelda franchise doesn't work multiplayer. Would not recommend . zelda: four swords was a massive disappointment . no online MP support, few levels, the game not being available anymore ."
"1,193.Maboshi's Arcade","Three games for the price of one in the innovative WiiWare title. Six if you count the fact that you can download a version of the game over Wi-Fi to your Nintendo DS to play on the move. WiiWare is the downloadable game service on Nintendo’s Wii home console. It lets you download smaller sized and lower priced games direct to your console, and offers a distinctly different range of games than you can pick up through more traditional retail outlets. The channel showcases game concepts that may not have been profitable to release elsewhere. It’s astonishing that without WiiWare, MaBoShi may never have seen the light of day. Each of its three game concepts are so unconventional and slight that I think most gamers might not give them a second glance, even at this very affordable price. MaBoShi takes advantage of few of the Wii’s features but still delivers a solid and innovative experience. It allows players to use their Miis as avatars in the game, send replays to other players via WiiConnect24, and also has the previously mentioned Wi-Fi download to Nintendo DS. But there is no sign of motion control. In fact, whilst the wii remote is used as a pointer for the game menu, MaBoShi is firmly a one button game. Or perhaps that be three one button games, as there are actually three main game modes: Circle, Bar and Square. Each mode is played differently, but with the same objective - to score one million points. In the Wii version there are three game panels on screen, allowing simultaneous multi-player. With multiple players the game adds an extra feature into the mix, known simply as the Effect System. Destroying an enemy will cause a bubble to appear. This bubble moves across the screen and over other game panels where it can affect other games in progress. This means that players managing their own separate games may be influenced by these effects eminating from other game panels, and players may therefore choose whether they wish to help or hinder their fellow players. It’s not often you get to choose whether to play cooperatively or competitively, and I really like this aspect of the gameplay. Circle mode - my personal favourite - finds you in control of a constantly rotating circle, able to switch the direction in which it is spinning by pressing the A button. By controlling the speed and momentum of the circle, you must guide it around the screen. You can use the variety of dynamic obstacles that appear on screen as a means to achieving the precise movement required to collide with the enemies and collect bonus multipliers. The aim of each round is to collide with all enemies as they appear onscreen, before they move off the game area. It is game over as soon as one enemy leaves the play field. The depth of control in this game mode is simply astonishing, and infrequent taps of the A button allow almost analog control of speed and momentum. Special mention must also go to the level design in this game, as it is balanced to perfection. In fact, if you’re good enough to score a million you will most likely do so near the end of all available 40 levels. Bar mode sees you manoeuvring a rotating bar through a vertically scrolling level. The bar rotates around a core, which only moves using the momentum created by the bar and only when the A button is held. The bar can be used to defeat enemies and smash blocks, but if the core touches an enemy or a block the game ends. There are also pinballs, powerups and much more to contend with. I find this game the most difficult of the three. Square mode sees the player controlling a single block that leaves a trail of fire behind. This trail of fire can burn obstacles, and can even set other parts of the trail alight. You must navigate around the screen, at your own pace, setting fire to all the obstacles with the help of the occasional bomb, whilst keeping an eye out for bonus multipliers. The screen scrolls when the player moves, and if an obstacle or part of the trail of fire hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends. Created by Japanese pinball experts Mindware Corp, MaBoShi is a triumph of game design and deserves your attention. If you fancy a challenge I can heartily recommend trying to reach one million points in one or all of the game modes (I’ve only managed to do it myself in circle mode on the DS download version) - the game has a lot to offer if you’re willing to give it a try. Nintendo seem to be of the same mind, as they recently released an updated and expanded version of the Square game for their DSiWare download service under the name of Flametail (USA) also known as Trailblaze: Puzzle Incinerator (EU) and Moyasu Puzzle: Flametail (JPN).",WiiWare is the downloadable game service on Nintendo’s Wii home console . it lets you download smaller sized and lower priced games direct to your console . each of its three game concepts are so unconventional and slight that i think most gamers might not give them a second glance .
"1,194.DJMax Respect","Doesn't matter when, but you will be able to play until the end of time, offline as it should be. Unlike the far inferior Steam version. But eh, money talks. And my money is done with your Steam version.. I enjoyed the game and more fun in the online mode. Difficult in the first hours of the game, for me it was like that, something has changed since the first hours of the game.. Why not? With the massive and lovely initial library of songs, great difficulty spread, and with the promising updates of songs, this is a real treat for anyone who loves rhythm games.. DJMax has been a niche rhythm series similar to Beatmania where a bunch of notes rain down and you hit it with proper timing. If you don't know beatmania/iidx, then think Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero... most people who aren't heavy into video games usually still know those titles. There's quite a selection of music genre, and you might even get hooked on some songs that are not **** you typically listen to just because they're so darn catchy. This is a Korean game, so you will encounter Korean songs and some with broken English but who cares. The music is very well-done. This is the best release of the DJMax series thus far. It's hard, there are no gear effect compensations from previous versions (like protection from breaking your combo) so a full combo means a lot more than what it used to. The song collection is MASSIVE, and they have been putting out plenty of DLC to cover previous versions of the game. Furthermore, they're doing DLC partnerships with the likes of Rayark, which I find to be really cool.. Favorite rhythm title from all time for me, great art design, lots of music to play (also included most songs from previous generation). I didn't tried the one on PSVITA , so it has been years from the last djmax i played and the quality is satisfied. Try it and practicing you will be addictive to this legendary title!. A great rhythm game with lots of content in the base game and lots of future dlc to expand the already large songlist,very difficult starting off as you get used to the various buttons but very addictive and rewarding as you get better. This is an unforgettable aesthetic cruise to the world of diverse music. If you like something similar to Guitar Hero or osu! then DJMax Respect simply must like you. This is simple in its idea, but in reality a complex music game that will certainly carry you away for long hours.. This game is pretty hard. But challenging game too. Find 1 difficulty song first.","a great rhythm game with lots of content in the base game and lots of future dlc to expand the already large songlist . the music is very well-done, and you might even get hooked on some songs that are not **** you typically listen to ."
"1,195.Pro Evolution Soccer 2017","PES has refined year on year in this generation, continuing to improve, but PES 2017 is the crowning moment. With different tactics and styles that are effective, and unique players, great goal feel and lovely control, PES 2017 just feels so good to play. It may well be the greatest football game ever made. Really Good Carrer Mode Really Good Champions League Mode and Very Good Game. The best football game in my opinion Very entertaining, I wish Konami would make a soccer game like 2017 and 2013 again. Amazing and fun game easy to platinum but and realistic and fun tactics but when you the ball will go everywhere but in the goal and the career mode is boring but the kick off you can spend a lot of fun time and it has teams and players not in fifa. This was better than than the new ""Efootball 2022"", I hope Konami regret itself for changing all of these good things. This was still better than the ""Next gen Efootball"" , I hope konami regret theyself for changing all of these good things. Love the game style that allows heavy body clash, very smooth gameplay! Cons: * Observed in Master League, sometimes the uniforms of two teams got same color! Observed at least when Eibar vs Barcelona. * Separated transfer fee / wage budget, very stupid design! What on earth can do you when you have plenty of transfer fee available but no wage left?!. It changed for very well this PES and for the first time in years I am playing more to this than the game of EA, FIFA. Well well!. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is a fairly good game, and in my opinion the best football game on the PS4 so far (I haven't played PES 2018 yet). The graphics aren't special and not as good as Fifa, but the gameplay is where Pro Evolution Soccer games were always miles ahead of the Fifa series. But when will Konami finally fix the problem with the passing? The ball, when a pass misses the targeted player, always seems to end up straight into the feet of a player of the other team. And this problem is certainly not exclusive to the PES series, every other football game has this problem! Why can't the ball just roll to a spot somewhere in the field where there is no player around? Also it seems to me that kicking the ball towards the goal from far away is now even more difficult than before. I loved the old Uefa Champions League games on the PS1, where you could kick the ball at the goal from halfway the field. You would not score a goal that way, but at least you could kick the ball far away and with a bit of luck the keeper of the other team pushed the ball over the back line and you got a corner kick out of it!. The best football game I've played until today. Inside the 4 lines is a very interesting game for those who perceive and like football. The graphics are good, the animations and the sound as well. It loses in the licenses of the teams and others, which limits the experience. But hold on! Personally it made me feel my first experience of PES 3 on Playstation 2, I do not know what but it did.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is good but has its flaws. The good in my opinions are the customization and long shots and quite exciting matches. The bad is commentary is the same as 16 and is very basic and annoying, same game plan as if you pass in a zigzag shape you always beat the defense, you cannot tackle near the throw in line coz if you do it will always rolls out for a throw in. The CPU never gets booked or foul me, and a local 2 player is a nightmare if you have loaded kits as it end up restoring back to default, online isn't reliable and so end up just playing against the CPU all the time.. Bought this Pes straight away because Pes 2016 was so good, as it rewarded quick thinking and intelligence, but this new Pes does the complete opposite, reward crap football, i. e. a slow game for crosses and people who lump through balls in the air. A football sim no longer for the hardcore football fans but the casual crowd.. Although the PES series has been the one i have usually preferred in the soccer game series, it seems that these games aren't improving much. This game's biggest issues is poor licenses and the lack of exciting game modes, when compared to the older games of the series. My Club is very time consuming and finding an online match can take some time for an odd reason. The gameplay is very precise, but sometimes teammate AI can be quite dumb and senseless. Many of these game's issues are very little, but issues with licenses can be fixed with online files that can uploaded to the game via hooking up the USB in to the PS4. If one does not want to go through the hassle of uploading these files and one wants a more authentic experience I recommend PES 2016.. This is my fifth title in the Pro Evo series. I like how PES connects you to the game of football through its unique presentation, music and gameplay. I will briefly mention the things I like before going on about how crap this is. So the positives are that It is an alternative to FIFA, has a nice selection of songs and includes UEFA Champions league License. I also like how they've release FTP version for 2016 and 2017. However, despite that, I don't think one should invest their time or money into this crap. Here are the bad things, Limited Licenses, Repetitive commentary, Lack of new game modes or changes. Lag cheaters, High level of scripting. 90% of goals scored through crosses or rebounds. No rewards for dribbling/skills or possession. Tackles are so easy you don't need to do anything, just hold a button and you'll win the ball. People who say that PES has a better gameplay are either die-hard fans who can't accept the flaws in the game nor have they ever played another football game, or newcomers or those who don't play a lot or the ones who casually play offline. The game feels smooth but it doesn't mean that the gameplay is superior. Some people also say that in PES you can control the midfield and play how you'd play in real life. But that's not true either, It takes one shot for the ball to go from one end to another. Crosses are so OP. Last year, it was the R2 shot. This game continues to have so many flaws, it is better to stay away from it. Now, the only way I could enjoy this is by playing offline or friendlies but it is quite boring unlike FIFA which you have to agree has better offline game modes especially the new journey mode. Lastly, I hate the general perception that many people in the community have that PES is for pros and FIFA is for kids or noobs. Or, how they'd quickly point at you after a defeat and say ""Go play FIFA"" These people are just delusional and actually are the real noobs. I hate it because I once was a part of it. I have mentioned FIFA a lot of times here and I will say that it is also a frustrating game at times but it is miles better than this piece of **** (pos) known as PES. I have given this game many chances in the last few years but I can't take anymore. So Goodbye forever!. fun game, howere the depth compared to the fifa games is very lackluster. The game has almost no real teams in it, as I can guess that they didn't get the rights to print the names on there. However, the mechanics are great, and it feels good to play.. A major step forwards from last year. More realistic than ever, yet it holds up a fine balance between realism and fun. Not a big fan of any of the ""career"" modes available. The trophies are as ridiculous as ever.. I been playing this series off and on since it was called Goal Storm back on the ps1. We've certainly seen our fair share of ups and downs with every release over the years. The best version I personally played up until now was 2009 but I think Konami have finally put it all together again in 2017. I know this because I cannot tear myself away. It's always ""one more game and then I'll go to bed"". I haven't had this feeling since PES 2009, considered by many to be the best iteration. This year they really put it all together. Well almost. The overall package really shines. Master League is once again very engaging and entertaining with a plenty of drama in the big games that only PES can provide. This mode is the meat of the game. Every match seems to play out differently and I've had to adjust tactics and have scored in so many numerous ways i've really lost track. Headers, Free kicks, corner kicks, one time blasts, crazy dribbles, hilarious own goals, and 35 meter bombs even! The gameplay is very organic and for the most part challenging yet rewarding. You will see your tactics play out on the field and on the surface things look very shallow. However, once you dig in the options available are astounding. You no longer need to really solely on speed. Great passers and technicians are once again able to make an impact on the field. Post players really can muscle in on the defense and provide aerial options. That's not to say everything is perfect. On the higher difficulty levels there are still some very questionable scripted moments, but I can live with it since it keeps the big games close. It can get frustrating at times, but the big thing that really puts it all together is the greatly improved goalkeepers. Even if the AI gets a great shot on goal, what used to be an automatic goal can turn into and amazingly improbable save by your keeper. It keeps you on edge and I've had some wild games that bring me back to the golden era of PES. Simply put, the gameplay on the field is head and shoulders above the competition and the Master League sim is finally engaging again. Also improved is the defensive AI. They will actively look to block shots in the box and in general do not let in too many of those crazy through balls as in years past. When the cpu goes with a defensive strategy, it is genuinely touch to find openings on goal. All in all, game play is simply great. The fox engine is a treat. There are some wonky collisions every once in a while but the ball physics are awesome. I love how players battle and jostle for the ball and the outcome of any play is never certain. Most players look good and the pitches are fine. Graphics are good as can be expected and the animations are fantastic. Wish there were more stadium options and some more dynamic weather too. That's just being picky though Adding in a player salary budget has added an extra little challenge to the mix forcing you to make some tough decisions with your players. You now have a separate transfer budget and you must manage both. However, transactions are fast and smooth and bringing in loan players is very simple. You can also add an option to buy out a player, so if you like anyone on loan you can put them on salary to keep them on your team. The youth team is back as well, but unfortunately one the big negatives is the Regen players. I just had Ibrihamovic appear in my youth team a year after he retired at a 77 rating. LOL, that is dumb and I wish I could turn the feature off. There really is only one negative I can give here and it's the lack of licenses. It is very easy to load an option file yet this really should be resolved by Konami in the future. We should not have to hassle with this and the game should be ready to go straight out of the box. Not that big of a deal and if you've played PES before you should be used to it. But it's time for Konami to pay for these licenses. That and the option to turn off the regen players would be a welcome change. However, I have to say that not only is this game a great soccer sim, it's really up there with all the best sports games like NBA 2k and MLB the Show. Good job by Konami. PES is back baby!. pes 17 is the best sport game in the hostory and its gameplay is perfect. I think that is better than fifa 17. konami suprised me with pro evolotion soccer 2017. thank you konami !!. pro evolution soccer 2017 is a breathe taken game with great graphics and is realistic so that is good its on Xbox one PS4 PS3 and Xbox 360 in this game you can play with a lot of brilliant players but a problem in this game is the player faces dont look like the footballers in real life but i think its better then fifa because better graphics you play with famous players and is well designed i give it a 8/ 10. As a long-time fan of FIFA, I hadn't try a PES game since the glorious days of SNES and International Suuuuper Staaar Soccer (Deluxe!). In short, the game seems to be somehow closer to a ""real"" football game. With FIFA, games develop in ways that you wouldn't expect in a real life game, whereas with PES games you think ""that could very well happen"". The physics aspect of the game are great though some of the moves are sloppy. My main beef with this game is how difficult it is to navigate. Figuring out how to even play against a friend with the FIFA control setups, required a Google search. The lack of licenses is also frustrating. Even after downloading them and managing to have the actual names in (most) teams, once I begun a ""Career"", the changes were not there. All in all, in terms of the actual gameplay, PES is solid, fun and different from FIFA. It takes some time to adapt to the style but it is enjoyable. I gave it a 7/10 due to the inherent difficulties in navigating the menus and options. They are definitely not easy to change or understand. In the end, FIFA is easier to play, it has all the teams you love and, most likely, you and your friends already know how to play it. As such, Konami has a long way to go before being the best option.. Amazing soccer game, very fun and reallistic, the graphics are very good, etc, my only problem with this game are the same things to play, master league, become a legend, and my club is a horrible copy of ultimate team, but and giving a 9 because the gameplay is very good, much better than fifa. I've never seen such a bad football game, it's a thief and my players are always slow, no matter what team I'm using or what I'm up against, it was a waste of money. Simply horrible, the game is always decided before you even start, my players do not run and the opponents are always excited, every back ball results in an opponent's attack and everything kicked away from my area turns rebound, I want to please Konami Stop making these games and accept that it will never be like FIFA is. The worst ever. Konami is just playing god to control whether you win or lose. Totally nonsense. I have played more than 10 versions from winning eleven to pes. I would never spend a penny on pes again.. The PES 2017 MyClub was ruined with the scripting/handicap Konami, specially the one based on Team Strenghts (above level 5 specially)... KONAMI is silent about it, but older players are not stupid. Like me, there's players in our clan that plays PES since it's first version, also we have played PES 2016 everyday, specially MyClub, which I have won 21 open club tournaments... But in 2017 many already gave up from playing due the clearly matches ""manipulation"", balancing, or whatever you want to name it... It will be my case as well, already trying to sell the game or playing outside MyClub only, which I couldn't notice such problems.... It has some faults but is a way better game than fifa in my opinion having played both games. The graphics look far more realistic than the fifa cartoonish graphics and the gameplay itself feels much smoother and more real than fifa. The lack of licences dont bother me as there is a option file that users can download that sorts all that out no problem. I like the fact that the opposition adapt to the way you play in the game, for instance u keep going down the wings the computer will adapt to that to stop it so then you have to adapt your tactics to find alternative ways through. I find the online divisions very addictive and keeps me coming back. The negatives are the lag cheats, some people who are rubbish on the game will attempt to lag cheat at times to confuse your defence and keeper and that can become very annoying but not every opponent does that just a sad minority. The other negative is the percentage of getting a black ball superstar are very low and cost 10,000gp a go and you dont make around just over 2k for every online division game you win and you have contracts to pay out of that wich seem to come around fast, so basically to get enough gps to spin agents they want you to spend money on gold coins wich is 250 gold coins a spin and I think is just over £7 for just over 1000 coins I believe so no thanks I wont by them and instead have to farm in either sim or novice cup wich is very boring. I think there should be higher rewards as you go up the divisions but it stays the same and I also think there should be more v com taurnys added to aquire good gp, as when u completed all the ones there is then u get poor rewards from them there after. Also there should be a way to get the lag cheats banned, a way that konami can see exactly what there were doing with there connection during the vital points of the game, as them lag cheats are chasing people away. Apart from them negatives, I find the game a far better experience than fifa and highly addictive, I have played it every day since the release date and will continue to till next years comes out where hopefully the few negatives I have will been sorted out by then. All in all I would recommend the game and I would say build a strong team before going intoo the divisions online as you may find them tough at 1st but once you make a team you feel happy with the results will come and practice makes perfect.. I gave this game a solid 8, it's the best football game I remember to play... the animations are cool, the graphics are excellent for a football game but the best thing is the AI intelligence, they are really improved and it's quite a challenge at Superstar level, took me a little bit to move from Star to Superstar. The cons are the few songs that the game have, the online servers should be better and the licenses this year are the worst compared to the last years and that's why I scored this game with an 8 instead of a 9 or 10. If you like football this game is for you!. One of the best football games I have ever played. One thing who I dislike is the difficulty of the AI. I usually play on the highest but it still feel a bit easy. The graphics on some of the players are just outstanding. The animations are fluid and alot better from its competitor, FIFA. The goalkeepers are now (FINALLY) alot better this year and well done to konami for that. PES 2017 offers amazing realistic gameplay. If you are a football fan, you will very much likely enjoy this game!. This game is rubbish. The interface, player movement and AI is just awful. They seem to be running on ice. Plus, faces and personalities on each player are unrealistic. The gameplay looks more simplistic and the ball physics may be good, but this does not compensate anything. Needless to say about the lack of licences which feels totally unacceptable in 2016. FIFA is much much better. Period.. I think this game has the best gameplay from all the football games made until today. This is by far the most balanced , they fixed the goalkeepers , A.I. is smarter and harder to beat than before and the big players are even better individualised. You can expect to get goals from 30 m or more from top shooters like Ronaldo for example.There are a lot of pluses on the game regarding gameplay and defences are stronger. Graphics are great , and producers made it easier regarding data import so licencies and kits is no longer a big problem. what still lacks compared to FIFA for example is the variety of game mods. This is a big reason for which many people still play FIFA even though they see the big quality difference in terms of game play. There are not many co op game mods in the game and the most plsyed game mode myclub has no co op mode, while if you play against a friend you don't lose contract playes level doesn't grow. There is also not possible to play something like pro clubs in FIFA, to have a club with more players playing co op, the 2 vs 2 co op is gone. While the part of licencies is a matter of money and ea has many exclusivity with clubs and is understandable that is hard to compete there, the variety of game mods shouldn't be an issue to improve. But al in all a solid 9 for the fantastic game play , the importance of tactics and how instant be seen any tactical change, the data file importing system and for the care that Konami has and fixed stuff every week and informs the users.(plus that most changes in the game are made after what people request on few big PES specialized forums). IMO one of the best PES games although I wish the pace was a bit slower. I can see where a lot of the negative reviews coming from. I think that most of the bad reviews that speaks about scripting coming for those we jump on the game playing with the most basic controls and on high difficulty levels like superstar, that’s where the scripting is prominent. PES is about the right balance between difficulty, controls and camera. I personally play on regular on full manual using broadcast camera, that’s where the game shines for me. With full manual players stats are still factored in. Camera also makes or breaks the game experience. I Don’t think the PES teams are doing a good job with the camera angle settings most of them are awkward and make the ball physics looks weird.. So another year another PES game and now after 3 months or so from its release i think it ll be a good time to review the game with a cool head...I am amazed from the rave and reviews that this game gets...I am even more amazed from the fact that people believe that this is the best PES ever or that it is even better than the glorious PS2 days i believe that none of these people have actually played the game in PS2 as this game has no resemblance to the great PES titles of the bygone PS2 **** here is why: 1.Gameplay aint bad at **** is by no means great or very good but it aint **** is **** feel that the players have a weight in them like actual human beings,unlike FIFA where they weigh about 10 pounds,you fell that they actually step on grass and not on ice like the EA's product and the ball feels like a **** as an overinflated plastic globe.Match pacing is really nice and animations are at least **** get some great games here and there and nice football **** downside to all of that is that most of the time you feel like you are playing the same match over and over again.I have scored more than 150 goals with the same exact **** cross to the near post followed by a one touch finish.Rinse.Repeat.I always play with the worst teams in the game so it can e a little bit chalenging and not only it isnt but this game is way easier than the last PES if that can be **** you make the mistake and choose a great team or a very good team then you can end the game 7-1 or 8-1 as every shot that you ll take can go in,or if it does not go in it ll go very very close to the net,it seems that every shot from anywhere on the pitch is a big chance to score,especially the R2 ones that are virtually unstoppable.Another bad thing is that if you lose possesion even for a little bit the cursor changes and your player freezes,even though that he has a chance to win the ball back **** cursor problem is horrendous.Especially in defence where the AI can select the center back when you need the left back and if you press L1 then the cursor might go to the center forward for some **** defensive system is bad,your team does not feel like a cohesive unit that tries to defend it rather feels like a Mario game where the attack starts from the easier level that being your forwards and progresses onto the more difficult levels and finally to the Bowser who in this instance is your keeper.Your centre backs are mostly out of position,your defensive midfielders seem oblivious to the runs that are being made by the attackers and your wing backs are constantly playing in a universe or their **** for the offensive **** the ball movement is non existent.I am a football coach at the younger leagues as a side job and every time i play this game i pause and try to swallow my anger.Your team mates are going all over the place (i cant even count how many times i saw my two center forwards together on the byline for some reason),your midfielders do not create space so you can pass the ball,your wing backs do not overlap even in the most blatant situations..i could go on and on and on,anyone who has played the sport on a professional or even semi pro level can indicate all of the wrong off the ball movements that your players make and lastly the ""tactics"" like TIki -taka and so on are poorly **** can still play the same game without **** dont need them to win or to turn a game around. 2.Presentation:There is no presentation.Nothing.Same sound as PES 2015,2016 commentary is god awful,you feel that youare playing a generic match all the time even when you play a rivalry /derby game and the licences are still a huge **** it can be solved if you have time and a good option file but it is 2016.Just make the unlicenced teams a little bit more close the official counterparts.JUst have London FC wear **** pink. 3.Game Modes:ML is very blunt,very boring and not **** have no control on your transfer fees as the ""agent"" chooses the amount,the scouting system is incredibly bad and you can practically make a team consisting of 17-18 year old free agents withh 78 **** do not interact with your players,you do not interact with the **** are there to press the buttons.I wont even write about BAL as i believe that there is no need.Read a review from PES 2009 and there you have **** is exactly the same. Overall:4/10.I dissagree 100% with the ""all that matters is the gameplay"" **** aint like **** customer pays 60 euros to buy a game that excels in every department not just the **** pay for the game to have a great sound,great commentary,great gameplay,great and immersive gamemodes and great presentation.That is why you pay that amount of money for yearly **** has an ok gameplay and bad sound/commentary/immersion/game **** is time to put the series to rest.Sadly.. Gameplay wise this really is the finest football sim ever made, but sadly everything else in PES 2017 is a little bit ""meh"", especially in terms of the presentation, and don't get me started on the ****ing commentary. I ONLY play MyClub nowadays which has become an exercise in tedium most of the time. At the time of writing, two months after release, only 60,000 people have played a pvp match in MyClub, that may explain why whenever I do play a MyClub online match, matchmaking takes ages, and when it does find me an opponent they are usually in Spain/Portugal and have a HUGE lag advantage. Does anyone in the UK play PES??? I really wish Konami and EA would team up to make the perfect game, PES game play and everything else FIFA.. It's a interesting game and when you play it it gets your favorite game but it's teams are low .it's graphic is nice but it's not near to real and every player is perfect in this game I prefer play fifa than Pes because that had more team than this game that parts are more by the way it has champions legue and it has better physical body than fifa it's a bit fast their players are a bit fat and lights in this game is awful this game is good but it can be so better than now. Now my favorite game became a massive dissapointment. A lot of things been copied from fifa series games. At most game scripts and ai gameplay been copied from there. The game become much difficult than before - playing demo i thought it was better goalkipper and more manual passing and shooting BUT NO. First of all ai is cheater - it does things that real player cant do and plus it does that things simultaneously with a lot of his players. Then scripts that when you play this game a lot and you learn all of them this game becomes miserable agression provoking joke that destroys your nerves. I dont want to play against cheater, i want the same abilities. Also economy in my club has become a casino where you alway loosing or just cant earn gp because the cost of contracts for good players equals your gp which you earn only by winning. Also 2% chance to get black ball(best player) which costs 10000 gp is for fools who want to donate real money for their favorite game and still get silver ball player. Uninstalled that brain damage.. Initially I thought PES 17 was great but after couple months you can see a lot of flaws. The players are slow and studder too much. If you lose possession the player freezes and can't win the ball back. Playing vs the computer is brutal. All they do is slide tackle you non stop and fouls don't get called very often. Not as many fun modes as FIFA 17. If you are looking for one game this year FIFA 17 is just plain more fun on the pitch and more interesting modes to play and licensing .. First of all, I bought the game, spent half an hour try to upload the option file, turns out there are limitations on number of images you can upload. So, I updated the Premier league, the classics, some la liga and a bit of the rest. Not cool. The overall gameplay is not too bad. I am one of the few people on the planet only play against COM. Myclub is actually quite fun. You start off the difficulty from regular up to superstar so you have a taste on different levels of CPU and how it progressively gets harder. In top player, you could still beat a team overall above 80 with you team overall 68. Once it goes to superstar, the difficulty changes drastically. In top player or below, you can keep the ball on your team, if the COM has the ball, you can pressure it and get it back on a timely fashion. Occasionally, COM will score some ridiculously goals on you but you will be 3 or 4 goals ahead, so no one really cares. Once you get into superstar, **** is about the hit the fan. If you have a 70 overall agasint 65 overall on COM. Not only you would not be able to keep the ball most of the time (from 70:30 to 55:45). A lot of time, you will have zero shot on goal. The COM's defence is insane, I play procession game and once you work you way through to the box (if you try hard enough), your shots get block. Change strategy to cross, could not even cross, the ball just get blocked or the cross is getting no where or cleared. On your defence, well, COM will manage to keep the ball so a lot harder to win it back. And sometimes, their ridiculous goal does matter now. In a hard 0:0 game, and at 85 min mark, COM just make some crazy passes either destroy your defence and score or made some crazy consecutive volley passes into the box and followed by a crazy volley and score. So if you are new, and going to play masterleague where you start your own team (which is 65 overall) and going to play champion league in superstar. You will get destroyed. Like crushed. So don't. Let's face it, your players are **** low TS, all others teams in the league are like 75 overall, in superstar level, you will be destroyed (I feel worst in this than in DS 3). Go play myclub and have a feel of it. You will soon realise your 80 overall team can win 70 overall COM but once your rating is similar or lower, you will struggle. For those who are cheapskates like me (don't spend money on PSN or buying coins). You could still farm a bit coins in vs COM cup or normal vs COM games. As I have said, once it is in superstar, it will be a lot harder. And my coach apparently needs 68 points to extend the contract and my friend, playing in superstar with an average team will not help you that. And also, don't be frustrated to get a silver ball when using the top agent. I get it a lot too. Likewise, the scout, I have used 3 of 4 stars scouts, I could still end up with white ball players. But the good things is when you player the white balls players enough, they will grow (level up) to like 75 rating at the en","""pro evolution soccer 2017"" is the best football game on the PS4 so far . the game has different tactics and styles that are effective, and unique players . ""pro evolution soccer 2017 is a fairly good game, and in my opinion the best football game so far"""
"1,196.Resogun: Defenders","[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Adds two new modes for $5. It is more Resogun and if you don't like Resogun you aren't going to like these. Defender's Commando seemed like a LittleBigPlanet creation complete with terrible Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonator quotes but was a lot of fun to be little guy protecting the city and changes the formula a lot. They added new enemies and art throughout these modes. Fun but not essential. The vanilla Resogun is much better than anything in this DLC.. Resogun is still a game that's make a lot fun. The Defender DLC added more fun an complete the game with new great modes. I really enjoy this game for meanwhile over one year. I LOVE Resogun, and all of the DLC they add is always amazing, especially for such a cheap price. Great new game modes, power ups, new humans and ships, challenges; just so much fantastic content.","if you don't like Resogun you aren't going to like these . the vanilla Resogun is much better than anything in this DLC . i love this game, and all of the DLC they add is always amazing ."
"1,197.The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood","I loved this game, and I honestly believe it had the potential to be one of the greats when it comes to the storytelling genre. First of all, the art is beautiful. The setting is also really interesting. The game itself is a visual novel with a card mini-game attached and both of these give you choices that heavily impact the story in meaningful ways. There's just one major gripe I have with it, hence the score. There's a strong anti-men message in later parts of the game that is both patronizing and hateful. There's also a lot of political messaging surrounding gay and trans people that felt a little bit forced, but overall most references to these topics were pretty tactful and actually made sense given the context of some characters. Overall, I enjoyed the story. The gameplay isn't riveting but it's a nice twist on the usual visual-novel shtick. The choices and how much they matter is what makes this game. Every little decision - be it text or cards - matters. You strive to make your deck with the feelings you want to convey and face the consequences of whatever path you choose.. firstly I went through a great visual novel that has a memorable colorful world and the same characters, but it is also unique (at least for me) the mechanics of creating your tarot cards. In general, I give the highest score because in its genre it is non-standard and at the same time one of the best representatives of its genre. P.S. Playing interactive literature in fact in interactive literature itself is brilliant!. I am gonna start off by saying that the Pixel Art and Animations were really well done and that they deserve every praise that they get. The story starts off pretty strong and there were some really decent moments and even plot twists that do shake it up in the middle, I was not really a big fan of the ending and the way they sped up the final chapter (it felt very rushed and kinda made the choices that you previously had worthless). I was not fan of the game play either because it was not that easy to understand or not that very well made in terms of card creation and then selecting the cards( not fully sure what the effects of the picked card will be). Overall the game was chill but it had some feminist vibes to it (which did not deflect the story or the message of the game that much) and I can recommend it for a short story with multiple choices. Music was nice!. I played the demo and was pretty hyped. The first chapters are also really great, the game has depth, doesn't throw the message in your face, just shows you different fates and I felt deeply touched, but that changed just after half Romance felt extremely forced (wtf pacing) and the fun and message lagged behind at a certain point after the last chapter i would like to say: why do you have to hate men? why do you have to seem to include everyone? at the beginning i really thought this is about the deeper connection between women, that all decisions have meaning, that every fate counts, but in the end i was disappointed how much that was slapped in my face, a pity. Good short narrative and decision-making game. The only downside is that being a game that focuses on creating cards, there is very little variety. And lgbt issues that cut the thread of the story.. The cosmic wheel - Sisterhood is a life altering experience. For the past 6 years now, I have been struggling. The transgender question was at the forefront of my mind all this time, asking me wether I am or want or could or should or would. This may be the most uplifting story about women I have had the pleasure of experiencing so far. I won't spoil much, but there is a transgender character in this story. She was accepted, and she didn't have to justify it. No one questioned her, or called it a decision. And after experiencing this, I can say with confidence that I am going to follow my path. I know now, that I should not hold myself back. I should be who I want to be, and not let the discourse around it all make me think and reconsider and question and effectively ruin myself. In ten, or twenty years, when someone asks me what the most life-changing thing that happened to me was, I will be able to say with confidence that it was a Night in August of 2023, in a London Hotel while browsing the Nintento e-shop and finding a game about witches. I will be a woman, the way I want to be. I will be myself. And Fortuna and her sisters will be with me.",the game is a visual novel with a card mini-game attached . there's a strong anti-men message in later parts of the game that is both patronizing and hateful . there's also a lot of political messaging surrounding gay and trans people that felt a little bit forced .
"1,198.In Stars And Time","Really strong story and characters which I loved. Intruiging plot and worldbuilding which kept me excited to play despite the slightly repetivite gameplay (which actually nicely mirrored the journey of the poor main character ).. Gorgeous, lord. I hate to compare things but this is the first time since Undertale I've gotten the feeling of ""aw little guy there's so many fun things to look at"" and an overwhelming sense of ""oh god what have I done"" dread with a surprisingly satisfactory ending(s) for a time loop game. Maybe this is too niche, but if you were a theater kid who now loves reading game dialogue with voices I have good news, its good for that. Two hats ending is my favorite thing ever, i love all the portraits and how they change over time, etc. The one thing for me is it doesn't have a huge replay potential. As a concept the gameplay is a little repetitive, so playing the game again without it being a first time doesnt feel the same. Anyways happy birthday isat. The best narrrative game I've ever played. You don't play this for the gameplay, you play it for the characters, the world and the story. Genuinely recommended for everyone. ISAT is a wonderful game that uses the repetition of RPGs and grinding to tell a great story about time loops and spending time with people you care about. The art style is very charming, and lends itself perfectly to the game themes. Normally in games like this, I have a few characters I like, but only one or two Big Favourites - and I really dislike at least one main character. However. I adore each and every party member in this. All of them have such unique personalities and every pair you can think of in the group has interactions that really flesh out their relationships and characters as a whole. (Vague, minor spoilers for the themes of act 3 onward) Very good representation of depression too - excellently captured both the feelings of hopelessness + emptiness and the desperation to find humour in anything you possibly can. Sometimes it felt a little too real, but it still managed to toe the line enough that it never actually upset me - it just made me think ""wow, this character is me"", or ""this is so relatable"", and ""I feel so seen"". Part of the reason I love this game so much is because Siffrin suffers from a lot of the exact same issues that I do.. Great art, writing, and quality of life features especially for only 20 dollars. Also has fun combat system that's simple but feels great to master. As well as excellent representation for different body types and gender orientations.. This game is really well written. I love it when I can’t choose my favorite character in a video game.. This is one of those games that, within an hour of beginning to engage, I knew that it would be important to me until I died. The story is devastatingly genuine and sincere, in a way that enraptured my attention even through the part of the loops that don't change. The characters have such depth and feel extremely alive, and the world feels whole and full. Siffrin as a character resonates heavily with me, and likely will with anyone who has struggled significantly with mental health. I can feel how much heart the creator has put into this story and its execution, with there being tons upon tons of tiny dialogues and details to find throughout the loops. Also, the casual inclusion of LGBT+ characters who are simply treated as people is always such a joy to see! If you like heavy themes of grief, self loathing, family, and acceptance this is a great game for you. The battle system is easy to learn but challenging to master, the relationships you can build are fulfilling and influenced by the paths you choose to take... truly I cant recommend it enough. Easily my favorite new game release in some time.. this is one of the best games I've ever played, especially when it comes to the writing. so long as you don't have a pathological hatred for stories in video games, you will, at bare minimum, enjoy this game. In Stars and Time may not be my favorite game mechanically, nor is it a story that has moved me to tears. Certainly, it's a game that is fantastically executed. It's visually splendid, accomplishing fantastic things using only black and white. The RPG mechanics are familiar, but also innovative enough to maintain engagement. And I'd be remiss not to tell you that every character is well written, endearing, and relatable. But it's with that last point that makes this game my new favorite game of all time, and possibly my favorite story of all time. Never before in any story have I related more to a character than I have to Siffrin. They made me feel seen in a way I haven't anywhere else. While I hope that more people play In Stars and Time, most people probably won't get the same thing out of it that I did. Just because it's my favorite game doesn't mean it'll be everyones's, but that's A-OK. But also please play this game it's very good.. Fantastic game that I'm still thinking about months after playing it. Cannot recommend enough!. If you're a fan of games like Omori, Undertale, Deltarune, or OneShot, then this game's probably ALSO going to be something you'll love. It has so much personality, I would struggle to name every single way in which it shines, but if I were to try… It has beautiful artwork for overworld sprites, battle animations, character portraits, and a couple Special pieces of artwork you can see when reaching certain parts of the story. It has a solid gameplay Loop if you like story-telling, and the battles are pretty fun with Rock Paper Scissors mechanics. Basically no grinding required if you're decently good, though in my playthrough, I did grind a few levels to make a Certain Boss easier. I'm not the best at remembering music from video games, but even so, the main battle theme is still stuck in my hand and probably will be for the foreseeable future. The only problem I can say I had with this is one most have already voiced, that being the somewhat short way things are wrapped up at the end. Even so, I left the game feeling pretty satisfied, despite missing a couple of things. Can take ten hours or thirty, depends on how thoroughly you investigate. Mine was somewhere around 16, if I recall correctly, and that was with me mostly making a bee-line for the end, with a couple “what happens if I do this over and over” moments throughout.. Although I liked the overall story and the characters, I cannot suggest this game at all. The idea for battles is interesting, but it is merely something superficial that completely loses usefulness in the second half of the game. Moreover, the game does not shine in any aspect of gameplay: the combat gets repetitive (and neglected) very fast, the puzzle element of the story is not puzzle at all since all you have to do is go from one point to another to find the interaction you need to continue the plot. Even the loops are really a pain because you are forced to redo entire parts of the game almost identically with really minimal dialogue change. Dialogues that in the end are well written, but become boring very quickly as the characters talk about objects and matters that are not at all necessary, this for EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION. The player should be incentivized to check around at every loop, if it weren't for these endless dialogues for every interacting item that you can trigger every loop (and for many of these you can't skip them, even though there is a feature for skipping specific dialogue). On the plus side, the narrative has many ""cool"" moments with incredible scenography design, but they convey a message that is way too simple and the ""cool"" moments seem put in on purpose just to impress. In fact, many of these ""cool"" moments are not explained at all at the end, and the author of the game expects players to come up with an explanation. I would have enjoyed the game much more if the story had been more compact, but unfortunately this game has too many fillers.. I don't normally write reviews, but I feel the need to write a review for a game as amazing as this, so I'll keep it brief. This game has what I believe is the best story in any video game, and has my personal favorite protagonist in any game as well. I love Siffrin, I love the rest of the family, and I still don't know if I want to punch or hug Loop. 10/10, please play it, please please please please please please please just play it. You like a good groundhog day type of game? give it a try. I laughed, and I cried, boy I cried, I love the writing in this game so much! the game feels so sincere and has lots of fun moments while also dealing some dark stuff too. There's so many details that give you insight on Siffrin and the world This is such a wonderful game with lots of care and love put into it, the art and the characters are so memorable and endearing.. In Stars And Time is an absolutely wonderful game. There are a lot of things going for it--great, highly playable music and gorgeous art amongst them--but probably its highest strength is its writing. The world is occupied a lovable cast of characters that you'll want to learn more about and protect and fleshed out surprisingly well just by the odd offhanded comment, in addition to actual exposition. It all feels well lived-in. All of this serves to draw you into this world and the relationship between the main characters and his party, and that immersion only deepens as you go through the game and experience the time loops (and the tolls they take on those going through them). The story is beautiful, really, and it made me cry more than once. I'm still thinking about it 24/7 days later, and I imagine I will be for a while to come. Every part of this game emanates heart, and you can tell how much effort and emotion was put into the creation of it. If you can't tell already: I highly, highly recommend it!. Really good game with a fun combat system and good soundtrack the gameplay is great and the characters are the charm in my opinion. In Stars and Time is an amazing game, containing a well-crafted soundtrack, compelling dialogue, and beautiful character development and growth.. This game is immensely special; the sort of game that only comes around once in a blue moon, and changes your life for the better. The world is rich, the characters are beautifully written, and the music is enchanting. In Stars and Time is a feat of brilliance, and everyone should give it a chance.. Genuinely one of the most interesting and fun games I've played in a LONG time. Absolutely incredible characters, an insanely compelling story, GORGEOUS sound design and musical composition; ISAT has it all. Please do not miss out, you will regret it forever.","this is the first time since undertale that i've gotten the feeling of ""aw little guy there's so many fun things to look at"" with a surprisingly satisfactory ending(s) for a time loop game . as a concept the gameplay is a little repetitive, so playing the game again without it being a first time doesnt feel the same ."

"1,200.Easy Come Easy Golf","Brilliant golfing fun, nicely balanced, includes the great tap-tap mechanic, well paced, gorgeous visuals - better than the golfing ""SIM's"" as this has all the swish, polish, pacing and enjoyability to come out tops. Best golf game on Switch, I believe!. An excellent arcade golf game for the Switch, the antidote for those who were disappointed by the terrible Mario Golf Super Rush. Pros: - excellent gameplay, simple to learn but with a lot of depth to explore - 3-click or touch controls, both are quite fun and functional - stick controls, easier to use than 3-click but still maintains the challenge of the game - 11 well-made courses - numerous characters with their own characteristics and favorite clubs - costs $20, 1/3 the price of Mario Golf Super Rush, despite being better in every respect - the game's fundamental gameplay is basically golf, without stupid gimmicks - the HUD gives you just enough information to be clear about what you're doing, but it doesn't feel like ""cheating"" where you know exactly the trajectory of the ball before the shot Cons: - kinda bad frame rate and the Switch's natural input lag isn't ideal, making precise clicks more about prediction than reaction - only 9 holes per course - online tournaments that are just leaderboards is behind a paywall (Nintendo Switch Online) - gameplay structure is that of a mobile game, so there isn't a well-structured campaign, but several events designed to be played in small sections - you can't save replays Neutral: - grind is insane, but it's a fun game so I don't know if it makes sense to complain about grind, unless you're an extremely competitive player who wants to level up all the characters as quickly as possible to win all the online tournaments - you don't use the same character on every hole, but assemble teams and choose the players you think are most appropriate for each type of hole, weather conditions, etc. - there are no motion controls, which I don't mind, but I think it might be a drawback for some people - graphics, although nice and well animated, don't have the polish of games like more recent versions of Hot Shot Golf Conclusion: If you like arcade-style golf games, but were disappointed by the very low-quality cash-grab called Mario Golf Super Rush, then this is the best option for you on the Switch at the moment.. Not much different than Everybody Golf, but that's not a bad thing. This is my go=to when I have just a couple minutes to kill during the day and I also love cracking a few adult beverages and playing tournaments with my roommate using the pass the controller mode. One of those fun easy to learn, hard to master type games.","brilliant golfing fun, nicely balanced, includes the great tap-tap mechanic, well paced, gorgeous visuals . game's fundamental gameplay is basically golf, without stupid gimmicks . only 9 holes per course - online tournaments that are just leaderboards are behind a paywall ."
1.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the best games I played maybe even the best game. It had great puzzles and boss fights. The dungeons were fun and not too hard and not too easy.. Best Game oat in my opinion just everything about that game is perfect the story the gameplay just everything. It´s not only the best Video Game from the Nintendo 64. It´s also not only the best game from Nintendo or even from the entire Zelda-Line. It´s the best game ever! It may don´t have crazy graphic, but it is still SO MUCH FUN. It has a crazy Storyline, very good characters and the gameplay is amazing. Best game ever 10/10. No words, just play it). It was a great technological advance in its era, as was its history, but I feel that it is something overrated today.. Truly one of the greatest games, Ship of Harkinian is a HD fan made remaster that is incredible if you're looking to play this for the first time and don't have a N64. I highly recommend remember playing this for 2 days straight during a holiday and finishing the last boss on day 3, what a great game.. The reviews for this game are highly binary, people either seem to think it is complete trash and rate it ridiculously low, or they seem to think it is without doubt the greatest game ever made and give it a flawless review. Personally, after playing this game twice now, I think the truth lies somewhere in between those two points of view. Firstly, there is no doubt that this game is an absolute masterpiece. Anyone with a genuine interest in gaming (gaming history) on any level needs to play this game. If you play the game like it is 1998 then it must have been truly mind blowing. Firstly, the game is massive, it lets you explore, it evolves, the story unfolds beautifully. The game play and controllers I found great, regardless of a lot of viewers stating the opposite. The music in this game is 10 out of 10, the story in this game is beautiful and touching, a definite 10 out of 10. The level designs are clever, the side missions are good, 10 out of 10. It is clever, fun, joyful, scary and engrossing. So, I would be leaning to give it a really high score. However, my issue with this game is that it can be far, far, too convoluted in places, and that just zaps any fun out of it. You WILL get stuck, you will spend hours running around this massive open world having absolutely no clue what you are supposed to do next. If you like that sort of thing then more power to you. However, for me a game should be fun, not a chore. Do not get me wrong, I LOVE a challenging game, but there is a massive difference between challenging and just not having a clue what to do because the game has been designed, purposefully or not, to obfuscate its next steps. Overall, I recommend you play this game, at least try it, but if you find yourself aimlessly trying to figure out what on Earth you are supposed to do next, then ask yourself, is that your fault or just poor game design.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played in 2000' and again in 2025, this game is awesome, best game of all time. My favorite game of all time also the first game I ever played and can’t wait to get a remaster up to date. An excellent game in 1998, but just a good game in 2025. This game severely needs a remaster with quality of life upgrades to be truly enjoyable again.. Decent game. Had my fun playing through and 100%ing it but would prefer to play newer titles.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the greatest games of all time. One of the highest rated games on this site for a reason.. A great game, I had never played it before and wanted to dive into the Zelda franchise with a game that is supposed to be the best. Recently I heard my friends arguing about how the critics for Ocarina of Time were outdated and that people were blinded by nostalgia, I then made it my mission to see if it is outdated and the only outdated part is the graphics. The game is beautiful and takes you through time as a whole. The game has wonderful dungeons and scenery along with a guiding story that has twists and turns but can go straight at the same time. I do not want to spoil the wonderful game for anyone reading this review so I will end after this next sentence. This game is wonderful and even if you hate story games or have had trouble with Zelda in the past I still recommend this game as a 10/10 to everyone.. it's the first, if it hadn't been created, most of the games today shoudn't be like that. We can't rate this one with the today's norms. Their's nothing wrong in this game because it was the first one to do that. Today yes, it's old, most games are better, but that games should not exist without this one. We shouldn't rate today.. Ocarina of time has been my favorite game for years and I have a great affection for it to give it the maximum rating and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good Zelda game to play and believe me you will not regret it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still the best thing ever happened to gaming till this day. It’s remarkable how well it really stands today, how well it is designed and laid out. Playing this nowadays I feel sad for the games that are released now, they lack love the developers used to put into games back in 90s - 00s. Games like this one will never be released again. Best game I ever played, the only game that came close to this is Witcher 3.. Definitely up there as one of the best Games I've ever played, if not the very best. I got it along with the Pikachu Nintendo 64 for Christmas when I was just a kid (9 or 10 years old, maybe?) and the N64 was on its way out and being sold for a lot cheaper. I'm so glad I played this, though. The exploration, music, simplicity of it all was absolutely stellar. The only caveat I have is the water level and because this game is such a classic not even that knocks the score down from a 10 to a 9. Fantastic.. .... I don't know, I just felt so wonderful experiencing this game. This game to me, is the greatest game ever made. And for all the Rockstar Masterpieces, the Naughty Dog ones, the incredible Mario games, Bioshock. Other then the House In Fata Morgana, I don't really get an equal fondness. And The House In Fata Morgana is a visual novel, so I don't know if that would count. all I know is that...... hey, as a kid looking at this sight, I found some of my favorite games of all time, and it got me to become open minded to other genres, styles and games I would have said no to. I just love games not as a critic but a simple fan always on the lookout for something new and old. so long as it's wonderful, artistic, and just......... kinda Beautiful for me.. I’ve played countless games across a wide variety of genres, including many contemporary titles, but none have ever surpassed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It is, without a doubt, a timeless masterpiece. From its captivating world and innovative mechanics to its unforgettable characters and iconic music, every aspect of this game is unparalleled. Ocarina of Time isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. It moved me so deeply that I cried at the end. Truly, this game is the G.O.A.T.. One of the best games to ever be released. The story, the gameplay, and even the graphics, everything is amazing. This was the game that would compete directly with the PlayStation.. There are very few works of art that I would consider near perfection, but this game is one of them. It is my favorite video game of all time and one of the greatest games ever made. Not even Tears of the Kingdom holds the same special place in my heart as this game does.. Perfect gameplay perfect song perfect dungeon perfect items perfect bosses perfect open would perfect game. One of the best games I’ve ever played, to the puzzles and the dungeons, its an absolute joy at every corner.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game that changed everything. From gameplay to the story... it's a perfect game in nearly every aspect. It's why I still play. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its is the best game of my life! I still play it once a year :) I remember how I played this game with my brother whenI was 7 years old. Nostalgia.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is by far one of the best games I’ve ever played, it engaged me both visually and emotionally.. Great game, that never gets ****'s a very nostalgic video game. It's always fun to explore the dungeons and locating the master sword. The Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time stands in my mind as the epitome of what a gaming adventure should be about. Everything from the story to the gameplay are connected is a simple, yet undoubtedly masterful way. Arguably, the Zelda game with the best dungeons, best music themes and best character designs. No other Zelda game has ever come close to Ocarina of Times masterful design. The underlying sadness of its story hiding in the subtext of the story itself, is reflected miraculously within the game's story progression. The gameplay mechanics revolutionized the gaming industry and inspired game developers for decades. For me it is the perfect game in all aspects. Nothing within this game feels wasted or forced. The only regret I have is that I can't forget it so that I can play it again for the first time. The best Zelda game of all time and in my opinion, the best game ever made.. Despite it's age it's still an absolute joy. It's the video game equivalent to Lord of the rings. An absolute masterpiece, that really makes you feel like you're in that world on the quest. You actually feel sad, after you finish, like something is missing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a milestone in the game industry. It is a must-play game, obligatory. Although the story is a little cliche, it has great characters that you can speak with. The game is straightforward, which means that it is a bit linear. You just need to complete the dungeons and save Princess Zelda from Ganondorf. There are no good side quests, besides the biggoron's sword quest. How is an old game, it gives you some hard times. But with the internet, you can search for a guide to help you. But when this game came out, it was astonishing, a pioneer in various aspects. The game design is incredible, with good and memorable locations. Memorable races, and characters. The end game is very exciting, some dungeons are not so good, but you have good ones like Forest Temple and Spirit Temple. Yes, and it has the Water Temple, the temple everyone hates. Artificial intelligence for its time is good. The soundtrack is amazing. Various and memorable songs like Zelda's lullaby and Epona's song. The bosses are great and well-designed. If you never have played Ocarina of Time, do not waste your time. Play it before you die.. To be a game made in the 90's is a great game,and when it came out it was surely the best game of all,now I don't really think is like that,there are even better Zelda games in my opinion,but if you like puzzles,action and a great story I recommend this game,but if it's the first time playing it the 3ds remaster is better. To think about it had to be the game that planted a ton of mechanics at the first time and in spite of the limitations, nailed every single one of them, it's shocking. The game that introduced the dungeons of puzzles, the mazes of Zelda, their most important value, they nailed that as wellin the best way possible. Incredible world and game design, pace. Charmful story, charmful characters. Charmful everything.. There is nothing that needs to be said. You know what this is, you know what it means to so many people, you know it’s a must play for every person on Earth. A true masterpiece.. Design & Presentation 5 Gameplay 5 Story 5 Graphics 5 Content 5 Sound 5 quite simply a timeless classic. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best game of my life, even at 43 years old.. Its a great game, one of the most important games I've played since its the first game that really got me into game development.. Ocarina of time is simply a masterpiece of video game design. Every dungeon and area felt unique. The game perfectly introduces puzzles to you in a way that you will be confused but eventually figure it out.. I dont know MUCH about this game, but honestly, its kinda stunning that the game is still the best rated game of history after so many years, and I do know about it still, and it is indeed great! I think this game honours the place of number one, and is an example of what a video game is. but theres a question I would ask Ocarina of Time. are you the number one game because you are ocarina of time, or are you ocarina of time because you are the number one game? THAT, is the question.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game, created by the incredible Shigeru Miyamoto, is by far and away the best game I have ever played. The story follows Link, a young Kokori boy who recently has been having terrible nightmares. The Kokori folk are the people of the Kokori forest, a giant woodland area in this magical land. All of the Kokori folk retain their youthfulness. No matter when they are born, they always stay childlike. Each member of the Kokori people has his or her own guardian fairy to help them through their life struggles. Link however does not have a fairy and never has done. Then one day Link is visited by a fairy who tells him to visit the great Deku tree who is a giant tree possessed by the spirit of the wood who serves as the father of all the Kokori. The Deku tree knows of the nightmares and predicted them long ago. He reveals to Link that he is going to grow up as a hero and save Hyrule. He also reveals that Link is not actually a Kokori boy, he is in fact a Hyrulien (from the town of Hyrule) and that is why he never had a fairy.After having left the forest Link goes to Hyrule town with his new found friend and guardian fairy called Navi, then on to Hyrule castle to meet princess Zelda as prophecised by the Deku tree. She tells him that she has been having the nightmares as well and she also a suspicion that a strange man who works for her father (the king) will try to overthrow the peaceful land of Hyrule and rule as a terrible dictator. And so the giant quest begins, (for it is truly giant) so great in fact that you mature to an adult before it ends. That however is for you to find out about. I do suggest that you play this game if you have an N64 and if you dont have one. My imagination took me to places I could never dream of before after I finished this game. I found it wholly satisfying and thought provoking also. If I could use four words to describe this game they would be: epic, enchanting, magical, and emotional. It is not a game but an experience.. Not the best game, but a good game that set a standard for others in the genre. I respect it and it's fans. As for Breath of the Wilds that game can kick rocks cause that game is a little overrated for my taste. I'd like to see Majora's Mask and this game gets a Remake.. A great game with well designed dungeons, but its age shows clearly and there are many parts of the game that feel lacking and are simply done better by later entries.. It´s just, amazing how a game can still be enjoyable as the first day even decades later after it´s release. I first played it in 2013, at the age of 6, and even then, it felt like a magical experience, more than just a game, is a moment in your life. Something you´ll never forget. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is simply overrated. The high ratings are only because people were blown away back then. There wasn't much else like it at the time. Sure, the music is great, and it laid some foundations, but the game itself is boring and dull. Its game design wouldn't hold up today, and you're often left not knowing what to do next. Frustrating moments and illogical puzzles. If there's ever a remake, a lot would need to be changed.. Second favorite game oat!! My second selda game and absolute favorite can't wait for the day I can't play it since my switch is broken. It certainly isn't a bad game, but I do think it's a little overrated for what it is. I really liked playing it when I was a child, but in my opinion, it's not the best game of all time, or even the best game of the franchise. OOT was genuinely a technical achievement for its time, and you can still have lots of fun with it, but playing it nowadays shows its age. The Hyrule field is pretty empty and can be a real chore to get across. The characters are bland in comparison to later games, especially to Majoras Mask, which was released only a short time after this game. And the gameplay was more annoying than anything. Like I said, it's still playable, but ... I rather not.. Ocarina of Time... Pff, spare me! Game of the century? It’s a pasture simulator, that’s what it is! You’re just running through an empty field, it’s like Link’s on a tour through the Midwest or something! And saving the world with a flute? Come on, a magical flute is for fairy tales, not for a real hero! Give me a giant sword, not a wooden toy, for crying out loud! And then, the big challenge: the Water Temple. Oh, what a delight! Yeah, right. It’s a maze of rooms with physics that feel like wet paper. I almost threw the controller out the window, and I’ve played some bad games, but this one tests your patience. Honestly, if someone says they enjoy this game, they must love suffering. Nostalgia is a trap, folks. Ocarina? You’ve got to be brave to call that a masterpiece, seriously!. This is withouta doubt the best Zelda as well as the best video game of all time. Only game I would ever give a perfect 10 to ever.. Nearly perfect game, honestly the only reason it is a 9/10 is because of the awful N64 controller. The music, puzzles, and combat are absolutely fantastic. This is my second favorite combat system in Zelda and is a must play game.. No coments, just the best game ever, from the best enterprise. The best franchise ever, the best musics, the best Gameplay. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily one of the best games of all time.. A pure staple of my childhood, I am 29 and to this day and I still play through this game about once a year. The only bad thing I could have to say about this game is the fact that you have to pause so any times to get your items out of your inventory. THAT IS IT!. I first played this game when I was young, coming back to it even 10 to 15 years later still never disappoints in how amazing it is. Greatest game of all time Everything about it is perfect I'm just filling the characters im not writing a review about a game so perfect the word perfect fails to describe it. I dont think this is the Best game ver ive neverplay this but maybe the ancient ganes are a little bit overrated. So so so good, my only gripe is the camera controls on the n64 but it’s not to big of a problem.. Best game of all time, 10 out of 10, everything it's just perfect, the music, the gameplay, the graphics. I was fortunate enough to be alive when this masterpiece was released. There is a reason why it tops countless lists of the greatest video games ever made. Everything was mindblowing from the soundtrack to the dungeons and bosses. At the time this game was in a different galaxy in the action-adventure genre.. one of the games in a 4 way tie for my favorite zelda game of all time. Water temple is a good dungeon, the only problem is how you use the iron boots.. Best game ever! Was the best experience of my life hands down, all the memories and all the time i spent on this game. The best. EVER!. I dont have any words , its perfect......................................... One of the greatest game s ever absolute masterpiece only get outclassed by botw by a little bit. THAS CUZ HES THE GOAT, THE GOOOOOOOAAAAAAAT people be sayin ""orhurhurh its DATED and the KONTROLS are bad"" do not trust those people. Played this game without ANY nostalgia or ""rose tinted glasses"" and is still the GOAT. It looked a little rough at first but then I realized i have 60/20 vision.. Is one of the best games i ever played, i played it for first time on the port for pc and i really loved it. I cant believe people give this game a 0/10. The best game ever. Period. Has one of the best video game stories, great direction, and during its time revolutionised video games as we know it. Plus Likk is adorable.. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - A Timeless MasterpieceThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time isn’t just a game; it's a landmark in gaming history. Every element, from its captivating story to its revolutionary 3D gameplay, is pure perfection. The seamless transition between the bright, hopeful world of young Link and the darker, more mature realm of adult Link creates an emotional depth that resonates even decades later. The puzzles, dungeons, and boss battles are ingeniously designed, with each new area feeling fresh and **** iconic soundtrack, filled with memorable melodies, is both haunting and uplifting, adding an extra layer of magic to every moment. Whether you're riding across Hyrule Field or solving a clever puzzle in the Water Temple, every second feels like an unforgettable adventure.Ocarina of Time’s influence can be felt across modern gaming, yet no title has ever quite captured its unique blend of epic storytelling, immersive world-building, and innovative gameplay. It’s not just one of the best Zelda games—it’s one of the best games of all time, an experience that transcends generations.. The best game that ever existed by miles, nothing can or will replace this masterpiece. Flawless game. What an amazing game, I played it when I was older, but it made me feel like a kid again!!. This game is one of the best in the franchise. All featured items are extremely useful, and the dungeon design is amazing. Even the dreaded Water Temple can still be extremely fun, and dungeons such as Ganon's Castle and the Fire Temple are some of the best in the series. The graphics are admittedly bad, but this game is from 1998, so it's excusable. OoT also has some of the best music in the series with absolute BANGERS like the Gerudo Valley theme, and the gameplay itself is great. It 100% deserves all the love it gets, even if I personally prefer games like Link's Awakening.. I played a lot of video game, since I'm 10. I played OoT when I was 16 on Nintendo DS and I'm 28 RN. OoT is by far the greatest game I've played. I really get a magical adventure with a lot of moods and ambiance, sometime dramatic, sometime epic or even poetic. The fight mechanics are good, realtime, no slowmo' or stuff like that. The ratio of time between dungeon & exploration is good, it's not a series of puzzle and not a big empty openworld. the musics are beautiful, but also have mechanics in game, which reinforces the immersion. The game isn't perfect, but globally good in all the aspects. To me, I didn't fell like I had an adventure video-game, but rather an adventure experience. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Zelda give me many laughs and also many more tears. Zelda and a game that has aged very well, like those very expensive and good wines, If you ever have the chance to play, don't let this chance pass you by.. This game is incredible, very fun even to this day, everyone must play this masterpiece!. Just the best game ever. Sound: 15 Gameplay: 10 Graphics: 10 Script: 9,5 Duration: 10. It was my introduction into the world of Zelda. What an introduction! From that point, I couldn’t get enough and worked my way backwards through the catalogue of Legend of Zelda games. What a great experience it was.. Perhaps the Greatest Game of All Time. I grew up on this as a kid, it was the greatest then and still is. It is the foundation of the Zelda mythos and the core of the game model ever since. It revolutionized 3D RPGs in the way the original revolutionized JRPGs. The music is some of the most beautiful in all of gaming, and stands on its own merit as being melodic and captivating. The dungeons are very clever and serve as puzzles in between exploration and questing. The quests are full with all kinds of stuff to do whether they be silly or significant. And finally the story. The story is perfect and represents the essence of Zelda itself. It is the crux of the Zelda timeline, with every game before pointing toward it, and every game after looking back to it. If you haven't played this game, it is a must play and launch point for Zelda, and gaming in general. A true masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece, can't describe the feeling it gave when playing it back in 1998.. Ths game is life and it will never be matched no matter what the technology or the era. It should be mandatory in school for personal growth: if everyone played OOT the world would be a better place. Thank you Shigeru Miyamoto and thank you Koji Kondo ️. Masterpiece. I played when I was young, in the N64. Later on the 3DS and now on Switch. Never gets old. Best game of all time.. good story Gameplay MUSIC. It is the best game I have ever known and the best game in Nintendo and history. Tooth me almost 20hours to 100% the first time and loved everymoment of it. I am so happy I bothered my father to get an N64 for this game as a kid. It will always be on of my most loved games of all time.. What can I say? It is an immortal masterpiece, despite the old graphics, but the world, characters, variety of dungeons, and sound engineering made me complete the game and feel satisfied. I do not regret 40 hours of exploring the world.. This is often considered the best game ever made, and for good reason. Absolutely amazing vibes from this game, tons of secrets to explore and find, some of the best dungeons that the zelda series has ever seen, and an incredible soundtrack to accompany you the whole way through. It's incredible that nearly 30 years later, this game is still an amazing joy to play through. The only reason i don't give this a 10 is because many of the mechanics and controls in this game are very dated. also the water temple **** lol. But otherwise it's pretty damn close to perfect. Best game ever made. All is perfect: atmosphere, story, dungeons, puzzles, music, etc.. Here's a glowing review for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time:*A Timeless Masterpiece: Ocarina of Time Review*The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a monumental achievement in gaming that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its release. This iconic Nintendo 64 classic is a must-play experience that embodies the essence of adventure, exploration, and innovation.*Immersive Storytelling*Ocarina of Time's narrative is a beautifully crafted tale of courage, friendship, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.

If you haven't already, embark on this timeless adventure and experience one of the greatest games ever. G.O.A.T Just Perfect !. More people should play this. Best game ever. I now feel like I actually was in Hyrule. Thesoundtrack is amazing.. A master class in game design. The graphics? Perfect for the time and still hold up decently well. The sound? Flawless. The controls?almost perfect, only thing I'd change is making the iron boots equipable to the C-buttons. The puzzles? Tricky and satisfying to figure out. Story? Classic, 10/10. Honestly, the only reason this is a 9 instead of a 10, is simply that the water temple exists. That one dungeon is a stain on what is otherwise a phenomenal game that you owe yourself to play if you're a fan of any Zelda game.. Anyone who says this game is bad due to the water temple, I don't know what to say. The water temple has an amazing fight with dark link, and there is only one Zelda game better than this one: Breath of the wild. They both have a lot of glitches that are fun to do, and can both be completed in less than 30 minutes.. Do i need to say something? Best game of Nintendo and one of the best of all time. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its almost perfect. The only problems in the game come from its age like bad graphics or slow textboxes, but apart from that, it truly is the greatest game of all time.. The game overview is kind of overrated with simple story, unmemorable characters.. This is quite simply a game which was the standard for all the other games in this genre to measure themselves against !. Gamer's today only see the graphics in comparison to the game's of today. This game is still being played today after what 36 years or so and it's still as much fun now as it was back then, today's game's are brilliant mostly I think everyone can agree, but they don't last ! They're as much a cinematic experience as they are a game, you can save most games wherever you want and not have to go all the way back to the beginning and it's almost as if developer's are hesitant or scared to make a game that kills you every chance it gets and then send you back to the beginning . Yes I see that some people say that it has it's faults and i suppose they might have a point but I fell in love with this game from the very first time I played it and I still love it today. It was amazing with an incredible story, a wonderful way of transporting you to the land of Hyrule which other game's couldn't match despite some very good attempts they always just seemed to lack that extra bit of magic that enraptured a generation and still does. Don't try to compare graphics or cinematic scenes with the latest game's because obviously there's been some truly amazing leap's in technology which we're all grateful for and enjoying immensely ( Well I am at least ) but consider instead just how far ahead of it's time it was when it was released, it really wasn't that long after the whole video game consoles were first brought into people's home's whereas before that you had to go to your nearest video arcade to play games and pay 10p per go and yes another 10p to continue right back at the start of whatever level you had managed to get too. This is a game that has weathered the test of time and will continue to do so . The latest game's in the franchise are absolutely stunning and have the same special kind of magic as this one jus","ship of harkinian is a fan made remaster that is incredible if you're looking to play this for the first time and don't have a N64 . the game is massive, it lets you explore, it evolves, the story unfolds beautifully . the music in this game is 10 out of 10, the story in this game is beautiful and touching ."
10.Grand Theft Auto V,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GTA V is a masterpiece. This review does NOT account for GTA Online, by the way. Just the story mode.. THIS GAME IS NOT THE BEST OF THE SERIES, I WOULD RECOMMENT THE PART II. EVEN THERE ARE ANOTHER SIMILAR IN THIS GENDER THAT I WOULD PREFER. Gta V And Gta IV Best Gta ıv missions Good Franklin Michael Trevor Characters. Worst game in the franchise. - Poor driving- and crash physics. Vehicles feels like toys. - The story is short and it's characters are hollow - More or less NO CONTENT AT ALL added to the game since 2013. Nothing to do after the story is complete - Constant online updates are forced upon me despite the fact that I don't play online. This game is a must play beacuse its fun to shoot everyone and the story also id good. Best game of 2013. yeah i wish the story had gta sa's seriousness & was better but nonetheless gameplay & story are still very cool. absolutely love it!. Bad overloaded controls and options, bad user experience, frequent server issues. Great game, a little worse than rdr2, but still very good a few missions that I hate. Only about 40% into the game, but have pretty much already made up my mind.. I am currently in witness protection because of this game. Also there’s no cougars in missions. The iconic GTA V is an amazing game wich has everything, a good story and even better online mode. Iconic.. One of the best games I've ever played. Contains a fun, action filled and story driven main story.. The story is very good, the game is boring at first but it is a very good and continuing game.. Grand Theft Auto V stands as a revolution in what we now know as an open-world experience. Its ability to offer something new at every moment keeps players engaged and far from boredom. With a wide variety of missions, the game takes us from nostalgic moments to large-scale heists that leave us in awe. Additionally, the inclusion of the online mode redefines the multiplayer experience, allowing us to take control of the vibrant city of Los Santos and live unique adventures alongside other players.. its an very good game, but you cant get girl girl girl and its bad cuz u can do manythings you can but not this girl girl girl girlwomen women women or mans. This review is for the PS5 version of the game. Rockstar Games usually pushes current platforms to their limits with their extremely simulation heavy GTA series. The base PS4 version struggled a lot with this. The PS5 version seems to be de definitive version of the game. Even after more than 10 years the game looks absolutely incredible. The story is the weak point of the game. But it is held up by the interesting characters and exciting heist missions. This, and some controls that feel a bit aged, are the only things keeping from beeing a 10/10.. [PC, XBOX SX] This is a game that I personaly think it is a masterpiece! The story will litteraly replace your life! The characters are great, the online is awsome especially with friends! My favourite gta game for sure! If you haven't played it yet you must try it out!. Let me start by saying this is a good game. However, is there any game more overrated than GTA 5? It's like the ultimate power fantasy for gamer dudes. People say the story is great but even a cursory analysis of plot and it falls apart. The gameplay itself though is a step up from the rest of the series. I.just can't get over that 2 of the 3 characters you play **** though. This game also continues the trend of highly scripted missions with no room whatsoever for deviation or improvisation. As a fan of immersive sims, this is a negative to me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Better stay away from anything from rockstar games. This company is the worst there is. Their games are filled with hackers. They take away access to bought games on certain platforms (steam deck). They **** you dry if you let them too, their games are filled with microtransactions. And a nice cherry on the pie their anticheat which doesnt even work is worse then most spyware and practically infects your computer.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GTA V review before GTA VI is crazy. (hurry up rockstar we've all been waiting). + Graphics + Writing + Story + Dialogue + Gameplay + Voice Performances + Replayability + Player Freedom. Masterpiece a generational game that still continue to demolish the concurrence. its **** story **** you know whats bad.online,it forces you to buy this STUPID PS PLUUUUUS!!!!But it relly worth it a 10â. 7.3/10. I wasn't allowed to play this game as a kid and because of all the hype about it and seeing my friends all play it, it made me feel like I was seriously missing out. Then, when I got older and finally played it for myself like 5 or so years ago, I was very disappointed. The story is terrible. Trevor is a freak, Michael is super annoying, and Franklin is just okay. Point is I was rooting against them the entire time. There's definitely fun to be had in the open world getting in intense police chases/gun fights, customizing and racing cars, and just messing around, but other than that I'm not interested in darts, tennis, strip clubs, card games, and freaking yoga. I honestly don't understand the hype.. The game that, I dare to say, changed my life. This was THE GAME. The ultimate experience, because I have never played anything like this before. It would set high expectations for open world video games to this day (Only Red Dead Redemption 2 defeated them.) The only reason why this game is not a 10/10 is the Online, because hoo boy, do I have to say a lot about it.. Here i dont have a word's just because always in GTA you rob something, i play all parts of GTA and it's become boring. Classic game.. I would give it a 10 for nostalgia,but for me, it's a solid 8. The gameplay is interesting but the story is repetitive.. Rockstar please release gta6 I'll spend my life savings I promise just please release. This is an instant classic for many people, how ever i'm not many people. I first played this in 2022 beacause i'm always late. But yes this game was amazing and very fun to play.. Well I agree, this is one of the best games ever made. it's not my favorite rockstar game but it's an enjoyable experience overall. The multiplayer was really a cornerstone for a time and people still play it to this day. The game story it's really it's funny with memorable characters and missions. To me it's far from perfect but it's an achievement for the gaming world and that's undenaible.9/10.. Timeless and infinity remilkable. Franklin, Trevor and Michael are three sides of the same coin (lol) and remind me of 80s crime movies. GTA VI is gonna be lit!. the best Grand Theft Auto game after GTA San Andreas in my opinion, after I played this game on PlayStation 4 or PC, the graphics of this GTA game are more realistic than the previous game (although I think the previous game was good too hehe) but in the GTA game In this one, I felt a different experience, starting from driving vehicles, carrying out missions, and the storyline, and everything else was extraordinary, it's no wonder that this game has received positive ratings from other media, including Metacritic.. The absolut success game is GTA 5. I've played this game so much. Now I'm waiting for 6.. Kinda dissapointed cuz its lacking in a lot of spaces where gta 4 peaked.especially in cops and cars but still a great game although the story is lacking a lot.. Good game no doubt. Feel like boring and unfinished story. I choose games to avoid people, you offer me multiplayer with people and lack of story? Am I missing something?? After finishing the game, you feel alone in empty map. The feeling that GTA San Andreas provides you would never be achieved. I finished the game and I don't think I'll be reaching for the disc again.. Masterpiece, the best game of all time. First off the the gunplay is the best out of any game ever, and there are so many guns to play with that you will never run out of gun fun. The driving so good, with the 200 something vehicles or more, and the excellent driving and handling driving will never get old. The map is the biggest and best gta map, there is so much to do in the city, game modes, missions, robbery’s, etc, it’s so amazing. There’s millions more I could talk good about, in all buy gta 5.. Ive spent more than 3 thousand hours on this game, and I have to say it is pretty meh. The story is pretty good, but i spent most of my time in online, the amount of modders youll come by is insane. if youre trying to find a game to play online. this game isnt it.. This game is incredibly fun, polished in almost everything it puts forward, and creates a decent enough story to follow along with. Additionally, it still holds up incredibly well even 10 years later. With that being said I find games like this to be a bit repetitive. Thats okay! This game was meant to be played the way it's played, but it's not what I personally would gravitate towards. I feel that the GTA franchise continues to try and push how realistic a game can get. This is both a positive and a negative This makes the game a more fleshed-out and interesting experience, but a less fun game. Take a game like GTA San Andreas. By today's standards, this game is not realistic. But it is more fun. It takes the same concept as GTA 5 but makes it more fun because of a level of self-aware video game weirdness that makes it more fun. Again this game is great, and a true feat of game design even 10 years later, but I do wish for more videogame-y elements were implemented.. For the first time ever you could play as three characters and man did I enjoy playing each character. The map is huge and detailed and you will never run out of things to do in the game. The story hooks you in from the start and the payoff is amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Insane game one of the most infulencial games of all time. Its crazy how it can be replayed. I finished it over 5 times on multiple consoles. Generational game.. A good game overall. There are few missions that are truly interesting, as most of them involve simply driving a car while the characters talk or a shootout begins.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. forImpossible for me Finish frompreferGames inFor a date and especiallyIn the insanely invited OnlineIt's a very entertaining game.. Grand theft auto 5 is split into two parts, the story and the online mode. The story is a 10/10, it contains the commentary of the US as all other games in the franchise have, and the humor is amazing. The story is well written and as stupid as ever. GTA Online on the other hand is another story, filled with hacking, exploits and griefing, online servers are a cesspit for people to take turns killing new players repeatedly, and the only real way to advance and make money is to go onto a private server, or to pay them money so you can buy yourself overpowered rocket firing futuristic tech to fight back. There is a serious hacking problem, especially on PC, with players being flung, teleported, and banned by other players, with no end in sight, especially with GTA 6 releasing next year. The reputation of this game has been dragged down by the online community, especially because the players that spend all of their time online tend to be the people that the story is critiquing the entire time.. Although highly acclaimed by many, I personally cannot continue playing Grand Theft Auto V.Grand Theft Auto V is a critically acclaimed game known for its stunning detail and open world freedom. However, despite its praise, I personally find it difficult to stay **** core concept of the game is to provide a vast and realistic city environment, allowing players to take on various roles and engage in thrilling missions and activities. The game features a plethora of missions and storylines, giving players the freedom to choose their path and gameplay **** game's world is meticulously designed with stunning visuals, providing an immersive experience. The city's buildings, streets, and characters are lifelike, allowing players to fully immerse themselves. Additionally, the game offers a wide variety of transportation options, including cars, motorcycles, and planes, adding to the enjoyment and diversity of gameplay.However, despite the game's rich content and impressive design, I personally struggle to continue playing. On one hand, the missions and activities can sometimes feel repetitive and monotonous, lacking novelty and challenge. On the other hand, the game's difficulty can be overly high, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to complete, leaving me feeling tired and uninspired.Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is an awe-inspiring game, but it fails to capture my sustained interest. I hope the game can offer more fresh and engaging content, as well as a more balanced difficulty, allowing players to continuously experience the joy of gameplay.. Grand Theft Auto V is a testament to Rockstar Games ability to construct enjoyable, engaging games. The city of Los Santos and the surrounding wilderness are richly dense with life and meticulous attention to detail maintaining a close resemblance to the real life LA whilst differentiating it enough to feel enjoyable to play in. Having three different protagonist to play as provides a much needed breath of fresh air as each bring a different perspective to the gameplay with their specific special abilities that feel well developed and fitting with the character they are designated to in addition to their wildly different backgrounds and relationships with the supporting cast. With a large amount of weapons and vehicles to choose from as well as specific clothing options and hair/tattoo combinations for each character the game does an excellent job at providing the player with ample opportunity to play the way they want. Grand Theft Auto V is a game that you could spend 10 hours in or 10,000 hours in and still find fun, enjoyable ways to play as Rockstar have created a generational sandbox game harkening back to the days when games felt like new worlds whenever they would release.. The main story was good, but the most time I spent was in online and hell yeah this game is FUN!. Grand Theft Auto V is one of, if not the best story game of all time, the story is one of the most thought out and fulfilling pieces of fiction I’ve seen and even though it was released back in 2013 it still holds up well to even newer titles functionally wise. If I had one problem with the game it would be it’s online mode is one of the most greediest games I’ve played infested by people who have no sense of fairness or integrity. Can’t wait for the sixth instalment coming out next year hopefully! 10/10. one of the best games in gaming history, the only drawback is that online is pretty buggy sometimes. A game I waited 4 years after its release to be able to play it and then I played it about 4 times. After the incredible experience of GTA 4, I had high expectations for Rockstar's next installment. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a lackluster attempt at an action-packed narrative that fell flat. The main characters—Michael, a wannabe Tony Soprano; Trevor, a wannabe serial killer; and Franklin, a wannabe thug—felt like shallow imitations rather than original, compelling figures. It seemed like the creators were trying too hard to cater to different fan-favorite genres like crime drama, horror, and murder, but the result was a disjointed mess. Los Santos, the game's backdrop, was equally disappointing. As someone who has lived in Los Angeles for 34 years, I can say that the city depicted in the game barely resembles the real LA beyond the surface visuals. Unlike GTA 4, where the story felt authentic and the city genuinely felt like New York, this game came across as trying too hard to be ""cool.""My biggest issue, however, is with the story. It was shallow at best and downright terrible at worst. The cast was a collection of overused film tropes, and the attempt to weave a coherent story around the trio was not only ridiculous but also embarrassing. The endings were all absurd—each one more disappointing than the last. While the action and gameplay were decent, they were nothing special. The game required little skill and felt more like an outlet for bored preteen boys who would rather go on a virtual rampage than burn ants with magnifying glasses. Overall, this game was a giant step backward for Rockstar compared to GTA 4.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story itself isn't particularly great, but each character made me feel like I was part of the game. Their emotions, behaviors, and interactions are incredibly engaging and enjoyable. Even after the main story ends, the game doesn't stop there. There's so much more to do—random events, various activities, and more. As for the online mode, I'm not really into it, but overall, it's still a very enjoyable experience.. I have gotten this game 3 times on ps4 xbox and pc and I think gta 5 is a good game with good graphics for its time. Story =1 Narrative of the story =1.5 Characterizations =1.75 Gameplay =2 Graphic =1.75 Result => 8/10. I maybe an Xbox Guy but the PS4 version of GTA 5 is the best version because the PS4 controller speaker makes noises like when the phone rings the speaker on the PS4 controller makes the ringing noise and the police radio calls in they come from the PS4 controller speaker which is pretty cool I'm not goanna lie. and the PS4 controller lights have amazing detail such as when you play as Franklin the controller light is green when you play as Michael the controller light is blue and when you play as Trevor the controller light is orange. but the coolest thing about the PS4 version of GTA 5 is that the when you're wanted by the police the PS4 controller light flashes red and blue and that's Awesome.. The best game of all time, not just crime and shooting games. What a set of characters . The best story. The driving is better than so many racing games.. I don't know why but it was too short and I couldn't connect with any of the characters, maybe the idea of ​​multiple main characters is not for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't have the option to give my review about GTA V PS3's version, I dunno why. However I can talk about PS4 and PS5 versions, well I think the story mode on ps4 and PS5 versions weren't so different than ps3 version, but, I thought GTA V online was better on PS3. When rockstar decided to close the servers os PS3 I got sad. I believe there has been a step backwards in online serves. And GTA has a lot of bugs in his trophies on ps4 version, I think its frustating, If I had the option to give my review about ps3's version, my score could be 10.. I could not finish the game. I just did not enjoyed the story. Even the bank mission did not caught my attention much. The game seemed just""one"" type.. I actually started the series with the original bird's eye view game so I was familiar with the basic idea. This game is a lot of fun, the graphics especially are excellent, the police chases are great but the story isn't that good. Despite the 18 age rating, it's obvious this game isn't actually aimed at adults at all, it's target audience is clearly boys aged from about 12. For me, the nightclub title ""The pink sandwich"" said it all, that is a really puerile joke. That's the fundamental reason why it's so successful, as you have an entirely new generation of kids coming in every year desperate to play it. The best bit in the entire game was being given the chance to kill Trevor!. Greatest free roam multiplayer of all time. Many things to do with friends or by yourself. Super fun to mess around. You can roleplay and do tons of missions. Generally an amazing game made by a solid company.. Its an amazing game with a great story but I don't think its as good as grand theft auto 4. Played this game after 10 years before it leaves PS Plus and forgot how much content is packed in it and how fun it is. As a gamer who plays games mostly for a good story, this is one of a rare games where beautiful world, gameplay and fun factor were so high that is outweighs average story so much that I still think it deserves a 10 (9,5 would be my exact score).Mentioned already that story is ok but nothing special, side quests are average as well. I understand desire to show satire of a mostly western modern way of life but maybe it was too much of satire and weird humor especially at the end. World that Rockstar built is a biggest asset ****, beautiful, detailed and with so many stuff to do. Switching between characters was incredible mechanic for the time game was released and it still is. Put classic GTA gameplay in it and you have hours and hours of fun. Voice acting and sound were quite good but music is incredible, maybe even better radio stations then San Andreas and Vice City, it fits the game perfectly. I am really glad I decided to play this game again, was not that excited for GTA VI before but I am now. All-time great game indeed.. Great story and lovable, crazy characters. Great story and online mode. A must have for any gamer.. This game is a masterpiece! It has good gameplay features, easy to learn controls. Even after so many years of playing this game, I still hop back on some time or the other. Rest you can see for yourself.. What an experience this game is! Both the story and the online are worth playing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I own this game for all generations of ps up **** is a really good game. my favorite game ever. The worst game ever. People who plays that shame are just dangerous and luxurious psychopaths. Video game is an art. A lot of people that I've met says: video game is not an art. And when I saw this game,I've thought that they were right.. I don't really know what more can you, expect from a video game, for sure in the top 10 games ever created. My favorite story driven sandbox game where i can mod it into oblivion and have the time of my life.. timeless ! , especially when I consider how revolutionary the game was at the time it came out and how long the game was available to play.. Even if you don't enjoy this game, you can't deny that it's great. It's almost perfect.. THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME THE BOAT GOAT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY FLAWLESS. Pretty fun game. Driving is the best part. Extremely modable which improves the experience heavily. Starting to show its age but pretty fun game.. GTA5 is locked in. They gave the world charm. They brought us a great protagonist system. All three leads are great. Trevor is a timeless character. The story was diverse. The lines were iconic. Still a top played game over a decade later.. GTA is characteristic in terms of freedom and content. It is undeniable a very good game. Still, I can't get myself to complete it. I am just not very interested in its superficial, materialistic tone (the over the top hood, rappers, Merica theme). I'd wish a rockstar game with a different tone.. one of just a few games I was able to finish. It's so good it did cure my depression, schizophrenia and anxiety issues, while giving me the best possible experience at the exact time (I was also able to smoke weed). It's so good it could probably cure Heisenbergs cancer. Still not as good as GTA IV which is the best game in the world imo. The main story of gta 5 is decent but nothing special. Best part of this game is the freedom and they delivered on that. this should be a game not a job. Time wasting game please be careful. Dont forget cheater everywhere. you better get a cheat for yourself or you will drown into grinding in-game cash.. Got bored quickly. Tries too hard to be funny sometimes, and you basically just kill people, that's all you gotta do.. Main game - light 5/10 Crashing cars - decent 8/10 Story missions are tedious and uninteresting, albeit with decently written characters, but the game truly shines through hitting cyclists. late to the party, premium game, cant wait for 6, almost ahead of its time it is still 'that' good in 2024. One of the best all time games that makes me wanna play all day driving in Los Santos. Good game in general. Nice story but I felt like it was short a bit. The graphics are on a top level. The reason that I have 8/10 is because of the excessive nude scenes, I felt like these scenes were unnecessary.. so good for 2013,open world,story and so good map.i know all places on los santos but imnot go there.. GTA 5 has a fun story with entertaining missions, the world os also amazing and there’s so much customization. The online mode builds on this and it’s amazing with friends or even just alone.. It's a GTA game with a robbery theme, it has a solid story with excellent characterization, but there are some serious problems with the mechanics. For example, the feel of the vehicle turns is unsatisfying and it feels like the physical rules have been broken :D However, the story is really good, maybe a bit exaggerated but still good.. Apart from the online mode, it is a very good game, I think it is still playable. In my opinion, it is better quality than most ""games"" released today.. REALY good game, but there are some things that could be better, for example, the ending of the story.. it gave me a new perspective on games and i was amazed at how good and enjoying it was. What kind of story?? Fake murdering and chareising that how the game start to give wonderfull story and gameplay to enjoying playing, the blood split in bunk and gunes store., to live three theifes live...... without the base of online, the game was entertaining, GTA is a monster on it's own right and gets better every time, we will see what GTA 6 brings. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GTA V is an exceptional game that flawlessly combines storytelling, gameplay, and freedom, solidifying its status as one of my all-time favorites. However, the introduction of the Oppressor MK2 in GTA Online has significantly disrupted the game's balance, often detracting from the overall experience by enabling overly dominant gameplay that overshadows the game's otherwise engaging and diverse online world. Despite this, GTA V's captivating narrative and expansive open world keep it at the pinnacle of gaming excellence.. Excellent game, fun guaranteed. The only problem is that the open world is a bit empty in the sense that it doesn't have many side missions, there's no way to talk to NPCs and you can't enter almost any interior. Another big problem is that the characters don't have that much depth, being more basically an action-oriented game. But if you've never played it, it's worth buying, you'll have a few dozen hours of guaranteed fun with the main missions and driving while admiring the beauty of the game's map.. After all these years, this game manages to be enjoyable. The boundless fun of Los Santos and a great core story. You can have fun even just eating to the sunset and good music, I think every fan of this game knows what I mean. Everything is perfect from start to finish, the details and elaboration of the game, its fun and features, and the online mode.. I always preferred this over IV. The characters have so much personality and depth along with an excellent story. That being said it lacks a lot of replay value for me mostly because it removed so much from the classics and it being mindlessly easy with the broken auto aim and special abilities. Its still a good game. I love it, a great open world game and a spectacular story, Rockstar Games did a good job. Even so there are some things that should be emphasized, such as the end of the story, it leaves me a little sad because it ends in a sudden way, but the story is quite dense and entertaining. Therefore, it is a great game that I recommend to play.. Cool world and one of a kind characters. Story is entertaining. Soundtrack is really great and has many good songs in it. Radio is also awesome and driving a car through the map is very relaxing.. I just don’t find these games fun. The novelty wore off after GTA 3 and it’s nothing more than a massive fetch quest fest.. Best Game OAT, Prime was insane, bought it on PC twice, Xbox 360, Xbox one, and on Xbox series s. Story is good, Online is fun (besides a few griefers, but thats life).. this game contains boobies and other nasty stuff that i cant even comprehend like shooting at COPS! no way will i ever buy this game ever again never never!! 4/20 - graphics were decent. Very good, 3rd best gta for me .. The game is a masterpiece. I like the story telling and very big open world map. Nothing to say, just a Masterpiece in the videogames world and still better then some other games of the new generation.. This is literally the best game to show to anyone new to gaming, but still very good for those who have been gaming for decades. I doubt you'll find anyone who doesn't enjoy all the things you can do in this game.. The best game and I recommend try it game and new people................... Online kinda ruins this game it’s fun but the single player is unmatched great experience. ""Grand Theft Auto V is a titan of open-world games. With a vast, detailed world in and around Los Santos, it offers an impressive experience. The multiple narrative, following three main characters, adds depth to the story and diversity to the gameplay. The freedom to explore, undertake quests and immerse yourself in side activities is immense. In addition, GTA V offers an online mode, GTA Online, which has created a thriving and constantly evolving community, adding even more value to a game that is already a masterpiece in the world of video games."". GTA5 is one of my favorite games of my life. so I want to say.. "" the Glory eTernAlly foreVer "". A near perfect game that overstayed its welcome and left the single-player story begging for scraps. Best game of the world beatiful you can do anything very very good game probably one of the best i have played. ""I absolutely adore Grand Theft Auto V; it stands as the first and only installment in the Grand Theft Auto series that I've completed. I highly recommend giving it a try; the captivating storyline and incredible characters truly make it an unforgettable experience."". Very boring play and not my cup of tea, the idea is horrible and being theft don't help. Boring characters and boring plot make this game boring, give me 4 again I'd rather be a character that is new to a country and trying to make it! Now that fun not following some dumb Americans around, I play games to get taking away by the story not seeing everyday life of the dumb US!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Grand Theft Auto V is a stunning achievement in gaming, especially on PC. It runs seamlessly, enhancing the quintessential GTA experience. The graphics are breathtaking, bringing Los Santos to life with incredible detail. The PC community adds another layer of fun with its modding scene, offering endless ways to personalize gameplay. The open-world depth is unmatched, providing limitless opportunities to explore, wreak havoc, or simply revel in its rich environment. It feels like a universe unto itself and remains an iconic gaming experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The pinnacle of the GTA series. A must play period and one of the greatest games of all time. But you knew this already.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good game, graphics, story and gameplay but why so many DLC's and so expensive?. A game that seamlessly combines the functions and play-styles of hundreds of other works into a balanced, fun, and fast paced experience that surpasses almost all others.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This revi","the story is very good, the game is boring at first but still very good a few missions that I hate . with a wide variety of missions, the game takes us from nostalgic moments to large-scale heists that leave us in awe . the inclusion of the online mode keeps players engaged and far from boredom ."
100.Super Mario 3D World,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just an all around good Mario game. There's nothing that really stands out about it but it doesn't need anything because of its great and fun level design. I do dislike the need to replay the entire game with all the different characters but it was only a minor nuisance and I eventually 100%ed it.. It'sa good game maybe even a ten with friends but solo is a little boring. I loved the challenge of 100 percent completion but not doing 100 percent feels required to enjoy the game at its best. The huge amount of post game is a plus but it's just harder version of levels from the base game. Still really good and playing with friends makes the game way funnier and better plus the port makes it easier. Pretty Good/10. Super Mario 3D World is the bigger and better Super Mario 3D Land. Perfect for Homeconsoles and an overall great 3D Mario platformer. 9,65/10. This game is a nice mixture between a 3D and 2D Mario game, I remember when I bought it at launching (anxious to play it).Nice new powerups and a fun opportunity to play couch multiplayer. For me, this is the best game for Nintendo Wii U System.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I. LOVE. THIS. GAME! Nothing but pure joy out of this one. Even though this game feels quite safe, that doesn't stop it from being a stand out experience on the WIi U!. nintendo switch version is better than wii u it`s faster and the super mario bowser`s fury it`s very good. This game is so mid i dont even recommend this game and its on the wii U the power ups are so boring. It's a really creative Mario game, with each level having it's own mechanics and secrets. Also, Mario has never been as fun in multiplayer as in this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You know, everyone says this is the most vanilla Mario game ever after NSMBU, but in this case, I think the basic tone of this game is rather cozy. You may not be going into the depths of Corona Mountain, or plummeting into other planets out in the universe, but the little toybox-esque levels have so much cute charm to them that it justifies this game's existence. And I gotta say, the music is oddly good, too. It's like they took a loan from Mario Galaxy with how contrasting the tones are. Again, this game isn't tough stuff, but that's why I like it. Its not afraid to admit that it's a bit soft. And playing it with someone else is really fun. (Would highly recommend to play it on a rainy day with a close friend and a cup of hot cocoa. May replace close friend with son/daughter/relative kin of choice if you wish).. Worst mario game, this is boring cringe and ass, mario transform in cat this is so **** bro. They didn't even try with this one because they know that nintendo fans would buy anything that has nintendo on it. nothing but recycled content and generic set pieces we've seen time and time again. It's only good when you play with friends because you can piss them off really hard over a **** mario game. Super Mario 3D World has a few flaws to it, like some odd placement of obstacles in a 3D plain, some uncreative bosses, and a bit of hand holding here and there. But how I really remember this game is simply having a blast with friends. 3D World simply adds so much to Mario that it feels a bit magical when you play it, and time stands still. With a lot of visual and audio cues that take my nostalgia away to a magical place; 3D World is simply something everyone should want to play at some point.. Incredible game, incredible graphics and incredible music. You must play this game if you have a Wii U or a Switch.. Super mario 3D world on the wii u was vastly diffrent to most 3D mario games, and thats what makes it so good, the cat mario, the final boss and miiverse also played a huge role in this game, it was cool seeing other people opinions on the level when loading in, shame miiverse isnt on switch it was very good and it was great.. Excellent 3d platformer game! I got this with my first-ever Wii U and have had tons of fun playing it with friends. The 3d controls are surprisingly easy to learn, especially for a game that isn't a turn based RPG like Pokemon. It also provides a challenge at times, it's much more challenging than the other Mario games on the Wii but isn't absolutely crushingly hard.. This game is literally perfect. THe pacing is good, the levels are unique and have actual themes unline 3D land, the graphics are so amazing and are fun to look at, the bosses are amazing, the music is amazing, the multiplayer is fun, and it really feels like 2D mario transitioned into 3D and it did it alot better than Super Mario 3D Land. Highly suggest playing this masterpiece. This video game is a ZERO. Every time I played Mario 3d world, I did not have fun. The idea that 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games Mixing is not a good idea. The idea does work for 3D Land which is a little bit fun. However 3D world is just not fun at all.. Super Mario 3D World seems to be one of the more underrated games in the series, but I think it's great and the perfect step up from what 3D Land was. 3D World added new mechanics, had countless levels to play, and although some people don't like linear Mario gameplay in a 3D setting, I thought this was great. One of the biggest highlights from the Wii U era, and a game that's still a blast to play.. Its not a 10 just because its too short, spent a lot of money and finished it in less than 2 days doing 100%, but had a great time, cant go wrong with mario. And the most beautiful in terms of graphics in the series before Odyssey launched.. Playing this expecting it to live up to the astronomical standards of the Galaxy duo is only going to give you heartbreak. However, it is a great game in its own right, with distinct levels that jump between mechanics and concepts with ease. Great fun and an extremely polished 3D Mario title.. This game was my childhood! It introduced me into the world of games, but even with that reason, it's alright.. I have to appreciate how good this game is with family members. Solo I would never play it, as there is a real dearth of new ideas and great level design here.. Masterpiece! I literally have no issues with it. The level design is mostly great though like every game, there are a few levels that ****. It ranges in difficulty which is rare in Mario games. The music is good and catchy. This is the first time that You get to play as Rosalina outside of Mario kart and she is the best to play as in my opinion. It's cool how every character has their own Unique gimmick; Luigi can jump higher than the rest; Peach can hover and glide for a short amount of time; Rosalina has the spin attack from Mario Galaxy and blue toad can run the fastest. The graphics are great. There ate tons of Easter eggs to be found in this game from all over the Mario franchise and even a whole course dedicated to the original Mario circuit in the original super Mario kart. The cat suit is a nice edition and is fun to use. the hub worlds are bigger and more detailed than in its predecessor (Super Mario 3D Land for the 3Ds). There are so many worlds and they aren't the same for once. Also, it's a huge breath of fresh air that we are not rescuing Princess Peach for once as it's and overused plot in this franchise. Instead you have to save pixies. The multi player is also great and in single player, you're not forced to play as Mario which is definitely good. Overall, this is a great game and a must play.. Nice graphics, criativity, good pos game. But boss battles are to easy than other stages., good mechanics are used few times , and others not so good several times, The soundtrack is good, but repetitive.. The Wii U was a failure. The console wasn't bad, though. The marketing was horrible. Lots of the games were bad. But, there were some good games. 3D world is horribly underrated. ""Oh, really?"" some may say. But I will prove this is the best Wii U game. Wait, Mario and Luigi are PLUMBERS? The story is that Bowser, instead of stealing one princess, he steals eight. It's by no standard good, but story doesn't decide a platformer. It is a linear platformer like 3D land. Lots of people don't like this. I prefer the open-world style, but this is fine. The levels were designed for 4 players, but they're fine for 1 player. But I have to say, this is the best multiplayer in any Mario game. There are 4 collectibles per level, each not being impossible to find. There are 4 characters you can play as, and you need to swap occasionally to get certain collectibles. There is also a character after the game. You need them to progress to boss levels, but this wasn't an issue, even when I played for the first time when I was FIVE! The bosses are easy though, and they have my least favorite character ever, Boom Boom. I could rant on and on about why I hate Boom Boom, but luckily a lot of them are creative. Some of the levels seem like experiences of their own, and I sometimes still like to play. The gameplay is a 9/10. Very solid. The presentation is the same as most Mario games in HD. The locations are old Mario POIs, but better. On the world map they seem uninspired, but in-level they look gorgeous. Like Puffprod Peaks. Seeing it gives me so much nostalgia. The music is the best of any mainline Mario game. Puffprod Peaks is my favorite. It gets a 9/10. You'll like the presentation. It takes about 15 hours to beat. If you are only playing the story, it's easy and short. If you are only playing the story WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? It takes about 50 hours to beat. There is 3 post-game worlds, and there is a very good 100% reward that I won't spoil. There are 3 stars per level and 1 stamp that you COULD use for Miiverse, but on the Switch you can take pictures with them. The content is a 10/10. Lots of content. This game, on the surface, looks shallow, but grows on you like moss. I am heavily nostalgic for this game as it was the first I ever played. People who didn't get the Wii U missed out. I like it more than the Switch. Nintendo experimented back then, but in the Switch era, they don't even try. Get this game on the Wii U or Switch. Please.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is pretty good. Super mario 3d world was my very first game on wii u and I got it on christmas of 2013 the same time I got the wii u. I got the game because I loved super mario 3d land and I decided that I really wanted the game. It was love at first site. However that's when OCD issues started to take form and I enjoyed the game way less. I tried my best to think about it like I did when I got it on Christmas but I wouldn't work like some levels I don't like playing due to my OCD striking at the time. However, as a game itself, it was really good but I think if there was a star collecting 3d mario game on the wii u as well.. maybe a super mario sunshine remake, most people would have no issue with it. The levels are somewhat more diverse than it's 3d land counterpart and there are 4 players. It can get really fun and chaotic.. Compared to the other Super Mario Bros. games like Super Mario 64, it is lacking in certain places, but for someone wanting a new experience to enjoy with family/friends, this is definitely the Nintendo game for you. Absolutely solid AAA Mario game, with new mechanics diverse characters with abilities that match characters like peach float, Luigi jump boost, et cetera. Level design is fantastic and will always leave you with a smile. It is simple and leaves things to be desired such as custom game modes, but I can always find new things to do in the game, whether it's a tag within the levels, messing with the level selection world, and so much more. My only notable problem is the lack of movement options, I personally like a game where you feel fast and skillful, and there are few ways to move. There is the basic walk and run, holding jump to go higher or a short jump, a weirdly times ground pound jump, and an unreliable crouch jump and backflip, long jump, rolling than long jumping, ground-pounding, and finally spin jumping. A dive move like in Super Mario Odyssey or Super Mario 64 would have been welcome since there are no aerial movement options in this game. Overall, fantastic game to play, and if you play it enough it grows on you until you start to feel like a professional speedrunner. Playing with friends/family is most optimal, but even by yourself there is an incredibly difficult final level in a secret world, which you can attempt, and you think about how packed with content this game is. Great game, 8/10.. My favourite Mario game other than the two galaxies. The ranking mostly is due to the multiplayer mode. Everyone shares lives so no one wants to kill each other, but the crown and point system still allows for there to be some competition. It also has the double cherry and some of the best level designs and bosses from the series.. Super Mario 3d world is a perfect game, the bosses are incredible, the levels are fantasy, my favorite power: Super feline bell, raccoon. He gave: 10 to 10. Now, SUPER MARIO 3D WORLD is fantastic and one of the finest 2.5D Mario games, but it was translated to the Nintendo Switch with a completely new mode, and if I were to evaluate it in 2013, I would give it a ten out of ten, but alas.. The biggest Mario game on the Wii U, and while not full 3D, is fun enough to be more than enough on its own.. Not challenging enough due to the focus on making it multiplayer friendly. Well designed, but lacking that special something. I didn’t expect too much from this game when I saw some previews, since it looked like little more than a console iteration of Mario 3D Land. But after completing the first two worlds, I was proven wrong. Super Mario 3D World adds enough new content making it distinct. The biggest marketed aspect was definitely the new cat suit. It allowed my character to climb walls, which proved to be pretty broken in the first couple worlds, but the game slowly added more suitable platform design that forced me to apply the climbing ability in clever ways. I also had a dive attack which was fun to use, and a nice change from the same old hovering ability the tanooki suit offered for the 100th time. Visually, this game was gorgeous. Everything looked so cute. I guess the cat suit amiplified that. It was hard to resist awww-ing when looking at Goombas in the cat suit trying to dive attack me. Or Goombas in big skates chasing me around an ice rink. And the final showdown had Bowser in a cat suit, struggling to climb up walls. It was hard to take the fight seriously. I couldn’t stop smiling. The worlds were absolutely beautiful. After Galaxy 2, this was the first 3D Mario to have a true HD resolution. Looking at the lush colorful environment made the whole platform experienced a lot more immersive. World 8 was my favorite. There were a lot of night time levels, which made the lighting stand out, creating a feeling like I was in a carnival. The hub world in this one is quite unique. It’s a hybrid. Although, at the heart, it still followed the prayer bead structure, I could go off course and explore the map. Not that there was really anything to explore, aside from random 1-ups and coin blocks. It ended up just giving the illusion of freedom. Littered throughout the map were captain toad puzzles. I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Toad on the 3DS, so this was a big welcome. The puzzle designs always found a way to surprise me. Instead of walking around the area to find secrets, the focus was on rotating the camera to find secrets, which I still find to be a refreshing concept. These segments also utilized the gamepad by having me blow on the microphone to raise a platform, or touch the screen to raise a platform, which was neat. Couldn’t say the same for the action segments that had me use the touch screen though. It was nothing short of clumsy and annoying being forced to take my right hand off the controller, touch the screen to bring out a platform, then quickly put it back so I could jump onto the platform.. It's 3D platforming perfection but isn't very inventive and doesn't really do anything new for Mario.. The best original Wii U game by a fairly wide margin. Super Mario 3D world is a hybrid between 2D and 3D Mario, and I absolutely love it! Although not perfect, the platforming is very solid and there is plenty to do here for hours on end.. One of the best mario 3d after mario galaxy series. Fresh gameplay,beatiful platformer Beginners and talents on this genre Everything is suitable for mario 3d world. This Mario version looks basic but it is really good to play this game. It is different from other Mario games that are available on internet. The story is slightly different from the usual: Instead of capturing Peach, Bowser captures the Sprixie princesses and runs away to the Sprixie Kingdom. Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad go after him. One notable addition to the game is that you can play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, or an unlockable character. They each have different strengths and weaknesses. Luigi can jump high, but has low traction on his feet (couldn't he just get different shoes?). Princess Peach can hover for a short time after jumping, but runs slower. Toad runs the fastest, but also falls to the ground the fastest. Mario's biggest strength is that he doesn't have any weaknesses, and his biggest weakness is that he doesn't have any weaknesses (he's the all-around balanced type). I won't spoil the unlockable character, but you can probably figure out her strengths and weaknesses just by playing as her. The best thing about this game is it is multiplayer. Using your favorite character while playing with other people can make for a fun time. A great part of the game is the introduction of the Cat power-up. When one of the characters gets a Super Bell, they turn into Cat Mario, or Cat Luigi, etc. Then they can climb up walls, which helps you get some secret treasure to help you unlock some bonus levels. You can also swipe at enemies with cat claws. That's cool.. Pros: + amazing artsyle and music + balanced difficulty curve + creative end game stages + toad levels + multiple playable characters Cons: (none). Super Mario 3D Worlds Fun yet flawed Super Mariod #D Worlds originally came to Wii U in 2013 and is now available on the switch in this new collection, Here you can play with up to 4 players, you can play as Mario, luigi, princess peach, and toad.. setting out to rescue these faries from bowser… Super mario 3D worlds starst out with pure nintendo magic.. this is a 7 hour long, pure platforme meets collectathon.. eacuh of the levels in each world contains 3 stars for you to find… and at least trying to look for them is necessary because of the collectathon aspect, there are road blocks in your way that require a certain amount of stars to proceed.. this can be annoying in some games, but here in 3d orlds the ask is pretty manageable and wont have you banging your head off of a wall trying to move on.. in fact looking for the stars really is the hook of this game.. as the levels here are all super short… youre mostly dodging enemies and obstacles, and collecting upgrades to help you find these stars.. and for the first half of the game I was having a lot of fun.. I couldn’t put the controller down.. the colors, the sounds, the level design.. the star finding.. I was hooked.. unfortunately though 3d worlds doesn’t do enough to consistently feel so amazing… the uniqueness and variety starts to fade the longer the game goes on.. reused assests and even reused boss battles… Super Mario 3d Worlds feels so padded out and full of repeat content.. so you don get that feeling of excitement to see the next world or level im used to for Mario games… youre just hoping, man I sure hope theres no desert or lava here… and this also leads to levels just blending.. ask me what my favorite level was from 3D worlds.. I couldn’t tell you, because its all a blur, and levels standing out really only matter in 2 types of games, racing and platforming… and a las, here we are with a platforming game that has levels youll forget about in a week… Thankfully 3D worlds is still fun to play through and see through to end. Even with my omplaints, super Mario 3D worlds proves to be a gret and addictive collectathon that was hard to put down.. I just wouldv liked to see a little more Nintendo magic and variety in the level design. I give Super Mario 3D Worlds an 8.5/10. not quite as impressive as 3D land on the 3DS, the levels sometimes feel emptier because multiplayer was a thing, but this game had a lot of charm and quite a few surprises along the way (unlike NSMBU). and without this game, we wouldn't have gotten odyssey, so it deserves praise for that alone. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I was extremely impressed with the graphics at the time the game was released, and the game is excellent. I do not think this game compares to Sunshine or Galaxy in scope, but nonetheless the game is absolutely worth a try. I would urge anybody with a Wii U to play this game. I prefer the Wii U version over the Switch, as I personally favor the Wii U control scheme. If you have a Switch, it's still worth playing the port. I love the graphics and music that this game provides, especially some of the levels, and their aesthetic. My biggest problem is with the difficulty, and that's because this game is WAY too easy. I only ever get stuck because I'm going to fast, or I get fed up with the level. I would recommend the game to anybody who has never played a 3D Mario game, because this is the perfect lace to start. The game was clearly not designed for experienced players, and I'm surprised this wasn't released on the Wii. I still like the game and I even prefer it to Sunshine. If you are new to the series than I encourage you to play this one first, and if you're a veteran, you should play through with a friend to keep things exciting. When all is said and done, this is a good game. 3D World isn't the most impressive, challenging or large game out there, but it's worth a shot. (It's also one of two of the games I've 100% completed). One of my favourite games on the Wii U and it's a pretty good game anyways with all the unique levels this is sure to be a future classic.. The gameplay is simple but fun. Multiplayer is amazing, But the camera could be better. I was pretty skeptical at this game at first. It felt like a step back from the Mario Galaxy games. But it really isn't! It's a huge, fun game with loads of challenges and it focuses more on classic platforming. Everything looks great and it plays as smooth as one might expect from a Mario game. The only thing I found a bit frustrating is the lack of focus on collecting stars until the very end, where suddenly I had to backtrack and collect a lot of them to be able to move on. Nevertheless, redoing all those levels was fun. Next week the Switch version comes out and you bet I'll be playing that one.. By far the funnest Mario game in years! I urge anyone with a wii u to purchase this game. This is pure AAA grade Nintendo gaming. The local multiplayer is an absolute blast anyone can join & leave whenever. Perfect game for families or hanging out with friends. Hi. I absolutely love this game I played it as a kid and also watched YouTube walkthroughs at the young ages of 4-5. I just about finished the game in 1 month, then my Wii U broke, I was crushed when it broke. Ever level has many different challenges, its just a great game that's all I am saying. I think it is a must play for all ages.. soooooooooooooooooooo why do people call this game to be a let down? theres nothing wrong with it and i think its by far one of the best mario games same with the Wii U i thought the Wii U was good the only thing bad about it was the name and the ads nothing else was bad about it and this game is one of the best mario and best games of all time the graphics feel so awesome the music is catchy the best music is sunshine seaside and super bell hill everything is good about this game so i think i will give a 9/10. After playing on and off since 2015, I finally got around to beating this game, and I'm glad I did. 3D World is an absolute must if you own a Wii U, and even if you don't the upcoming Switch port will give you another opportunity to play this amazing game. Many complain that the game is linear, which is true. It's very obvious that 3D World and its precursor (3D Land) are 2D games with an extra axis. Its linear nature on its own makes it difficult to stack up against other 3D Mario games, but it brings its own charm that is displayed especially in World Bowser, which has more charm than even some of the better levels in other 3D Mario games. However, it's low difficult makes the game pretty short, and if you're planning on getting the Switch port I'd wait a few weeks and scower out used copies. If you own a Wii U, used copies are cheap. And of course, we can't forget the multiplayer. 3D World stands as the only 3D Mario game with a full multiplayer mode, and it brings the chaotic fun of NSMB's multiplayer. I'd go as far as to say that 3D World is the definitive multiplayer Mario experience. Overall, it's a fun time that is a must-play for any Wii U owner. I'm glad that it will finally get the chance it deserves on the Switch. (Played on a Wii U). i love super mario 3d world, this game is really fun to play, and the levels are amazing.. Mario 3D World is a fun game. We don't have a masterpiece like the Galaxy games, or 64, but we have a fun and enjoyable ride nonetheless. I believe that this is one of the best 2D Mario games, oh wait. That's probably Mario 3D World's big problem is that it has more similarities to the 2D games then the 3D games, despite having 3D in the title. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though, it's just on the same level as most of the 2D Mario games (which is definitely not bad) instead of jumping to that amazing 3D Mario titles. Although I talk about how it's to similar to the 2D games, the 2D games need to take notes of this game. Mostly all the levels feel original in their own way. They always have some way of being different than the pervious levels. Mario 3D World also has some underrated music. It feels super jazzy, and I think Odyssey's music was definitely inspired by this game. I overall think Mario 3D World is a really fun game, but not anything amazing. I give it an 7.5/10 and a B-.. While not as revolutionary as Mario 64 or Galaxy, 3D World manages to feel simultaneously fresh and nostalgic in a way the New Super Mario Bros. series never quite realized.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 3D World is a fun entry in the Mario series. It might be a bit lacking in terms of challenge. But that's good if you're a new comer to the series. It's colorful, it runs super well, and it has the best co-op in any of the 3D Mario games.. Nice game.....................................,............................................... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Mario 3D World makes 3d Land better than 3d Land. By having put the multiplayer and the phases of Captain Toad, this Wii U opus excels in the video game despite some things that could have been mastered, A forgettable Ost and a post game worse than 3d land. Let's not forget the excellent level design and artistic direction of the levels while making a nod to Galaxy in its way of being .... the plot in the game is simple, it is made only in order to set a goal for the player. the gameplay is very interesting and does not let you get bored even for a second. plus is fun for 4 players.. this is a pretty fun Mario game.. It has some of the cool mario stuff that you'd expect.. but yknow.. it's not as big and grand as I like the Mario games to be. Still a very tight and fun game.. This is probably the best game on the Wii U. Just a superb platformer and a hell of a lot of fun. This game is fun and I really enjoy it but it lacks heart. It feels like they needed a Mario game for the Wii U and made a pretty generic one. One more problem is because the charecters have different stats some struggle with certain levels. Also worlds levels don't match the world theme. I still do reccomend it however.. Raw Super Mario gameplay distilled to its bare basics without distractions on the way of the fun.. Before this one, I had played only one Mario game in my life. But I fell in love with SM3W. Everything in this game appears to be done with a lot of affection for the character and the fans. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is captivating, the controls, the level design, everything is amazing! I've played as an indication by one of my friends, and I do not regret I've listened to him. The game is challenging, and makes you want to perfect it.. I would love to see more Mario games like this one. I really love this game, and it was the first 3D Mario game i completed. Very underrated game and I hope there´s a port for Switch, or a new game.. Visually stunning game with great controls. Most of the levels are great and fun to play. This game is very very satisfying to 100 percent. Creative levels that utilize different mechanics. The finale “champions road” was difficult and actually required skill to beat it. This was genuinely difficult and not artificially difficult (no enemy spam,no short time limit, etc.). That type of challenge is actually fun. Overall, I Love it. The only set back for me from giving it a 10 would be that playing every single level 5 times gets annoying. 3D land was stretching it with 2 times, 3D world is abusing it by changing it to 5. The levels get pretty boring when you have to play them 5 times each. Beating champions road 5 times probably took me 2 hours. That is lot of time spent on just one level. You only get that satisfaction of beating that level once. The other 4 times aren’t special. A minor gripe I have with this game is a lack of reward for truly 100 percent in the game, again, it’s minor, but I’d still like to point it out. I said earlier that 100 percenting the gam is satisfying, that’s true— until the very end. I had 5 shiny stars at the end of world flower, and still had 5 shiny stars when I completed world crown. Why doesn’t the game just wait to give me the 5th star until world crown is beaten, or just give me a 6th star on my file. The only thing that changes on your file is that your green stars go up by 38, and your stamps go up by 9. Unless you already know the exact amount of green stars and stamps that are in the game, you would have no idea the game is really 100 percent done. I know I just complained a lot, but I really do love this game and highly recommend it.. I know it's a good game. It's fun. But it is nowhere near the level of its predecessors. I was waiting for a super mario masterpiece for wii U :(.. Super Mario 3D World is a colorful, fun, and smooth Mario game with beautiful graphics. That doesn't mean the game doesn't have cons, though. The story takes a blow from unoriginality, and I don't like the level design. Like most Mario games, the levels felt like platforms to jump on, and it felt empty, and it didn't feel like it was lived in. Also, I wanted an open world Mario game. One more thing: I want original bosses! All of the bosses except the amazing final boss have been in most Mario games. Overall, a flawed yet great Mario title. I wish this would be remade for the switch.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved Mario 3D Land, and Captain Toad, so i was really hyped to 3D World, which did not disappointed me. The game has amazing level design, with tons of ideas with really good usage. Sadly some stages get stale pretty quick, but the multiplayer aspect really shines in this regard. A pretty good M","just an all around good 3D Mario game . it's a nice mixture between a 3D and 2D Mario game . it's a really creative Mario game, with each level having it's own mechanics and secrets ."
101.Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty,"The campaign wasn’t that bad, but they failed to integrate it with esports, leaving nothing to do after completing the entire campaign.. They really tried hard to surpass the original here and while I don't think they did, that doesn't make this any less great. The basic premise still holds up for the gameplay and the story excellently starts where the expansion for the original ended. It's a worthy sequel that is ALMOST essential to play but you don't have to.. Defined its genre at launch and continues to be a solid game, though its prime has passed.. Does the things very good, you can even play even if you haven't played starcraft I. Highly recomend. Also other campaings such as Hots and Lotv are super cool too.. best startegy game ever, the cgi parts so good bro it's exceptional... addicting and challeging gameplay, no easy task to kill the last boss. Starcraft i think is one of the best games ever made. But starcraft 2 i think it lacks just a little bit in the graphic system. I loved the original Starcraft and Brood war. And while Starcraft 2 is still good gameplay-wise and character-wise, the story is much worse. It feels like they wanted to get rid of the series. Wrap it all up and be done with it. Pretty stale and straight-forward, uninspired. No more twists, betrayals and interesting political situations, like the original story had. Overall The whole Xel'naga and Duran story-line mystery especially has basically been straight up thrown away. The story of Wings of Liberty is especially bland and the weakest of the 3. Gameplay: 10 Characters: 7 Story: 2. Pretty fun RTS game. Really enjoyed the upgrade systems and the involved campaign missions. Memorable story and characters, but overall campaign was pretty forgettable for me. Somehow feels like less than the sum of its parts.. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. Good example of good quality game, good campaigne, I am still playing sc2 in 2022 in customs. Best game ever still playing in 2022, too bad Blizzard doesnt make games like they use to anymore if we should even still call them Blizzard.. In some way it feels like StarCraft and just a little bit... rushed? I feel I just lack of something there.. The best game of its kind, with a very good story and captivating characters in a strategy game. With excellent balance between troops. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Starcraft 2 is the standard of strategy. This is probably the last masterpiece game from Blizzard. Absolutely everything was good in Starcraft.. Probably the Blizzard's game with the most quality. Despite being Blizzard's answer to 40k, the design, story and world setting is really interesting. Complex mechanics make you enjoy the game after some time of training. This is not actually bad, but a matter of taste.. It's a shame they didn't take the script as seriously as they did the technical part. I played both parts already 10 times. The first part was much more serious and more mature, I would call it category R, ​​and the second part is PG-13. It feels like the story of the first part is not ideal, but it was written by people with a level of knowledge comparable to university students .. It would seem that we have grown, they have too... Many naive works of art from our childhood grew up with us and began to acquire adult materialistic features or even rethought, without ceasing to be themselves, without losing the spirit of the original source. But not StarCraft. He not only remained in the same place, but also took a step back. Feels like the second part was written by schoolchildren. The game itself became brighter, the feeling of stuffiness disappeared, a large amount of children's humor appeared. An evil villain who is evil because he is evil, Prophecies, chosen ones, cosmic magic, abstract gods devouring worlds to which it is difficult to experience any kind of emotion, just as a person is not able to feel the distance in light years (since our biology was formed in conditions where this was not necessary), pink queen of blades, with a healthy complexion, neat eyebrows, hair styling and lip gloss with stilettos from a modeling agency called ""swarm"" ... if stilettos are her evolutionary advantage, then what does the world in which she exist look like? The world of strip clubs? Queen of our ... ""blades"". She is no longer a ruthless sociopath and manipulator, but a campy hysterical model from high society in Zerg. The first part is materialism, realism, and the second part is idealism and romanticism / classicism. The first SC is Terminator 1, 2, Alien 1, 2, Bladerunner and SC2 is Terminator 3, 5. This was the first time the game hurt me, the second time was BL3. In the opening videos Wol, Hots, LotV there is the spirit of the first part of the game, but in the game itself and in the rest of the videos, everything is much and much worse. And it's not the high cost of the videos, watch the SC: BroodWar videos. They are outdated, but they have a sense of danger, war, impending threat. The videos in the second part seem to be made by Hollywood. Secondary techniques, only proven methods. They seemed to come off the assembly line, as a result of the work of a raw neural network, and not of people.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. if u are a fan of rts games there is nothing better than this so 10 out of 10 SP is just great as well. StarCraft II is a masterclass real-time strategy game that rightfully deserves all the attention given to it.. The best RTS that ever existed. Period. They don't make games like this anymore. Now that Blizzard has been merged with Activision, there's no hope that Blizzard will come up with any game with an ounce of finesse and decent story. Guess I'll play this to the day I die. En Taro Zaratul !!!. Utterly immersive. Graphics are **** on, the audio is very good and the point and click gameplay using just a mouse for me is perfect. Tons of additional content in the form of levels and loads of ways to affect the gameplay. Still play this today.. My only complaint about Wings of Liberty is the scale of the campaign story. In Starcraft and Brood war, 3 races were fighting for supremacy of the sector. Here, you're a small rebellion fighting for scraps. Apart from that, the campaign is actually great, with a lot of variations and a good progress mechanism. Blizzard tried hard for both single and multiplayer to make the game approachable, but it remains very challenging to master. It is definitely varied and more challenging than the original Starcraft.. We were waiting for it for so long. Such an amazing continuation of the story.. I've 3850 hours in this and the other three DLS's (Heart of the Swarm, Legacy of the void and The Nova Campaign) and on the online mode. This is by far the best RTS game that I have played (I played a lot of RTS games, like Age one, two and three (the original and remasterd versions) and all c&c games). The A.I is by far one of the best, the online mode is fantastic (don't play on Korean servers, you gonna lose). The performance is also good I get over 300 FPS on ultra settings (Gtx 970, without V-Sync). The voice actors have down great work. I never had bugs. The first part/DLC is the three (Wings of Liberty), for me this is the best campaign of all, but the others are also worth it. But it if you like RTS games and like the future setting. Starcraft 2: WoL has by far the best campaign of all 4! Also the multiplayer was something new back then. Fantastic game!. 10 years later and I keep playing this game regularly. Definitely the best RTS out there. The campaign is great and the story is nice although the tone of it was made to appeal to younger audiences as well, but I am ok with it.. Very good real-time strategy, one of the real-time strategies that I played the most. Fans of the original game seem to be very divided in their score, but all I can say it was worth the money.. Most played game all time for me. Online mode is addictive. I never cared about campaign too much.. A very great game with unbelievable depth, graphics still beautiful 10 years after release and a very grown up and well alive community. A few inevitable minor bugs, like absolutely every online game ever, but nothing gamebreaking. (Talking bout multiplayer of course, because otherwise why are you playing Starcraft after all). Pretty much the best you can do out of Rts. Campaing is super fun. Finished it like 5 times at this point. And will comeback to it more in years :). 9/10 A very good game. Was a huge fan to the original Starcraft and Brood war. Was hyped when it was announced and came out. Solid story and campaign, and just as good multiplayer. Its almost starcraft 1 but with better graphics and sounds and some general changes.. I'm gonna give it a perfect 10. Loved the Campaign, loved it. The graphics and feel of the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great, great story. The game is addictive, worry about the main characters. Definitely 9 points.. Great strategy game, great story and level design. I give it an 8 out of 10.. Meticulously designed, balanced effects, ineffable storyline and an egregious supervillan!. this game has some of the most cool features out there today [2020] the only real complaint by me is the graphics i mean there not that bad you know [crashing] but other than that i think it's amazing game and the creators of starcraft are awesome. I played competitively for some time, but stopped because it is too much about the speed at which you can click and not enough about strategy & tactics. The game also looks outdated, comical and its single player campaign was too simple and not engaging compared to the original.. The game suprised me with how interesting and good the story was. Multiplayer is also great.. Awesome cinematic, great balance, various missions, decent plot, return of loved characters, nice management of the troops. Also I like ideas with achievments & icons. God damn it, I wrote it and now I want to play it again :). Such an old game now... And it still holds up. After playing other RTS, I still find myself returning to Starcraft. I've played this game to death back when it first launched, and every year I return to it. A lot of other RTS games always try to over complicate the games. So I like the simplicity, yet still huge variety that Starcraft offers. The campaign mode is actually good for an RTS. Each three class, now with their own campaign as well. But main characters to follow their storylines. And of course, the many many custom maps and mods, arcade modes, and now the really fun co-op mode! I wish they'd expand upon the co-op mode and make some 4 player co-op modes. And then redo an entire full campaign with a co-op mode. I'd love to go through the campaign, gaining gas and mats and money, just like the normal campaign. But only with a friend. Upgrading our units differently as we go. And take on a full co-op campaign.. Sequel on of the best RTS games in history, which I never played. That's why I give a chance to this one and I was not disappointed. Great gameplay, MP and campaign. What more do you want :). Incredibly short game. Just when you are starting to get into it, it's over! Cannot understand why it is praised so highly.. This game has become a very big breath of very fresh air in the strategy genre. I would say that for me it is the best real-time strategy about battles. The continuation of the cult story of the first game, made in a new, very beautiful and stylish graphics. All movements, animations, sounds and music are made at the highest level as Blizzard only can do. The plot and cut-scenes of the game make you constantly watch and delve into, like a some good movie or book. Such a strategy seems to be for the most part in a single structure (battles on a limited area in the form of a map), but many levels in this game are something unique with their own ideas. And the rest, what are just battles with the bases, are still made so, that they are never boring, and you do not think that they are similar. In this game, absolutely everything is perfect.. Great RTS with a good story. Each faction plays in a unique while still being balanced.. If you like Real Time Strategy, games this is one of the best ones. There are so many different ways to play Starcraft.. The classic is back on an epic Masterpiece. The story, characters, plot, units, visuals, everything is just amazing, the kind of game I come back to play again from time to time. Unfortunately, I can't rate the multiplayer experience because I'm pretty bad at multiplayer :P. The classic real time strategy franchise with incredibly well balanced factions, frenetic action. This is a game that can be played for years, like chess. It has redefined the genre and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Regarding the creative direction, it's a fine-tune sci-fi world, charming and brutal: beautiful aesthetics, charismatic units (something that's often lacking in the RTA genre), great soundtrack. The player is transported into the future, whether you pick the Terrans, the Zergs or the Protoss.. In my opinion, the best RTS game so far. Great multiplayer with unlimited replayabilty, great campaign and co-op scenarios. Top notch controls, good pathfinding and the best AI on the RTS market.. A great game, no doubt about it. Classic RTS's golden boy no1. Enjoyable campaign and great multiplayer. It's quite hard to get in to at the beginning though, and in my opinion the base building is too APM demanding.. It surpasses Starcraft which is not easy to do. The single player is very interactive and top notch with brilliant humor added in. The multiplayer is incredible and intellectual. It is a game you can get years of fun play out of and one of the best strategy games all time with Rome total war.. I've never played the first StarCraft and judging by how the game was reviewed by some, it seems that's advantageous, because everything was fresh for me. I can definitely see why some people would be less than impressed with the gameplay. I haven't played a ton of MP, but it seems most of your attention is spent on building and teching properly. You're essentially just trying to amass a blob quicker than your enemy so you can wipe them out in one sweep, with rushing being the sort of tactic that either wins or loses you the game. There's virtually no grand scale strategizing and the unit's overall low time to kill makes micro managing counterproductive unless done incredibly quickly. I've mainly just been playing the co-op modes and campaign, especially since most of the community at this point is god-tier. For being an 8 year old game at the time of writing, I'm actually really impressed with how much quality and content this game has. The graphics have held up well, though the units are all quite small, meaning you can't really see much in the way of detail anyways. The cut scenes are plentiful and are very high grade ascetically, giving them a distinct movie quality. These days devs, (due to cost cutting publisher execs), generally try to avoid cut scenes altogether. So getting really crisp, sci-fi cinema is a real treat. I understand that the campaign won't be for everyone, (especially if you find the SC gameplay boring), but they've done an objectively stellar job on fleshing out the campaign with quality content. As you'd expect, the story is built around the gameplay, meaning it's relatively generic and filled to the brim with tropes and cliches. (I found the main character's romanticized alcoholism pretty cringey, but again it's another trope). You'll notice the universe has a western vibe very similar to Firefly and sci-fi elements that parallel closely to Warhammer 40k, but I personally don't have an issue with this since SC undoubtedly maintains it's own creative spin. Characters, though fairly generic overall, are likable and fit well with the plot. What I really liked is how in between missions you can talk with the various characters you're working with, potentially giving you a more personal connection with them. Despite their noticeable lack of depth, I couldn't help enjoying them anyways because of how they're depicted with having flaws alongside their grit and comradry. I thought this conversation feature to be a really nice touch given how RTS's often cheap out on fleshing out their campaigns. If you find the gameplay enjoyable, then you'll notice how well done the missions are. Each map is distinguishable, being set in a wide range of worldly environments. Though the primary formula is usually to build a base and defeat X, each mission involves it's own set of narrative objectives that have their own twists to accomplish, with optional side objectives to complete if you want to keep things interesting. Some missions involve controlling heroes with special abilities and though I found these missions to be fairly easy, they were fun and memorable. While the plot certainly accommodates for the creative gameplay designs in ways that are extremely unrealistic, even for a sci-fi setting, the two still synergize really well. Overall, I was amazed with how effectively the devs were able to come up with different spins that make each mission it's own. Lastly, there's a lot of substance put into differentiating the three races. The terran have a combination of components seen in a plethora of other sci-fi universes, such as mechanical armor, mechanized walkers and troop drop pods. Their build elements mirror that seen in other RTS games. The protos, an alien race, remind me a lot of Halo's covenant or 40k's eldar, with their advanced technology, shielding and arrogant demeanor. Their units and build functions are in some cases considerably different from the terrans. The zerg though just blow me away. They're very similar to 40k's tyranids in their overall design, but the craftsmanship put into them is incredible. Each unit is distinct, and appropriately disgusting to look at with their insectoid appearances. A lot of their units have very unique functions and the way their build system works is not only inventive, but perfectly fitting for the bio-technological theme they have. I couldn't get over how much I enjoyed playing the zerg campaign, (additionally priced DLC), and how much their play style aligns with the game's horde focused functionality. The additional DLC campaigns feature the same content excellence and polish seen in the first. I bought them all at half price and they're all well worth it. If you didn't like the terran campaign, then you won't like them either, as it's really the exact same formula with new characters, a continuation of the plot and more of the ingenious level designs. Overall, SC2 is filled with grade A content and holds up well even today.. The same way blizzard messed up diablo 3, and world of warcraft, they messed up starcraft 2. They take a great franchise and change it so it doesnt resemble the former games and most of the similarity comes only from name. It is sad to see blizzard trash such great concepts with their SAME artwork styles carrying over from WORLD OF WARCRAFT, into different games entirely. Blizzard, wtf stop dropping the ball... Hire some new artists or rehire the artists you had for diablo 1-2, and starcraft 1. Stop using the same artwork styles from world of warcraft and putting them into entirely different games.... This isnt even the biggest pet peeve here. The story, the gameplay, the balancing, everything about the games lacks creativity, its like blizzard thought they could ride the glory of the former blizzard north and hope the fans would eat it all up. No thanks. There is a reason blizzard is HAVING to go to free to play and its not because of good product.. So here's the thing. I've played this game the first time when it was launched. I've never finished the campaign then (something came up and I had to stop at about 70%) but I've played quite a lot multiplayer and skirmishes. I've also picked up the game again not so long ago and I've played it in co-op, single player, versus AI and multiplayer. It's not that great anymore. I used to love it but after playing about a dozen co-op games, I've realized that it is exactly the same thing again and again and again. The same build order, the same strategy, the same moves. It is like chess without the mental stimulation. Once you find a strategy that works, you keep repeating it and that's about it. The entire idea of multi-player or co-op (especially co op) comes down to mastering three or four build orders and then massing your troops against your enemy. The single player is not that great either. At the time it was launched, it was great. There was nothing like that. A single player with units you can upgrade, multi-path missions, a story-line (even if it wasn't that great) and a feeling of grandness was something impressive in 2010. But in 2017, it feels extremely generic, downright boring and a waste of time. I've finished the game eventually. I am sure it is a great e-sport game but I am the kind of person that prefers single player. So from a single player perspective, once the novelty wears off, it is not that a brilliant game.. The campaign is fun, I always loved the story aspect of this universe. But the only reason why I play this game is because of a friend otherwise the multiplayer is too hard to be enjoyable.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. After a long wait starcraft 2 has finally arrived. The campaign is very satisfying with the unlock of new units making multiple playt hroughs very fun. I was very satisfied with the ending of this game. The multiplayer is also very fun. The game is not good enough to overcome the bad feeling of renting something that I should own. Blizzard even intellectually insult me by telling me I own it after I registered their game code that locks StarCraft to me.. People who criticize Starcraft 2 probably lack the ability to play it. The learning curve is huge. The ingenious way in which the metagame was developed by players and developers is amazing. Balancing has always been an issue but they put work into it. In the end, someone will always complain about this and that. The story was amazing, although somethings could have been better developed. Overall, a must have game.. Such a huge downgrade from brood war. Yes the graphics are better but the gameplay is terrible and encourages ""cheese."" Terran always drops because of medi vacs. Marines run around the map ""kiting"" and shooting things as they run. Last I checked running around decreases accuracy and gets you killed in the back. The tank o vac is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw. All you do is spend the game trying to keep drops out of your mineral line and there is little time for big battles. Where are the goons? Really?. Never played the multiplayer, im not that skilled. But i simply loved the story of it and all expansions. Very good story telling, and the campaign is great too.. I was a Starcraft/Broodwar fan, back in the day. I own almost all Blizzard games, except WoW. I was excited so much for this, but it was a let down. Blizzard played it safe. They just took the Warcraft III engine, upgraded it, and made a Broodwar remake with minor alterations. Don't get me wrong, Broodwar was great, so a remake of it would be great anyway. And we were witnessing the beginning of the great RTS draught we are currently experiencing, back when it was released. But i expected much more. This game is archaic by modern standards. It has the usual Blizzard polish. Great art, not the most advanced engine though. Great cutscenes and cinematics. The story is somewhat corny but enjoyable, the campaign is enjoyable but won't make you think much. But ultimately, it was a game we had already played before. And the RTS genre had seen many advances that Blizzard chose to disregard to return to the 90s. All in all, this game was overrated. Worth a playthrough for nostalgia's sake, just for the story. Don't bother with the multiplayer unless you are a Korean.. People who think this is a good strategy game are those who have never played strategy games. There is no climax to matches, your are 100% completely upgraded by around 10 mins of gameplay. There is no battle between upgrading and speed it has very short and numb games. A good strategy game is something like supreme commander even though it's old it is far superior to this. If anything download the free try version and nothing else, it's worth nothing but not 20$.. Original Starcraft is legendary and to this day one of the best RTS games of all time, combining 3 completely different, yet perfectly balanced races. SC2 is a nice revival of this classic for younger generations, in case of Wings of Liberty with very nice terran story campaign. Every single mission is fun and with different flavour, intermissions on Hyperion, research, interacting with other crew members etc. is a cool addition. I'm looking forward to other chapters and I hope they will keep or even improve on this quality. The only complaint is separation into 3 parts, forcing you to buy main game and 2 DLCs, there were times in history when this wasn't needed, SC1 had all 3 campaigns from the start, so it's just a sad observation of where the gaming industry went. 8/10. My list descending in personal priority concerning negative and positive aspects: Negative: 1. User-hostile policies, the company definitely poses the customer under its own profit 2. The game itself feels a bit too stale and lifeless, units are mostly just a plain tool to work with 3. After a while the game feels quite repetitive and not very rewarding at all Positive: 1. The user interface and handling of the game in general is outstanding and it performs very well 2. The main game is really well balanced 3. A lot of possible settings make the gaming-experience very customizable I give 7 out of 10 because I think that this game is a solid one which offers a lot of challenge and interesting matches, but it just lacks color and soul and playing it feels more like doing maths than playing a video game. The custom games are fine, but the playerbase is still quite small there. If this review was helpful to you, please let me know!. An incredibly exciting and deep combat system, fantastic competitive multiplayer along with single player campaign and bang for you buck make this the greatest RTS game of all time.. StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty is the perfect sequel to a legendary RTS game. The mechanics for the most part remain unchanged with the addition of several new units, abilities, amazing story and visuals all on top of a very smooth experience. No bugs that I could find, excellent matchmaking choices with very diverse multiplayer options for all sorts of gamers. Wings of Liberty is an ultimate addition to anyone's PC gaming collection.. This is crap do not buy this stupid game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Multiplayer **** ****. If blizzard is good at anything, it surely is RTS. They used the old formular and applied it on another flagship-brands of their company. The outcome is a great competetive game, interesting campaign and vast loads of user created funmaps. They took what was good in SC, added some more good stuff, and pressed it into SC2. Hell, it about time!. The proof that RTS games can still be good nowadays. It's not as good as Starcraft : broodwar, gameplay-wise or story-wise but it's definetely really cool visually, very entertaining and it's a lot of fun to learn to master all 3 races, also the multiplayer is extremely competitive.. Impressive. Gameplay is fast and fun ..Blizzard manage to cut out some of the boring time consuming task in old rts game # stunning animated sequences # good story # choise driven plot. It's really a good work.. The best Real Time Strategy game returned with an overall improvement and brought the RTS genre on a whole other level. Since the Starcraft universe is so complex, Blizzard Entertainment decided to split its successor into 3 games to unfold even more background story. The first game of the trilogy features the Terrans, who are a humanlike species. Furthermore players will follow Captain James Raynor and his crew through a rebellion against the Terran Dominion. The Storytelling is outstanding in this one since it is told interactively. The story of the game is just breathtaking, from the beginning until the end of the game since it engages the player to interactively explore the background story. Everything in this game is top-notch, for example the character design makes every character very approaching, lively and reasonable and at the same time the music is outstandingly spirited. It feels incredibly smooth playing this game compared to its predecessor and even more fun with playing the story campaign. Every single mission is well-thought-out, considering that in over 20 missions it never feels the same nor it ever gets boring. All in all there is nearly nothing to complain about this game except the graphics. Nevertheless every gamer should at least try playing this one.. this game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRRthis game is so returded MINECR%AFT IS BETTAER RRRRRRRR. The best campaign i had ever played in a strategy game. I never seen such an interactive single player, gives you the feeling that you are playing Mass Effect or something lol. The story isnt ground breaking but its definitely good enough for what it is, and all of the cool stuff, the unique missions and everything else makes up for it big time.. I was bought this for my twenty seventh birthday by my friends and initially I thought the mechanics were weak - throw down some 'rax and hold 'a'... follow this up with an all in at 5 or 6... This tactic was applied by and against us successfully until we became able to defend and give a proper account.. Great graphics and beautiful cutscenes, great gameplay, great campaign missions and great and enjoyable continuation to the story from the first one. It's really a great game.. Best real time strategy I ever played. I still play it on a regular basis, it's fun, it's amazing, it's fluid, there are always thousands of players online in multiplayer. Of course I gave it 10!. A 10/10 Starcraft in 3D with more options and modding possibilities, its only problem is its lack of LAN mode... the mode that I enjoyed more and they can say that is the same because today all people has internet, well is NOT, but even being the same is unacceptable a game with less features than its predecessor. So yes, is the best SC, but with the half of the fun to me and my friends, so it has the half note too.","the basic premise still holds up for the gameplay and the story excellently starts where the expansion for the original ended . while starcraft 2 is still good gameplay-wise and character-wise, the story is much worse ."
102.SSX (2000),"When you look at this game and what was out already for snowboarding titles it was a pretty big change. While the style would come more with Tricky this has the grit and elevated the genre to a level only Tricky could surpass. Between the amount of characters and courses as well as the stats and outfits for each there was quite a lot you could do in this game. While other launch title X-Games Snowboarding had way more customization this had the arcade feel down perfect.Pulling off tricks was easy and the stages felt fast and the amount of secret paths were surprisingly high. The music is great and I enjoyed most of the stages except for that one that felt like a pinball map, seriously the bumpers ****. This game also feels really dark graphically and I wonder if that was intended or not. Is it worth playing instead of Tricky? Not really, but there are fun things if you want more games similar to Tricky.. Another game that since its introduction to me at a very young age i have loved. Always wishing for a new title. One of the few games that needed to change very little from the original recipe to improve. Superb.. One of my first PS2 games I had, not an easy game but hours of fun. Graphics were good for its time and loved the banter between the snowboarders.. Took snowboarding games like 1080 and added a little crack to it to create this crazy game.. This was a quality game when it first released. Used to play this with friends back in the day. If you own a PS2 and you like snow boarding then this is a no brainer.. This game has long entertained me for hours long after the original ""Phat"" PS2 I got it with has long died. A pinnacle game in my childhood... I can't say anything more about how great this game is.. I never thought in a million years that my most played PS2 title would be a snowboarding game, but to my surprise it pretty much was. SSX was truly a good game, the unrealistic aspect of it made the experience even more fun and to this day this is one of the better PS2 titles. The best part of the game was learning and performing new tricks, tied in with some sweet maps. Even though I didn't own any of the predecessors, I've seen Tricky and SSX 3 and they are both worthy of the name and add some meaningful content.. Good visuals and fast paced gameplay. A few major problems. Holding down will make you go faster but if you are holding it and you get the tiniest bit of air you try to flip and fall, which can ruin things easily. While their are many varied tricks, some of the mechanics really ****. Sometimes flipping is really easy and you can do two and other times you will hold it and your guy will barely move. Unless you want to lose a race, don't try one of the major point-scorers because you never know if it will work or not. Finally there is the circuit. They make you race the same map 3 times and even with all the problems and the fact that all the riders are faster than you, even if you are speed and they are tricky, you are supposed to get top 3 every time. This would be fair if they let you restart the race that you had progressed to. But to make the game artificially longer they want you to race the level 3 MORE TIMES. I was already sick of the level after 3 times, but having to do 3 more and who knows how many if I make one mistake, was too much for me. Game like this that aren't long and don't have many maps try to make up for it by making the game seem longer since you have to repeat every course 10 times. Sloppy developing.. Amazing game, if you still own a PS2 and want a cheap fun ride, pick this one up! You will love snowboarding and make you wish you lived in a place that had snow and mountains!","SSX was truly a good game, the unrealistic aspect of it made the experience even more fun . i never thought in a million years that my most played PS2 title would be a snowboarding game . graphics were good for its time and loved the banter between the snowboarders ."
103.Street Fighter IV,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not A fan of Street fighter but street fighter 6 is one of the greatest game .. Certificate of Masterpiece. Great game, it was from this game that the Street Fighter franchise started making realistic games, there was a huge graphical improvement on the previous Street Fighter, the gameplay is great, the game is incredible, there are several characters to play with, the arcade mode is very cool, this game is a work of art.. I was so excited playing on my Xbox Series S but out of nowhere the game started to freeze my console and shut down by itself. Microsoft URGENTLY needs to review these situations, there are several comments on Xbox saying the bugs in this game. What a poorly done backwards compatibility, eh?. I'm not big on fighting games, but even for a novice player such as myself, there's a lot of fun to be had. its an ok game lots of challenges to fulfill plenty time to master but it is an ok game overall. My favorite pure fighter, struck a nice balance for newcomers and the die-hards.. Street Fighter IV visually makes an amazing jump from 2D to 3D models and in general it accomplishes what a Street Fighter game should accomplish. However, ultimately the game fails to innovate and change the Street Fighter formula . In all honestly, this review doesn't have much bad to say about the game but the repetitiveness of the title makes it feel as if the new graphical style is the only addition to the game. Cons Same game as always but different graphics. nearly everything about Street Fighter 4 is perfect, the combat is fun and smooth, the story mode provides insight into the characters, with endings that make sense.(looking at you, MvC3) my only problem is that some characters are ridiculously overpowered, like Zangief and Dhalsim, they both have overpowered unblockable and undodgable combos. apart from that, SF4 should be in any fighting game fans collection ASAP.. People who hate on this game are clearly impatient. This was the first fighting game I ever played and after many hours practice, I finally saw why it's a good game. At first, it seems terrible but after you do all the trials in challenge mode it becomes easier. It's not for casual gamers (at least SUPER SFIV isn't) but there's lots of content in challenge mode and while you can run through everything in the single player by just spamming Lariat with Zangief, the strategy and execution required for online play will make you keep wanting more if you can get into the game and see the skill in it.. I am a huge fan of the fighting games playing them since the original Mortal Kombat days. I have played alot of different fighting game series over the years the Tekken Series, The Mortal Kombat series, The Soul Calibur and Street Fighter series. I just loved Street fighter 2 to death I can't explain the amount of hours I spent on that game and how much fun i had with my cousins when playing SF II with them. And than comes Street Fighter 3 one of the most disappointing games ever, the game is just seemed broken and the fighting did not seem polished at all and it surprisingly did not work well in 3D enviroments. And nows comes Street Fighter IV to be honest I was no looking forward to this after the awful flop that was Street Fighter 3, after seeing the reviews this game got I felt like this game would redeem the franchise and finally give fighting game fans a great fighting game after most of the fighting games this gen Soul Calibur 4, MK vs DC and Tekken 6 turned out to be underwhelming games that did not live up to their potential. But when I played this game expecting to relive the amazing time I had with Street Fighter 2 I was just let down. First of all the A.I in the game is just cheap and messed up. Capcom also changed its controls and combos so the veteran players would have to learn and master all over again to be honest that would not have been a problem for me if the A.I actually gave you a chance you see if you are veteran player and you want to completely master a game you should start out on the lowest difficulty in a game and that exactly what i did when I first played this game and what happened? Well even on the lowest difficulty the A.I is cheap as hell doing the same unblockable and unavoidable moves over and over again and even exploiting the new meter system, this kind of stuff should not happen at the easiest difficulty otherwise how in the world are you going to learn the combos and execute them. The Meter System would have been a great addition if the game actually did a good job of explaining how it actually works for the players. Sure the game has the combos listed in its menu but they are really hard to bloody understand and even when you get to understand them executing is a bigger pain because the controls are just slow in responding. In a game like this which is hard as hell and takes a while to master the unresponsive controls just make it alot harder to execute combos and special moves making the fights harder and annoying plus the awful directional pad on the 360 just makes all this more painful. Plus the game has a lack of modes where are team battle, 2 on 2 fights, Mission or Challenge mode and an actual story mode none of that is in the game plus the roster is very thin and here I was thinking they would expand the roster by a large number, there are only 4 new characters in total thats it. As far as the online Multiplayer goes it is much better than the offline mode because atleast the players online don't have the tendency to do one cheap move after another and kicking your a** as much A.I does in the arcade mode thaty is simply because it is hard and time consuming to learn combos and special moves and executing them. The graphics even though if cartoonish look great, the environments in fight areas look fantastic even for 2D and characters models during the gameplay also look great and I would also say that the voice acting for all the characters has been done really well. But the anime cutscenes just look terrible and I mean terrible it looks like i am watching a cartoon show on cartoon network only alot worse. All those scenes look tedious and corny and lip syching is also a problem during the scene couldn't they have just made the characters look like they do during the gameplay because that would have been so much better. I must admit however the game does have a alot of extras but will you really be willing to spend all the time it takes to unlock the extras in the game because of how problematic it is learn and than execute combos against the cheap A.I in the arcade **** is so obvious CAPCOM did not go all out on this game because they wanted to release a Super SFIV with more content so that they can hog more money from their fans this move has just proven that CAPCOM cares more about money than giving fans what they really want. As a huge Street Fighter 2 fan I really wanted to like this game and have fun with it but all these problems just ruined the game for me and it is just sad for an incomplete and to an extent problematic fighting game like this can get 93/100 metascore. 6/10. Okay Capcom, you showed up with your sleepy franchise to give it a comeback. I'm glad that you made this at last and trnasformed the awesome series to a monster ****. Beutiful graphics, solid gameplay ( ultimately slow though) and nice features makes the best entrie in the series. Even with those great feautres get the Super Street Fighter or the new Arcade one that came out, overall Capcom slipped the hand on making to much Street Fighter in less than 4 years probably , so get the most updated version.. This is very impressive for a Street Fighter game.Never really liked the franchise but this version is very good. Are there Mortal Kombat vs Street Fighter fans still around after all these years?Well,Mortal Kombat is much better.Good effort though SF.. Very one dimensional. It's gets old fast and Capcom likes to milks it's customers by selling brand new games that included content that could have just been DLC.. im not a big fighting game fan to begin with so and fighting game that has me playing it longer then a day or 2 is pretty good in my book. i have played most of the SF games and liked alot of them . i think 2d style fighting games for some reason will always be more fun then the 3d ones. the games looks beutiful . controls both on the 360 and ps3 arnt very tight mainly because some of the moves are so close together controlwise that you will be doing the wrong move alot with some charicters i had ALOT of problesm with Ryu . also not really alot of charicters when you look at some of the other SF games. it also has a UBBER cheap boss even on very easy he just spams the same move over and over using ryus flying upper cut attack over and over and over and over again. i also wish they added more special moves to this game . i also felt the supper attacks didnt look as flashy as say in marvel vs capcom 1 or 2. still though this game is fun and online will provide you with alot of fun and bring you back to the early 90s of playing people in the arcade .. This game is terrible. I was bitterely dissapointed with it. All the good moves are really hard to do, which means your left with boring punches and kicks. If you want a fighting game, i reccomend Soul Calibur IV.","i'm not big on fighting games, but even for a novice player such as myself, there's a lot of fun to be had . the repetitiveness of the title makes it feel as if the new graphical style is the only addition to the game . i'm not a fan of street fighter but street fighter 6 is one of the greatest game ."
104.Minecraft,"Bro... this is literally one of the best video games ever made. It is literally inescapable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even though this game has been around for about 14 years, it's updates keep it fresh and it might be one of the best games of all time.. What a stupid **** block game. The game is so horrible, after playing only 2 minutes I killed my whole family irl, and you, yes you are next.. minecraft is nothing but a hollow template, an idea **** rather than an actual game, but of course as soulless as it was even from the beginning (the game was **** finished in 2011 btw and still an empty grinding simulator with a meaningless dragon fight, with a poem that notch didn't even write, not even about minecraft), it's still is a sandbox so it got off on the fact that you can make the game your own; SO WITH THAT FACT: Why then is the game not tailored around the player's or at least the COMMUNITY'S idea for the game?(mojang will never add anything the community actually wants, they will simply appease the players with A SINGLE **** MOB PER YEAR [Mob vote]) The game is known mainly for two things: Being a 3D Lego game (Block game), and 'X in minecraft' -- the idea that minecraft is something, that in truth is only meant to simulate things from real life and other media rather than its own ideas.(AND DON'T **** TELL ""aLl ArT iS sToLen"", THE ENDERMAN IS JUST PLAGIARIZED SLENDERMAN) Therefore, in truth minecraft is just a **** trash can for people to dump meaningless ideas into youtube videos or little escapism severs and worlds where people builds ****, pixel art, AND BUILDINGS TAKEN FROM **** REAL LIFE. But just as The World grows bigger and bigger, so will the hole not only in ourselves, but the ways in which we waste our time waiting for The World, and ourselves, to die. SO JUST LIKE AN ADDICTION, ENJOY NOTHING BUT WASTING YOUR TIME, BECAUSE THAT'S ALL MINECRAFT IS, AND EVER WAS; A WASTE OF TIME, ASK GODDAMN **** NOTCH.. movement nerf they nerfed parkour now it **** i cannot play parkour anymore. This is the most replayable game I have ever played. It has something for everyone and you can add endless mods to match you're exact requirements. It also has insane multiplayer capabilities. My only problem with the game is how it separates its two versions, Java and Bedrock. Bedrock feels so limited and doesn't have any of the major gameplay mechanics that make the game worse in my eyes. The creators are trying to fix this issue though.. I have 3000 houres playtime in this game and its so good beacuse it never gets boring whatever u like there is something in this game intresting for you. if it is building creativity or competitive pvp against others there is everything and you have unlimited options YOU CAN ALSO customize EVERYTHING like mods or your gameplay in general so for me its a game you can make more games from its a Keystone to gaming history.. Has to be my favorite game of all time. When I was a kid I would get home and hop straight onto minecraft. Best game ever. I still play it to this day and If i ever get bored I either hop on a sever or download mods. Amazing game!. Minecraft gets a 10 for java edition and like an 8.5 for bedrock so I'm just gonna put the higher of the 2 as the rating.. The game is very enjoyable, and the best feature is the sandbox mode. However, over time, you might get bored of playing it.. Actually, I love this game but when we get the market place update,Everyone stopped releasing good addons in addon sites. Now you have to buy those.. This is a top 10 sandbox indeed! so many things to do in the game and to build. This should earn a medal! 9.5/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game in vanilla and even better with mods. It provides a nice foundation before modding as well. General Nosalgia and Beautiful Game Design.. Amazing game new content every few **** huge amount of mods make it so you can have basically a new game whenever you want. Many Serves with all kinds of themes and modpacks and best of all you can playit on basically anything.. You don't have to say anything of minecraft, everybody know it. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but I love this game, who hates this game?. Not really a fan of the game. But a game that conquered the gaming industry for such a long period of time simply cannot be bad!. This game changed my life it is great but java edition is better to mod then bedrock but bedrock is a little bugged. I have spent thousands of hours over the past twelve years playing this game and I have no regrets.. S tier for the game itself, A tier on Nintendo Switch, S tier on PS4 and 5, and F tier when it lags and transferring worlds.. One of the best games ever released. Your creativity that you can express in this game is unlimited which is the best part about it.. 10 for the game, which I spent on nearly the whole first 5 years of my gamer life, and 0 for updates made after 1.16. Well it's one of my favourite game from my childhood and because of this I can't be objective while I'm giving point it.. Minecraft offers an infinite possibilities of things to do, and an ever-growing amount of content. Some additions are questionable, and the acquisition from Microsoft has unfortunately introduced some widely hated features (I'm speaking to you, chat reporting), but overall some good additions. April Fools updates are well crafted and fun to play. The game gets even more interesting when you install mods, which is made easy by the developers, and large modding community.. Very Good game. You can make whatever you want and you can survive the night, which is very good for me, but not perfect as some stuff i want to build take too long.. Minecraft is a great sandbox game with many worlds to explore, games to play, challenges you can impose on yourself, but I don't care about that. Check the name. Ice climbing is the only thing I need, and there are two ways to climb ice in this game. Naturally, or custom. If you want a randomly generated ice climb, play survival mode and look for a nice icy mountain to build up or a glacier biome. If you want a custom experience, play on creative mode and build your own mountains like you've always wanted. But there is one more thing I want to talk about. This a great game, and you can even climb ice, but the creator has recently said some anti-lgbt things. I don't really understand that (although I don't understand straight relationships either, I only really understand climbing ice, but I guess I haven't met the right girl) and I found it distracting during my climbing. But that isn't the point at all. I also like the music (mostly just pig step) but it's unfortunate I can't carry the note block up the mountain while I climb. I love the Ender Dragon fight, as it requires climbing, like all good games should. Anyway, it's a great game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Minecraft is a multi platform video game that incorporates fantasy aspects to a 3-D world made up of cubes. When I first started playing Minecraft, I was only a young child. The game contained aspects that allowed my creativity to flourish making this game easily become one of my favorites. You can play the game in creative or survival or even on PC with hard-core mode. Creative is always my favorite because it allows you to build some of the coolest things imaginable. Everyone plays differently, but I found that I prefer to just mess around. There is a way to win, but I’ve never really had much interest in winning the game. This little essay will cover some of the more basic points of Minecraft like the types of survival players as well as a little tidbit at the end about the new updates announced by Minecraft Live 2024. The game was first released as “Cave Game” back in 2009 and recently experienced its 15th anniversary in May of this year. The full version of the game was released in 2011 dubbed Minecraft. The game was created by a developer named Markus Persson also known as “Notch”. Notch left the company Mojang (the company that published Minecraft) shortly after its first full release. Leaving the future of the game in Mojang’s control. Since its release, Minecraft has had updates nearly every year with the most recent being the trial update with many more plans in the future. Mojang has been announcing these updates with an event called Minecraft Live. Initially called Minecon from 2011 to 2019 and held in person till 2016, Minecraft live is a live stream where Mojang announces its plans for the game for the coming year.Minecraft is one of the most accessible video games that I can think of in terms of today’s online games. Being multi-platform the game is available on PC, mobile, and console with 2 types; Java for PC and Bedrock for the rest. Some believe there is a bit of a bias toward the Java version because there is a lot more stuff available with mods and shaders as well as being the original version. Bedrock can also have custom mods but it can be more expensive. People also tend to think that Bedrock is easier than Java due to different controls as well as different coding in general. All in all Java definitely has more of the hardcore players while Bedrock being available on more devices is more popular among casual gamers (not saying there aren’t hardcore gamers on Bedrock). While Minecraft is initially a single player game, servers can be opened up to allow you to play with friends leading to the ever popular content genre of SMPs. Minecraft content creators have been around since the creation of the game but with servers these creators can play together to make content. There are private servers with a whitelist allowing who comes in like the Lifesteal SMP and there are also public servers that anyone can play on like Hypixel. Overall these servers have allowed different types of players to interact and i've noticed 3 main kinds of survival players; the PVPer who is really good at killing mobs and other players, the builder who can build the most majestic bases/statues ever, lastly the collector the person who somehow has everything the game has to offer. It's really cool to see these different types of players together in one world. Obviously no one is completely one or the other and there are probably several players who are a mix. This was just an observation I have made over the years of watching SMPs online.I’d recommend Minecraft to pretty much anyone who was interested because there are so many ways to play. Obviously modes like survival or hardcore might not be getting my highest recommendation for younger audiences mainly due to the fact that the mobs can be scary, but modes like creative make it so the mobs have no interest in you and it helps foster one's creativity. Overall Minecraft is a game for everyone from hardcore gamers to people just wanting an open world to build some crazy cool bases. Now onto what has been happening today with Minecraft. Minecraft Live 2024 was live today and released some interesting future updates for Vanilla Minecraft such as Hardcore mode and Bundles coming to the Bedrock version (Yay for Bedrock gamers). A new Biome was also announced…the Pale Garden… and its super creepy new mob The Creeking…. But we do get some new wood, it will be nice to work with a more neutral palette as well as the moss and hanging vines. I'm super excited for the snapshots to come out so I can test things out. Also RIP the Mob vote, your ability to split the community will be missed.. Minecraft is just an amazing game. I found really late to this game, but I still loved every minute of it. Redstone is amazing if you are a programmer. The exploring part will easily give you at least 100 hours of enjoyment if you are new to the game. Of course, as a veteran you will get faster, stuff will get easier, but it’s fair to rate your first 100 hours with a game and those were absolutely amazing. Among every version of Minecraft, the PC version is the best. With a world limit of 30,000,000 x 30,000,000 blocks, there is an endless amount of enjoyment to be had. This version is the most consistent to get new updates, and lets you select the version of the game you want to play, a curtesy most versions don't have. You also get to choose which instalment you want on PC, between Bedrock and Java edition, each having different qualities and differences, alongside selectable servers and features. And Minecraft is already arguably the greatest game ever made, with amazing music, gameplay, hidden lore to look for, rewards exploration, and has an endless amount of things to do. A must-play for any gamer!. There are few games I've played multiple times through different stages of my life. And even fewer that I can see myself playing inevitably. Minecraft's colorful charm and unique sandbox is one that ill cherish forever. The only thing stopping this becoming a 10 is game-led content.. I think it is a very good game, it has many possibilities and has improved a lot over time. It is very fun to play with friends, although I feel that the vanilla version without mods and alone burns out a little quickly and that updates are not its strong point from there. On the outside it seems like a very fun and versatile title to me.. Minecraft is such a legendary,good and fun game that i have always enjoyed playing. 10/10!. As much as i love the game, it's been a game I've been playing since 2016, recent updates aren't very outstanding, aside from the 1.21, there hasn't been much added to the game, we have been waiting for a end update for half a decade now, when are we getting what we deserve? Negativity aside, with infinite possibilities, this can occupy you for a while, Multiplayer servers, Mods, the only limits is your imagination, and whatever Microsoft doesn't want you to do, seriously, that ban on guns is a joke, it's a game where you can burn down villages.. It would be hypocritical of me not to give this game a 10. You can do anything in this game ! The tools given to the player are almost infinite. And if you add mods, the game becomes exceptional. I'd recommend the horror mods, so you don't go mining in peace. Minecraft may not be the best video game I've ever played, but I agree that it deserves a place in the debate about the greatest game of all time.. The amount of time I've spent in this is just too much to know the exact number. It is also the game that caused me to get addicted to multiplayer games, so it might be its biggest con for me.. What other users said really stuck with me. Minecraft is a game for the ages. I plan on entertaining my future children with this game. It is a dojo for creativity, problem solving, relaxation, and exploration. Although the development and upkeep of the game has been less than amazing recently, it is an amazing game for the ages.. An undying classic with unlimited amounts of content for any sort of creative endeavor. Singleplayer can be made highly interesting with the massive amounts of mods there are and multiplayer has been pushed forward with all sorts of minigames and even fully functional RPGs. It is amazing that a game as simple as Minecraft can have such a massive range of audiences from competitive players to casual adventurers and builders. True sandbox masterclass.. Masterpiece, in 10 years this game will still be played .. Minecraft is one of the best games yet, it's boring sometimes but always will be fun to play and explore, especially with friends!. Although minecraft has soured a little in my mind recently, it is still one of the greatest sandbox games ever made and I have always loved it. The sad thing about it is that with the coming of Microsoft I don't see the same love for the game that the devs had in the past, although I think they are trying to take a step in the right direction. Hopefully, I can enjoy this game as much as I used to as a kid in the future.. Minecraft is a game that I have basically grown up with, but as I grow up with it, the worse the game gets. At its core, Minecraft is a brilliant experience. It's a game that you can think of in 2 parts: one part where you're progressing through the game, and one part where you're creating whatever you want, bounded by nothing but your imagination. However, as the game went on, Mojang/Microsoft made a lot of updates that diminished the effect of both of those parts. They've added quite a lot of features where you're pretty much not incentivized to interact with them, and they've made the game's main campaign a lot easier by making rare ores common, making villager trades absolutely busted, and making strong tools even stronger than they've already been. Sure, they've added more mobs and stuff, but again, you are hardly encouraged by the game to seek them out because you don't really need to. The creative element gets diminished as well since part of Minecraft's genius was that you can make a lot from what they've originally gave you, but now the entire system feels undeniably bloated. There are plenty of blocks and items that serve similar functions to others and look like others. Or they've got features that nobody ever needs to use. This flood of options leaves little room for people to actually think more creatively. Sure, it's nice to have things that liven up the game, and it's important to have those things, but if the game at its core doesn't increase in scope, then the entire experience feels more shallow by the minute.. It was awesome awesome. I played for over 3000 hours, and have something to say. It is a nice sandbox, but don't play on servers like jartex network or hypixel. You won't have fun playing on servers. Play survival or creative modes alone or with friends. Play with mods, but not get bored.. Minecraft isn't just a game; it's an entire universe waiting for you to explore and shape it to your heart's content. In Minecraft, you're not just playing through someone else's story; you're crafting your own epic tale as you go. It's all about freedom and creativity, letting you build, explore, and survive in a world that's uniquely yours. Whether you're mining for resources, building towering structures, or battling against the creepiest of creatures, it's all up to you. And that's what makes it so special. Minecraft invited millions of players to join in on the journey long before it was even finished. It's a game that's been shaped by its community every step of the way, embracing the power of procedural generation and emergent gameplay to keep things fresh and exciting. This game spits in the face of conventional gaming norms, blazing its own trail and raking in millions of dollars while doing it. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of gaming, offering an experience that's accessible to anyone, regardless of skill level or imagination. At its core, Minecraft is a towering achievement that manages to captivate players without ever losing its indie charm. So if you haven't already, do yourself a favour and dive into this virtual sandbox. Trust me, it's worth it.. Does I Really Gotta Say Something? The Game Is Perfect, The community is perfect, but fck the devs. Updates is very small. Content in game after 12 years playing, now is boring. But this game create my childhood and nostalgia. Games only fun with friends other than pretty boring *insert entire essay that nobody would read*. this game is one of the best games of all time, i highly recommend for new players!. not gonna lie bedrock version **** but no one can say minecraft is a bad game for sure. The most importantly and popular game ever made. Truly something for everyone. There isn’t a soul alive who likes video game who won’t like an aspect of Minecraft. Endless fun, endless creativity, endless freedom. Possibly the greatest game ever made.. I logged into the Minecraft site the past day, to see if there was any hope that maybe a glitch happened at some point, and that it recognized I had a copy of the game. Nope. During the what I think is the second forced account migration in this game's life, MS didn't credit the new account has having a copy of the game. And I was frustrated as it was with this game just never really working out for me. I don't like the combat, and just couldn't find a mod set that clicked with me either. But add in MS basically stealing the game away from me during the account transfer, and now expecting like $30 for a new copy, no, just not happening.. Minecraft is the greatest game ever created. No question about it. I have Bedrock Edition on PC from 2 accounts, and Java Edition on Pc from 1. I've even played in on PlayStation and have it on Xbox Series X. The amount of creativity and limitless possibilites is pretty much addictive. I have a total of around 1500 hours on it across all platforms and accounts. If you get bored of the normal Survival Mode, quit, play some Creative, or some Hardcore. If you get bored of all that, hop on any server. Nearly 500,000 MC servers exist in the world, nearly each unique. If you like Bedwars/Eggwars type games, play them till you get bored, then you can play Skywars, UHC, Duels, Survival with Friends, Box PVP, Prison Servers, Roleplay Servers, etc, etc. The possibilites are truly endless.. I love this game and have been playing it for almost 10 years. Everyone saying it ""it's bad because you need creativity for it"" or ""it's too hard"" just has a skill issue and should cry about it. I can’t play multiplayer and if I join someone’s world even though I am friends on Minecraft therefore having a Microsoft account even using the same WiFi and somehow lags and crashes and if there is no multiplayer well it’s really an inconvenience. Here I am, a decade after I got the game, coming back yet again for another 2-3 week Minecraft server with my friends. It never stops.. The best survival game that will never let you get bored. Returning to it again and again, we set new goals for ourselves to achieve. All of this is enhanced by the ability to download and install mods and builds for Minecraft, making the game even better! Want to build a megacity? Want to become the ultimate warrior? Want to collect the rarest items? Want to reach the edge of the world? Play Minecraft!. you can start any war, commit wars any way you want and remake 9/11 with redstone plane. Best game ever.. It is almost the ancestor of most games. Of course, what makes it special is the freedom that this pixel pattern brings.. Very fun and easy to get into. Controls are simple. Its also easy to add additional content. Overall, child friendly, and will make your time fly.. Minecraft is special its a game that deserves a 10 its the game to play for hundreds of hours.. Minecraft good game. Now let me post this review... Uhhhhh it needs 75, 75 characters! I mean that's such a random number. I mean like... Oh, I'm Already over 75 characters.. Greatest game I could ever play, infinity amount of creativity, adventure and fun with friends in many many ways you could ever dream :D. WAY WAY WAY back when i was 7 i watch a lot of people play this game so i bought the game and played it a lot but know i feel like its boring and i find it sad that the game is dying BUT mods do make it way funner the normal minecraft a 7/10 but with mods a 9/10. I would rate it a 10 but the laziness, lack of creativity and lack of communication on Mojang's side in the past couple of years is really starting to show in the newer updates (mainly past 1.16/17). But that besides this is a game I've played for more than half of my life, a game that has made many great memories that I'll keep being fond of as long as I am alive.. Do I really need to explain anything...? If you haven't heard of Minecraft I don't believe you are real.. I have been playing Minecraft for the majority of my life (I’m 17) and I’d have to say this is my favorite game. I have trouble with gaming because of the fact that I am just not good at them, but Minecraft has always been enjoyable for me, and that really means a lot. I love farming and mining and building ugly houses. I love hoarding things and making huge crop farms for no real reason. It’s relaxing and there’s so many things to do. My only problem is the recent mob votes, we want updates that actually add to the game. We don’t just want publicity stunts. Youtubers would give their input on what mob they want, and then their fans would rig the vote. We have missed out on so many cool mobs because of that. I think the devs should add whatever mobs they think would add to the game, which is usually all three of the options. Sometimes the mob vote just seems rigged from the start though, with one obvious winner, but then people vote for a stupid one instead. It’s just not a good system.. Let me start by saying that Minecraft has seriously let me down. I mean, come on, I spend hours building up my gear, collecting resources, and psyching myself up to take on the notorious Ender Dragon. And what do I get in return? A colossal letdown, that's what!First off, the whole process of gathering Ender Pearls and Blaze Powder to create Eyes of Ender was a pain in the block. It's like the game is intentionally trying to make you work for the privilege of getting your butt kicked by a ****, let's talk about the actual End dimension. The floating islands and Endermen everywhere are enough to drive anyone insane. But fine, I accept the challenge; after all, it's the journey, right?But here's where it all falls apart - the Ender Dragon fight. It's supposed to be this epic battle, right? Well, epic is one word for it, but frustratingly impossible is more accurate. You know why? Because the dragon just won't stop flying around! Seriously, who designed this thing?I've got my enchanted diamond armor, the sharpest sword, and I'm ready for a showdown. And what does the dragon do? Just hovers in the air like it's on vacation, making it nearly impossible to get a decent hit. Not cool, Mojang, not **** don't even get me started on those Ender Crystals healing the dragon. I can't tell you how many times I thought I had the upper hand, only for the dragon to swoop down and regain all its health. Talk about a slap in the **** conclusion, Minecraft, you've managed to turn what should be a legendary gaming moment into a frustrating nightmare. Fix the Ender Dragon fight, and maybe I'll reconsider my one-star rating. Until then, I'll be smashing blocks in frustration and questioning all my life choices. Minecraft as a game is really good and I've been playing it for so long. It kind of became a part of my character and the podcasts, debates and interesting videos I have always listened to while building large creative builds has honestly really shaped who I have become as an adult. However, and this is the reason why I am giving this game a negative review, Microsoft is trying as hard as it can to make the actual game a living nightmare to get to play. My first Mojang account was really old, I was like 8 when I bought it (or rather, at the time, my parents did), meaning that, as a stupid kid, the target demographic at the time, I really don't remember the password to the old account anymore. When Microsoft decided to ""migrate"" the old users to their **** ass systems, they single-handedly created the largest trend **** game turning absolutely **** I have ever witnessed. When trying to even play Minecraft, I had to scour through my old e-mail to find that the account info needed for the migration wasn't there and what's more, the provided link for migration didn't work at all, it literally pointed at a 404 error Mojang page. That was a year ago. I have since stopped bothering and just bought the game, because the number of times I went ""I'd kinda wanna play Minecraft anymore"", only to be disappointed, frustrated and turned off by the immense ""dragging-your-balls-over-broken-glass"" experience that is trying to get your account back, was really too much. Now that I bought my account, I discovered that I can not get my old name back. Okay, understandable, I added a numerical suffix to the name and went on playing. The game, after a staggering three months, FORGOT MY NAME and didn't let me play until I entered a new one, because, while forgetting my name, it didn't forget that SOMEONE had it. So I was blocking myself from having my name. Sure, okay, I resolved the issue and picked a new username. That was two months ago. I didn't play for a bit, wanted to really ease off today, build some stuff and chill, only to find my name forgotten by the launcher AGAIN. So I scoured through the forums and happened upon a recent thread with Mojang support, where it said to just set the username to something different, which should in theory unlock the username and then set it up again. So I did exactly that only to find that contrary to Mojang's own support team's **** CAN ONLY CHANGE YOUR USERNAME ONCE. A. MONTH. This level of messing with the playability of the game has me surprised no one has actually put forth some sort of a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft, who, either intentionally or through their incompetence, literally force the players to buy new copies of the game because of their stupid, barely functioning migration and when they finally get the launcher, they will often not get through it to play the game. It's frankly bewildering how they get away with this. What a joke **** this has turned into.. One of the best video games and the good thing is that it is timeless, in short, it definitely deserves 10/10 .... This game is no longer the same as before, players are adding a lot of beautiful mods, there are a lot of mods requested from them, seriously, is it very difficult to add them, you don't even answer the player requests properly, you still don't even have the story of the game, minecraft is still like an unfinished beta game, more friendly creatures, enemy creatures, and big bosses are needed for this game, it really upsets me that the game I have been playing for 8 or 9 years is still like an unfinished game, not everyone may agree with this comment, but this does not change the fact that I did not accept it at first, but I understood it when time passed, What makes the game fun is either the friends or the different mods made by the players, the game alone is not that fun anymore, it's not like it used to be for me, I used to say that minecraft is not a game I can never leave, but now I'm not sure, I still play it sometimes, but fortnite has prevented this with its last update, maybe it's me, but right now minecraft is an inadequate game and microsoft doesn't care about it, a game with a lot of potential will be forgotten.. let me start off with the positives. building is a simple but amazing system, and you can create incredible structures with the different blocks. redstone is very indepth and you can create even crazier things with it. now, the negatives: mojang is a lazy developer. at least hundreds of millions of USD in terms of funding and they release half assed updates every year. instead of fixing the issues the game has (bad combat, low replayability, terrible boss fights) they focus on adding new content that half the time isnt even good. the mob votes are tilted in the favour of whatever mob the popular youtubers pick, and (this is fixed now, to be fair) for the longest time the game had terrible optimization. now, the MAJOUR ISSUES: there is little to no replay value, as the progression system is short and incredibly linear. especially since you always end up picking the same enchantments on your gear, because some enchantments are just objectively better than others. gear you have becomes obsolete quickly, so there is almost no point in you making it aside from getting the next level of gear in about 10 minutes. overworld (not the nether or end, those are interesting) biomes are boring as well. instead of having a unique soundtrack with unique enemies (there are a FEW ","minecraft is nothing but a hollow template, an idea **** rather than an actual game . the game is known mainly for two things: being a 3D Lego game (Block game) and 'X in minecraft' the game is designed to simulate things from real life and other media rather than its own ideas ."
105.Persona 4 Golden,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a game that you can really feel casual atmosphere and gold-like friend relationship in Japan countryside.. The game is good, however a major problem for those who haven't played any Shin Megami Tensei games will start off this game struggling (especially on difficulties Normal or harder). But don't let the difficulty dilute your enjoyment too hard, it's still as fun as any other Persona game!. The strengths of this game in comparison to other JRPS is the lovable, deep and interesting characters. Much of the content of this game revolves around interacting with the characters, so if you do not enjoy connecting with characters in games, then you may not see this game in its greatest light.. THIS GAME IS FUNNY!!! Is this game the weakest out of the main 3? Yes... It's soundtrack, story, combat, environment, and even it some instances characters are outweighed by P3s and P5Rs. But if you just want to sit down, relax, and play a legitimately fun and humorous game, you should play this one.. I play the game on Switch since 2024, I was worry I can afford the old game style from 10 years ago, but after story go in tos second months, my worries has gone. I can’t stop to play, and I confirm I love this game same like P5R. It never go down even the graphics is more than 10 years. If Atlus remake this game like P3 Reload, I definitely buy the collectors edition!. ""Persona 4 Golden"" is a real gem in the JRPG world, which not only delivers epic gameplay, but also takes us on an emotional rollercoaster. Playing this game, I felt like I was transported to the town of Inaba and became part **** of friends with whom I experienced every moment, from laughter to tears.First of all, it is worth emphasizing how phenomenally the plot is. Inaba may at first glance look like a typical, boring town, but it quickly turns out that it hides dark secrets, and the puzzles that we have to solve keep us in suspense until the very end. Each character we meet is unique, has their own problems and dreams, and building relationships with them is pure pleasure. Believe me, it is hard not to get attached to this team.Graphically, for a game from the PS2 era, ""Persona 4 Golden"" looks really good, especially in the refreshed version. The colorful palette and art style are timeless, and the animations during fights and cutscenes are a joy to watch. Music? There's no point in saying much here - the soundtrack is a total banger! Songs like ""Reach Out To The Truth"" are tunes you'll be humming long after you've finished the **** gameplay is a perfect balance between exploration, combat, and building relationships. Every day in Inaba is a new opportunity to get closer to your friends, develop your skills, and discover more secrets. The combat system is dynamic and satisfying, and Persona fusions offer a ton of strategic options that allow you to create unique and powerful **** only minor downside that can be found is the fact that the game can sometimes require a bit of grinding, but it's nothing that could spoil the overall fun of the game. Additionally, some dialogue moments could be a bit shorter, but for fans of this type of narrative, that's more of a bonus than a **** sum up, ""Persona 4 Golden"" is a true masterpiece. It's a game that not only draws you in with its story and gameplay, but also leaves a lasting mark on your heart. If you haven’t had the chance to experience this adventure yet, now is the perfect time to dive into the world of Persona 4. My rating? A near-perfect 9.5 out of 10!. The worst of the series, not bad, but when compared with P3 and P5, you can clearly see the difference. The game was made in just 18 months, clearly not enough to make a deep and interesting game like the others, the characters were absolute underdeveloped and some even fully garbage . However, the ambience on which the game is set, is one of the best, the suspense is huge, sad that it was **** annoying. First persona game on the vita, beat it in 3 days, I love this game to death! Didn’t know what I was getting into and just fell in love with the world and the characters, beaten this game about 5 times now, my favorite game of all time!. Persona 4 Golden is an exceptional JRPG that blends engaging gameplay, a gripping story, and deep character development. The vibrant world and captivating soundtrack enhance the immersive experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.. Persona 4 led to great innovation for the franchise as a whole with the changes in structure for the gameplay and social links. A masterpiece ****. A must play for anyone who owns a PS Vita. Addictive RPG gameplay and a captivating story. Even better than the later persona games in my opinion.. 93 is bigger than 92 but not bigger than 95. runnerup for goty 2024 easy. 9.9/10 (rounded up to 10). Played this game out of curiosity. Finished it twice, played through Persona 5 Royal, and now playing Persona 3 Reload... Atlus is mastering JRPG, this is 100% worth it, stop reading and go try it !. Addicting as well as immersive life sim dungeon crawler jRPG. Friendships you make through the story seem incredibly ""real"". Main protagonist can be mirrored yourself, which I strongly appreciate. Town of Inaba despite its small size is charming, also school events were superb comic relief. BGM's are phenomenal, PERSONAlly I anticipate that ""Heartbeat, Heartbreak"" or ""Heaven"" may become classics. All in all, it's work of art.. BEST Persona series ever! Gameplay, HUD/UI, musics, all perfect! I'll play again when it come to remake or reload. Persona 4 Golden is an elite game and I really want to give it a 10/10 there’s a few things prevented me from doing that the game is still amazing but the combat feels kind of out dated only because the game came out over 10 years ago now and is so worthy of a persona 3 reload treatment in a remake and I hope it comes soon because this games characters and story is phenomenal and Maries character can also be more in depth and possibly can be a party member at some point it’s definitely possible and don’t even get me started on the music everything is amazing about this game but a remake would actually make this game go from amazing to perfection I hope atlus does it soon. One of the bestgame that i ever played The soundtack,the history everthing is beatiful. A excellent game that clearly shows they kept building from 3 and into my amazing experience with royal. Yet it stands on its own with superb characters, fun, mystery, social links and still has an enticing loop. I love the cast and elements they introduce. coming from i appreciate the dungeons though i prefer t5s dungeon expansion, and like the bosses. An amzing experience top to bottom.. Persona 4 is my 3rd favorite game of all time. A lot of people come to it after playing Persona 5, and I must say, do NOT compare Persona 4 to Persona 5. These are completely different games, and they're both beautiful in their own ways. The story gets you **** in so easily, and the TV World concept mixed with a murder mystery is honestly one of the most unique ideas I've ever seen. The characters in this game are all incredibly lovable and unique. You'll fall in love with them in no time. The gameplay is super addicting too. Overall, I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good story game that's both engaging and interesting, but also comforting.. This is the definite way to play an already amazing jrpg. The character interactions are just so lovely in persona 4.. Persona 4 Golden is the definitive best game on the PS Vita. It is an upscalled PS2 game, but one with one of the best narratives in an RPG, great characters, a memorable soundtrack, solid gameplay, and great new content. I can't really add too much to this review that others have said, but Persona 4 Golden is a definitive 10/10.. I played 5 first and on that game my ranking was a 10/10. Well i have not played P4G to that point. Gameplay and Personas are better in 5 but everything else i like here more, especially the story and cast.. Persona 4 Golden is my favorite game of all time. 2016. I was a depressed, angry, suicidal teenager who had just graduated the year before and had spent his post high school life wandering aimlessly through life and pushing away everyone he had ever cared about. I had not felt joy in years and the hobby that had previously brought me comfort now only bored me. A friend of mine convinced me to get a Vita and a copy of this game so I gave it a shot. I was not ready for what I was about to experience. Persona 4 Golden is a genuine work of art. It is a truly beautiful game... and it saved my life. -Story- Persona 4 Golden is a very long game, but it uses that length to it's advantage by giving the story plenty of time to breathe. You spend a lot of time taking in the sights, exploring the town and talking to its residents. Even more time however is spent getting closer to and learning about your party members and a few select special individuals. You truly learn a lot about these people, and this town and you really get attached. The story itself I will not spoil, but it is a murder mystery with a super natural spin and all the twists and turns are very interesting and keep you engaged from start to finish and for an 80+ hour game that is a major victory. -Gameplay- The SMT series as a whole is constantly revamping the JRPG turn based formula and Persona 4 is no exception. The game is split into two halves. The ""real world"" where you live your life as a normal high school student, getting closer to your friends working jobs, going to holiday gatherings, and living in this new town and the ""shadow world"" where you fight the existential horrors of mankind given form. The balance between the two keeps things from getting stale and the actual battles themselves are made ever more engaging with the unique spin on turn based combat that incentivize using the proper moves on the proper enemies to steal turns away. Play your cards right (pun intended) and you can finish fights without even giving your opponent a single turn. -Music- The Persona series is full of amazing music and this game is no exception. Don't even waste your time reading my words talking about it, just go listen to the soundtrack right now even if you don't play the game! Persona music is just simply THAT good! I love this game so much. It really is one of the most special experiences I have ever had the joy of playing through and I will NEVER forget my time in Inaba. I love the entire series, but this game will always have a special place in my heart as the game that literally saved my life. Thank you for listening.. Persona 4 Golden is the definitive means of experiencing the PS2-classic. Though a port from the PS-Vita, the graphics are a definite step-up from those of the PS2 and are still relatively passable as a modern game. The gameplay was made significantly easier through the introduction of new difficulties and the revamp of the Shuffle Time mechanic. The story remains untouched for the most part, though, as with all Persona re-releases, new, special arcs are added near the endgame. This is a highly recommended starting point for anyone interested in the series.. The worst of the the modern persona games dew to the game play being just unfun at points. Only game that ever made me cry like a baby. If you haven't played this game please do.. Blinded by nostalgia is what I am currently. I first played Vanilla Persona 4 on the PS2 back in November 2019, that was my first exposure to the Persona franchise. Vanilla P4 was a fantastic game, I love the story, it gives me vibes of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4, which is my favorite part of JoJo's. Persona 4 Golden is a fantastic remaster/expanded version of the original game, the new characters, the new gimmicks like accessing areas once restricted in the original (such as night access and Okina City) I love this game, my favorite character has to be Chie Satonaka and Yosuke Hanamura.. As much as I loved Persona 5 Royal, I am sorry to admit that I did not enjoy Persona 4 Golden. The game did not age well - the mechanics are old, the gameplay is awfully repetitive, the dungeons are a complete letdown, even considering the times in which the game was released. Not to mention absolutely horrible side quests that kill all the enjoyment of the game. Unfortunately great characters, decent story (albeit with very questionable pacing) and exceptional music did not save the experience for me and I decided to drop it halfway through. I am really worried for Persona 3 Reload, given the fact it’s based on the same design scheme.. Finally beat the game. Its really fun, but also really long. Good thing you can boost Izanagi to be your best Persona and tweak the difficulty. Grinding was enjoyable as i could do other stuff doing it. Ended up with Chie and in Good Ending.. Pros: -Good story and storytelling; interesting characters ( even minor characters); good soundtrack; great design of the characters. Cons: sometimes dungeons are annoying. I don't recommend to play if you don't like; school aspects; dating; the power of friendship; outdated graphics. Overall the game is 8.5 - the Golden version is even better than the original Persona 4, new endings and more time to do Social activities ( Social Links). Persona 4 Golden was my introduction to what would become my favorite video game series of all time, but how does it hold up on it's own? The graphics are dated, the combat is grindy, slow and uninteresting, the dungeons are two hallways repeated ten times, the golden hands **** **** and the dialogue can be cringy, but I would be lying to myself if I didn't absolutely love this game regardless of it's glaring issues. It is so unique and charming, with characters so incredibly well written and realized that you really do end up caring for PS2 era jpeg's. The small setting in the town of Inaba only serves to reinforce the homey feeling of being where you belong with great friends, and their interactions and frequent outings are cute and well realized, albeit with some pretty embarrassing moments that only serve to reinforce the feeling of living in the mid to late 2000s. The story is simple, with a rather predictable antagonist (who is also great), but it's still a great whodunnit murder mystery realized with great care and passion. Some social links, like Dojima, Marie, Naoto, Adachi, Ai, Nanako and Kou (as well as the investigation team) are amazing and some of the best in the series, but some other ones, like the Temperance and Sun, are pretty mediocre. The soundtrack is charming, some dungeons are quite good, even if they are randomly generated, and some moments are very emotional, especially with the True Ending, which features one of the best epilogues of all time. Although I do believe that Persona 5 Royal has overtaken this game as an arguably better experience, you'll still find a ton to love about Persona 4 Golden.. If Divinity 2 is the pinnacle of Western-style RPGs, Persona 4 is the pinnacle of JRPGs. The charming companions and sub-quests are a fantastic balance to the heavy, dark main story, keeping you entertained throughout your playthrough.. The best PS Vita game of all time. Got me into Persona even before the series was cool.. The original was already great, and they made a lot of good additions to this one.. One of my favorite rpgs, love the story, the characters and the gameplay. My favorite game series, I'm just a **** for the rpg and dating sim/VN game type.. Definitely the best game of the series. Gameplay is much better than the predecessors and the cast is my favourite out of any game I've ever played. The story is phenomenal and don't even start on the soundtrack. The OST is marvelous and the best I've ever heard. It's a 10/10 no debate. First time was awesome and 6 playthrough was great . As someone who bought the Vita was hoping to get some great games from Sony. Well that didn't happen and Persona 4 Golden was must own video game and it's awesome now it's on mordon console. The original Persona 4 was my perfect game and when I played P4G, my mind was blown that my perfect game can be made even better. This is the second persona game i've played and I freaking love this game. It has it's flaws but those flaws cancel out for because of how high the highs are in p4g. The chaacters are the most charming and relatable than any of the games i've played and are some of my favorite cast of characters in fiction. The small town setting is an elite setting for me in this game because it feels like you really know this town because of how small it is. Which creates an excellent sense of immersion. The turn based rpg gameplay is amazing as always from atlus and the personas are badass and cool. Overall, I think this game is masterpiece and I highly recommend it.. Best JRPG game i play so far as i bought Vita specifically to play this game.. I love this game soo much! Persona 4 Series really has changed my life, and I feel very grateful for that.. One of the greatest games of all time. Fantastic story, character, plot, music, everything about Persona 4 Golden is perfect. It indeed is golden. It was my first Persona game, and I've never looked back.. Steam version is released but i still choose the vita version because of its mobility, unless you want better graphics and 60 fps bettering go with the steam version.. A very heartwarming story full of suspense and mystery. The characters in this game connect and develop so well, their friendship is amazingly done and it's the most important thing in the entire game. The moments the characters share with each other is the core foundation of the story, and their team dynamic is what makes this game so special. The school trips and social events are also a very big part of the game and they flesh out the characters more. The gameplay is pretty solid and enjoyable, it's your typical Turn Based JRPG gameplay with some very few unique elements, but the menus are a little bit clunky. The social simulator aspect is easily the best part of the gameplay, I absolutely love going out with people and partaking in events, doing the little side stories and interacting with the world the game has to offer. As for the music, it's fantastic, I honestly didn't think I would like the music of this game as much because it's not my type of music, but it fits very well, it's light-hearted and a contradiction to the game's themes, in an excellent way. The only problem I have with the game is the bad and lazy dungeon design, and the backtracking gets tedious after a while. Every area looks identical to each other, there are pretty much no puzzles, and the floors are randomly generated. Also some plot-points are kind of goofy and very sudden, which left me with some unanswered questions. That being said I think most of the story is honestly very interesting, and I love how the game delves deeper into the ""murder mystery"" theme, giving you choices to uncover the secrets of Inaba. Where the game shines is the atmosphere, at times it's surprisingly disturbing but for the most part it's very welcoming. The color palette is warm, cute and unique, making you really feel immersed into the game, spending time with the characters and participating in the story. It has a ""family"" vibe to it like no other game, and it feels like home. Despite the few outdated mechanics, I absolutely adore this game and it's definitely one of the best JRPGs I've ever played. Final Rating: ""Excellent"" - 9.5/10.. What can I say, this game is perfect. Story, gameplay, atmosphere... Everything!. Awesome story and characters design! Huge game and ton of fun. There are really a lot of memorable moments that I am sure everyone will cherish!. The Story is great as well as the gameplay. You just want to continue playing, to find out what is going in this town.. Persona 4 Golden is the updated rerelease of the ps2 game Persona 4, and personally, I think it suffers from many of it's additions rather than benefits from them, yet still it remains a fantastic game and with the added benefit of portability and HD graphics, I really can't recommend Golden over the originally enough, not to say the original doesn't still have merit, but for your first time with this game, I think Golden is the way to go, but unlike P3 FES and P5 Royal, I think you really ought to go back and play the original too. Persona 4 tells the story of a city boy moving to the countryside to stay with his uncle and niece for the year, you can name this boy whatever you want, but canonically his name is Yu Narukami, so that's what I'll be referring to him as. Yu will meet a whole host of characters, some bright and vibrant with character and some are Yumi Ozawa, but we don't talk about her. There's the main cast, comprising of resident best friend character Yosuke Hanamura, a fellow city kid and removed gay romance option, Atlus you cowards, Chie Satonaka, spunky tomboy who isn't as obsessed with meat as the spin-off's would have you believe, Yukiko Amagi... she's fine, Kanji Tatsumi, the most relatable character I've ever met in a piece of fiction, I love him so much, Naoto Shirogane, best girl detective who people on Twitter willfully misinterpreted as transgender, Rise Kujikawa the simp, and finally Teddie, annoying mascot character. All in all it's a pretty good cast, I don't like it as much as either P3 or P5's cast, but good nonetheless. They do suffer a bit from being TOO in love with Yu. where in P3 Junpei hated Makoto for a month and you had to work to impress Yukari and Mitsuru, everybody here kinda just loves you right out the gate and never shifts opinion, you're god to them. It's especially bad with Rise, who simps harder for Yu than I simp for Naoto, which is damn hard. For the most part these are good characters, Kanji and Naoto stand out to me as having particularly great character arcs that deal a lot with personal identity and where society places you, Kanji specifically, I find his story of having traditionally feminine interests really relatable, him trying to appear more masculine on the surface as a self defense mechanism only for him to embrace those parts of him people find strange or ""****"" is something I find more emotionally resonant than all 6 of these games combined, and despite Kanji's sexuality never being confirmed because in his own words ""it ain't about guys or chicks, I'm just scared **** of bein' rejected"" My personal headcanon is that he's bisexual, but I'm just projecting at that point. As for the story in this game it focuses a lot around the ""truth"" and how far you'll go to pursue it, to the point of having a really dumb secret ending that I don't understand how you're supposed to get without the internet telling you how but there you go I guess. It also has themes of societal expectations and rebelling against that, something Persona 5 would later build upon. The games actual plot revolves around a murder mystery in a small town as you and your ragtag group of friends work together to route out the killer making friends and enemies along the wa- wait a minute... this isn't Persona 4, this is just... GRAND MATROPOLI- I mean, Diamond Is Unbreakable. Yeah people have discussed this games similarities to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure before, and given the nature of Persona's in general, it wouldn't shock me to find out Persona is inspired by JoJo, but as is, it's just a fun little coincidence. Golden introduces one new character in Marie, she's... fine, she has this whole tsundere thing and it's kinda rough but I like her design a lot, very cute. Her dungeon is pretty good too, if easy. The game as a whole is pretty easy actually, the easiest Neo-Persona game in my opinion, to the point I could solo Marie's dungeon no trouble whatsoever, which is a far cry from spending 2 hours fighting Nyx in P3, but I guess I'd rather this anyway. Combat is what you think it is, Turn Based combat with your standard Pokemon-like elemental attacks and weaknesses, Pokemon + Demons, a Pokemon for Doom fans. Good to see Atlus realized their mistake with P3 and gave you direct control over your party again, god knows it needed it. Persona 4 Golden is good, great even, not my favourite Persona but one I highly recommend, even with Golden taking away from what made Inaba a neat concept by adding a beach and a Ski Resort, I mean seriously Yosuke's whole character arc revolved around him being bored out of his skull and you add a Ski Resort? Well whatever, it's still good, and it's on Steam, so go play it.. Average story with great voice acting ruined by 90 hours of pointless grinding.. Amazing feel-good slice of life game combined with a tense and disturbing murder mystery plot which takes place over a calendar year. The high-school characters in this game aren't inherent heroes or superstars (not even the teen idol as you will see if you play the game), but just your regular optimistic and, sometimes, naive teenagers. What they have though is big hearts and potential for growth, which is best seen in the social link mechanic which allows the main character to hang out his friends and other people he meets in the town. This is my favourite part of the game, getting to know other characters in the town and but also obtaining bonuses for the dungeon crawling part of the game. Of which the turn based dungeon combat is so addictive. The Jungian aspects is also very cool too. Music overall is pretty good as well. If there is something I didn't like it would be that the main character is infallible and perfect in the eyes of his friends. I suppose it's better than being a blank slate but it would be nice if Persona 6 had a more complex protagonist for once. Then again the fact that he is boring takes away the attention from him allows his friends and family to shine brighter as characters.. If you've got a Vita, play this game. Prior to this, the only RPG I'd played was Pokemon Leafgreen (quite fun btw). But from the very beginning, this game **** me in. The world building, each character having their own arcs that feel meaningful, to spending time enjoying the small town of Inaba. The game simply draws you in, attaching you to the characters. And the story is amazing. Twists galore. If you love RPG's, play this game! If you don't, play this game! As a last note, the soundtrack is wonderful.. Persona 4 Golden is a masterpiece. Give it a shot if you never did. The beginning may be a little slow if you aren't habituated with story-based games, but it quickly turns itself into one of the best ""friendship simulator"" games of all time. The gameplay is pretty good. For me, Persona series has one of (or literally) the greatest turn-based RPG mechanic of the century. Combining the amazing story and the fabulous gameplay, Persona 4 Golden changed my life. Why don't you let it change yours as well?. A very charming JRPG that tells an interesting story full of heartwarming moments & mystery. I love the characters in this game, they connect & develop so well, their friendship is amazingly done and it's the most important thing in the whole game. The school trips and the events are also a very big part of the game and they flesh out the characters more. The gameplay mechanics are pretty solid and enjoyable, although a little bit outdated for today's standards. The music is fantastic, I honestly didn't think I would like the music of this game as much because it's not my type of music, but it fits very well. The only problem I have with the game is the bad and lazy dungeon design that gets tedious after a while. Despite the very few outdated mechanics, I absolutely adore this game and it's definitely one of the best JRPGs I've ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Persona 4 Golden is a game that is an integral part of my childhood. The day I got this game at the PlayStation Vita became the start of me being a fan of the Persona franchise or just JRPGs in general. The game offers a lot for the players to have their time worth with it's incredible narrative and a beautiful cast of characters that you will emotionally be attached to because of how well written each characters are, even the side ones. Adding with its amazing combat system that made turn-based combat into a whole another level, making people who hate the combat system become a fan of one and I was one of them. The creative and innovative bosses and dungeons all have different feeling to them and it was perfect for each scenario in the different events happening in the game. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing changing the vibes of the game because of the BGM alone, whether it be a cheerful or a sad one. It is no wonder that Persona 4 Golden is the only game on Playstation Vita to have a Metacritic Must Play. The game still holds up until now and I honestly can't recommend it enough.. Challenging combat and boss battles, Great Story, Gameplay is addicting, dialogue is pretty great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game! The story is perfect, the gameplay is gr8, and best of all, it's on Vita! It may be on LC, but the Vita version is still joy!. Persona 4 get great scores but i dont understand. The game is ok but dont deserve a 9 or 10 like some give. It is fun but not perfect or near it. Graphics are very average. Gameplay is fun for some parts but alot of talking too. Too much talking for me. I prefer action games and this one need alot reading and searching. I would still recommend but this is not an awesome game. Its a good game but not more.. My favorite game of all time baby! It has an intriguing premise of catching a serial killer who throws people in a TV and it has highly functional and balanced combat. More importantly than the premise, it delves into Jungian psychology examining the painful truths people wish to deny about themselves. The series signature gameplay element of social links, which pretends that you had friends and hung out in highschool, is best done in Persona 4 in my opinion. They contribute to the small town intimacy of Inaba and boost your combat capability. The team in this game feels very tight knit and there's not a single member of the Investigation Team I don't love. The game shows this extremely early on the second you see Chie kick Yosuke in the nuts. The music is insane, Shoji Meguro is a real one for writing Your Affection.. After playing almost 100 hours to this game I can say that Persona 4 is one of the best game that I have played in my life. Everything in this game is amazing, story, combat, music, characters... The incredible story, full of mystery, the fun and entretaining battle system, the great music and the dearest characters have maked with this game my favourite game. Worth buy a PS Vita to play this game, now I am waiting for Persona 5 :D. Ever since this game was announced in the Vita at the time, I have never played a persona series nor know a SMT series before. But after playing it, it made me see the light of the series and made me play the previous games before it and enjoyed the series. While the plot is not better than P3, its still an overall an enjoyable ride with amazing characters, interesting plot twists, and fun gameplay. It's not a fun game, I had the most fun about it.. A Masterpiece. From the story, characters, and writing, to the progression, RPG mechanics, abilities, and soundtrack; this game is near perfect.. This is the best game I've ever played.I used this game for learning english language (It helped me a lot with that)Now it is my favorite game.. The first thing that hooks you as soon as you put this game is its soundtrack, then they introduce you to characters that little by little you will get to know more and better, in a very simple way: Living your student l","""Persona 4 Golden"" is a real gem in the JRPG world . the strengths of this game in comparison to other JRPS is the lovable, deep and interesting characters . if atlus remake this game like P3 Reload, I definitely buy the collectors edition!"
