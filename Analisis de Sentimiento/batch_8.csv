293.Trials Evolution,"Atmosphere: 7 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 6 Music: 5 Story: 5 Total: 6.17. As with it’s predecessor, Trials Evolution challenges players to ride a motorcycle from the start of a level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles, preferably as quickly and with a few crashes as possible. Trials Evolution becomes particularly difficult towards the final stages, to the extent that few will ever see it through to completion, but the gameplay remains addictive and the addition of an excellent track editor has seen some fantastic user created levels made available. Add to this some fun multiplayer modes and you have another top notch Xbox Arcade title.. Following on from its predecessor 2009’s Trials HD, Trials Evolution brings more 2.5D barrel balancing, log leaping & fire dodging, motocross goodness. Still keeping its original core feel, simple controls and some mentally insane tracks, Trials Evo isn't just a quick entertainment fix. No sir (or madam), it’s a game to bring out your competitive side, your control skills and maybe some “Hulk” like tendencies. The metamorphosis through the years has seen improvements to both the graphics and game play, pushing the boundaries of physics, awesomeness and the just plain crazy. Trials Evolution tests your abilities (at least to start with) on relatively simple obstacle courses and tracks, but as you make your way things get tougher, and the determination to succeed becomes stronger. That is unless you see green, rage quit and sit sulking in the corner. Online you can compete with 3 other human riders, and a big part of the fun is building and sharing your own personal tracks and customising your bike and rider. Congrats to Red Lynx and Microsoft Studios for bring something truly epic to the table and I hope they continue to work together on future projects. At 1200MSP, it’s available to download in the XBL Marketplace and is simple enough that anyone to play (yes, even my 3 year old can complete the beginner courses).. Trials Evolution came out of nowhere. For the first few months learning how to manipulate the motorcycles I enjoyed jumping ramps and trying OVER AND OVER AGAIN to place the bike into a particular position while balancing between gravity and my own virtual weight in order to make the bike swing left and right to clear an obstacle, then on to the next obstacle. After thousands upon thousands of wrecks I started to use the level creation tool to create my own tracks. Months went by and I started to pass tracks that were once impossible for me, and now I search for tracks that will somewhat present a challenge to me. Trials keeps your nerves twisted and your palms sweaty, but the addiction is uncontainable and constantly evolving. With no game of its kind (apart from a few indies and I tab/phone similars) its no wonder this smash hit kept users coming back. Intense bike manipulation, good graphics, and superior controls, Trials is among the top five best arcade games of all time. Magnificent.. Nothing but joy was felt playing this thing. This is a pure gamer's game. You don't have to like it, but are a f*cking moron if you give this game lower than a 5. I can understand not loving it, but Jesus, man, don't be that f*cking jack*ss. 9.5 rounded down. Nothing is a 10.. Best DLC ever. Only cheap. If you dont own it.. WHY NOT? You can download other peoples own created track so there is no end to this game. A must buy.. Talk about the most frustrating series of all time, but still fun. It's very well made and the gameplay is great but it doesn't keep me coming back for more, like the first one did. Maybe I just bored of it.. The only thing that could make me stop playing Trials HD? Trials Evolution. It improves on nearly everything from the first, starting with even bigger and more awe-inspiring set pieces. Add in customized bikes, characters and levels, and you had a deep game with tons of replay value.. Graphics: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Enjoyment: 8/10 Value For Money: 9/10 7.75 If you haven't yet... BUY THIS GAME!!! Just looking up there at what scores I have rated you should have got overtime at work and worked for this game. Bust game on the XBLA, maybe?. This is clearly the best arcade-game available in my opinion. It can't compare with ""real"" games, but for the branch it is nearly perfect. It's astonishing what this game is capable of. It's not only another great Trials game with improved graphics and physics, but thanks to the map-editor and the communities' creativity you can expand the experience a lot. However, after all it's still a Trials game which means that the gameplay of driving a motorcycle in 2D perspective can get quite dull after a while, no matter how much quality content there is.. Impressive the game is. Not only fun but also difficult to play, to get pass the harder levels of the game require a lot of patience and skill. This game deserves a try for everyone. It's the perfect Xbox Live Arcade game, awesome, addictive and amazingly good. A must-buy for everyone who likes racing, physics, puzzles, explosions, multiplayer competition and an all-around complete editor.. Simply a really fun game to play - as simple as the gameplay may seem initially, being somewhat the same as 'dirt bike' flash games, it is just so much more in every way. If you can work the level editor to an advanced level, that alone is worth the cost of this game.. It's one of the most amazing games that I ever played. Its awesome, very fun, and you can play easily with 3 other friends in the same room, competing for only one reason... If you don't get this game, you are a kind of stupid person!!! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. For newbies the Trials games are at heart a platformer with amazing level designs, except instead of being a blue hedgehog, you are a trial biker. It uses realistic physics to control your bike, playing with speed and weight. It's very addictive. Back to the review now. Trials HD was one of my favourite games of all time. Trials Evolution is even better. The controls are tighter and more responsive which is an improvement on what was already rather perfect. The skills games aren't as well thought out but their are a few that come close to the original. For all let downs in skill games... It is offset by better tracks in the main game and an amazing track editor. As if that didn't keep you occupied, you can download tracks and skill games from bedroom designers from all over the world. Buy this now!. The Trials franchise has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a PC title. Now in its fourth entry Trials Evolution opens up the doors of that dingy warehouse into the open landscapes beyond. Trials Evo boasts a single player mode with 50+ tracks & skill games to play; online, splitscreen and LAN multiplayer on both single player courses and all new Motocross courses and Track central, a place to build, share and download all your creations with anyone in the world. Trials Evo will set you back 1200MS points but for that price your getting what would amount to more than a £40 game. Trials is back and its here to stay.. Can't believe this is rated so highly, It's an alright game but does not deserve such a high rating. Got bored of it after about 6 hours of gameplay. Nothing more than what I used to play on windows 98, but it was free to play that back in my day.. Trials HD, RedLynx. I bought this game on the day of release, played it for a few hours and thought it was pretty good but not something i would play much in the future. Oh how wrong I was. There comes a point playing this when you suddenly break through one of the several difficulty barriers and you are suddenly whizzing through tracks that had previously seemed Iike trial-and-error exercises in futility. And then there's the hard tracks, and then the extreme tracks. When I finally got gold on Way Of The Ninja it was literally one of the most satisfying moments I've experienced in gaming. The thing is, you are always improving and just when you are about to smash the controller you come through the other side... You can feel yourself getting better. It's addictive and rewarding, more so than any 'AAA' game, hands down. It's what gaming should feel like. To say nothing of the amazing editor and DLC, you cannot get better value for money imo. Don't dismiss this game until you've given it a REAL chance. Trials Evolution is really fun but it gets kinda boring when you start trying to get gold on all levels. Track central offers loads more gameplay. Making levels is really easy too(other than making complicated skill games like snake and other things like that). I would even say the track editor is simpler than happy wheels.. Although I hate this game and all trials game before it, this game certainly deserves credit as one of the best games on the arcade this year. It has nothing wrong going for it. Graphics are outstanding, game-play is smooth, game physics are amazing, excellent maps and the player customization allow players & creators alike to explore their creativity with developing for the game. Definitely an amazing game to fans of the trials series and neutral players but my pure hatred for the game series forces me to deny this game a 10 rating.. There is nothing bad at all about this game.....other than the fact it is incredibly addictive. Anyone giving the game a low review is either **** or they have not played the game and just want to hate it.. ""Physics based"" my foot! Excite Bike on the NES had better physics! It's pretty, responsive, and fun, with varied and engaging levels. But let's be honest: the core mechanic is very simple, and it is anything but realistic. I got bored of it pretty quickly, definitely before I felt like I'd had my $15 worth. If you judge it on the gameplay, I've seen better flash games with the same mechanic*. That said, it's not like it's terrible. It's just that this rating is way, way too high. *And I find the ""level editor"" in Line Rider to be a lot easier to use!. Evolution on this game, Red Lynx has had 3 years to perfect this game, and it is no doubt a wait I could deal with, he game is awesome and even with it, it is still one of the best games on XBLA. lovin it. Trials Evo is fun. Very fun. The only problem is, Trials is also VERY VERY frustrating. Its a simple premise, ride your bike from point A to point B without falling off. The thing is, your going to fall off. ALOT. trials is a trial-and-error style game, which may turn off some who have a lack of conviction. Heck, even I wanted to throw the controller at the screen a few **** maybe a few hundred times. But still, its relaly alot of fun, and you definitely feel accomplished in finishing each and every course. Especially the extreme maps. Amazing! Way better than Trials HD, which was already a fantastic game. For a 15$ arcade game it's a must buy. Redlynx has mastered the physics of the bike and are by far the most realistic of any other motorcycle game.. Another attempt to cash in on a cheap tacky game, everytime I tried to boot this game up I was greeted with a long period of unreponsiveness, when I do get to play the game I find myself playing something from ****. Gameplay is same old flash style gameplay, graphics are the only thing worth mentioning about the whole game. It gets really boring very quickly and no matter how the graphics change and the scenary varies it doesn't make the gameplay any less repetitive or yawn-worthy. I give a 2/10 purely because it looks good but I wish I could get a refund as I would accept it in an instant.. Gameplay is great. Endless options with the track builder. Only real complaint is the selection of upgrades is fairly small. Got a bunch of money to spend and nothing to spend it on! I had no problems with online multiplayer.. I loved Trials HD! I never thought they were going to make a sequel, but I'm glad I was wrong! Trials: Evolution was amazing! I loved the single-player campaign! Then they brought multi-player to the game and just expanded it more than it already was! They also made it so the trails could be turned and it's not just a straight away, you can turn and the enviormentss are amazing! I love the sense of humor that Red Lynx has! The Squirrels are hilarious and I love them. Overall great game!. Addiction. I went on for ten minutes, I spent two hours. The graphics are great for the game but that is just the beginning. The tracks are both innovative and challenging. You can waste a lot of time on this game and not get bored. It's an awful lot of fun but it gets very frustrating. I have spent many hours trying to get a gold medal on every track and when you finish that you get the added challenge of having to get platinum. It is a fantastic game and defiantly worth the small fee you have to pay.. Really amazing. One of the most addicting games of this console generation. The settings in this sequel were a welcome from the traditional warehouse backdrops of the previous installment. The physics and handling of the bike is spot on.. Even though this game has on occasion made me angry with some of the unpredictable bouncing and random front/ backflips... I can't stop playing! Trying to get gold medals on all track is going to keep me playing. I've yet to try the multiplayer and track creator, but I'm sure they'll be just as fun!. This is a great game. Building on the original Trials HD, Trial evolution takes the game out of the warehouse and comes out with a fantastic little game. Courses are especially beautiful including themed courses (e.g. baseball, Limbo, UFOs), and include new features like explosions and the like that really add to the gameplay. The learning curve is also smooth to newcomers, but original Trials HD players will find some really hard levels to entertain, which they'll have to earn. Throw in a super cool editor (used to make all the tracks!) and an online community's worth of DLC tracks, and you have a sequel **** that is leaps and bounds ahead of its original game.. Keep in mind, I haven't even tried local or Live multiplayer. I just find the game hard to stop playing. It isn't remarkably different from Trials HD, so if you have a chance to pick that up much cheaper go for it, but the experience is really compelling. Please note you are going to have to turn the music down for it, but a silly theme song always plays no matter what when you start it up. I come back to it time and time again for other users tracks, which is probably the biggest overall selling point for it. The stuff others do with the track editor are amazing. It is a bit easier, especially early, than Trials HD.. LOL @ the PC fanboy giving this game a 1 because he can't play it. That's very sad. This game is clearly awesome for anyone who has ther patience to stick with the game once it gets more challenging.. I loved Trials HD. It was a really fun but challenging game. The environments from the first game to the new Trials Evolution are dramatically better. The courses in my opinion are a lot easier and nowhere near as frustrating as the last game. The added multiplayer is great both in the racing mode and the Trials mode. The only thing that takes away from this game to me is how hard it is to actually create a level. I have played some created levels and they are amazing. The talent that it takes to make those quality community levels is fantastic. I play this game every 2 - 3 days and it hasn't been getting old. Overall this game is a major improvement from a near perfect original.. Redlynx tried to make a sequel to one of the best selling games on XBLA of all time and while they kind of succeeded in doing so they fell flat on their face with a few flaws the game has. One of the annoyances that I had with Trials Evolution was the new medal system they added in, they've taken the medals out of the original (Trials HD) and they've kept that same formula that made the game feel like you've achieved something. In Trials Evolution that's still the case but with the new single player mode dragging that down having to have a certain amount of medals to progress onto new, harder tracks the game just get's time consuming and can end up being more of a chore than actual fun to play. Another annoyance is the soundtrack, it doesn't really fit that Trials feel, music can pop in at random points and it generally doesn't suit what kind of genre Trials is in. Although the game has received little graphical updates than the previous title it still holds out as being one of the best looking XBLA titles on the system. The gameplay, while frustrating it's still incredibly fun and addictive, unless you're going to play the same levels to get better medals to try and unlock more tracks. They've kept the mini games and they've also added a few other game types in the mini games, one being control a ball (created in the in game editor) to get as far as you can and get the best possible time and score. The editor itself is very hard to learn but once when you learn how to use it then you can make things like a first person shooter, a football table game that you can actually play. The verdict: Despite little graphical updates and barely changed gameplay, it's still fun with new environments, constant levels being made from the community. The weak single player could be overlooked because of the flood of content being created by users. I would recommend waiting until the price goes down a little bit, but it's defiantly a game worth looking at.. Good: -The graphics are well done with a smooth frame rate (feels like 60fps, but not sure). -Some interesting track design. -Some people really like this style of punishing gameplay (example: Super Meat Boy, which I deemed ""not fun"" after 5 minutes). -The demo is a good sample of the full game. Try it first, but beware of the Bad points below: Bad: -I finished all the medium and below tracks in 2 to 3 hours. Not much replayability there. Professional reviews praise the abundant content but I disagree. On the other hand, it's only 15 dollars. -Tracks rated as Hard or Extreme are just exercises in tedious trial-and-error. When you finally pass an obstacle it feels like luck, not better skills. This is not fun. -User made tracks are mostly disappointing (lack of checkpoints) and/or rated for higher difficulty. -The music and voice effects are atrocious. -The track editor works but it requires so much time that average gamers might as well skip it entirely.. I was very pleased by this arcade title. I never played Trials HD but I had heard good things and the multiplayer and track editor really intrigued me. Let me tell you I was not disappointed! This game is very fun and quite addicting. Has a great competitive edge to it so the more friends that have it the better! Graphics are so-so but do the job for this type of game and the soundtrack is decent but can get repetitive at times. I would say the coolest thing about this game though is the track editor feature. With it you can literally CREATE ANYTHING within the realm of racing. From the atmosphere to the vehicle, if you can imagine it you can make it. I'm not the type to spend lots of time making one but it is fun to experiment with it. The best part is you can play other peoples tracks and compete for the top time on it. Overall this is a solid game with a very high replay value. 9/10. This game is so good. I would give it a 10 and say that there is nothing wrong and it is the best game on XBLA, but the music ruins it. If you ignore the music, the game is awesome and even with it, it is still one of the best games on XBLA.. About as addictive as arcade games get, with a never ending rabbit hole of user-made content. Go buy this game right now. However, I am docking a point for the terrible opening ""rap"".. Absolutely the most addictive and satisfying game on XBLA. I put countless hours into the first one, watching my score edge its way up, and now I get to do it all over again, only with user-generated tracks, which are already awesome (check out the Castlevania track). Bravo, RedLynx...bravo.. A $15 game that has near infinite replay value-there it **** original game was so unique and challenging,a true classic.I love when a game like this comes out and it is so good that it gets you to either go back to there previous game to play it all over again or it's got genius value to instantly convince you to buy it so you can have both games to enjoy, just like how the newest Mass Effect 3 does the same thing.This game doesn't just have value though it has everything else to go with ****'s gorgeous,challenging,sexy,and satisfying just as much as a new $60 game **** this game was $60 it would be well worth that,but THIS is the way to make a game!Not only that, it's also a hint of what the future has in store for us.Take away the community creations,(track editor) and you still have a well worth sixty dollar game.I love when game companies take leaps instead of baby steps and delivers what us gamer's crave.This execution in ideal is nothing less then perfect.. Trials Evolution easily takes a spot in the top 5 best XBLA games of all time by improving on the original while maintaining the core that made the first so successful. If you are not familiar with Trials, it is like line rider. You ride on a 2d plane leaning your rider over obstacles to reach the end of the track. The concept of trials is to ride your bike from the starting point to the end point as fast as you can and crashing as little as possible. Checkpoints help guide along the way and new License tests help newcomers learn how to play the game. Trials Evolution takes the Trials hd's physics engine and tweaks it. It is still the overall same physics but is improved adding in curved driving lines. There is also a plethora of new skill games that will keep you entertained for hours on end. The game also as a much more gradual learning curve than hd. It is now much more easy to learn how to play the game. To all the orginal hardcore Trials hd fans, you will be happy to know that the extreme tracks still exist and are much more extreme and more frustrating. The game also adds multiplayer which is excellent with friends locally or online, but still satisfying with random people. I found myself replaying this game tracks a ridiculous amount of times just to compete with friends to obtain the high score on my friends list or to get a virtual gold medal. Evolution's graphics are much improved over hd's graphics. Everything looks great. The sound of the game adds to the experience. The soundtrack is decent and the sound effects are superb. The game also keeps to some of its comedic roots with hilarious crashes, funny rider dialogue, and skill games. The skill games add a different level of comedy, for instance, one game has you launch yourself off of a ramp and then repeatedly tap Y or X to make yourself fly through the air with wooden plank wings and your ragdoll physics body. The game also makes multiple refrences to other games doing things like a Limbo themed map, Angry birds spinoff, a Splosion man skill game and much more. You can also customize your rider more then in Trials hd. In hd you could only change your rider and bike colors. Now you can choose different clothes for your rider and different paint jobs. The options are limited but they are still there. The new map editor improves on hd's in everysingle way. The game gives you the same map editor that the creators used to make their maps. Although it may be overwhelming at first, there are an infinite amount of possibilities with the new editor. A new track finder also allows you to play other user's created tracks. Unlike Trials hd, you can get maps from people who aren't on your friends list. I am very anxious to see what the community will create. It was some time ago that I bought Trials hd and I haven't played it in quite sometime. Trials Evolution capitalizes on everything its predecessor established and just a bigger, more fun, and overall bada** experience. I have not been able to stop playing this game unlike Trials hd it was one and done. It is satisfying to know when I beat a friend in our friendly competitive spirits. This game is just an overall more polished, addicting experience. For 15 dollars, you can't go wrong with Trials Evolution. This is already the leading contender for downloadable game of the year.. All I have to say is that I have blisters on my hands from a 20 hour marathon! This game is incredible. The way that ghosts of all your friends records are active during the single player campaign is pure genius! Plus going to the leaderboards and being able to view anyone's replay or race against their ghost is amazing. This game has an amazing track editor that allows you to create tracks that you can then use in multiplayer. It also keeps track of times for every custom track the same way that it does for all the built in tracks. The skill games use the same system, and they are a fun diversion that really tap into the heart of competitiveness. It's been a long time since a game has captivated me the way this one does, and I count the minutes until I get to play it again!!. Fantastic single player game, even if it is basically the same game as Trials HD. But the multiplayer matchmaking is broken right now. It takes forever to connect. Beware if you buy this game for the new multiplayer!. Brilliant. By far the best arcade game and despite lacking its addicting sense of challenge , better than Trials HD.User Created content and multiplayer will keep you playing this game for a long time. Great value , I wouldn't complain even if it cost an extra 1000 points.. Editing, loads of tracks, modes, sharing tracks, online modes, tournaments, competitive and yet friendly feel makes this game good and in my opinion the best in the xbox live at this moment!. #1 Xbox Live Arcade game of 2012!!!!. Trails Evolution Trial is actually HD, but a billion times more crazy. Simply magnificent and deadly fun. Despite being so frustrating in more advanced levels that lead to Rage Quit. Also comes with a multitude of customizations and an editor levels. But the more is the addictive and fun multiplayer, which generates and wild sprints, although the time point and Spamm could become irritating. Trials do not despontaria Evolution minimanet if it were a physical, multi-platform game. Trials Evolution has so much going on for a $15 game, it's almost funny when you compare it to the offerings of most $60 games. Trials Evolution gets the addition of online multiplayer and a really slick track editor, it's extremely cool. If you like the idea of creating your own crazy custom tracks and sharing them with your friends and the rest of the online community, then this game is a must buy. The track editing software is really deep, and the customization options will keep you busy for a long time. The online multiplayer works really well, both racing side by side, racing against ghosts, and downloading/racing user created tracks. Awesome game and a lot of fun.. It has kept everything that was great in Trials HD, and added more. The level editor is very expansive, the multiplayer very amusing. Only thing that is dragging it down are some multiplayer issues, however these are minor and should be easily solved in the near future.. This is easily one of the best titles on XBLA. I loved Trials HD and played it a lot but when I started playing Trials Evolution I couldn't put it down! The graphics are better, the tracks are feel more structured, there is music in the back round so you're not only hearing your engine and your guy yelling woohoo every ten seconds, and your not in some factory the whole time! This is definitely worth the wait and I recommend this game to anyone. Crazy fun and addicting!. I wanted to like this game so badly, but I can't get over how horrible the bikes handle. Even if you liked HD, play the trial version of this first.. This game is fantastic. If you bought the first one, you should definitely buy this one. If you didn't buy the first one, you should buy this anyway if you enjoy playing any of the many ""tilty"" type flash games. The ""evolution"" that has taken place from Trials HD to Trials Evolution is very impressive. Red Lynx has had 3 years to perfect this game, and it is no doubt a wait I could deal with. From the immense Track Creator, to the four player online multiplayer. Even the music is a positive (the opening theme is starting to grow on me). Trials Evolution is some of the most fun I have had from a game in some time now.. Trial Evolution is a prime example of why the future lies in fast fun addictive games . AAA titles really are a yawn fest these days XBLA Wiware etc are bringing the game back into gaming Trials Evolution Rocks !!. Despite some missteps with the sound design (some annoying sounds from the rider and the stupid soundtrack) , this game is just utterly fantastic throughout. Complete improvement on the original, and the insane amount of options available are still blowing my mind. It looks great for a downloadable title, not as good as heavy hitters like Hydrophobia and I Am Alive but still nice visually. It's also nuts the amount of variety the game has, I'm still waiting for the FPS segment I saw from the trailer. Get this.. A evolution on the first game - better graphics, better physics, better stages, and now with a nice level editor. If you liked the first game, go for it - the gameplay basics is the same, but improved, addictive and fun. And now we have the option to play on the same screen online or in Xbox live, with 2 to 4 players. The only minor downside is the soundtrack musics that sometimes are a little annoying, but nothing that spoil the fun! My score: 9,0 / 10,0.. Just WOW!. although i put down the original Trials HD sometime ago, it didn't put the slightest shadow over my eyes when i heard the Trials Evo was on its way. What an improvement (not that much improvement was required). the bottomless possibilities with the level editor and the 3 hours of fun ive already had re-playing level after level. For 1200msp Redlynx have gone above and beyond. - That Rick Guy","Trials Evolution brings more 2.5D barrel balancing, log leaping & fire dodging, motocross goodness . the metamorphosis through the years has seen improvements to both the graphics and game play, pushing the boundaries of physics, awesomeness and just plain crazy ."
294.Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned,"a superb story and bikers what could be better?Despite some difficult missions, I had real pleasure even with the disastrous driving of this GTA. After the main game this was disappointing. Characters are uninteresting and Johnny is such a weak protagonist.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 7. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 8 Music: 9 Story: 7 Total: 7.83. One of the best expansions in the history of video games. It's even better than some full games. We are part of a biker gang with many problems of all kinds inside and outside their gang. Jhonny klebitz may seem like a character a bit without charisma but he is a brother, a partner and with time you will feel inside his story. We will know the story of Johnny and how it complements that of niko and will help us understand the plot of gta iv that is even more complicated than it seemed Regarding gta iv we find new vehicles and motorcycles, this time with improved driving on motorcycles. New songs, a grainy filter to the screens that can be turned off, new trophies and achievements and mini-games among other things. He also added some news and modes to the online. The expansion is ok. For me it felt like drive from a to b and shoot kill and repeat. The draw distance is a bit improved but they also added some film grain filter.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""It's time to get serious"" I rated it 10/10 because it has everything GTA IV lacked: a coherent and consistent story and more interesting and positive characters (in the main story it felt like you are surrounded only with scumbags). The missions are much more innovative and actually hard - expect to spend up to 90 minutes only on one of them trying to complete time and time again. The cut scenes got even better, I think, and you can clearly see the improvement in the visuals. P.S. Okay, after some time I decided to lower the score down to 9 because no matter how good the DLC is it is still DLC. I think the shorter a game is the easier it is to make it fun through out the whole walkthrough. It would be unfair to rate The Lost And Damned add-on higher than GTA IV just because it is more consistent and fun. The Liberty City which was introduced in the main game and the original plot is what made it possible for this DLC to shine as bright as it did. Considering all of that to rate these games equally would be the most appropriate decision.. Set during the events of Grand Theft Auto IV, Johnny Klebitz, a big bad Biker man is taking through the mean streets of Liberty City with The Lost MC and his story says it all.. This DLC is an excellent addition to the main game. It serves as a side story to Niko Bellic's adventures and features a gritty ""Sons of Anarchy"" vibe. Fans will love the new characters, weapons and missions. In addition, there are new online multiplayer modes included on this. A must have for fans of the series.. Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned is a great expansion for the already great Grand Theft Auto IV. It tells an interesting story that runs simulataneous to the main game. Everything plays just as good, too. The addition of checkpoints also makes this even better.. One of the best story in the series. As you progress, you find out that the story is more complex than you thought. The characters are fun, but it takes a while to get used to them.. What I love about the GTA 4 DLC's is being able to look at missions at a different point of view. Lost and Damned featured a story about The Lost, a biker gang that later in the game split into two sides, those who support Johnny and those who support Billy. It delves deeply into the relationships between each person. Instead of starting at the bottom and working your way up like in every other GTA games you're already the Vice President of The Lost. My favorite mission was the last one when you fought your way through the Alderney State Correction Facility and executed Billy/ But the game did seem kind of short and their weren't too many improvements from GTA IV like graphics but I still enjoyed playing.. I know GTA IV:TLAD was a DLC but it was sort of boring. The only thing I really enjoyed were th last 3 missions. Johnny Klebeitz making off with the cash, when he was doing the deal with Niko, then having to fght a bunch a thugs for stealing the cash, then breaking into the Alderny sate correctional facilty to kill Billy. But other than that I can it.. THE BEST DLC EVER MADE...better than tbogt and even better than the original game....this dlc is more fun than gta iv or **** missions are cool and the side missions (gang wars) are AWESOM...honestly i wished that TLAD was the main game and the Niko part was a DLC. This game is really fun. There are new weapons, and there's a new story line. Its amazing. This game should have been a ballad, because it is like a ballad. Always sad. My opinion, this game is amazing and deserves better.. The start of this game is not good, however towards the end it becomes great. A slight problem is the lack of missions. There are not a lot of missions, so the game's story doesn't last as long as Gay Tony or IV.. GTA: TLAD is the most disapointing thing ever. Now just like IV the characters are the same the story makes no sense at all, when you heard that a new GTA is coming out you were thinking ""How bad can it be, it can't be worse than IV, I mean you play as a biker and do everything you did in IV"". Yeah until you played the game and it blew you're mind, no Im serious you went straight to the guy who sold you the game to get you're money back and an extra few hours that you wasted. TLAD is in fact worse than IV but its not the worst in the series, like Yoda once said ""There is another"". 2/10. Almost like a brand new game, but shorter. It seems like Rockstar never runs out of fuel when creating new settings, new characters and plots. The story holds up perfectly, even when blending into the story line of GTA4 and The Ballad of Gay Tony.. Great expansion pack to an already fantastic game. The use of intertwining roles was awesome, as well as giving the player a new look on the main games events. Low replay value but still worth the money and time.. Liked the new bike mechanics .... voice acting did great job .. story **** but dialogues are great .... Dunno why i feel that AI of gang members are stupid or weak ..... not as great as GTA 4 .. but good DLC. 10/10 = Masterpiece = This is DLC?? I could've sworn it was a new GTA game and a masterful one at that.. This isn't a bad add-on, but I really didn't get that much out of it. The story was there, but it was fast to beat and I really didn't have much attachment to the characters. I kind of just played through it and thought ""hm"" and just moved on with my life. Nothing special here.. Though it ties to the most epic game in the series of GTA it wasn't what i expected out of it. it should have been longer. I didn't really like the ending either. the story for what it was, was pretty good.","despite some difficult missions, i had real pleasure even with the disastrous driving of this game . after the main game this was disappointing. Characters are uninteresting and Johnny is such a weak protagonist . one of the best expansions in the history of video games ."
295.FIFA Soccer 12,"A bit of a buggy mess, but fun in a pinch, good with friends, and a lot of memories behind this game right here.. The pinnacle of the FIFA franchise and the best football sim I have ever played. Starting with FIFA 13, the scripting and the pay to win ruined this franchise.. FIFA 12 is the best FIFA game ever made. These so called user scores are trash. don't listen to them.. Are the best game of fifa With new features And game playing are excellent. It’s is one of the highlights of sports games and it’s great to play anytime of the day.. Great soccer game for any soccer fans! The graphics is pretty good, the gameplay is awesome, and the sound is excellent! You feel like you are at a soccer game! This game features a lot of teams (F.C Barcelona, Manchester United, etc.) and I like it very much!. Best FIFA game ever,need I say more? It has great graphics and gameplay and a spectacular career mode except for same transfers happening over and over again.. A consistent football game that feels well polished and deserves to be well received. The ultimate team mode is even stronger here and makes for a game that has multiple game modes all of which have the ability to hold our attention, FIFA 12 is the year's best football simulation game.. Fifa, Fifa, Fifa... what can i say... I think 2005 should of been the year that EA was considered a bad company instead of 2013 because they just kept MILKING and MILKING the Fifa series! its a good game, but you can get Fifa 10 and it would be nearly the same at Fifa 12. 5/10 -PandaGames. Same as the last one but with better graphics its still kicking a football and running around also you still kick a ball did i mention that yet? OH and spoilers its rubbish. EA Sports tried to make a lot of improvements on FIFA 12. Some improvements they have made they have done a good job on. But there a few problems with this game though. First the songs are atrocious I mean did they even take these songs seriously, second the referee's are worse than on FIFA 11 I just think the referee's are not very consistent when playing against a weaker team, third the tackling style ok I give credit to EA of trying something new I just think to perform a tackle on the controls feels clunky, fourth the best overall rated goalkeepers don't perform as well as they should because every finesse shot seems to go in the back of the net and fifth the Ultimate edition on Ultimate Team is awful because the free packs you get every month are just regular gold packs I mean you have a 1 out of 12 chance of getting a rare gold player in a pack, I bought this version of FIFA 12 and I never got a rare gold player in so I wasted an extra £5 on it. However, there are few things that EA have done well. On Ultimate team for the first time released a new set of Ultimate Team Cards called Team of the Season cards from each league, this was very innovated for the time and best of all after one comes out and the next one comes out you can still get the TOTS players from the previous TOTS in packs, this made it easier for gamers to earn these players in packs. The shooting and passing seemed very choppy at first until I got us to the controls and now the shooting feels a little bit more accurate. There is no over powered free kicks and headers which is good because EA are trying to make the game a bit more realistic. Overall it's not a bad game, it has a few problems and the rest of the game modes, it is up to good standards. But if you're a fan of FIFA game, it is probably worth playing.. Generally loved the game, best FIFA game I've played, I'm quite slow with the buying of FIFA 13 and the pre-order of FIFA 14, so hopefully, they bring much better things for game play. The sport of football has evolved like the game itself has, it's still stupid however that if you stay in one club for ages, you only have some useless young players with no rapid overall change, the limit of getting individual awards and the longevity of FIFA 12's Career Mode made me assume this game was a video game sport joke! The good factors were the fact that the player collisions, referee AI, player movement depending on their movement overalls and the extensions of the player's attributes have improved.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has a lot of football teams- most I've heard of some I haven't, I like this because you get to be unique and have that freedom to like a different team than everyone else. This game has a couple of downsides; slow loading and mainly THIS GAME IS TOO EASY. I've tried to changed the difficulty to hardiest and it's still too easy I'll normally win a match 9-0 every time!!! Which is not realistic at all even they said it was more realistic than FIFA 11 which it isn't. Overall, I would only recommend this game to people if they really want to win.. It's a reasonably good game, the Defensive AI has been definitely improved, and Tactical Defending and Precision Dribbling were very nice new features, as they improved the game's realism, since the defensive system and dribbling system in previous FIFA's was reminiscent of guided missiles ready to take the ball away from you, and there was little you could do about it unless you passed the ball around. However it feels like they didn't apply those features very smoothly, and some problems exist. And there are a lot of problems with the impact engine. On the graphics department everything's good, it's not a reference in terms of graphics, but it's still pretty good. Online: the servers could be a bit better, and offline the Career Mode is still poor, probably because of the attention EA Sports gave to Ultimate Team, which hasn't improved at all, somehow. PS: Momentum still seems to be present within the game in the last minutes of each part, even though EAS denies it.. This is a dull experience... too easy on world class and the com just cheats on legendary overall you have to ask yourself do you enjoy this because its fun? No theres no fun left as all you do is chase the ball and and give it away at the drop of a hat then chase the ball some more... I'm sorry folks but this is the most overrated game in history,. Fifa still doesn't succeed in offering a realistic football experience. I've been playing it since Fifa98 and I have fun doing so but that's fun as in Tekken: it is what is: PRE DEFINED ARCADE MOVES! NOT FOOTBALL WHATSOEVER.... Fifa 12 is a fun game but a 90 metascore is shocking. I play this game regularly and have fun while doing so but it is so similar to the previous games. they only added a few new features and that's it. Also the game has many small but frustrating bugs and mentally challenged referees. This installment of the fifa series deserves around a 70-75 and overall not enough new content to be called a new game its more of an upgraded fifa 11 in my opinion.. It would have been a 10 if they included LOUNGE MODE!! Otherwise its easily the best football game ever made. Defence is difficult but more realistic. Watch a football game and see how often players get tackled successfully. Its not as easy as they have made it before. Online play is awesome, and the euro dlc is slightly over priced but a good addition. All in all, every soccer fan should have this. Don't even dream of comparing to PES. FIFA and EA is in its own league.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fifa is the dingle most overrated game in the industry. It looks bad but the really bad part is the game play. It all feels very pre-defined . Football should be played fully manually instead. EA doesn't aim for a real sim i **** arcade football is not much fun imho.. Unlike game such as MW3, the team in Vancouver always tries to create something special. ALWAYS. In FIFA 12, again they have kept the ""Virtual Football Crown"" in my mind and MANY others. All the new mechanisms work, and work well. From dribbling to tackling, everything almost seems perfect with new Precision Dribbling and Player Impact Engine. New game modes are AMAZING, and you can almost never be bored of the game. You can go watch (for example) Manchester United vs Chelsea, and then go replay the game on FIFA with new challenges that come out EVERYDAY from the EA Sports team. Albeit there are many glitches (mostly freezing), FIFA 12 is a complete necessity to all football/soccer fans, players, and anywhere in between.. It's hard to believe that the overall User Score on Metacritic is a lowly 6.6 at the time of this review. FIFA '12 is approaching perfection in football (NOT soccer ;)) simulation. The increased focus on intelligent defence, combined with the requirement of actual skill to break down an opposition in attack (not simply flicking the ball up and blasting it in from 50 yards every few minutes) is refreshing. Don't get me wrong; I'm no traditional FIFA fan boy. In fact, I was quite the hardcore PES fanatic until recently. But FIFA just beats the old Konami title hands down in every single respect. Those players who are used to holding down a button and automatically charging down the ball and auto tackling will be disappointed. You have to hold your position, wait for an interception, mark players, watch for runs behind the defence... in short, you have to play football, which is a novel experience in a football game! Added to the game mechanic improvements, the DLC content is superb, the community is fantastic, the single player options are brilliant - everything works. If you have the desire to put the time in to play the game properly, you'll get rewarded. Ignore the very errant reviews on here thus far. It's a game that's difficult to imagine being improved upon, and when you play a game like that, you know you're onto a winner. I score it 9/10, simply because I don't believe I've ever played the perfect game in any genre, and I hope FIFA '13 somehow goes one step further.. It's ok, but like most people said the CPU will just be passing the ball around and takes a long time to get it back. They also tend to score last minute goals.. Absolutely great game. I don't like sports games and it's the only sports game I've ever liked. I haven't played the previous fifas but I did like this one. And both graphically and the gameplay wise it was awesome. Before I got this game I didn't really follow much soccer. But now that I've played it I've actually taking a liking to watching soccer. Whether you like soccer or not this is a great game.. Seeing what is coming up in FIFA13, I feel that certain new features could of been added / implicated with patches / DLC for FIFA12. I believe there were only 2-3 major updated for this game and sadly they did fix some issues but major issues were skipped. The game is still great and is fun to play, but for more of the hardcore players it's sad when a game doesn't have some of the most simple rules implemented for soccer and when a semi complete player engine is release without any major tweaks along they way, it leaves me saying this game could of been a lot better.. This game is absolute **** I regret spending my money on it every time I get the chance to play it because of all the **** things that happen during gameplay. First of all, lets mention the only good things about this game: Career mode and head to head. Career is fun building teams and head to head is great long as you dont get paired up with some band wagoner that only uses Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Man City, etc. Now on the BAD, and there a lot of BAD. Despite my overall enjoyment over career mode, am I the only one that noticed the most ABSURD transfers that occur during career? Its as if not a single player has loyalty, and does who do have loyalty arent any specific number of players, its at random (im refering those who deny contract offers). Example: Sergio Aguero joined Man City this season, and in more than one of the career modes I play he ALWAYS goes to Madrid or to AC Milan by the 2nd half of the 1st season. I mean, if you know about football, THIS **** MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. Another example, Juan Mata, recently bought by Chelsea, in more than one career mode he gets unsettled after just one season and gets sold always to Inter or Milan. Lets apply the logic of the game here, If you constantly play a player in your starting squad he gets happier, right? Now how THE **** does a starting LW for EVERY single Chelsea game unless he gets injured becomes unsettled and ends up leaving his RECENTLY JOINED (KEY WORD, RECENTLY JOINED) team after ONE year? That makes NO **** SENSE. These are just examples of **** that happens, and there are much more but I bet the users know what I mean (Robinho selling himself to **** teams like Wolverhampton or Catania, Man City and Inter always selling their starts after only one season, etc etc) Now onto the GAMEPLAY. Let me just start off by saying that the AI is ****, as in, there are moments in game where you make a pass to a totally open forward/midfielder that isnt offside yet mid pass he decides to go back and the pass lands beyond him. Also, whats the point of having a goalkeeper? Unless youre really good with him when you control him by hitting the back button, theres no point in having a keeper because ANY PLAYER that gets passed your defenders scores the most absurd/****tiest goals. Example : 90 minutes into extra time, enemy team gets a free kick. My keeper is an overall 90 (professional game using lyon against PSG) and Nene takes up to take the free kick. HE SLAMS A PERFECT **** KICK THAT CURVES SO FAST INTO THE NET MY KEEPER CANT REACT. Now, when it comes to tactical defending, if you just make ONE mistake or let a certain, ANY person beyond your defensive line is going to score no matter what. Moving on, lets talk about offense. oh this pisses me the **** off. Has anyone noticed that if you play on professional or higher, you spend more time chasing defenders and defending than actually attacking ? It's as if every defender channeled the 1990 World Cup Winning Germany's defense combined with todays Borussia Dortmunds defense for every single game above professional. EVERY CROSS IS BLOCKED, EVERY PASS IS INTERCEPTED, EVERY THROUGH BALL IS AN OFFSIDE, EVERY SHOT ON GOAL, NO MATTER WHAT RATING THE KEEPER HAS, IS BLOCKED, EVERY TACKLE STOPS YOU AND NOT ONLY DOES IT STOP YOU, THE BALL DIRECTLY GOES TO AN ENEMY PLAYER AFTER THE TACKLE. Also, the AI of teams you play against make PERFECT passes from RIDICULOUS angles, score ABSURD free kicks using a shot power that if you had used it it would not have turned out like the AIS kick and EVERY single shot on goal within the box is never with power and looks like a **** tap in. Also, am I the only one that noticed that EVERY SINGLE **** TEAM IN THE GAME PLAYS THE SAME **** WAY WHEN ITS PROFESSIONAL OR HIGHER? This is basically the strategy. Defenders and back midfield pass the ball between themselves, they pass it to a forward on the wing and he runs up the whole pitch hugging the sideline, once he gets closed to goal he either shoots from a **** angle or makes a cross that ALWAYS guarantees a goal because the one making a header never misses. The only times enemy forwards pass you without this strategy is when you make a mistake or the enemy team makes ridiculous through passes and spends a lot of time trying to evade you when youre defending (by a lot of time I mean a CAM running all the way back near his teams penalty box only to kick the ball away.) Speaking of kicking the ball away, I feel defenders block my shots more than the keepers. If its not blocking the shot with 3 people covering it with their bodies, they kick it away ALWAYS and keep this process up until they have possession all they way up to the midfield. TL;DR This game had potential to be the best Fifa game ever made, and just ****ed it up with its **** AI and the absurd tactics enemy teams use in higher difficulties (they only ones that actually make the game challenging, cause amateur and semi-pro: too easy.). It's the SAME DAMN THING IT IS EVERY YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND YET EVERYONE STILL BUYS IT EVERY YEAR!!!!! Footy simulation that is auto-controlled. To much focus on realism. Only thing I can say is: FAIL. Best soocer game on the planet for the options alone. Dont believe the haters buy it love it play it... the soccer plays very realistly other than in Ultimate team when playing below pro level, the defenders on the opposing side are pretty bad you can run with the ball and score pretty easy. The physics are amazing and accurate as hell.. When I first got this game, I loved it. But as you start to play it you realize just how many things are wrong with this game. The defending is absolutely horrible. If I am going to ""tactically defend"" and block pass lanes, I need my AI defender to be able to adequately defend my opponent with the ball. When you do attempt to tackle/jockey, it is incredibly difficult to time correctly, leading to your opponent running right past you. If you do tackle correctly, the ball magically bounces right into your nearest opponent's foot and the whole process starts all over. However, my biggest and must infuriating problem with this game is how it is somewhat scripted, for lack of a better word. You could take the exact same shot, in the exact same situation 10 times, and FIFA will decide you get to miss 6 of those, because apparently having a random error generator makes the game more realistic. It doesn't. If I have a good shot on goal, I expect it to go in. Also, you have a SIGNIFICANTLY better chance of scoring in the 45th minute, 90th minute, or just after you've been scored on. This leads to some absurdly terrible shots being scored, which in my mind removes the legitimacy of this game. Basically, until all that crap and more is fixed (which it likely won't be), I won't be buying another FIFA game. I also feel dirty every time I give EA my money.. FIFA 12 is a decent game if you want to play it when you have your friends over, if you want to play it online however the game is horribly broken and is filled with very flawed game design. After playing every game out of the FIFA series since the early days on PC (which featured 5 A Side), but this is definitely the last game I buy. If you play online then you can completely dominate a person in every aspect of the game, but his keeper pulls off one incredible save after another, then your opponent gets one shot on goal and the ball just roll in. In various forums this has been called ""scripted events"" which EA desperately denies is in the game, but whatever it's called - it's in there. It's noticeable in many matches, sometimes you have the advantage, and sometimes your opponent got the advantage. Those games where every single ball bounces in favor of someone and one shot on goal, no matter how bad it is, goes in. Those games where the AI of your defenders are either in the wrong position, or tackle the opponent in the penalty box, or just stop in the middle of chasing the ball resulting in your opponent getting a one on one with your goalkeeper. I don't recommend anyone buying it, and I don't recommend anyone buying FIFA 13 unless they take care of the issues mentioned above. But knowing EA they will just upgrade the graphics and leave the game design untouched, and of course throw in another mode that costs money.. Fifa 12 is a major improvement defensively from Fifa 11. 11 was a joke because you could use a heat seeking missile (A button) to take the ball from the attacking player. In 12 you have to judge when to make a tackle (if ever). Some people are complaining that you slow down when you jockey. Guess what, don't jockey! I never jockey, I only contain (A button) when the opponent is in the final third. If you have to, hold RB to double team while containing. However, you when you double team an opponent, you have to compensate that by making sure one of his buddies isn't open in the box. Also, never slide tackle or do a standing tackle in your final third. You will usually get burned. Also, for those of you who think the computer is too difficult, it has gotten more difficult than last year. This year's world class is the equivalent of legendary. However, if you practice enough, you will be able to beat legendary almost every time. Finally, for Fifa 13 Ea needs to change a few things: 1) When a person has inside position on a header, he should always be the one heading the ball. I hate when I always get inside position when I'm on defense, and the opposing offensive player morphs into me and heads the ball over me (In real soccer, jumping over an opponent to head the ball always results in a foul). 2) Fix the servers: I lose more games to them than to people actually beating me, and my latency is green, and my connection is otherwise crystal clear. 3) Fix the passing: I hate when I think of a brilliant cutting pass and press A or Y to make it, and the computer decides to pass to a less convenient teammate of the opposition.. This game has potential - but it is ruined by the unhelpful **** EA and the insane amount of scripting they put into the game. Online, the opponent gets lots of lucky deflections, your defenders act like mental cases and you can't do anything about it. The servers troll you, too. Every game that I win I get disconnected, but I am still logged in to XBL or PSN. Offline, you watch as the CPU **** you by walking through your defence, getting lucky deflections and then proceeding to cross the ball really fast to the attacker who acts like a ninja to score. But then, I tried putting CPU vs. CPU, they ****, even on the hardest difficulty! Why EA feel the need to script the game to hell I will never know. This is the worst FIFA for a LONG, LOOOONG time.. big step forward with EA SPORTS FIFA 12, which has raised the level of the game simulation. The defense tactic has been a great innovation to make realistic and fun match in defense ... the new fun and realistic dribble makes the offensive maneuver, and the slower pace of the game and makes the largest field operation simulation and much more more compelling and logical. Who voted 4 is only ONE OF PES fanboy because I genuinely am happy with the work done by Ruter on fifa 12, fifa 11 in fact I enjoyed less, fifa 12 is much more fun to play, there are actions you can make very realistic and animations, collisions, and the rest bring about so much more quality than last year. is yet another confirmation that the most realistic game of football is FIFA a few stories. CALL FOR SPORT AND DAVID RUTTER and feedback from the community to follow the Italian and English ... and continue to do so because they are on the right track ... the highest level of simulation is achieved by the feedback you read ocome but can still improve a lot, and let lose 4 pessaries fan boy because boys are just jealous of the fact that EA with FIFA 12 this year has been very successful .. painful to play while their konami did flop again! EA FIFA 13 regalaci an even better .. but on the basis of this great fifa 12.. Good game, as much as you can ask for from a year on year sports title. Good graphics, good gameplay, relaistic player movement and actions. Fun to play and online play with pro clubs is brilliant.. Great game, I have a strong bias towards it though as i am a huge football fan and a fan of the fifa franchise. Pros- Wide range of game modes Good graphics Ultimate team is incredibly addictive Could spent a seriously long time just playing in the arena Building virtual pro and playing clubs game mode Cons- Still quite flat when playing against computer, seems like a chore The collision system can fail at crucial times Steep learning curve. I'm not a huge football fan, but I've always enjoyed the FIFA games. Well, not this one... I know I'm not brilliant at football games, but they've made all AI teams practically superhuman. Scoring is virtually impossible, ""jockeying"" to defend usually results in the AI just steaming past you at 100 miles an hour, and tackling is pretty much eliminated from the game (in other words, if you try to tackle, it just doesn't do anything most of the time). I can only imagine this appealing to football/FIFA enthusiasts, because it's simply too hard. On the other hand, multiplayer becomes too simple because you just hold down ""A"" whilst the computer does the rest for you. Practically a waste of time. I regret getting this, and will be trading it in when I get the chance.. UPDATE: I've been desperately trying to give this game a chance since my last review in Oct and my frustration and disappointment has only exacerbated. To Summarise, If you literally like spending 95% of your time chasing the ball and miss-timing tackles, while the CPU cuts through your defense and makes you look like a mug, buy this game. I can see what they're trying to achieve by placing more emphasis on tactical defending (and I still like the concept), but they got the balance wrong to the extent there's virtually zero emphasis on YOUR attacking phase in single player (you wont have the ball long enough, while every shot and cross is blocked and intercepted), its **** all the fun from this game and feels like too much hard work. Yes for more depth in defending, but I mostly want to spend my time trying to score goals, not chase the ball. Its the first time I've had to destroy a disk to ensure I can't give it ""just one last go"" in the hope I've got it all wrong or decide to sell this crap to anyone on ebay. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. PES 2012 is a non starter so its back to Fifa 11 I'm afraid.. Completely gutted. This game is poor! I got it as an unwanted xmas present and initially rated it a 5. Now I've had time to play it, I'm rating it a 2. Why? I believe this game is a MASSIVE step back from previous versions of the game! The tactical defending is rubbish! Ok, you can turn it off but its so not needed! Attacking is a complete joke! You're telling me to beat defenders you have to do all these fancy flicks, twists, turns, step overs, chops etc etc again not needed! Have the devs ever watched REAL football matches.... these things rarely happen unless you're Ronaldo or Messi..... it so un realistic its untrue. And thats its downfall; they have tried to make it realstic they have actually made it unrealistic and unplayable! The controls are so sluggish and laggy too. The through ball is a joke.... it never goes to the intended target. I swear their players must have telescopic legs! Just when you think you ar through.......... NO intercepted again! Passing never reaches its intended target about 25% of the time! Shooting is a nightmere! Always goes wide or hits the bar/post whatever....... its just bad! The game is just poor! Thats another thing why are my strikers always on the half way line?? WTF?? They never push forward! Its crap! Games crap and I hate it! The last fifa game I actually bought was fifa 10 and I loved it.....this version is crap! I'll be putting this game on ebay today! Save your money, games broken!. Fifa 12 is amazing like Fifa 11, but in different ways. The new defensive game is totally new, wich cause some frustration to some people... but not to the hardcore one's... Fifa could not be the best football ever, but its way better than PES, this i can say, as one ex-PES player.. The 2012 was the year when football became boring, so it seems. I've been playing it for a few weeks and the tactical defending really ruins it and slows the pace of the game. It is not entertaining to play anymore. You just try get half of the time the ball back from CPU which predicts your every move and also plays towards his own goal frustratingly often. Also sliding tackles go through the players as they would be invisible. It is amazingly slow to shoot so about everytime you get into position of shooting CPU will just come and take the ball away from you. Oh, and it is so rare for you to get into the actual box. You just have to try to shoot from long range. Opposite taking goalkicks is slow also, the goalkeeper just keeps standing there. No more header goals it seems, since the opposite is always between you and the ball. When giving a through ball even the best runners (Ronaldo, Messi etc.) can't beat the defenders. They slow their pace to half when getting the ball and then opposite comes and end your attack. This year's Fifa was a great disappointment and I'd highly recommend to stick with the Fifa 2011 if you haven't bought this game yet. Three points for: it's football, great graphics and choosing shirt colors is better 'cause you can see the whole outfit (no more confusions between same looking whole outfits).. I have to admit that this is a beautiful game. It is a huge step compared to Fifa 11. Graphics are much much better. It all makes the game that much more realistic. But every game has its cons and Fifa 12 has several. The dribbling has been greatly improved, but they slightly overdid it. It has become far too realistic me is making it hard to keep control of the ball. The expression on the players' face is always as plain as ever. The umpire's speeches need to be more realistic. You an tell that it is fake simply because the words keep getting repeated. At first the words the umpire said were very exciting but after a while the excitement died off. There are some cons but hey, no game's perfect, right? There are far more pros than cons and I noticed that the ball's movements and bouncing are much more natural. There are added tricks in Fifa 12 as well such as the heel flick. Overall I think Fifa 12 is a fantastic game and don't forget that Fifa 13 is yet to come!. The game has a lot of improvements but Tactical Defending ruined it. Also, they're focusing only in the online part, the AI is a joke, the games are fixed, there are matches that you can't win no matter how many times you repeat it and every team plays like barca when they're in possession of the ball even if its a 1-star team, the only difference its that they wont score.. Best soocer game on the planet for the options alone. Dont believe the haters buy it love it play it... the soccer plays very realistly other than in Ultimate team when playing below pro level, the defenders on the opposing side are pretty bad you can run with the ball and score pretty easy. The physics are amazing and accurate as hell.. Was really looking forward to this game before release but I am so dissapointed. First off, i hate it when people quite the game because youre winning and is the main reason why i play h2h seasons online. I can pretty much beat every opponent i play but i've lost quite a few mainly down to lagging out. Playing against the computer is a completely different story however. I'm playing career mode on professional and it feels as ive the computer is cheating for the opposition. The computer has 1 shot during the whole game and they score off it, a 50/50 challenge goes the way of the other team and pretty much makes the game a non contact sport and it feels like the ball falls straight to the opposition. The defending is also a disgrace, you press B and the player sticks his leg out and stops completely dead, realistic right?? So many things to complain about not sure if i've remembered them all. On Fifa 11 i could beat world class but this game is so frustrating i wanna break my control. Not getting another Fifa game unless they completely change it and would advise people to stay away from this game.. Ok so where to start, graphics will always be good by EA however the game play as always is terrible in fact its boring. They have changed the tackling so you can' tackle unless you figure out you can go in to settings and use old Fifa tackling. Secondly player skills and attributes are so messed up fast players run so slow and players who have no skills in reality are doing mad skills past your players! As for online MP the game is so slow like players use energy in a few seconds. It ","starting with FIFA 13, the scripting and the pay to win ruined this franchise . this is the best game of fifa with new features And game playing are excellent . a consistent football game that feels well polished and deserves to be well received ."
296.Factorio,"Extremely addictive game. Easy to learn. SpaceAge DLC offer new playgrounds, so be prepared to spend here next thousands of hours.. Best game I ever played, sunk 2000 hours into this game till now. Now with the new expansion I think this trend will continue to onlyrise. I play games only occasionally for already 30 years as since some age my free time is filled with work, family, sports and other hobbies. Yet I found that I spent 300 hours of my precious time in the Factorio. That's how great this game is! Unfortunately :) I have followed the recommendation of my fiend and I agree with him, it is just a top 1 game of all time and very addictive.. I've put nearly 1000 hours into this, and it would absolutely be my most played game if I had found it sooner. I kinda ruined it for myself by watching so many tutorials, but I've still had an enormous amount of fun with it. Before I played this game I was addicted to corn with a p instead of a c and I had a small D, now I'm addicted to this game and don't have a D at all!. I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR SO LONG I THINK CRACK ISNT MORE ADICTIVE THAN THIS GAME SO GOOD LOVE IT. If you love automation, this will make you absolutely happy, great game. The only problem was that it felt a little bit grindy at the end where you had to create so many products that you had to refactor everything you built before or start a new factory.. Man u can get lost in this game for hours. Def better than roller coaster tycoon from windows XP. Absolutely perfect experience, just ideal mix between fighting aliens and building your factory.. Absolute favorite game of all time. Hell of funto play for thousands of hours on end!. Factorio infused the blood of the poor predecessors with heroin so that my veins could be filled with Satisfactories meth... and for that I am in debt.. Excellent game! I love industrial game. pls. creator game add iron door))). A perfect building/management sim, that has THE MOST engaging loop i've seen in a video game. The game is so addicting, that I had to force myself to stop from playing it because I haven't left my home for almost a month.. Transpor tycoon on steroids. One of the best games of the decade. I love this, my kids love this, everyone love this.. Factorio is an automation game that doesn't suffer from problems other automation games do. The game is pretty nice and layed back the automation mechanics are just grindy enough to still be fun while the game is actively enforcing you to expand factories and the combat was fun and fluid. There is not much to say about this game other than: the ""grindyness"" is balanced and construncting factories is fun.. I already have this game many years and just wanted to give my support. Still one of the best games! Automate everything! I dislike that at some point I do not want to understand it anymore with all the networking etc. And when the sources are empty... You need to start over at another please. But I can not use the networking and I can create a map with a lot of resouces, so I can play it my way!. One of the best indie games ever created, very goood. Deviously addictive.. A very good automation game, so much depth and replayability. It is amazing how much you can have fun out of this game. The only problem is bad graphics and sound design. It does not get in the way of the game so You can safely ignore most of it.. Best game ever. It changed my life for good. Even minigames of it are induvidual masterpieces.. I don't play it anymore cause I am scared my life will flash before my eyes. This is one of those games that you start and you completely forget what time it is, truly something that very few games are able to achieve.. One of the best games I have played. I spent at 100 hours before beating it. I hope they create an expansion so I can get back into it. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. the game can be very addicting and is mostly fun, however, it can get repetitive.. One of the most amazing games every created. A simple game that is so much more than it seems.. Fantastic game. Well worth the playtime invested in the game. Never felt like I wasted time playing. Its also sandbox so it allows variety and replayability which many games lack.Beginning, Middle, and Endgame all great. Never mind the cringe spam negative reviews, actual gamers don't care about politics. We just want good games.. adictiv, fun and dut dut gameplay is really impressiv becus factorio is realy god buy the game. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. perfect. -1 because not good multiplayer environment. if guest do something, it cause stuttering every time. Ideal to lose 90 hours a day somehow and learn how to **** a planet with machines and so on. it's incredible.. One of the greatest games of all time an absolute must play worth the money I would pay over £100 for this game. This is the number 1 greatest game of all time. 10/10 would be an insult to how mind-blowing this game is. all the negative reviews are just Russians review bombing.. Factorio is one of the best games I have ever played, and its hard to put into words how much i recommend this game, and I do not think that is a failure of my writing ability, but rather a testimate to how masterfully this game is designed. From its insanely impressive and consistent performance, to its incredible depth and variety in its systems, Factorio (and its eventual expansions) is something i cannot recommend enough. Sure it is not for everyone, if you didn't like playing modded minecraft when you were younger, you probably won't enjoy this, and thats okay; but if you found even the slightest bit of fun in that gameplay loop, you will find something to love in this game.. This game is nearly perfect. The only thing you have a lack of is plot. It would help to believe in game's world.. It being one of the few games of this kind, with its characteristic style and gameplay loop, make this an essential game for people who really like climate cha... i mean, automation. Fantastic game, well balanced and incredibly addictive. Well worth the purchase!. Gameplay is well optimized and interesting almost through all parts of the game. The main gameplay is in building your base to produce some technological stuff, to build a bigger base that can produce more technological stuff. Sounds simple, but you will create your own little factory with a power plant by yourself, developers give us a lot of different types of items and buildings, which you can manipulate, and optimize for building some unstoppable production. You will solve big problems in your factory such as: optimizing your resource delivery conveyor or delivering iron ore by trains, creating fire turrets for defense, or enriching uranium for a nuclear reactor. Sounds really hard to do and boring, but the game makes you feel fun from these problems and make you happy when you find some genius way to use standard things better. And this game fit well for a lot of kinds of players, from hardcore one to some lazy people which just want to chill after work. Also if you get bored from the main side of gameplay you can make a tank or car with a machine gun and just drive a little outside your base and kill some biters. And it will also help you in the main part of the game because you will spend less time defending your base from attacks. Nice optimization and interesting mechanic with pollution and biters adding into your game another side of gameplay, the part which is interesting too but not so interesting as the main part of gameplay, because we don't have a lot of weapon types and some parts are not so effective for battle as you think when you collect resources to produce them. But you can find a lot of opportunities using buildings for your battle. Actually, they probably were made without any thinking to use them in the battle directly, but it's great that you can use them effectively in it so that it will open a big window for different manipulations. One problematic time period was when my base had already grown up a little and my base was almost like spaghetti. So it was a little boring to rebuild all this stuff. So it's the biggest problem of the game. A little disappointing is the ending, I think they can make more tools for the end game era to let players feel like a god. And also I can mark one thing: the game world is endless so you can't get some happiness from your in-game tasks such as: killing all biters, researching the whole planet and etc. It looks like a good point for multiplayer or for some experienced players but I don't think so for new players it's good too. Anyway, it's a great and unique game, so I recommend it for purchase. My overall score is 8.5/10. One of the best game. Best developers! Factorio is that game what you want every moment. Вevelopers are great people with the right views on life!. The developer is russophobic and therefore is based.. The saddest game I have ever played in my life. Everything is terrible here, from the graphics of the last century to boring gameplay. I don't understand how people can waste so much time on this game. I hope it's just bots.. Easily my favourite game. Time speeds up when playing Factorio. Best game of all time.. Addictive and just amazing game! So much to do and... The factory must grow.. 11/10. This game is a drug. Please don't play it, it's addictive. Jokes aside, this game is the most fun I've had in ages. You can program basically everything. The lore, atmosphere, difficulty is just on point. It's like minecraft in a foreign planet.. Mechanic of technology tree that kinda extends playing time, but in all another aspects its greatest game that i recommend for every strategy/logistic enjoyer.. A very good game in which you can get stuck for many hours. The developers have tried and made something cool. Building these logistic chicks is fun, but it might not be for everyone. The graphics match the game, there shouldn't be anything better or prettier. This is even more difficult for a small indie studio. But it doesn't matter, the game is just as good. Everything matches each other and there is nothing superfluous.. Realy great game, nothing to complain and fun with friends. played since beta. Hope expansion will be grat too.. I just love this game. I played it over 2500 hours and still love it like the first time I have seen it on YouTube. In its core Factorio is a factory building game. It gives you easy tools like inserters which grab items and belts which move them and they can be combined in endless creative ways to build bigger and more complex factories. A big difference to other games is that you can easily build very big factories and still maintain performance and actually do research with those materials. The game has very good modding support since day one and the modding community came up with very great mods which can overhaul the game and make it more complex or easier by adding convenience functions. The factory must grow!. Created an account here just to leave a review for Facotrio. This game is well worth $30 and I think much more. There is always something to do in this game and it's one of those time travel games where you blink and it's 3am. There is always work to be done, but it always feels like it's for you and not a grind manufactured by the devs to keep you playing and working for each new unlock. It's fun building and optimizing and facing each new challenge you face with each new discovery or expansion. Very excited for the expansion!. Best game under the Sun (not sure about beyond the Sun), extremely addicting, recommended for everyone who isn't disgusted by survival games!. Is one of my favorite games: satisfying gameplay, good mechanic and challenger on right metric.. I've played this game for one minute and it's the best game I've ever played. My favorite game ever. It's definitely a niche, but for those of us in that niche, this is the greatest game ever. The game is about designing an implementing your factory. It's an incredible open ended puzzle. There are built in copy and paste functions so that building a huge factory isn't a grind. Read the developer's blog (Factorio Friday Facts) to see the level of thought and attention to detail that went into this game.. It is a **** with towerdefense mechanics in it. You're strandet on a planet and your goal is to build a rocket to survife. you start out mining coal, copper and iron per hand, fighting of the hostile fauna. You can automate EVERYTHING, automatic mining, crafting and even restocking the turrets youll need to keep youre base safe. Part of the game is growning, growing your arsenal, your base and your chars capabilties (stuff like getting little drones that fight/build for you). Its a blast espessialy with friends.. The perfect sandbox. Together with mods, you can keep yourself busy for hundreds of hours. The game is amazing and will offer you gazillion hours of playtime if you're the right person for it. Only problem I have is that the game doesn't explain half the things you need to know to make it fun. If I didn't have a friend explain it to me I sincerely doubt I would have enjoyed the game nearly as much. This game is simultaneously the best and worst thing to happen to my life ever. Gameplay: 9 Story:??? Enjoyment: (Send help). If you do not care about graphics, this game is a pure recommendation without any negatives. It takes so much time to explore the game to its fullest that you can easily have fun for hundreds of hours.. Complex and Engaging game. Start from nothing and work your way up to fully optimised factory! Lots of fun, remember THE FACTORY MUST GROW!. Brilliant game. Not everyone's cup of tea, but has plenty of depth for those looking and is basic enough on the top layer to not have to steep of a learning curve. Before you know it it's been 3 days. Well worth playing.. Factorio is the best build base game ever, Is seems ahrd but is can be pretty easy.. If you like base building and legos play this. You can be really creative with how you do things. if the games too easy you can do a death world or wave defence and really push your limits. Game can be relaxing and or stressful depending on how you play its.pretty dope. Just one of the greatest strategy/sandbox game of all time. Very hard and very addictive. Be careful: you can spend thousand hours of you life in this game.. Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.. I have many games and activities on and off Steam that I enjoy more than Factorio, but few that have ever captured me nearly as much. I absolutely love playing Factorio, and there is nothing more satisfying that finally setting up your 10th iron outpost today to get your base moving again, and seeing belts and chests piling up with resources as production meets satisfaction. Or when you finally complete that 400th solar array -or 3rd nuclear power plant- and finally stop getting the low power alerts you've had since you pasted that beaconed factory blueprint. Few activities have me looking up from the game and panicking over how much time I just spent straightening out my railroad system, and very few games ever actually make me feel successful or accomplished when I finally click quit. At this point I now have over 1,000 hours tracked on steam, and at least a few hundred before it got added to steam. I cannot possibly recommend this game enough, from so many different perspectives. The only negative thing I see people mention that I can agree with at all is how tedious it can get far into a save - but that honestly 100% comes down to how well you balance your activities of adding resources, expanding your factory, etc; once you have some more time in the game, you can balance those things much better and no tedious feelings really come up so much anymore.. This is an extremely well crafted, polished game with an addicting gameplay loop. I ""finished"" the game (main objective/ all missions/story) but due to the nature of the game I can easily play a few hundred more hours. I also like how this game can be enjoyed by casuals who finish the game via a huge belt-spaghetti mess as well as the hardcore programmer who finetuned his megabase with open excel spreadsheets, blueprints, ingame logicgates and thousands of robots alike. How you play is up to you and it feels really rewarding once you successfully solve logistic problems in your own way and seeing it come to fruition. There aren't really any negatives I could think of outside of obvious design choices, e.g. there isn't really any story to speak of other than ""you crashed on an unknown planet - build a rocket"". Creative players especially will have a blast as well as anyone who likes logical problem solving. Overall fun and hard not to recommend.. Amazing, unlike anything I have ever played. It is the definition of easy to learn impossible to master.. Best of the best of the best game in the earth! Best of the best of the best game in the earth!. Good game. Unlimited playing hours for this. You can start again and again with better experience. It is so good to create a world as you whish.. Fair warning: This game is addicting. I just realised that I've put 120+ hours into the game. It starts off slow, but when you get into it, you really can't stop. Also, as an edit, I've upgraded the score to a 10. I'm nearly 200 hours in somehow.. Great game, took me 10 hours without noticing it was already morning. if only had some kind of campaign would have been 10/10 for me.. What can I say... A masterpiece. I thought it might be some boring building game when I looked at the trailer and the previews. However when I played the demo I realized what I might've missed if I did not download the demo. Great system and design. The alien setting is important as it pushes you to find an optimal-ish solution with some kind of time limit, saving the game from a dull, endless building exercise.. Awesome game, spent over 300 hours in it, still learning. Great gameplay loop and nice graphics (not everyones favourite style but still looks great) Worth the money. genre defining. There can be no higher praise for a game than spawnign copycats to ride on its success. This game is genre defining in the best possible manner. Its simple systems stacked up to stunning complexity, you can play how you like, you can follow the herd or go your own way. An amazing amount of customisation, and full mod support for game changing experiences to keep it fresh. Its not for everyone, but if you like this kind of game, no one else does it as well as factorio.. Factorio is great. I play it in sessions each with around 50/60+ hours because if I'm in there is no escape. While I'm planning something new or doing an upgrade I find more and more things I want to improve... a never ending circle. It's horrible because after I'm finished, I don't want to play the game again for quite some time.... Unlike my social life since I found this game, the factory must grow. I've played many automation/colony builder games and there is nothing as deep and complex as this game. A single playthrough can easily be 200 - 300 hours long if you're actually trying to ""finish"" the game, but the reality is it's pretty much endless and that's before you even get into mods.. this game is such a treat. its trailers really detract from 'what' the game is- as it is difficult to communicate that, even with a video showing you the actual game. its a 2d game about strategy, planning, management, logistics, balance, and automation, all rolled into a fun symphony. and if that wasn't enough for you, there's aliens that are angry you're on their planet and will try to destroy your base. it can be very complex in its execution, and i strongly recommend having a fellow veteran player nearby to show you the ropes without crushing your creativity, as a new player will get math headaches playing this game and really thinking about it. it can be overwhelming, and this is perhaps also a slight detractor for the game, as it will only really appeal to people who want to peel back the layers and be determined to 'guess and check' so to speak. everything in the game is customizable, adding a ton of quality of life. modding is simplicity itself, and the full set of tools is available from the dev website. browsing mods is done through in-game menu, and installation is a breeze. your game-play loop is to construct a factory to build a rocket to take you back up into space, where supposedly you can be safe, or something. leave the planet. that kind of thing. and getting there depends on you. there are no 'wrong' answers in factorio, simply less efficient answers. at first, you must mine some ore and coal by hand to get your first few basic systems running. after that, you'll have hydrocarbon miners to mine ore for you as you move it to the areas it needs to be. and then soon, electronic systems take their places, automated trains, drones, and transport belts are all there to mass transport your products to the next phase of refinement. will you run a balanced factory, an overproduction factory, a highly organized alphabetic production system, or a factory that just works? it's all up to you. once your factory build starts to reach a certain point, it begins to reduce your frame-rate, but most players will never see this. you have to be producing over 1M per hour of almost every product, and have a large integrated rail system to start reaching this point. you may reach this point sooner if you have enemies enabled. (yes they can be disabled, almost anything can be disabled. its a true sandbox builder.) from a code standpoint, i have never had this game crash with its default install, and it is one of the most technically sound pieces of software i've had on my system. it barely sips your pc power, and settings are available to help it run on systems with lower specifications. like if you use a laptop for travel, factorio can give you some diversion without destroying your wallet. worth every dollar.. Best automatisation game and best base-building simulator. This game need to be game of the year 2020!. top of top!!!!! Best game!!!!!! Awesome game!!!!! The best i have ever played!!!!!. The game copes with its task - to be a realistic enterprise construction simulator. Good optimization, nice graphics and great sound!. i only have on issue with the game which is being a time machine i start playing friday morning and then it is monday.. Incredible game, for specific type of players. You can spends thousands of hours on this game even though it seems simple at the first glance. Finding a way to make all things automatically is simple enough. but scaling it up or making it more efficient? It's HARD. You will always tear down you base because something is not optimal or right, or you will just start over. Mods are perfect way to spice things up when the Vanilla gets stale. Just like with the other indie games: Rimworld, Terraria, **** Valley, the community of modders is excellent.. The only problem with Factorio is that it doesn't come with free therapy sessions to cure crippling addiction to it. This game deserves every 10/10. One of the best strategic/logical experience for many years. The best sandbox game ever made. I spent over 500 hours in the game and I love it.. 80 hours on record, Factory must grow!!! Masterpiece of build and management strategy games.. After some 500+ hours in game since some v0.15, i can confidently say this almost certainly my most favourite game. I'd like to note that this is absolutely not everyone's cup of tea. Rather than reading the reviews and saying ""yeah, 9.3 user score, must be really good, instant buy"", don't. Play the free demo, see some game play videos first, see **** like this is your cup of tea, because for many it really isn't. That being said, if you love these sorts of simulation games where you build a massive base and love logistic nightmares, this game is for you. The base game alone is already enough for hundreds of hours, and there are plenty of mods to add or change parts of the game. The dev team is also really dedicated and has amazing relations with the community, and has quite a bit of commitment to the game.. Started playing Factorio whoops- another 12 hours gone and i love it! it has been years since i last had this feeling with a game!. Just couldn't get into it. Seemed like there was a lack of something to care about it this game. I loved Prison Architect because I was actually feeling like I was caring for or torturing something. This game was just boring for me and with 0 effort put into graphics it could not possibly be a 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I added Factorio on my Steam wish list a few years ago. Typically I'll wait until games go on sale and almost never pay full price. About a year ago, a coworker of mine convinced me I needed to go ahead and buy the game at full price even in early access and give it a try. Let me tell you, that was a great decision. A couple dozen hours in, I was hooked. 300+ hours in, I'm breath taken. This is a game I will be able to pick up over and over again over the years and re-play. There are always different ways to build, and different mods to try. This is my first written review on Metacritic. I did it just for Factorio. Looking back, this game has been worth hundreds of dollars of enjoyment to me. The least I could do is give them a good review since they have now entered full release. Give this game a try, and enough time to learn the mechanics, and you will quickly learn why the factory must grow.. Fantastic indie game inspired by minecraft. Don't let the pixelated graphics fool you, this game is one of the most fun and in depth works of art you will ever play. There is always something fun and interesting that needs doing, this game really pushes you to become more creative and innovative with your factory management and is hands down one of the best indie games I have ever played AND it has multiplayer. YOU ARE MISSING OUT IF YOU DONT PLAY THIS ABSOLUTE GEM!!. This is a superb game about automation that paved the way for other titles like satisfactory, with some tower defense bits. In it, your objective is to build a rocket, and for that you will place assembly machines to automate the manufactory of increasingly complicated itens, research resources and defenses for keeping aliens away as your factory expands, until it's suddenly 3am. It has carefully crafted sprites and it's aesthetic is excellent even being a 2D game, it is opotimized to a degree where even the largest factories, called megabases, will hardly push the game below 60 UPS, and some bases get really enormous, given the maps are infinite and procedurally generated. Also, if you start to think it's too easy, go ahead and slap in some mods until you need a trello board to remember wtf you were doing, the game has a really good mod suppot and community that it will be hard to not have new stuff to automate.. Really great game with complete modding support and crazy game optimization for HUGE factories. I reserve 10's for the best of the best and I considered it. Logistic simulation gone mental. Graphics are crazy bad, but that is not why I play. I play to build. Ever see Fraggle Rock as a kid? Those little dudes that keep building and you don't know why? This is worse.. I'm embarrassed about how many hours i have logged on this game on steam. Lets put it that way and leave it at that. Absolute 10/10 that needs to be played to be truly understood.. This is one of my favorite games ever, I don't even know how to review it, because it's just too perfect in it's genre. It's so perfect that this game should be placed as the Standard of engineering games in International Bureau of Weights and Measures.. Very impressive and interesting game. It is really not for everybody and can get a bit tedious and exhausting. But you will probably go back after a break... It's very hard to let go.. Even though I like few automation based games - I didn't like this one tbh. I know why some people would find it great/excellent, but it's just not for everyone. It felt quite boring and unrewarding in my opinion.. I could write a long review about how great game this is, but I don't want to waste your time. It's time you could spend playing Factorio.. I have been using metacritic for a decade, and never wrote a review. I just signed up to give Factorio a 10. This game made me belive in videogames again.. ""After 8 years in development, hopefully it'll be worth the wait"" It was. Also, hey hey people. Incredible game, best in in genre. Only 'negative' is no matter how many hours you have you always feel dumb.. It makes so much fun to me. To see your Industry grow and expand and fight against the agressive aliens. Love it. All good if you want an indie game to be for 2000000000 hours and if you want to think of new ways to do everything without doubts 10/10. I could write a long review about how great game this is, but I don't want to waste your time. It's time you could spend playing Factorio.. Nice sandbox. Bought it after 5 min of demo version. Build, plan and automate you factory. Then automate your automated factory again.. This game is great, very well crafted and innovative. You can sink hundreds of hours in this game and it never gets boring. Congratulations.. Fantastic game! 8 years of developing and an active community. 350 hours of playing and i loving it. Played hundreds of hours of this game. There is nothing quite like it, it's almost it's own genre. There is no clear winning or losing, you play at whatever difficult you want at your own pace and just have fun.. 500+ hours in, i absolutely love this game. Currently waiting for my favorite mods to get updated to version 1.0 then i'll build another gigafactory.. This game is a time machine - you start playing, then suddenly it's 5AM and you have to go to work in a couple of hours. Avoid at all costs if you won't be able to handle endless dreams about conveyor belts carrying coal.. This game is all about automation, and in it, it was perfect. Pleasant graphics, awesome game-play, good replay potential, full mod support. Looks like legendary game for years.. Interesting game, you cand spend hpurs creating building optimising and killing creeps. Amazing game for those who like to engineer, optimize, or play a game which has very responsive developers. The mods can add thousands (yes!) of extra hours of game play through addition of new recipes and new goals.. One of the best games ever made, this game was almost unique in its genre when it came out, it executed it's idea extremely well, the game has almost no bugs, no issues. The modding community is extremely good, letting you customize the game to fit every need you might have, either giving you more tools to accomplish the tasks the game sets before you, or making the game ten times harder. Altough the graphics style might not be for everyone, it personally find the sprites extremely beautiful, and some of the things you find on mods surpass even vanilla.. I have almost 400 hours of playing time and still play. I love this game and recommend it to everyone!.","i've put nearly 1000 hours into this game and it is just a top 1 game of all time . if you love automation, this will make you absolutely happy, great game . a perfect building/management sim, that has THE MOST engaging loop i've seen ."
297.NBA Street Vol. 2,"In my opinion, the best sports game of the golden **** mechanics were easy to learn, yet presented a challenge to **** story mode provided hours upon hours of gameplay, and the game itself was a fantastic homage to street basketball at the time. This is a game that I repeatedly see talked about to this day. The fact that it's held up to this level in the year 2024 is proof of the fact that this is an all time great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. dirtyslobber And I thought you weren't suppose to give it a negative review like an idiot. Your review ****. and ThomasM, you **** at games and at life. Losers.. To be fair, I think this game was a major upgrade over the original. But I feel if EA is going to make another NBA Street game in the future, here are some things they seriously need to address. First things first, I had to turn Bobbito's commentary off. He just got way too annoying. And look, I never expected this game to be super realistic, but I don't think the folks in charge of the players' ratings did enough homework on most of their skillsets. Your AI teammates are kinda dumb/lazy because they don't get back on defense, which for the opponents, is an easy basket at the other end. I don't like preset heights and weights for your created players, their outfits and hair were trash, and the teams needed more than 5 players. 8 would have been perfect. The courts were boring; too many in New York. And why put the only court in L.A. indoors, while putting a court on the beach in Chicago? Makes no sense. The street legends (Stretch, Biggie Little, Dime, Nelly, etc.) are almost useless because they are either too small or too weak. (Hello, you're going up against NBA players!) I hate the random dunks and layups; makes it too easy to get blocked. I also don't like how your dunks can constantly get blocked by guys who can't even dunk themselves, especially on the off-the-backboard dunks. Oh, and the computer gets WAY too many cheap shots and cheap steals to keep the game close, which almost makes the trick moves and goaltending useless. If you really want to play to win, you're actually better off turning the gamebreakers off and playing more fundamentally sound basketball. Otherwise, I do think it is a very fun game, especially for kids or for casual basketball fans. I just wish it had more substance to go with the style.. Real, Street ball. Amazing commentary while you play, funny as hell and smooth gameplay. I had a blast with this game in the past and recently too!. This is the only arcade-style basketball game I ever owned and it's a pure delight. The colorful funky art style is visually appealing and the superstar filled roster is fantastic. There is plenty of content to unlock and numerous famous arenas to play in. Overall, this is a great title for die hard b-ball fans. It's also the best in the series. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. The best NBA Street game and also the best arcade basketball game period. The roster, the legends, the characters, this game has everything you are looking for. Wish they kept it like this instead of what they decided to do in the future.. Great game. The way basketball should be played. Controls are spot on. Ea Big was great but the department was shut down sadly. Soundtrack was not good. Even so one of the best basketball games money can buy.. ""EA SPORTS!!! BIIIG!!!!!"" I LOVE THIS GAME! Best sports game ever!. I really like this game a lot. I guess if you like basketball but in a less serious fashion like NBA, but more street basketball, then this is a great buy. I still play it every once in a while. The only thing i don't like is the glitch that appears every time I play now that doesn't allow me to get the full amount of points. But over than that, its a pretty good game.","the game itself was a fantastic homage to street basketball at the time . if EA is going to make another NBA Street game in the future, here are some things they seriously need to address . i hate the random dunks and layups; makes it too easy to get blocked ."
298.Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando,"An objective improvement on everything that the 1st game so great. Ratchet's design here isn't the best though.. The Best Game in the series. Gameplay 11/10 (level design, weapons, combat, gadgets, paths, bonus areas, arenas, races, grindrails, spaceship combat, bosses, replayability, enemy diversity, etc.) Presentation, Mood and Character 10/10 (Graphics, soundtrack, lines, jokes, etc.) Story 10/10 (Plot, Heroes Villains, NPCs, character development, etc.). Music, atmosphere, story, combat, weapons, anything Ratchet and Clank did, Going Commando did better. Aside from still sticking to a formulaic design of going from planet to planet, and an enemy difficultly spike near the end of the game; Going Commando proves that some games just need a sequel to truly shiny.. Insomniac games lernt from their mistakes in the first game delivered one of the best sequels just one year later. The improves on almost everything the first title had to offer. It’s a more challenging and mature game overall.. while the gameplay is refined, some major aspects of the game were worsened. ratchet feels better to control, the weapons feel great and also mostly useful. progression feels meaningful and rewarding. yet towards the last third of the game, enemies spawn at a much higher rate, turn into bullet sponges, making the whole experience feel tedious and unfair. the boss battles are mostly lacking too: either too long, too bulllet spongy or just not fun at all. in my opinion, this one is a step down from the first one, despite doing so many things right. i remember this game fondly as a kid, but sadly it doesn't hold up that well. the controls are super clunky, and far more refined in the 3rd game as well as deadlocked.. Take off your undergarments it's time to lombax! What happens when you take everything that made your first game successful and ... make it better? This happens. Weapon levelling system to incentivise using all the amazing weapons this game has to offer, a new health system that scales on how strong your enemies are, armour, raritanium, new amazing gadgets and relatively bearable clank missions. The new game plus mode which the series has became famous for is taken to a new level where you can purchase upgraded versions of your weapons if you've maxed their level. The difficulty jump is rewarded with a bolt multiplier incentivising more strategic gunning gameplay to upgrade your weapons as fast as possible. Introduces the arena and the 101 collectible quest which became staples in future games, this game set the standard for action platformers that no-one has been able to match since.. Pretty good game where you would like to come back very often. The only minus - sometimes R&C 2 becomes too difficult.. i persoanlly didnt like this ratchet and clank im going oer pros and con. There are some stuff i liked and alot i didnt like . cons first cons 1. way too much backtracking (going back to previous planets for progression missions) 2. annoying puzzles ( electrical circuits) 3. annoying camera and aiming mechanics 4. some terrible mini mission segments ( ship vs hover turrets that will keep on respawning) 5 forgetable crap story ( terrible edition / new characters) 6. bullet sponge bosses 7. weapons XP progression/ upgrade is slow 8. have to enter to menu to switch btw gadgets over instead of their bieng a 2nd or third investory wheel. 9. fetch questing areas. The best Ratchet game. Other entries don't come close to the weapon and gameplay variety.. Considerably harder than the first Ratchet and Clank. However, it's still great fun.. Ratchet & Clank 2: Going Commando is a 2003 3D platform video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2.. PROS: - Introduced many mechanics that mecame staples in the series like; Weapon, armor and Nanotech upgrades. Flying sections, strafing and arena style combat. All of these are wonderful additions, but i am particularly fond of arena combat. - The OST is still fantastic. I do belive the first has more memorable tunes, but GC still has many, many catchy themes. -Wonderful and exotic worlds, favorites of mine include: Todano, Boldan, Damosel, Maktar Resort, Endako, Tabora and many more! - Not too easy, but not too hard either. - R.Y.N.O II is THE BEST! - Carbonox Armor looks so badass! - Clank sections includes new Gadgebots and i love em! - Thugs-4-Less went on to become one of my top ten favorite video game enemies. - Hooverbike is so much more fun than Hooverboard, albeit abit simpler, but whatevs. ­CONS: - The flying sections can be quite annoying until you get access to Ship upgrades. - Little backtracking compared to the previous game. - Have very few memorable Boss Battles. Going Commando is a fantastic RaC games and one of my personal Favorite Four in the whole franchise. It has a few shortcomings, but none of them are much of a bother to me.. ""Going Commando"" is one of those bigger sequels that happen to be better. The game refines and builds upon the formula of its predecessor. It's an improvement in every way. Featuring several upgradeable wacky weapons and brilliant level design, the game is a pure delight. While the difficulty has been ramped up, it never gets frustrating like ""Jak II"". If you liked the first ""Ratchet"", you'll love certainly love this. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 8 Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 7 Fun Factor : 10 Environment interaction : 5 Sound effects : 10 Overall Immersion : 8 There's no such thing as a perfect game. Another great game, which saved level of quality from the first game. 10/10 again.. This is the game that got me in to the series. A almost perfect game. If you like the other games you have to play this. Particularly if you like the third one.. Going commando, one of the best R&C games if not the best in the whole series in my opinion, the style of the levels, the enemies, the weapons, the dialogues, the characters, everything feels so unique, a good game nonetheless.. Really good game. I can play it over and over again, but it's in my opinion a little bit weaker than the first game.. Fortunately, controls are far more responsive. Once again, awesome weaponry, great soundtrack and interesting planets (Tabora is a blast to play through, Grelbin not so much...). This is the RATCHET & CLANK game that started the formula and it is the worst in the mainline series, The story is kind of painful to watch because you thought they were smarter than that in the original game But no they have chosen that painful story to tell. , The game has gotten a lot more painful to play because in the original game even the starting pistol were still useful in the endgame but now it's completely useless in the end game, Is actually felt like work just to get through it But I had to do it to see if I had played all the way and clean games in the mainline series, I will never play this game again. this was my first game in my life and now i'm almost 17 and i still love it. Ratchet and Clank is one of these Games that are so original, you can play them for hours and they never get boring because they offer so much different gameplay and an interesting World + Characters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Solid platformer for PS2. Recommend this for anyone that has played Crash or Jak and Daxter!. I don't think it's possible to express in words how wonderful this game is. Not only do I consider this game to be the best 3D Platform Game of all time, but I even consider it to be one of the most beautiful video games ever made. Everything is perfect in this game, and even today, i still can't find a single flaw in it. The soundtrack is to say the least great, the environments and the planets are beautiful and varied, the variety of gadgets in this game is unique and each gadget is completely different from the other so offering the player always a fresh experience with regard to the excellent gameplay of this game that is never monotonous or repetitive and if that wasn't enough everything is compensated by original and charismatic characters that serve as a story always set at a good pace (for what concerns the Platform games). As I said, in my opinion this is seriously one of the best video games ever and deserves the highest score.. After the masterful follow up that Insomniac has done with Ratchet and Clank’s first adventure, Going Commando is an impressive upgrade over the first and it’s incredible as you play it.. This game is platforming bullet shooting code cracking hover racing spaceship flying brilliance, the storyline is fantastic and keeps you interested throughout. The controls are perfect, complex but once you master it the game becomes even more fun. There is a weapon upgrade system all the way through the game and also vendors where you can purchase new guns and gadgets. Honestly I have read this game is so much better than the first one numerous time’s but nothing prepared me for just how much better is would be. I just finished the game today and I think before I play the 3rd one I’ll play through this again. Note that I was playing this on the original console and not the trilogy edition that’s now available on newer systems. Honestly one of the best games ever made.. The first one was amazing but this is far from amazing, this game is a masterpiece it's a gem The 2nd best ratchet and clank game after UYA. Almost every bit as good as the original, this one focuses more on a shooting and basically adds rpg elements that let you level up your weapons making the whole process even more satysfying, but at the same time it sacrifices bits of platforming action. There is so much content here its crazy, but I think levels from the first one were more memorable overall. Going commando introduces the kind of grinding levels, bascially a whole lot of boring space just to look for stuff that gets you a lot of money, which is kind of a time waster.. Sequel at the same level of the first game. In my opinion it still does not live up to the competition of jak and daxter.. 9.5 out of 10 - One of my favourite games of all time and my favourite in this series just beating out Up Your Arsenal. Scoring Scale: 1 - (AWFUL) Among the worst games ever made. The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.. Being the second game in the series, Going Commando fixes a lot of the original's mistakes. Even still some changes are kind of strange. The Good: Ratchet is given a much needed overhaul to his character and is now a somewhat friendly, more professional Ratchet, but he does still have some immaturity from the original. In fact I actually enjoyed all of the characters in this game. I found the Thugs-4-Less guys to especially hilarious. Weapons in this game have much more of a variety in this game and there are more of them. My favorite of which is the Chopper where you throw ninja stars and they ricochet everywhere (very satisfying and flashy). The weapons also can be upgraded in this game by killing enemies. (Upgrading in this game basically gives you a new more powerful version of the original.) Not only that, but now you can add modifications to your weapons. Also, you can buy a few weapons from the original (mostly the ones that doesn't have a similar weapon in GC. For e.x. you can't buy the Blaster because of the Lancer). The weapons that you bought in the original are free as long as you have the game saved to the same memory card. Clank moves much faster in this game and the puzzles don't really slow down the game mostly because of the new gimmicky robot helpers. You can have much more health in this game with maximum of 75 (I believe) versus 8 in the original. Strafing also now thankfully exists. And the OST has much more of a variety to it this time around. The Bad: The Hoverbike races try to feel like there own game versus the simplistic feeling of the Hoverboard races. Which somehow makes it feel less because it isn't good enough to be sold on it's own. There are many more ship battles which I don't think I've liked in any game not just R&C. The planets' globes mostly all look the same and similar to Earth's actual globe. The Hoverbomb Gun doesn't really work properly. You're supposed to hold O to move Hoverbomb, but without it going into first person it just feels awkward. It actually sort of reminds me of the 2nd player in the Shadow the Hedgehog video game. But, my least favorite weapon has to be the Lava Gun. The Lava Gun has a very generic name (compared to everything else) and it is very weak and the range didn't really work for me. I tried to upgrade it to the Meteor Gun (to see if it was any better), but it didn't upgrade fast enough for me and it just wasn't really fun/easy to use. So, I gave up on it. It also seems as though the original game's weapons were made weaker in this game. That could just be that the enemies are harder because you can upgrade weapons in this game, but I don't really know. The puzzles were actually pretty confusing/annoying. I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it.. Okay, so take the almost perfect game that is the original Ratchet & Clank, and times it by 1000 and boom you have Ratchet & Clank Going Commando. This game was direly renamed in the UK to ""Ratchet and Clank 2: Locked and Loaded"", but I simply refuse to call it by that. This is a very well put together, humorous game (much like the previous installment) and has tons of neat little things about it and a good element of re-playability. In-jokes, funny dialogue and a few references to other games such as Jak and Daxter give this game a comic edge that keeps you interested. It must be said that the references can only be really appreciated by people that have actually played the games they are spoofing.... Better than the first in every way. Weapons are creative and level design are well thought out. I have recently fired up the old ratchet and clank games, that i grew up with in my childhood. This one i must say is my personal favorite. It does not overdo it with weapon upgrades (Ratchet & Clank 3 was still acceptable but deadlocked was just too much levels) and the second play through using the new game plus mode is very satisfying. This game ages very well if using a 4k Monitor and the state of the art PCSX2 version 1.5 (Dev version), It supports rendering the game at 4k and all textures look amazing compared to the 480p that the original console puts out. I think its fair to say that if your looking into experiencing a classic gem like this one, do not use an original console and rather use an emulator. It looks much better and can even compete very much with the ps3 version of the game.. After the original Ratchet and Clank was a brilliant game, there was bound to be a sequel. Ratchet and Clank 2: Locked and Loaded (Going Commando in US) is not only the best game on the PlayStation 2, it's the best game ever made. The story continues from the first game, and you start the game working for Abercrombie Fizzwidget, trying to kill the Thugs-4-Less crew and stop the production of deadly but cute creatures called Protopets. The whole campaign is full of great humour and funny moments, Captain Qwark being particularly the funniest character. You start on cool weapons that become even cooler by upgrades, turning them into more powerful weapons with 'Heavy' put in front of their name. (Lancer becomes Heavy Lancer) Once you finish the game, you can buy even more powerful versions of your weapons with 'Mega' or 'Ultra' put in front of their name. The game is generally challenging, but not in a frustrating way. You actually know that you failed for a reason (unlike Flappy Bird) and can try again to get better. For the time (2003), the graphics look very good (better than the first) and look even better in the recently released Ratchet and Clank Trilogy. The sound effects are fun and memorable, and the same goes for the excellent music soundtrack. There is an area in the game, Planet Joba, which has Megacorp Games, a place where you face off against waves of enemies and bosses, under certain restrictions. Another area has Hoverbike Racing to take part in. Both of these areas are great fun, and they control very well too (just like the rest of the game). Several segments of the game have you playing as Clank, Ratchet's robot companion. In his missions, you do more of the same platforming that Ratchet does, but certain doors or jump pads require help from other robot friends you find throughout his missions. After you complete all objectives on Planet Dobbo, a small teleporter to a battle will unlock, where you play as a massive Clank trying to destroy a massive version of a boss. Other sections include spaceship battles, where you get to a new area, but have to fight off the enemy forces in flight. All planets are available to explore at any time during the game. You can also customise your ship at Slim Cognito's Ship Shack, where you can give your ship a different nose model or change the style of paint on it. Once you complete the game, you can do it again in Challenge Mode, where you go through the game as normal, but you keep all of your weapons and have the ability to buy Mega and Ultra weapons, as mentioned before. All weapons are very creative, including one that turns enemies into sheep. You always have your signature wrench. My favourite weapon is also the most overpowered one, the RYNO 2. Puzzles are a chunk of the game too, and they're quite frustrating but very satisfying and fun. There are a few Easter Eggs as well, the most noticeable one being Ratchet playing the first Ratchet and Clank game on the start screen, while Clank reads a book. However, there is another secret which is a button code for a demo of Sly Cooper. Overall, Ratchet and Clank 2: Locked and Loaded/Going Commando is the best game of the 2000s, the best game on the PS2, and most importantly, the best game ever made (in my opinion). It has an entertaining story, great controls and gameplay, good graphics, funny humour and characters, plenty of reasons to finish it a second time in Challenge Mode, and tons of things to do besides the main story.. Much improved gameplay mechanics compared to the first game but weird story, really annoying space battles and boring weapons. Weapons from the first game were absolutely useless and even some new ones were quite weak and boring to use. Still a great game tho!. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando is one of top ten best games of all time, and it serves a testament to how sometimes adding more and refining your flaws from the previous entry can make a sequel work phenomenally. This is the case for this game. Taking place in a new galaxy, new characters and a even better combat system, RAC:GC capitalizes on delivering more and having more memorable moments. Considering it came a year after the first game, it really makes a argument on how impressive games can be when dev time is so little and make so much work by only fixing and adding to its formula. Only criticism that I have for GC is the ease of difficulty that makes engagements far too easy once you become overpowered. Considering difficulty is the only main issue, RAC:GC is able to come out with a master work of platforming and fun that makes the duo go through another great adventure and solidify their friendship.. The first Ratchet and Clank game was a beauty that folks were unsure Insomniac would be able to top. Then Going Commando came out and blew everybody's minds. It does everything the first did, but better, and with more. As well as fixes some of the issues the original had. The game now pauses when using the weapon wheel, so you're not open to cheap shots while switching weapons. Ratchet's double jump feels a lot more acrobatic and carries a lot more momentum than it did in the first game. Both Ratchet and the camera move a lot quicker this time around so everything is just so much smoother now. And the real godsend among all of these improvements is the implementation of straving. Graphically it's improved too. With bigger worlds and a more bombastic soundtrack. Enemies have also been beefed up, but it's okay because so have your weapons. They're much bigger, louder, and more destructive than the first game could ever hope to be. And you have more of them too! And if you have an R&C1 save, you get a few of the weapons from the first game for free, which is a sweet bonus. But I'm not done yet. Insomniac threw in some RPG elements which now allows you to gain experience with every kill so you can upgrade your health and weapons to be able to consistently stand up to the enemies which grow tougher and tougher with every planet. And there are a lot of planets in this game. When weapons upgrade, their destructive power can become beyond comprehension, and using the platinum bolts that are scattered throughout the levels, you can mod them. That way they can effectively cause damage in more ways than one. By half way through the third act of this game, you feel like a badass leaving a trail of smoldering hot wreckage in your wake wherever you go. There are around four major difficulty spikes at major parts points in the game that if noobs don't buy armor, they're gonna find difficult to handle. Of course if you feel tough, you can prove your manhood by attempting a no-armor run. Mad respect if you accomplish said feat. The gadgets make a return too and do just as good of a job at mixing up gameplay as they did in Ratchet and Clank 1. Also making an appearance in this game is what Insomniac calls ""maxi games"" they're like mini games. Only on a scale that's anything but mini. You got adrenaline pumped hoverbike racing, intense spaceship battles which you can trick out your ride to perform better and better in, giant Clank sections which were also in R&C1 in which you can duke it out with gigantic bosses, and grueling arena battles which throw wave after wave of enemies for you to mercilessly slaughter to your heart's content. All of these award you more bolts to buy more stuff to make yourself that much more destructive. Everything in this game feels like it's on such a huge scale, and there's just so much to do in it. Throw in the more puzzle / strategy based Clank sections and glider sections along with the two sandbox worlds and all the other things the game offers for you to do, and you have a package that is practically bursting at the seems with content. And it doesn't even stop there because in Challenge Mode (new game plus) you can purchase mega versions of your upgraded weapons so you can upgrade them AGAIN to make them EVEN MORE devastating against the enemies that now in challenge mode are EVEN MORE vicious! The game is unrelenting in throwing every single little thing it has at you, and if you manage to complete it 100% it has one of the sweetest bonus features ever. The Insomniac Museum, in which you can view and play around with cut content from the first and second game, as well as learn a thing or two about their development cycle. You can even access the testing level, like how sweet is all of this?! Insomniac set the bar with Ratchet and Clank, and then proceeded to shatter that bar with Going Commando in a way few sequels are able to do. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando is a game with so much content, so much replay value, as well as a story, (holy **** I forgot to mention the story) that twists and turns quite a few times and actually throws you for a few loops, which is more than I can say for R&C1. And with more characters that play bigger more involved roles, returning favorites, your feel like your a part of something bigger the whole time. The writing is witty with a focus on comedy. It comes out to be quite the biting satire on consumerism which the early R&C games eventually become known for. With all of these things packed on one singular DVD, Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando is guaranteed to rip you a new one. 10/10. Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando is a action-adventure platform videogame, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Creative Weapons + Fun Gameplay + Variety Gameplay + Character and Weapons Progression. The best game ever, awesome RPG elements, fantastic humor, great and varied weapons, perfect controls, awesome graphics, great level design, and amazing music. **** ReCore. That average shooter/platformer is nowhere near as good as this masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Im speechless about this game, this is a huge touchdown, im glad this sequel had more to offer,the gameplay was extremely difficult and it was very fun,. I had a lot of fun with this game, but I couldn't get into it as much as I did other PS2 classics like the Jak and Daxter games. Still a great game up there with the best of it's generation.. Can't decide which is better this one or 3. This being the more original one with the most new ideas I'll have to give it to this one. The games are just fun they aren't attempting to be ultra realistic or ground breaking there main focus is for the player to have a good time with the great humour, colourful graphics, array of weapons and mini games in the world.. The second instalment of the Ratchet and Clank series manages to even improve on its awesome predecessor. The game adds the vital abilities to strafe and upgrade weapons, innovations that would go on to dominate the gameplay of Ratchet and Clank games to come for years. Whilst the story isn't quite as gripping, it's improved gameplay is impossible to ignore.. I have poured numerous amounts of hours into this game, from the day I got it on christmas eve 2003. This game is perfection, I stand by that this is still my favourite Ratchet and clank game and even my favourite PS2 game ever. The planets, the characters, the story line is absolutely perfect, I owe a huge well done to James Arnold Taylor, he plays the voice of Ratchet and did and absolutely brilliant job at it. I'm giving this game a 10. I'd like to point out I'm not simply giving this game a 10 purely because of notalgia, I'm giving this game a 10 because it still stands up to this day. I still play through the campaign every now and then, probably more than I did as a kid. It's simply a beautiful game. Going Commando is just pure destructive platforming fun with cool weapons, enjoyable puzzles and great originality. It's also full of fun humor. I wouldn't recommend this to younger players, though, because it's actually a difficult game. I wish checkpoints and save points were a lot more frequent. And the spaceship battles ****. Otherwise, a great effort.. It actually took me a while to come up with the words necessary to describe my feelings for this game. How about this: ""It's my favorite game of all time."" Yeah, that'll do. All joking aside, oh my good god this game is something else. Literally everything wrong with its predecessor has been reworked into something truly beautiful. The guns are some of the best that this series has seen yet (and as a series with a heavy emphasis on gunplay, that's saying something). One of the best parts is that the best weapons aren't your ""typical"" weapons. An issue with a lot of Ratchet games is that the most efficient weapons are ones that draw parallels to real life guns, like rocket launchers, machine guns, shotguns, and what-have-you. Ratchet and Clank 2 doesn't suffer from this issue; while those weapons are there, they can't hold a candle to the weapons you get later in the game, like a glove that throws out automated turrets that fire lasers at enemies, a gun that fires out a searing hot ball of plasma that shocks nearby enemies and explodes upon impact, a gun that shoots out molten lava, a grenade launcher which launches one large bomb that explodes and releases tons of smaller bombs; so many creative ideas for weapons, it's ridiculous. As well as regular gunplay, there's also bike racing (which is like Mario Kart except fun), space combat (with numerous missions and excellent controls, as well as an upgradable ship), and Clank levels (where you send your robot companion Clank through short RTS-like levels). The presentation is excellent, too, featuring memorable levels like a space casino, a warehouse floating in the sky, a weapons factory overrun with mutant squirrels, and a chemical factory, and a delightful soundtrack that has many different genres of music to it.. This game did what a sequel should do... Improve on everything. It has better graphics, better gameplay and a better story. If you liked the first game, then your going to love this one. If you didn't like the first one, then you might not like this one that much since even with all it's improvements, it's still just more of the same.. Everything that Ratchet & Clank did, Going Commando does better, and the tweaks and additions just goes higher. Shooting with crazy weapons have never felt so awesome.. This might be the best game ever made if you love 3rd person platforming. The soul of this game can only be beat by the first game. I think I've never pun more hours in to any other game I've ever played and it sure is the golden gem of the Ps2 area.. My childhood favorite game I miss playing it but i'm to old for it known at least.Very good game its one of those where no matter what age you are you will enjoy it.. I think, that the game is great, but it isn't the best Ratchet & Clank game. Gameplay, the controls and weapons are better, than in a predecessor. The levels aren't as creative as in Ratchet & Clank (1), and themes of levels are not very variable. The plot is great and has good comedy in it. Characters are wacky, but in the original R&C, the characters were better developed. A very good sequel and it deserves the praise it has.. A perfect example of how a sequel should be. BOSS.. The gameplay is masterful and the story is as good as the original. This is simply a great game that all ps2 owners should experience.. I Love it! the weapons the gadgets, the arena battles everything!. Words can not express on how amazing this game is. One of the best OST's in gaming. Creative futuristic weapons and great characters. A great bonus re-play ability after you beat the game too.. The game has much more content added compared to the first game and has great gameplay and story. The game has a unique weapon upgrade system where you can upgrade your weapons and armor making you want to try and upgrade everything. There is a lot of hidden content in the game too. After you beat the game, you can replay the game and buy more advanced weapons. Over all the game is a unique experience everyone should try out.. Before I state my overall opinion, let me just say that this is a very tough game. It could be frustratingly difficult for some and ridiculously easy for others. Now for the actual review: The gameplay, graphics, and weapons are all a","insomniac games lernt from their mistakes in the first game delivered one of the best sequels just one year later . while the gameplay is refined, some major aspects of the game were worsened . the controls are super clunky, and far more refined in the 3rd game ."
299.Black & White,"Awesome concept and idea, but not enough well executed... Only fun in the early game. Innovative and refreshing god game where you have much more control over the world via your AI creature. The creature is way ahead of its time in terms of responsiveness, hoenstly much of the world is, and you really feel like you have an active hand in guiding your civilization. Battle against other gods is really fun, as is the sandbox level. Remake!!. That was a game.. Gave you a chance to be a GOD that you want to be.. and train your animal helper to deal with problems on land :) Pity that they did not create 3rd part.. Once upon a time I was really addicted to this game. The whole idea of being a god with awesome creature that grew and changed based on what you did is even today unique, so kudos for that. I love those two advisors (one good and the other evil) that constantly tried to persuade me to their way of life. Even today I still remember the sailors song :). I love god games, and it definitely scratches that itch. It's innovative and fun to play, but the graphics are dated, and the humour is not really my cup of tea.. Brilliant game, some much fun to play around with, so original. The best management and town building where not well implemented though.. I bought this game back in the day, believing the hype. The game was fun enough but didnt seem like a full game. It was a fun idea. I don't think many people finished the game.. It's a highly innovative God-style management game where you help a small tribe to build and expand a village. The more villagers pray to you, the greater your circle of influence on the map becomes. Your goal is to capture the whole map and defeat rival gods. You also control a creature which you teach with rewards and punishments. Astonishingly, the creature's AI is designed with so much plasticity that, with some patience, you can teach it to do very complex things like creating forests, fetching stuff and generally helping villagers a lot and taking most of micromanagement away from you. Villagers tend to become lazy if you just give them food and wood, so it's better to create forests and rains instead, letting the villagers produce food and wood themselves. With some training, your creature would even do all the forests/rain spells. You can also choose to be an evil god, torture villages and let your creature eat them. The creature can fight with creatures of rival gods. There are quests scattered over the world, with the most famous one being where you bring grain and a pig to sailors (I still remember their song: ""We're not complaining but there is one more thing remaining: We're not going nowhere 'ntil we get some meat.. ""). The graphics are great for the time and still look good, and you can fully zoom out to see the whole map on the screen. You have 2 advisers (one good and one evil) who are funny and have a lot of character, especially the evil one. The game has an innovative system of casting spells (by drawing signs on the screen) which unfortunately doesn't work well - but you can also just use hotkeys for spells as well. The only real downside (and that's why 9/10 and not 10/10) is that the game somehow lacks purpose. The campaign offers a handful of words to conquer and after that you don't know what to do else. Even being evil for a while gets boring fast. This game came years before Minecraft, which made this style of game (""do whatever you want"") more common and accepted.. So I remeber all the hype about this game back in 2001 and years flew by and I finally decided to test this game after so many years, it's nearly 2016 now yep 15 years after the release of this game I always had that little feeling that I wanted to test this. So yea I finally did, well I don't know that to say, I can think of so many things but I will just try to keep it simple. The game looks great very nice considering it came out in 2001, the sound and music are really good and the presentation is great, almost all about the game is decent for a 2001 game. nothing can go wrong right? Well... I am not sure if the game didn't age well or the concept was just too new back in the day or if it all was just a commercial stunt. Thing is the game is great but it just lacks depth, it gets very repetitive soon and trying too keep things in order, the vilages and citizens food wood miracles your creature etc etc becomes really hard, it starts to feel more like a chore than a game. Soon I started to feel more like a maid or a slave than a god. The game and concept is really great but it was poorly executed. I have very mixed feelings about this game and I don't know if I could recommend it, I have not played B&W2 but if its slightly better than this one then get that one instead of this one. This game just feels incomplete that should have been my whole review summarized 'Incomplete game'. I will rate it a 7 just because the game is not bad even with all it's flaws. if you like these type of games then get (Jowood The Nations) it's an old game too but at least it is more balanced than this one and it makes me feel more **** than this one too.. Its 2015 and i am still playing this, not often as it isn't much for the replayability but it brings back memories of me originally playing it 10+ years ago. Graphics are a little off but look at how old it is. I believe i saw a comment from 2013 complaining about that but they didnt take into the age factor. I wish Black & white 2 stayed closer to this games gameplay. I also wish there was more done of this, i haven't played another game like it and i want to. But i just have to deal with this and 2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I always loved those I am GOD games, and especially this one had so much potential and so many excellent ideas, that it was almost more fun thinking about it and about all that potential than actually playing it. I loved the concept, but I also remember that it never kept me entertained for more than a few first levels, but it's definitely one of those titles that deserves to be remembered for what it is and for what it tried to do.7/10. Well... I am on the final land... I am trying to be a good god and impress villages, so first a make sure my villagers are happy. Then I raise the totem. Oh, I see that the villagers worshipping want food. Sure! Still in control... Okay, now to impress. Oh no! My influence is too small! Nevermind, I have a creature for such problems. Then I hear the death call. Hmm... I know I will get a heal and heal the people Okay, there, now to refill the food of the people. Alright, now to... Oh no! People are dying at the worship site! I must lower the totem. Okay, now my creature must go impress the village! Hang on! Why is he so small! Oh no! I spent too much time trying to be good that my creature has shrunk! Well anyway, I will send him! NOOO! Nemisis chucked like a million fireballs at him!!! NO! Oh no! My villages need more civic buildings! why are there so many children! Oh! Oh to hell with good! where's that fireball dispenser? Oh no! I accidentally destroyed it! Well, let me see how much belief I need, maybe I can expand my influence. 3500 belief needed.. The concept of this game is so very appealing, but it makes me feel a bit let down. The creature aspect either feels too advanced, or just wasn't thought through completely. I can't decide. Somehow it will feel like having a real pet, with a colorful personality where you can affect it's choices, lifestyle and morale. But the system for doing this requires a lot of patience, as it's seldom clear on how to do this. Often you will be required to watch him closely every minute to find the right timing on when to praise him or scold him, and the outcome may still not be what you thought it to be. It also seems like the creature forgets stuff over time, so he will have to keep relearning things throughout the game, which proves tedious. As for being a god the layout feels clever. You'll impress different towns with your godly ways, which will give you enough influence for them to start worshiping you. But you may only do stuff within your ""influence radar"", which makes it essential to either bring your pet over to impress or cause distress; or throw rocks and stuff from afar like crazy until people take notice. Sometimes, it works out well and you'll feel good about it. Other times, you'll want to rip your hair out as the god-villain so easily may electrify your creature to death, making your choices very few on how to proceed. It's also quite sad how boring it may be to be a god, as it often will feel like a village simulator where you just micromanage stuff; like turning citizens into farmers, build stuff and keep bringing food over to your worshipers. And every level will be repetitive as this is pretty much all you do. Then there's the side quests. They're always cheesy, but often a fun break from the regular god-stuff that you do. The rewards will often be surprising, but seldom that useful. Though I have to say that most of the charm in this game lies within such things. I find a lot of pleasure from the side quests, exploring the world, pressing F1 to get descriptions of weird stuff on the islands, checking out small easter eggs and such. It's clear that the game is meant to be quirky and fun, rather than a die hard strategy game.. I'm glad the game is finally getting the real reviews it actually deserves, since behind its sharp presentation lies an overwhelming mess ****. From the woeful tutorial sections at the beginning of the game, to the intuitive design choices, Black and White seems more like a title designed to frustrate the player than to actual teach them anything. If anyone recalls the much better game, Populous 3, which came out some years before this, exceeds in teaching the player fairly basic mechanics and structure without attaching a one ton weight that is the atrocious AI of Black And White's infamous ""creatures."" You start the game off helping some folks being GOD and whatnot, you aren't opposed to helping (or harming) people once in awhile. After you're bored with that its time to listen to a tutorial for an hour rather than to introduce things slowly to the player without patronizing them or belittling their technical abilities to understand how a very basic game actually works. Their is no ""management"" of your throng of villagers, the gaggles of them will just literally do whatever you need them to do. Should you wish, you could essentially sit around and do nothing for them, but unfortunately nothing would ever get done. Unsurprisingly these villagers are pretty slow compared to you, GOD, who can essentially do their work for them much faster. After a few buildings are finished you will get to pick from three adorably polygonal monstrous creatures: A cow, a lion or an Orangutan. In what can only be described as, ""tedious to a degree not since seen in any other game ever"" you are now forced into what can only be described as a pet simulation till the end of single player game. None of the creatures were particularly better than you, GOD, and the effort needed to train these beasts from murdering citizens or gaining their trust before picking one up all of a sudden and eating them was mentally draining. I certainly don't remember this portion of the game being intuitive either. In fact I found it revolting how easily you could accidentally train your monster something entirely wrong and not know the consequences until it was too late. I never even bothered to finished the incredibly long winded Single player portion, as I was just too frustrated by the creature AI mechanics to possibly stomach the rest of the game. Though it was met with exceedingly amazed reviewers at its time of release, since then it has been confirmed for one of the most overrated and over hyped pieces of software to come out in some time. Is it fun to pick up villagers and throw all of them into the ocean one by one in an effort to bring some peace from the chaos? Yes of course. But you'll never get anything done that way.. This game had so much promise, but it falls short of its godly goals. That said, the game is still enjoyable thanks to the fact that YOU ARE A GOD. Seriously. Why didn't they make B&W3? With the hardware and even software out now, that game would be truly at epic proportions fit for a player-god. Quirky and funny dialogue from your advisers eventually get old. And, yes the gameplay does eventually get rather boring after a while and the story isn't even really worth paying attention to. Most of the time, I just try to build the best, most efficient city ever and then once my goals are met I bring the apocalypse upon my people. Muahahaha! Ahem. Anyways, I wouldn't exactly recommend this game, but if it's really cheap then buy it. Otherwise, I'd go for B&W 2 instead. Since it's basically the same game, only better! (and prettier too). I loved this game. My biggest wish is that they make the ""3rd"" one also!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I don`t understand all the negative reviews on this game. For me is the single most brilliant game ever made, too bad it doesn't have a sequel to follow it's steps. From graphics to gameplay to story, this is the game that filled my early years in gaming with hope that the game industry will grow in intelligence and innovation. I was wrong, but still this game deserves to be in top 10 ever made. It saddens me that so many ppl view it as junk. One of the best. 10/10. It is an absolutely great amazing... but... it gets boring way too much quickly I even have not finished it, although it looks very promising, the features and possibilities in this game are endless, yet still boring.. Black & White was one of the first computer games I ever purchased for myself. Though having some major issues, this game was entertaining enough to keep my interest for a while. The miracle system and freedom to act how you please are what made this game so entertaining. No boundaries but your own sense of right and wrong. However, the AI was leagues behind where it needed to be for a game like this. Stupid villagers cannot even feed themselves if you don't manage their village's every need. Your creature will walk around eating folk, even if you slap him silly every time he does it. This game was created far before its time. If made today, this could have been so much better!. Every so often a game comes along that makes you stare in disbelief. This is that game for me. Maybe I'm to old but I know **** when I see it. This game reminds me of the Segway. It was supposed to revolutionize gameplay. It had the best minds behind it. Yeah, right. It's nothing but hype. The product simply fails to deliver in any category. The people who like this game are the same people who are proud to wear DKNY. How they ever got into the gaming world is beyond me.. One of the first games i ever played and i have to say one of my favorates, this game has one of the best story lines i have ever come across a very fun game to play ""black and White, Find out who you really are"" this really game lets you go ahead throw that man off a cliff you have no one to answer too, burn that womans house no one can stop you put that child in a pack of wolves see what happens. This game will release the good or evil in you. The graphics havnt really stood the test of time unlike age of empires for example but the game is still great and worth buying.","brilliant game, some much fun to play around with, so original . graphics are dated, and the humour is not really my cup of tea . the best management and town building where not well implemented though ."
3.Grand Theft Auto IV,"I really like this game but not for any of the gameplay except maybe shooting cause it was decent this game is really challenging you to stay awake while doing missions. most of this **** game is driving to and from missions it would be better if the driving was fun but lets just say it has a steep learning cerv. I did enjoy it later on in the game as i got better at it but damn is it sluggish and slippery. i hated the mission design for this game cause while i liked the story and characters its just so boring. how did this game follow after San andrenas? that game is full of so much variety in gameplay and places to go to, that with the characters they're just as strong as this game depending on how i feel about this game it moves between a 7 to a **** 4 but and its a big but I love the story and characters in this game. Niko, Roman, packie and his family, Brucie, Bernie/Florien, Marlen, the IAA agent, Little Jacob and Demetri. There's prolly more little side characters i forgot to mention but all of these people are memorable and full of character. The story is rich too full nuance. Niko journey is definitely memorable. Overall this is very boring but it does have a great story Rockstar just needs to work on gameplay variety desperately. Best GTA with also San Andreas the graphics are good for a 2008 game the story is fantastic and the online mode still holds up today. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good game and remains one of my childhood favs play thisgame if you have a chance !. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game i ever played ever this game is iconic and classic must play game. One of the best games of all time and arguably the best GTA in the series. From the Dark, Gritty setting of New York inspired Liberty City, to the revolutionary gameplay mechanics such as combat and physics which are still yet to be bettered by any Rockstar game.. I played and completed the story of both GTA V and IV. I can easily say that GTA IV's stort miles ahead of V's. The atmosphere,story line, characters,details,depth of the story etc.... A very good game, graphics still look good today, runs fine, good overall story. Just better than gta v. I mostly liked the story but this game has too many flaws. Literally spent 20 minutes on one mission and then couldn't complete it because the AI I was escorting glitched out and wouldn't follow me. There are no checkpoints so I have to start the mission over and do the same boring ""drive here, shoot this guy then shoot that guy"" tedium I've done on a million other missions. This game is coded terribly and wasting lots of your time. Sorry, I just don't have the patience for this. Developers like Bethesda get criticized for releasing glitchy games but in my experience GTA games are worse. The gaming media is a joke anyways in the way they cherry pick which games to fault for glitches and bugs. Also, some of these missions are scripted right down to when your bullets actually work. The fact that enemies are sometimes invulnerable so the set peice will play out is immersion breaking and goes against everything an open world game should be. Nevermind that the basic mechanics of the game are bad. The driving feels like you're steering a partially full water balloon floating an inch above the ground. It's not ""realistic."" The shooting and cover system is at best clunky and at worst doesnt even work. Then there are missions that fail through no fault of your own but because the AI does something stupid and gets killed. 97 Metascore, yeah right. This is a mediocre game and when I see something like 14% of players with the story completion achievement, I wonder how many people that rate this game highly actually finished this game like I did. The only thing holding this together is the story and the protagonist which blows GTA 5 away.. Please add AutoHDR support for Grand Theft Auto IV on the Xbox Series X|S consoles. Please Rockstar also please release an update to support native 4K resolution with 16x AF. Who hasn't heard of GTA IV, with pretty much the entire internet having heard its name, one place or another. My only question, when is GTA VI?. Whats there even to say, if not the best grand theft auto ever made? dare i say ?. The best story that Rockstar has cooked up for this series. Incredibly immersive open world and well-designed missions to boot.. It's a really good game, and the city looks great. The choices make the main story more interesting and make Niko the main character with the most depth in GTA. However, bugs are still present on the PC version in 2024, including one in particular on the last mission that requires you to go to forums to tinker with the game.. Very good history with Niko Bellic and Liberty City is so inmersive and realistic. GTA 4 is a phenomenal game, that at time doesn't stand the test of time - but is one of Rockstar's strongest games. Amazing free world, Amazing characters, Amazing story, Amazing would be the word to describe GTA 5.. Quite nice and expansive sandbox. Revolutionary at the time of release and aged well. Not quite the energy of GTA III. Accidently left an review on the 360 version instead of PC. Since I did, I might as well mention something. While the PC version is a **** port, it's better to play the pc version then the console versions. nowadays it aint that bad. It just had bad performance on old computers, apparently fixed with dxvk, go figure.. Cons : driving and shooting are really bad, yes the two most important things in a GTA game, also this is the first GTA game that I didn't enjoy fu**ing around and stuck with the missions. Pros : The characters and The story.. This is the best game in gta for story thishas the best story in all of gta with a very nice meaningful meaning. The game's atmosphere and car physics weren't quite to my liking, but the story, new game mechanics, and the rage engine really impressed me.. ThisGame really changeMylife i love somuch and today i miss the 5000 calls ofRománto go to play bowling. Besides thisGTA has theBestmission for me andit'sthe best grand theft auto.. even if the game is a decade and a half old, it still holds great for the time, best music, great story, even feels like im watching a movie, a movie im playing! YOU EVEN CAN EAT AT A CLUCKIN BELL! GTA V DIDNT HAVE THAT! it was a pleasure playing this on the xbox 360.... one of the best games ever. even after all those years it still manages to impress me with its amazing level of detail.. Genereational game, that most of the people love. Has now become a big classic.. It's a very good gta game but the biggest problem in here are dull, boring and repetitive missions. Additionally there is a horrible autosave mechanic and I was absolute furious wheni had to start some random mission for the third time because autosave is at the beginning of the mission.. this game was way ahead of its time. the game is an absolute masterpiece and i wish it got a remaster. this game is one of the greatest of all time and easily my 3rd favorite after SA and VC. very nice!. Amazing game the story is top notch and the choices you can make in it that lead to differnt side quests and other benefits are truly stand out from previous gta games same with being the first GTA to game to have more then one ending. Ragdoll physics are still amazing and put other games to shame. Activities are worth doing as you learn more about niko.. EL MEJOR GTA DE TODOS,ES UNA OBRA MAESTRA EN SU JUGABILIDAD Y SU HISTORIA TAN REALISTA Y CON UN PROTRAGONISTA MUY BIEN HECHO.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best one easily, amazing story, amazing characters, I'd go bowling any day Roman. Not as rewarding and enjoyable as other GTA games. GTA IV doesn't offer much new ideas nor does it really follow much of the same ideas and features that made the other GTA games amazing. Although I still enjoyed the game for what it had to offer, with its cool ragdoll physics, enjoyable gameplay, as well as its interesting story.. Terrible transport department. terrible game optimization. in the capital everything is fine.. Best gta game right behind san andreas, if not on the same level, story, graphics (for 2008) were impeccable even to this day the story is one of rockstar’s most beautiful work. The amazing game gta series, most immersive and realistice in game and the good character development for nico bellic and many character in gta 4. This is the best Grand Theft Auto game ever. I literally love everything about it, from this perspective yes the GTA V is a huge downgrade!. very good game. revolutionary at the time and very good gameplay. the graphics have aged poorly but at the time they were the best. My favorite game from the entire Grand Theft Auto series, love the characters and the story, It's worth spending your time in it.. incredible map and story!The gameplay of the vehicles on the other hand is horrible.. Played it in Playstation 3, it's a great gameplay, with a great story, very realistic for it's time of release. A game i would enjoy playing again. Not the best GTA! But a very enjoyable one.. GTA4 is a good game. I think it lacked the charm they brought to the series with 5 though. I could never play it again and really enjoy it the same.. One of the best Games I Could Have Played In 360 good Good Realistic Story Sounds And excellent graphics For the Epoch.. The best Grand Theft Auto history, one of the best games i ever played is a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Im not a big GTA fan but this is my favourite without doubt, very immersive, engaging and a **** ton of fun. my only gripes is the occasional clunkiness and boring/frustrating missions (this game really needed mission checkpoints). GTA IV offers an engaging story and immersive world, capturing the essence of Liberty City. 7/10. This game is absolutely amazing! I used to have this game back in the day when I had an Xbox 360. Oh my goodness, I used to love it! Roman used to say, ""Let's go bowling!"" This game has a lot of creepy places. It is densely a good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite being a more grounded story compared to other Grand Theft Auto games like San Andreas or GTA V, GTA IV gives an experience like no other game, providing an excellent satire of the American dream along with a protagonist we've never seen replicated in media since.. This is a great game, but it’s also a disappointment when compared to “San Andreas”. There are a lot less activities to engage in. Also, the over-the-top missions from previous entries were replaced with more “grounded” action. However, in terms of graphics and level design, this is a huge upgrade. The “Liberty City” of GTA IV is a lot more detailed and realistic. Rockstar also revamped the car physics and combat mechanics. While the game isn't as enjoyable as the PS2 titles, it still packs a punch with its story and characters. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.4 out of 10.. Gameplay ****, story is alright but music is awesome and the world is gloomy but well executed. Grand theft AUTO 4 IS THE BEST IN THE SEREIS ESPECIALLY ON XBOX 360!!!!!!!!. Tagline: ""Phenomenal open-world, modern-city masterpiece that is still more detailed than any open world game as of April 2024 ""What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?- Let's make one thing clear, you should never max out ""View Distance"", ""Detail Distance"" and ""Vehicle Density"". But good news is that you don't need to max out either of these, because game looks already perfect when you set all these settings to 50%. Everything after 50% is very minor and not necessary, but takes away huge amount of fps, so it's not worth it and with 50% it will already look miles better than Console versions. So for conclusion, yes, this is the best looking version of that ****, to run it in 4K, High Settings, you need minimum ""RTX 2060"" or ""RX 6600 XT"" for graphics card, For CPU Ryzen 3600 or I7 **** let's make one thing clear, this game was extremely ahead of time. More than any game ever. ""Resident Evil 4"" (2005) was revolutionary in it's own ways and is still amazing game, no doubt, but what GTA 4 did, changed open world games ****'s start with physics. You wont find this good physics from any open world game. None. Keep in mind this was **** York truly feels alive, more alive than modern open world games like Just Cause 3/4 or Cyberpunk 2077. Whole city is extremely detailed, especially by 2008 standards and all of that looks absolutely phenomenal, if you play this game in **** can go inside hospitals (fully detailed), inside apartment buildings, inside police station, abanoned places, etc. There's so much to explore and find in this incredibly crafter open world. Every inch of that map shows how much passion and talent was put into making this incredible game.Story is fun, long and rich, full of loads of memorable characters, missions and **** IV is timeless masterpiece, that truly showed what is possible in gaming, most detailed open world game to date and one of the best games of all time.. Man, GTA IV on Xbox 360 was the first one I played, it makes me feel nostalgic when I turn on my Xbox and get a car in GTA and kill myself right after, playing GTA IV is a feeling that I can't explain, I love this game. GTA 4 was one of the GTA that marked my childhood, and I have better moments in that swing full of glitch that launches the car very far and the game's story is very impactful in my opinion and the history of the expansions (TLAD & TBoGT ) are incredible, my rating for this wonderful game is 10, if I could I would give it 100, what a perfect game.. Played on Xbox Series X through backwards compatibilty, it does show its age as far as graphics are concerned. Its gameplay is also pretty dated. But what it lacks in those areas, it makes up for in its characters, story and setting. It tells one of the most atmospheric, and mature stories in gaming history in one of my favourite open worlds. It expertly crafts compelling characters like Niko Bellic, Elizabeta Torres, Roman Bellic and Packie McReary whilst telling a fresh and often grim tale of the American dream. I'd say the trade off is worth it. I was quite satisfied with the dark atmosphere of GTA 4, but I didn't really enjoy the main character. The portrayal of a Balkan man was quite good, but I may not have connected with him because of the lack of customization in the game. Still, the story was quite meaningful and enjoyable.. Maybe old, maybe shows its age in graphics or etc but for this story it is nothing but a masterpiece for me.. I don't know where to start from. Do I start with the great characters, the soundtrack, the radio stations, the story or maybe start with Niko Bellic or even that the game gave you choices throughout the story or even the easter eggs. Can I say that this game was perfect?. A well written story, unforgettable characters, unforgettable athmosphere, very good phsyics even today. Definitely a cult production for gaming world.. A near-masterpiece with depth and complexity. Though not my favorite, it's close to it.. A great work that spans the world view. The picture quality is very delicate, and the plot is also very deep-rooted.. An absolute outstanding masterpiece for its time and till this day, 10/10 the only complain I would have is that there are some bugs but theyre pretty known and theyre fun, oh and Ive also heard the PC version is pretty trash, and I also dont like that this games has no other ports or remasters so its pretty hard to revisit this gem, and I love how GTA 5 is 97 and GTA 4 is 98 becase GTA 5 is also a 10/10 outstanding masterpiece that is very overhated and overshadow by this game, but ignoring that, GTA 5 is a divine masterpiece but GTA 4 is just a super duper tiny bit slighty better, GTA 6 has to be the best out of both of them and out of Red Dead Redemption 2, but anyways what else can I say that hasnt been said already? Rockstar please remaster it or port it to the PS4 and PS5 and a better verison for Steam, and please dont charge 50 USD. Great game! Great main character. The V is better but this one was a big achievement for that time. This is just **** awesome, Niko Bellic is THE character that many people should be like him (except for doing bad things) and I wish rockstar would remaster it for Newer consoles.. best Campaign ever on a video game better physics than gta 5 and rdr2 has 2 great dlcs great gameplay mechanics each game character is perfect 2 great endings Overall best game experience ever. Verry goood my friendo. One of the best GTA games, with GTA SanAndreas and IV you can have a perfect GTA experience. They really tried to do something different here. Comparing to the other games in the franchise, This one has a very different story . While in most of the other games you get betrayed by a major character later in the game. This entry starts with your character already hunting the person who betrayed him. Driving is tough at first but is actually fun once you get used to it. Physics Is very advanced for that time and give you a very memorable and different experience altogether.. Grand Theft Auto IV is the best GTA game ever made, IMO. When it released, the 3D era of GTA had come to a close (GTA: San Andreas being the last major console release in this era), and the graphical and gameplay differences between 3D and HD eras was night and day. The cars handled different, the gunplay was so much better, the ragdoll physics are STILL second to none (and even superior to GTA V, no **** the storyline was dark, more mature, and genuinely felt like it was actually geared towards a more serious tone that GTA had never really embraced. Niko Bellic was - and still is - my favorite Grand Theft Auto protagonist, due to his complex and compelling backstory, but also the lean on Greek Tragedy, so to speak (there's no real happy ending for him). While he's almost in over his head, his combat training and his hardened character allows him to survive against all odds, and the ragtag group of characters that make up his friends' circle are all meaningful and important in their own ways. The dirty, crime-ridden streets of Liberty City are still such a perfect fit to a GTA game, and this title is still a game I play through, from start to finish, at least five times a year.. Overrated as frick. Missions are boring, combat is mid,story is good, half of the game is driving, rockstar has this structure for 20 years now and nobody criticises their games. The best GTA in all the time. Probably it has errors but is still Funny 16 years later. For me gta 4 have best history ever made with Rockstar,you feel really nico and the others characters have personality.. The best GTA game ever made and possibly the best that will ever be made. Our population is getting dumber and lazier and so the people that make these games will undoubtedly never recapture the magic of this game and the imbeciles who play GTA will likely be satisfied with the direction of GTA 5. If you like realism, story, and quality gameplay this one is a must-play.. The protagonist, the characters, the story, the world is still the best in gaming the realistic driving and rag doll physics the unfiltered satire that will have your lungs gasping for air after heavy laughter or the story moments which will shed tears in your eyes. Happiness, sadness, excitement, fear, every emotion this game will bring out of you simply a masterpiece. No other game will ever match this or surpass it. GTA IV is peak gaming the best in the series and the best game ever created. 16 years after its release im still playing it and still blown away 16 years!!!!!! Amazing spectacular fantastic. Masterpiece. Niko Bellic is a perfect main caracter, the game has an very sad history, what is good, and this game is almost perfect. There needs to be a remaster for Xbox and ps4, in some ways this game was a little disappointing, but it has one thing that gta 5 doesn’t have, or should I say doesn’t have that gta 5 has, an infestation of predatory micro transactions, this game seems a little bleak, gta 3 had more colors than this, but gta 5 really makes me miss playing gta 4, gta 4 did teach me something, it’s how much worse the gta series can get after every release, and gta 5 has only proven that, though there are fun activities in gta 5 story mode, but that’s it, after writing about gta 5, it made me appreciate gta 4 a little more on how a real gta game was designed, because in some way gta 5 felt like a knockoff.. It is a very good game. I love it, but gta 5 somehow just stands out more. So i guess i like 5 more, but this still is a good game that people should give a try.. Grand Theft Auto IV: A Gaming Masterpiece Grand Theft Auto IV, released in 2008, isn't just a game; it's a journey that profoundly impacted my gaming experience. Stepping into Liberty City felt like entering a living, breathing world, with meticulous detail in design and a narrative that gripped my emotions. From the gripping tale of Niko Bellic to the seamless blend of realism and entertainment in gameplay, GTA IV is Rockstar's magnum opus. The storyline, centered around Niko Bellic, an Eastern European immigrant with a haunted past, is a gripping saga of betrayal, loyalty, and the pursuit of the elusive American Dream.

The best game in History, No doubt, The best Physics, The best Characters, The best plot, The best Main character, The best aiming, The best guns, Best soundtrack. Everthing about this game is PERFECT, Obviously, We dont have that much liberty that we have GTA San Andreas and GTA V, But this is the only weak point of this game.. This is one of my favorite GTA games of all time the story was so good I couldn’t stop playing , so I consider this a must play. The story is a bit more interesting than GTA 5, but the gameplay and animations haven't aged too gracefully. It's janky and monotone, and while Liberty City is interesting, it's a pain to get through this today.. Another Grand Theft Auto Game, another childish gameplay clutch that relies on you just having freedom to do whatever, no real substance. Immature dialogue & choices like usual. Avoid if you're over the age of 15.. One of the greatest games of all time and personally my favourite GTA game a masterpiece. Yeah, this game is good... too good for the 360 era. A perfect time capsule of the early 2000s. Hope this helps. Over 15 years since its original release and this game still looks and feels absolutely amazing to play. The attention to detail is crazy, even by today's standards. The ammount of time spent on research when creating the map really shows. Liberty City feels ""alive"", like an actual city. And the story is genuinely touching. My favourite game of all time, unchallenged.. One of the best video games ever. Rockstar has created the New York in the gaming world. Grand Theft Auto IV contains a rich narrative, a fantastic and interesting protagonist, an ensemble of characters that are written and performed in a unique style, and fun gameplay and missions that keeps you playing for hours on end. When first playing this back in the day, no game had captured the real world and it's commentary like how GTA IV did. A benchmark in the open world and third person genre, Grand Theft Auto IV is truly one of the greatest games ever made. This is Rockstar at their best.. Maybe not the funniest GTA to play but it is THE GTA you want. The story is believable, dark, it involves an immigrant from the east who wants to have a taste of the ''American Dream''... The physics are still to this day one of the best ever made ! Combats are refined and still the best of the franchise to this day. You can counter punch the attacks of the enemies, the CQC is also allowing you to disable a cold weapon, the cars have this amazing feeling of ''weight'' especially with american cars, the speed is also really good you can feel it. For me, this game is just perfect and it is for a mature audience unlike GTA V for instance.. The story is probably the most down to earth in the spirit and trends on its time, and actually still of some actuality. The gameplay is varied and fleshed out. It has many songs, vehicles and the environment design is just phenomenal. Played on Xbox Series X add 60fps, 4xMSAA, 16xAF and a nice resolution upscale.. GOAT GREATEST OF THE **** ALL TIME PLEASE ROCKSTAR, THISIS WHAT WE NEED NOT GTA V ONLINE STOP IT. Masterpiece this game is an art sadly gta 5 never reached this level of epicness niko is hands down the best gta protagonist liberty city feels like a living and breathing world the physics are so much better then gta 5 everything about this game is perfect. good story. Absolute masterpiece. This game perfectly show us the big art that the video games can be. Truly gorgeous narrative accompanied with charismatic characters, places, missions and including the major Liberty City which it’s environment it’s breathily, big and lively. This game do a giant games-revolution because of its narrative, physics, characters and realistic, mature and crude story. I consider this masterpiece as one of the best games ever made.. So far, best GTA game. Hopefully GTA 6 will be as amazing as this game.. The best GTA of all time. GTA IV is an amazing game which includes a perfect story and **** has some optimization problems but it doesnt show up every minute.. It is literally one of the best GTA only surpassed by GTA 5. Not a bad game with a good story with a dark atmosphere. I think this game is the best game in the world. In terms of story, gameplay, characterization and other things, it is amazing. Sit down and **** masterpiece game can be played many times.. I don't understand how this has such a high Metacritic. It was incredibly fun when it came out but in my opinion, the weakest GTA.. One Of The Best Games Ever Made. Great game! I've really enjoyed coming back to this entry to the series. Very good story and missions.. This is theBestgta man. It's a great game with great side quests and story line.. Absolute masterpiece, but am i surprised? No ofcourse, Rockstar rarely fails to disappoint. But like i said, Absolute masterpiece W game.. played. Best GTA ever. The freedom this game give you is something special. Can't wait for the next.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the game is incredible, the gameplay and the physics of things are impressive, the story is well told and the characters are well constructed, but the port wasn't very good, so sometimes the frames per second drops, but nothing that bothers me too much.. it's very good game . but it contains some mistakes in the gameplay. amazing physics story choices and agreat story and activites. Like the Playstation version, the Xbox version deserves a comment.. First GTA game that made me feel all the relationships with the characters and be a gangster in real life with very realistic missons. Better physics than gta 5 ‍♂️ game just needed the graphic fidelity. Greatest game of all time. Nuff' said. Official Score- 10/10. Simply, the best GTA ever. I have fond memories of being a teenager playing this game, ironically enough, with my cousin whenever we would get together and just see how much mayhem we could cause. I remember playing through a bit of the story when I was younger, but what I do not remember is the grim depiction of Niko, the main character. Constantly having to deal with the **** hands the world constantly deals to him he becomes wracked with guilt, unsure of his own morals, and just seems extremely depressed by the end of the game. There is no happy ending, no matter the decisions you make, by the time the end credits are rolling Niko is just left in this miserable state. Quite honestly the game played better than I expected it to. It feels a little sluggish at times, and sometimes you get caught up in animation which will just leave you defenseless while getting shot. But once you get used to it you learn the limitations of your movement and can adjust accordingly. The story is pretty all over the place. Mostly due to the game's mission structure allowing you to have a lot of different things going on for different people at once. During the final portion of the game you start to see the ends tying up and how all of these people fit together but until then it's more or less just a means to an end for Niko's revenge plot. I think one thing in particular that I enjoyed that I wish were forced are the optional phone calls. After certain missions happen in the story you can call Roman and the two will speak about what happened and I think this is some of the best character building in the game, despite being optional. It really fleshes out both characters and their familial relationship. It made them feel much more humanizing and I don't think I would have been as invested in either of them had I not listened to them all. Overall great game. Glad I finally replayed it.. Memorable, it really made a revolution the day it was released, great characters, great graphics, everything was great, just made by Rockstar. Grand Theft Auto IV was a technical marvel at the time of release, and boas",i really like this game but not for any of the gameplay except maybe shooting . i hated the mission design for this game cause while i liked the story and characters its just so boring . the graphics are good for a 2008 game the story is rich too full nuance .
30.The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,"Windwaker is my childhood game, and this game deserves something more than 10 for its storyline and beauty.. This game is really good at being a Zelda game. There's nothing that stands out to me but I did enjoy it better than other games in this franchise for some reason. I like the art-style and the more open world aspect. I prefer the HD version since there's a fast sail.. Simply a masterpiece, this game is enjoyable to its minimum details, im not an experienced gamer, so im really used to drop games, but that didnt happen here, it made me play 5 - 6 hours a day, the story, the characters, the original sound tracks, and even the ones that it brought from other zeldas, it was all combined into this title, simply amazing.. The Perfect sequel and evolution to Ocarina of Time. My personal favorite Zelda title.. Anyone who knows The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker knows how great the “Wind Waker feeling” is. This feeling is one of the main things that makes this game great. Also the amazing and entertaining world, the unique characters and story as well as the dungeons are really great. The remake is even better in my opinion, with better graphics and quality of life changes. This game doesn't really have any bad aspects, it just doesn't reach the highest heights (you just get used to the ""Wind-Waker-feeling"" a little and the last part of the game can feel a bit lame at times). Overall a great game with an even better remake. 9,5/10. A TIMELESS CLASSIC!! I remember when my parent's first bought me a GameCube when I was younger. They bought it with 3 games: Peter Jackson's King Kong game, Mario Party 4 or 5, and the Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker! The Wind Waker had such unique and beautiful graphics and animation style! I loved the colors and just how everything looked! The plot I even found astonishing, 10 out of 10!!! I do wish that they would make a remake to this game but I just know, if it is, they will change the animation style entirely... And it WON'T be like the OG Wind Waker at all.. I just think if the graphics were improved to how games are today, that it would change a lot.... 9.2/10. There's such a strong sense of childlike wonder and adventure in this game. Something about setting out into the open ocean wondering what will come next is spectacular.. Not twilight princess or ocarina of time level, but still an incredible game. A little shorter and easier than I'd like.. Phenominal game despite being rushed for the holidays! Dungeons may need a little work but the first few were fun and pretty easy but hard enough to be satisfied after completion. The sailing is fun but slow but worth it because you can also find treasure in the ocean! If you have a sea chart then you can also find more significant treasure! The final boss fight is one of my favorites in the entire series and i would absolutely recommend this game to anyone that has a gamecube or backward compatible wii!. Wind Waker? Oh, what a joke! This game is one of the biggest disappointments in the Zelda franchise! Let’s start with that cartoonish aesthetic. Seriously? While other games offer a rich and deep world, here we have Link looking like a kid and sailing through a gelatinous ocean. It feels more like a Disney movie than a true Zelda adventure!And what’s up with the sailing? You spend 90% of the game paddling like an idiot across an endless ocean, and what do you find? Empty islands with NPCs who just spout nonsense! There’s no challenge, no excitement! It’s like the game is saying, ‘Hey, how about spending hours doing nothing?’The story? Pfff, the cliché of the hero rescuing his sister is so worn out it’s downright boring. And the way you uncover the world’s secrets? Wow, how thrilling: you literally blow wind into a flute! Is that what you want from a game?And the side quests? Don’t make me laugh! If you think collecting a bunch of meaningless items and doing favors for annoying characters is fun, then you must love wasting time! Wind Waker is a sea of disappointment, and anyone who claims otherwise is sailing in delusion! A real letdown for those expecting something epic and engaging from the Zelda series. This game is awesome, it doesn't even feel like retro,the artstyle is so beatiful, the exploration and isles are very fun to explore. A fantastic game that holds up as well now as it did when it came out. This game follows up on the success of its predecessors and does not disappoint. This game has the perfect blend of satisfying gameplay, a sense of adventure, and a compelling story. I can't emphasize the amount of fun and excitement there is to be had in this game. Critics of this game may criticize it for the cartoony graphics, its comparably short duration, and a certain quest at the end of the game (I will include no spoilers). The graphics have aged more gracefully with time than any other game of the same time period. To this day, it is a beautiful, stunning masterpiece. Despite its appearance, this game is just as much for adults as it is for kids. It has surprisingly deep themes that can strike the hearts of adults and kids alike. This game takes at least 30 hours to play through the main quest, and has plenty of content and enjoyable experiences for more hours to come. Every quest and item has great meaning and only adds to this already incredible experience. As I mentioned, there is a certain part at the end of the game that a very vocal minority of players dislike. It involves lots of exploration and searching. This actually was one of my favorite parts of the game, as it helped immerse me more into this world by getting me to travel far and wide. It is in no way a filler, as you see in most games nowadays. Overall, I couldn't recommend this game any more to anyone who enjoys the action/adventure/puzzle genre. Everything about this game is expertly crafted. This game has such personality, and contrasts greatly to many of the soulless games we see nowadays. The only thing that disappoints me about this game is that it is not available on modern hardware (cough cough, release this on switch, nintendo!).. Great game, stunning graphics, however the first dungeon is very confusing and repetitive causing you to want to shut off the game and not see the beauty of the game, otherwise, masterpiece.. I could hardly put this down as a kid, and it was just my first Zelda game. The storytelling is stunning and captures a sense of urgency to progress the story, all while letting you explore the Great Sea and sea what it has to offer. Please Nintendo, listen to your Zelda fans and get this game on the Switch, pronto!. This game's greatest boon is its presentation. The simplified, cell shaded art style may have been panned at the time, but it manages to be visually beautiful even today; environments truly pop out to the player and characters are the most expressive they've ever been in the LoZ series. The soundtrack is also a personal favorite of mine out of the Zelda franchise. It also does well to expand on Ocarina of Time's combat while still remaining simple and easy to pick up. The vastness of the Great Sea provides a great feeling of openness and adventure, and also easily signals to the player locations of importance due to the overworld being one ocean filled with small islands instead **** field. Constantly changing the direction of wind can get quite tedious and the sailing speed often feels too slow, but this is mitigated later on by the addition of fast travel. Where this game mainly falters is its dungeons, which are the weakest of the 3D series. Dungeons are forgettable and puzzles are often simple or too similar to past LoZ games and the Command Melody gimmick becomes tired as early as the first time you use it only to be overused for two more dungeons. The dungeon number is also the second lowest out of the pre-BOTW 3D Zelda's so this isn't even a case of quantity over quality, and unlike Majora's Mask, Wind Waker does not have nearly as many side quests to make up for it.. My favorite game of all time. Love the art design, the soundtrack, the atmosphere, just everything. Most important game of my childhood.. This game is a really piece of art. All that it contains is made with so much love and attention: the art direction, the animations, the mechanics and the SONGS OMG THe songs of this game are so awesome and memorable. And what do I say about the combat?... its so simple but so fun and beautiful. I like the puzzles. Some of them are hard but not impossible fo dumb guys just like me. But at the second part of the game when I had to gather the eight shards of the triforce, it was pretty hard to find out where to go or what to do just because Im not the guy who wants to complete every part the programmers made. So I asked internet and then, look for each part of the triforce became the most fun part of the game to me. The story is not a masterpiece, but it´s pretty good, and, you know, it doesn´t need to be it. It´s Zelda, and Zelda is gameplay at all. Anyway, i´m so happy this game could play on my crappy pc with my simple controller. Thank you, Nintendo for this game. And thank you, dolphins, but I cannot say so many things about you.. This is the first Zelda game I played, and it is also the best Zelda in history for me. The warm and unforgettable story and the open world predecessor of BOTW are also great designs. amazing and magical game my childhood memory is so nostalgia. i want to play game again.. I did not think I would like this game. I bought it because of my loyalty to the franchise and allowed some benefit of the doubt. I did not regret my decision one bit. This is a solid game with both fun and challenge. If you want to relax and listen to calm music, sail to the middle of no where and just park on the waves. It is the soothing sounds of nature.. Legitimately my favorite Zelda ever. Great game. Really damn good, has some REALLY major issues at the backend of the game, but overall its an amazing time.. An amazing piece of art, a super emotional adventure about growing up and being brave, this game is a masterpiece and one of my favorite games of all time, if i could give it something more than a 10, i totally would. The best Zelda game ever and possible the best videogame ever. This is the maturity of the game style created by Miyamoto with Ocarina of Time, fine tuned and perfected by Aonuma. Everything is perfect from the targeting system to the fighting mechanics. techincally impressive it stood the test of time and it is one of the few games that even with 20 years on its back still looks fresh and modern. Story has everything: adventure, exploration, sacrifice, courgage and everything that make a story great. masterpiece.. One of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, and the soundtrack is wonderful as well. Exploring the Great Sea and the dungeons is a lot of fun.. A good adventure game, kind of original, but pretty much shallow and boring.. A good Zelda game that has aged well and has better replay value than some of the others. Overall I wasn't a big fan of the cartoony animation. I liked the more realistic, gritty look of Ocarina, Majoras Mask, and Twilight Princess.. Best Zelda ever. From the action dynamics to the history. One thing that I really liked about this game is that you don’t get lost trying to understand what you need to do and at the same time is still challenging.. One of my favorite games of all time. Csn be top 5 easily. Best zelda I have ever played. Graphics still looking so good on 2023.. How do you follow up Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask? By going in a completely different direction. With a bright and cheery atmosphere the wind waker will draw you in like a magnet.. worst zelda games ever to exist worse than the cdi pnes I would rather play twilight princess the artstyle for windwaker makes me wanna die and the story is crap all the negative reviews are realistic and I couldn't even have a single bit of joy. don't listen to the positive reviews they are all wrong soundtrack is awful I give it a 1 artstyle gets a -10 story:0 characters:-1 controls:2 the single most overrated game in existence ocarina of time is better if you're looking for old games then twilight princess is the best traditional Zelda game and finally breath of the wild is the best game in existence. A fun and fairly easy Zelda game. Had good but relatively not great dungeons. The story is quite good and Ganondorf is an excellent final boss in this game, especially with the music in the background. The open world is fun when on an island but it can get repetitive sailing all the time. The arena area where you fight a bunch of different enemies by falling down a hole is extremely fun. The best dungeon is either the foresaken fortress or the shadow temple. Overall a great Zelda game let down by some of its dungeons.. This is my favorite game of all time. I couldn’t possibly recommend it more.. I'll be honest, I was ready to hate on this game when I first saw the cell shaded graphics, the only reason I bought it, was for the limited edition that had a second disk for Zelda Ocarina of Time included because my brother sold the N64 and the GC was the first ever console I bought with my own money. After beating OoT I decided to give this game a try just to confirm my hate, man was I 1000% wrong by judging a game by it's graphics, the amazing open sea exploration, oh my god the music! The great story like all Zelda games, the gameplay. This game was also a wake up call to me to never judge a game again by it's graphics.. From my humble opinion, it is the most underrated game in the saga of the legend of zelda since it has a fun gameplay and a fun story and also has charismatic characters. Although it was criticized at the time for its graphics, I think it is the best experience to start in the Legend of Zelda franchise, since the game is very fun and creative and I only have one problem, which is collecting the fragments of the triforce apart from that it seems to me a phenomenal and almost perfect game. A fun Zelda game with great music, fun character designs and one of the most charming versions of Hyrule.. The whole ""everything is on an island"" idea quite literally gets in the way of the game. It doesn't do anything except waste time. You have to change the wind direction every time you want to go somewhere, because hurr durr you're in a boat. Gets old fast, they should have just made it something in the menu you select quickly, or better yet, eff the wind and the sail works in any direction you want. The whole part with the triforce SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME AT ALL. You have to find a MAP that lets you find OTHER MAPS that FINALLY have a location of the piece of the triforce, and you need like 15 of them. Every step of the way it costs 500 rupees to have a map translated, so you need to collect 5,000+ rupees to beat the game. If you didn't know that you have a problem by the time the end of the game comes with the map business, have fun grinding for a few days before you can move further. You're ""supposed"" to treat it as a side-quest that you do bits and pieces of here and there throughout the game, but it's just SO boring that most players put it off, hoping there will be something at the end of the game that does it for them, but that doesn't happen. They screwed up the spin attack. HOW could you do that? You have to unlock it which is the first problem, but it makes you think it's good. It takes too long to charge up so most of the time you will get hit and not be able to use it. If you manage to charge it up, you spin for 10 seconds while Link screams, which is stupid but most importantly HE THEN STOPS AND IS DIZZY. Oh my god how could you screw that up? That would be like putting his pogo move in the game but making it damage you or something. The sneaking part of the game is forced and stupid, but at least it doesn't last long. It's at the beginning of the game before you have any items. The hookshot is not in the game, they use a stupid rope and claw thing. It's so bad because you can only use it in ""approved"" places, ie where there is a pole sticking out to latch onto. The hookshot was so good in OOT because it made you think about what was wood or vines or not and what you could or could not hook into. Also with the claw rope you have to swing across and time it, which just wastes time. That should have been automatic. The guy on the boat who baits you in to grind and get his bracelets or whatever is a complete waste of time, all he does at the end is says thank you. So you wasted your time. WHY IS THIS IN THE GAME! The cartoon style is fine, that doesn't really make a big difference. A lot of characters look stupid with their gorilla style arms, but it's fine overall it's a stylistic choice. It's dumb but it doesn't ruin the game. It's definitely trying to be a Zelda game and the main part of the game is great. The dungeons are great and the story is great. Nintendo at least learned from their mistakes, but they were definitely mistakes, because when they made an HD remaster of this game, several of the problems I've mentioned were removed. The only things they really kept from Wind Waker was the leaf item, where you use it as a little parachute to float across gaps, and also this was the first game where they started a huge deep dungeon that is very challenging and just a fun slaughterfest. Nobody plays this game after their first time for a reason. It's not a completely terrible game but for being a Zelda... nobody remembers this or pines to play for it after their first time. You don't see people being nostalgic for it but you do for Zelda games both before and after. Things in other Zelda games were kept for the next one but this is definitely the dark horse of the series because it's all just a bunch of experiments that didn't work. Gamecube games exploded in value and it looks like the HD remake are both expensive. Both of them are a waste of money but if for some stupid reason you think you want to play this, the HD version on the Wii U is cheaper and also better in every way because they removed a lot of completely pointless things that are in the game. If this was your first Zelda game, you probably liked it but I feel really bad for you.. Wind Waker continues the Zelda formula from Ocarina of time, but opens the rather tiny overworld of Ocarina into a massive ocean with lots and lots to explore. Beyond that, there isn't too much innovation to be found here, other than the wonderful art style. But at this point, the Zelda formula had not gotten stale, and I think the new story, the art style, the whimsical atmosphere, the wonderful score, the minor enhancements to gameplay, and the huge world are all enough to make this game worthy of high praise. the only major criticism I have is that the dungeons are a step backwards from Ocarina's.. While the game has interesting visuals, everything else quickly falls apart. The mechanics are far more tedious than in any other entry in the series, especially at sea and in dungeons that rely on the awfully slow character-switching song. The seemingly open-world is massive but also quite empty, full of invisible walls and required equipment that deter the player from exploring until the very end of the game.. Like Ocarina and Majora, I played until the end without getting bored. I'm someone who can get bored of other games quickly, but Zelda games draw me in. Zelda has come up with a new formula with Wind Waker. Some aspects are good and some aspects are bad. In fact, if we look at the basics of the game, the OOT mechanics are still valid. Other than the concept, not much has been changed. That's why there hasn't been a game that impressed me as much as OOT. The good aspects of the game do not end with counting. Main things I don't like. Dungeons are more mundane and simple than OOT. Boat riding can be tiring at times. You have to constantly change the wind direction. Sometimes it can be difficult to find the treasure even if you are in treasure sound. There are few important NPCs and towns, which made the game feel a bit empty. The drawings and music of the game are very very good. Very good game overall.. There is a popular saying that this game's art style has aged well. Sure I will give it that, but that does not mean it is any less appealing that when it was released. With a weak story and excessive amount of sailing that becomes a slog to get through even late in the game. There are some unique weapons in the game, but otherwise it is your standard Zelda fair. Unfortunately due to some aspects of the game the replay value is very low. If you have not played it before it is worth a play through, otherwise your mileage may vary.. A game with unique graphics of the franchise with a very good design and great gameplay one of the funniest games in the zelda franchise. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is the best game i have ever played in my life. Really playable even 19 years after the release.. The windwaker is a masterpiece. it may have some big flaws but everything from the exploration to the music to the artstyle it's just amazing. the only few flaws are the dungeon design and the triforce piece quest. I would make it a 9.5 if I could. From start to finish this game is a joy to play with so much charm I'm smiling throughout the adventure. The characters are weird yet lovable the sailing is relaxing yet adventurous and that soundtrack is easily one of the best in the series. Combine all of that with an overworld with secrets to uncover tight controls and solid story this an easy game to recommend. Visually this holds up extremely well it still looks good even to this day and has truly stood the test of time. Items are far more versatile in this entry compared to most of the games in series in and out of combat every item you'll be using throughout the entire game while still feeling fluid and organic to play. I wish their were more dungeons in the game and it was a harder but unless your 5 most entry's in the series are pretty easy anyways and with general feel good atmosphere that the game is going for it does fit the whole experience. I don't think the triforce hunt is that bad at all and asking the player to explore the overworld in a game about exploring works here. Another criticism against the game is its use of space with people counting up the squares and breaking it down to which islands are story relevant and which one are not and while I do think it can utilize it space better every 3d entry in this series has the same issue arguably worse (except botw) and if they decreased the size of the world too much it'd feel more like the great puddle rather then the great ocean. The ending is incredibly climactic and satisfying and ends right when it should this game holds up and deserves a perfect score by modern standards 5/5. This game confirms that Tingle is a serial murderer and link aids him in his escape from prison. This game is amazing. Probably my favorite 3d Zelda. The ship was a nice addition.. Warning: Spoilers You know I really don't hesitate to use the word masterpiece here, and I can assure you I'm not one to whip out the word lightly! It is so damn enormously charming and endlessly fun to play and get into. You get monsters, pirates, bird folk, adorable tiny leaf people, a ghost ship that's a real pain in the ass and a half to track down, a funny talking boat that helps you to explore the sea and haul up endless treasure, and a classically evil dark lord who's far more powerful than you and who laughs in the face of dragons! It's seriously one of the most memorable and satisfying gaming experiences ever. From the moment you are able to move around and hit the pigs until they turn demonic and chase you off the little island you're hooked and the other reviewers that say so are right, you really can't help getting **** into the world of Wind Waker and falling in love with it, at least I sure couldn't. I love the cell shaded style that it has, I think it makes it, it's gorgeously vibrant and it allowed for a lot more expressionful movement in the faces of the characters than ever before, with the whole story being told without a single real word being spoken, just very expressionful murmuring, and I loved that. And the whole wind conducting and sailing motif is really the heart and soul of it all... Yes the sailing never ends but it gives the game the grand sense of vastness and of exploration that makes it feel like a truly epic adventure, and the at the time 'controversial' cell-shaded style goes together with the big tone and theme of it. The child version of Link is my favourite version of the character, I got Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks initially because of that and they were good games in their own right, if mere shadows of this one. For me it was fun just to explore and do all the side quests and smash the myriad types of Moblins and Chuchus into puffs of purple smoke with your sword! And the boss battles are suitably daunting, my favourite one is the battle against the giant bird, it's so satisfying to crush and conquer with the Skull Hammer the winged beast that swiped your little sister! My one complaint is that it's a bit on the easy side, with only the final extended boss fight against Ganon being genuinely difficult to defeat. It is a bit grindy at points, but that's hardly something to moan about the way I see it, at least it makes you work to progress through it a little. Anyway it's amazingly fun and I'll always love it, as it is a joy and a great classic of video-gaming. Thank you, and may you ride the fair winds of destiny wherever they may lead you!!!. To this day, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker boasts the most charming and visually appealing aesthetic in the entire franchise. This gorgeous game builds off the excellent Ocarina of Time in many ways, though it does feature fewer dungeons than its predecessor. Furthermore, while its core sailing mechanic is a grand time at first, it does eventually wear out its welcome, and late in the game you're forced to utilize it for one of the most tedious quests in any Zelda title.. An amazing piece of work! I love this game. It is very entertaining. The bad thing is the water the ocean is quite extensive but this doesn't mean it's bad it has an amazing soundtrack as well as its design.. I think there is a problem in the brain of those who find the visual, art design and graphics of this game bad.. After OoT, this is the 2nd best 3D Zelda game for me. Timeless art style, best Ganon. This is the best 3D Zelda pre-Breath of the Wild. What you do in between dungeons is actually fun (@Twilight Princess) and the world and music are gorgeous.. The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker is a timeless masterpiece in game design. The world, the combat and the cel shaded art style make this such a unique game. I don't care if it's the nostolga glasses but it's a top 3 Zelda game to me and a top 10 video game in my book. Oh and dare I say the best Zelda soundtrck besides TP and OOT.. Great game for the time it was released and still holds up. Have replayed it again and it’s still so good. Graphics are charming and the story is amazing.. The most beautiful, charming, and funny game I have ever played, this game is way underrated!. If we take away the cursed quest for Triforce Fragments, this game is incredible. A successful atmosphere, endearing characters and much more dynamic gameplay.. The most fascinating and unique Zelda game in my opinion. The ocean world is very big, the story is simple and gripping and the dungeons are fun, albeit very easy. With more development time, there definitely could've been more. It included a bonus Disk with Ocarina of Time, which made this game a phenomenal value for 60 bucks back then in 2003.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The legend of zelda wind waker is timeless im playing this game in 2021 on my game cube and it feels like a breath of fresh air , im so use to games not working on launch , Samey game design , cover shooters and souls like action rpgs mired with micro transactions , most games that have come out recently will be forgotten about within the year. this never happens to any of the legend of zelda games , especially wind waker being just about 20 years old Story: you are a young man whos just aged a year ? YEAh its your birthday and it doesn't tell you how old link is but thats ok , you are gifted the hero of times tunic or at least a replica turns out you are actually a bit player in a historic battle for good an evil fought over the ancient and sunken land of hyrule witch you sail the seas in search mystical powers , BUT first you have to save your sister from that evil. the story is both personal and grand at the same time link starts off just trying to save his sister but ends up in the middle of an ancient war between 2 ghosts , with one of the most violent endings to a legend of zelda game , i can still remember vividly how hard my heart was pounding fighting Gannon for the first time Story: 10/10 World building: now when I was a kid a lot of this **** went over my head and I didn't realize most of what I was seeing or reading , alot of the zelda games are their own thing but this game feels like a sequel to oot not just in story but in world , hyrule is covered by sea the hyrule you knew is covered by sea creating the ocean and island landscapes , this was done by the gods to seal gannons power away witch worked for a while . dragon roost island is likely the top of death mountain , the forbidden forest is the shell of the deku tree from oot with the seedling being the new deku tree , and there are lots of little details like this, links village is obviously descendants of of kokoriko forest seeing as its the closest settlement to the deku tree , windfall must be descendant from hyrule based on teh cloths and culture of the island. i could go on about this game for hours and how much detail there is in the world and its story World building: 10/10 Graphics: wind waker at the time of its release was controversial because it looked like a cartoon , to a 10 year old boy thats nothing it looks like my cartoons , but this stylistic choice has saved the game from ever looking old EVER like i said this is 2021 and this game feels and looks like it hasn't aged a day its really hard to belive this is a 20 year old game , they say the best designs are timeless , the wheel , sliced bread and now wind waker Graphics:10/10 Gameplay: the game play is silky smooth , every bad guy has a weakness to exploit and a strategy to beat them , every dungeon and item are designed wonderfully , its exciting getting new gear in this game because you know you will use it , unlike i the modern day looter shooters where replacing your gear is every 3 minutes , but wind waker everything has a purpose , it will be used , weather its the chu jelly or the pendants , the sword play is silky smooth SILKY SMOOTH you make a mistake its your fault , I'm already pretty decent at this game so i managed to not even die once this whole playthrough , but I didn't feel like the game was too easy it always felt ""just right"" because id still take hits , id still screw up but i knew how to recover . my only gripe with this game is the triforce hunt , I some how managed to find them all without the internet back in the day and this playthrough I used my past knowledge with a little bit of luck , also SO MUCH SAILING it slows the game right down , i know the triforce hunts streamlined in the hd version but this is the game cube version Gameplay: 9.8/10 Sound design: music is fantastic , sound effects fantastic but also annoying at times , doing the outset gauntlet for the triforce shard all i heard was link go "" AHHHHHHHHHH"" for like 10 times in a row going down hole after hole. but those are nit","""windwaker"" is my childhood game, and this game deserves something more than 10 for its storyline and beauty . the remake is even better in my opinion, with better graphics and quality of life changes . overall a great game with an even better remake, with better graphics and quality of life changes ."
300.FIFA Soccer 10,"The graphics are okay for the time of the 6th console generation. The gameplay is okay as long as you can cope with the fact that you won't have the latest version of the game the following year.. Is it lacking features like ultimate team and stuff like that? Yeah. It's a Wii game. This is just a fun, anyone can play, mess around game. I invited some friends who have no clue how to play FIFA to play, told them the controls, put them against each other, and experienced the most bellyaching, six pack laugh I have ever experienced. This is coming from a kid who collects FIFA games. If you are planning on playing this like an average FIFA game, it might not be for you. This is the perfect game to pull out when hanging with a friend and messing around while trying not to die laughing. I love this game.. So perfect bruh. It is more better in everything from PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER 2010 but it has bugs - 7/10. Best game from fifa 2003 Better game play and better mechanicsam With new features. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is unplayable. Passes kept going in directions I wasn't aiming, shots kept going to the moon even with no power on them, team wouldn't defend and would lose the ball if they got within 5 feet of the closest player. They would even run into themselves and both fall over. Players refused to do skill moves and when they did it would be about 5 seconds after I inputed it. In manager mode players I attempted to sign multiple players and they said they had better offers elsewhere despite getting paid less and getting a lower transfer fee. Despite being on the 360 the graphics look so jittery and low res I thought I was playing FIFA 05 while on drugs. After giving my best attempts at the game for over two hours, the game continued to be an unfun and unresponsive mess to the point I figured it wasn't worth mine or anyone else's time and threw it in the trash. I've gotten more fun out of older and newer titles and both have had better controls and difficulty compared to this hot garbage.. Fifa soccer games has always had the distinction of being technically solid, and true to the world of soccer or 'football' and Fifa 10 carries on that just as well as it's predecessors. I played most of my time in Manager Mode and I found it be extremely exciting and playing through multiple seasons to be rewarding. I played as Chelsea and had great pleasure crushing Manchester United over and over again! However, those who play soccer in real life might notice the unbelievable goals that you can have in this game, but I looked past that because I really like the animations of the players and the sounds when you're in the middle of the game and score goals it just really powerful. The crowd animations aren't that good, but luckily you don't have to look at them all that much. This is a really good soccer game, in fact it is one of the best.. I'm reviewing my first sports game rather than the game itself so bare with me. FIFA 10 is very accessible and on the pitch, a decent game. With logical controls, fluent movement of players and ability to customise the level of assistance you want for each action, you can easily tweak the settings to how precise you want to be. Graphics **** like they've always done but that doesn't matter since it's a football game. Framerate is consistent so that's all that matters. On the pitch, FIFA 10 is a fine game. I don't have any interest in the sport and the gameplay is pretty much chasing a ball round a green field for (x) minutes. But even stil, I can respect FIFA 10's efforts. It's everything off the pitch that lets it down. Manager mode is useless unless you want achievements, and very boring as well. Be A Pro is just an RPG kind of thing but really unwarranted in a football game. Oh and EA shut down the servers now so you can't play online or get some of the really easy achievements requiring you to connect to EA servers. Another problem is that, due to the nature of using real life teams, there are balancing ""issues"" (even though they are intentional). Teams are split into tiers and I can imagine that in online play picking your favourite team is not possible, so you're limited to the best teams if you want to win. For me that wouldn't matter but for someone who supports a team I can imagine it to be annoying. If all these silly things like Be A Pro, Manager Mode and all that ""This team is better than this and you will lose because your stats are worse"" was removed- infact if all statistics of players and teams were ommitted, or they were made balanced so teams have certain advantages and disadvantages, it would be fine. But in its attempt to be an all-inclusive game they've put a lot of clutter in that needn't be there. Practice mode is useful, and obviously you can play online or with up to 3 other people on the same console, but everything else is just a waste of space in my opinion.. Minor improvements from FIFA 09, the Ultimate Team feature which you even had to pay for in this game which is outrageous, just EA Sports trying to make some more money from the fortune which they already make. One bad thing about this game is that in FIFA 09 the achievements kept you playing the game which was quite good as at least you got your money's worth. However in FIFA 10 the achievements are unappealing and whereas in FIFA 09 it was to win a match with 10 men, it is now to win a match with 10 men on legendary or higher, what about the players who are not so experienced at FIFA? Overall I think this game was worse than FIFA 09 in all areas (features, graphics, music) and that is unacceptable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fifa 10 is a very good game but the problem is that you can't curl when you shoot also the players don't go down and it doesn't say substitute player Fifa 10 is a cool game but just needs little tweeks to make it special. Good game play and really fun. It was my first soccer game on the XBox 360 after the move from PC (where I played every version since 1998). I liked the dribbling capabilities for the game along with control over the player but at the end of the day, our favourite mode (manager) disappointed us with the ton of bugs :(. This game in a nutshell: the more you watch actual football, the less you'll enjoy this game. While it can be enjoyable, the AI is horrible (doesn't attempt runs, doesn't follow the ball and makes no effort to defend) and most of the time it feels like the other team bought off the ref so they can play like the Netherlands in last year's World Cup.. It may be super easy, but this is by far one of the best sports game ever invented. It made me feel like I was playing an actual game. However, manager mode is full of bugs.. Do not buy this game. The entire QA staff should be chased from the industry. Go look up the glitch reports for this game, a long list of seemingly unmissable horrors makes the Manager Mode, the core of the single player game, unplayable. I have no doubt that **** of this level of polish were made by a smaller studio, the studio would not exist today. Here's to hoping that FIFA 11 addresses the 52 documented terminal glitches and numerous other lapses in quality that render the game, well, bad.","this is the perfect game to pull out when hanging with a friend and messing around . passes kept going in directions I wasn't aiming, shots kept going to the moon even with no power on them, team wouldn't defend and would even run into themselves and both fall over . despite being on the 360 the graphics look so jittery and low res I thought I was playing FIFA 05 while on drugs ."
301.Marvel's Spider-Man 2,"One of the best Spider-Man games ever made, even better than part 1. Very good villains- Venom and Lizard were amazing and Kraven was also cool.. A great game. But I felt it could be more. I loved the new gameplay and character development. I disliked the end, it was too much, too big, and, unfortunately, too distracting.. It's still fun, but pales in comparison to the near perfection of the original. Swinging around the city, the combat, cinematic presentation, and the acting are all on the level of the first (if just slightly below), but the story and the repetitive side missions really bring it down. I think someone on the development team was under the impression that everyone loved the MJ and Harry side missions from the first game. MJ is not at all fun to play as and her reckless stupidity is directly responsible for the major story beats in the game. I like Miles, but his story was undercooked and his side missions were straight garbage. An animation option later in the game had me wishing they just did a separate Spiderverse game for him. It mostly distracted from the more interesting main story with Peter.. They did it again! I'm a huge Spider-Man fan and absolutely loved the last two titles. But with Spider-Man 2, they brought something truly amazing. I know some people might complain about the lack of innovation, but they’ve taken what was already great and refined it to near perfection. I can't wait for the next game from Insomniac!. Great game, but not as great as the first. The movement is amazing, along with side missions being a bit more refereshing and some even contributing a bit to the plot. Overall story was good but weaker compared to the first, although it kinda felt rushed towards the end. Boss fights and all the extra skins/abilities were all very nicely thought out. Overall, it could've been more but it was still good given what we got.. My biggest issue with this title is it feels almost equal to the two predecessors. You will almost doing same things, in the same manner, within the same city. Personally I don’t want a next iteration of this game. Hopefully they made something new, that is what I would like to see next. Insomniac please don’t repeat yourself.. Gameplay wise - it is a good game. Not revolutionary, but good. The dev team did a great job implementing the mechanics, the combat is rewarding, the skill trees are well designed, the map is bigger than in the first two games. TBH after the first few hours, It was was a solid 9. But the treatment of Peters character in this game is abysmal. I do get that it, that the plot was supposed to show the ""baton pass"" but man... All of this felt unearned. Literally throughout the wholegame we are shown how great Miles is and how weak, sloppy and unfit Peter is. This could be done way better, with respect to Pete's character.... Making Black Cat lesbian not even interacting with Peter,only Miles cuz he s black and that side quest for two gays and MJ NOT that hot like how is she supposed to be.This game is woke af and changing Miles costume just gor adidas hell no bro.Gameplay was fun I love the Kraven and Venom story but **** WITH AGENDAS!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Insomniac has done it again another home run! We truly appreciate the work they are doing over there and can’t wait to see what they do with Wolverine & Spider-Man 3. Thank you Insomniac Studios for your incredible storytelling, compelling characters, and hardworking dedication to pushing the Superhero Genre forward.. goat game with goat plot, gameplay, abilities. Venom abilities make you feel like a monster, throwing enemies in all directions. I love this game every single part of my body the best game for the fan the Spiderman. I love the graphics in the game the story is fun and has a nice time length there are some tear dripping missions and fun side missions after the main story. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has a great story, good open-world, great suits, and it is an amazing step up from the last 2 games, fun as well with new traversal abilities, and 2 of the spider-men this time, some glitches here and there but definitely overall amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Start was a bit rough, but the story gets much better later on. Gameplay is awesome and the game itself looks great. Highly recommended.. Best game of 2023 as I loved the storyline, graphics and everything as it has a lot of character.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love this game. It’s an amazing sequel to the first Spider-Man game and Miles morales. I love the Peter + miles duo I think it’s done so well and I’m so thankful that we finally have a health bar for the bosses this time unlike the previous games. The gameplay is satisfying and fluid especially the web swinging and I like the addition of the web wings too. The story is fantastic. Both Kraven and Venom are perfect antagonists and the other additional villains like lizard and Cassidy are great also. Mr negative has the best redemption arc ever and I love the set up for Spider-Man 3. Overall this is much better in comparison with the previous 2 games as it improved upon them further.. I absolutely adored this game. Everything is improved from the previous games. The additions to traversal and combat make this game play even more fluid. The setpieces are breathtaking and an absolute thrill to see play out. I thought the narrative and storytelling were done incredibly well, and I was invested the whole way through. I strongly recommend this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not the best but not the worst. Even after 15 hours it still kinda feels like dlc, but for those who havent played the previous two, sm2 is a must play. Swinging through the city is satisfying. The graphics are outstanding. The gameplay feels solid in all aspects, the story is fun, upgrading each character to have stronger abilities really adds to the progression of the game.. I have no words to describe this game, simply fantastic, an incredible story and wonderful villains that leave us wanting more. They took everything that was good in the first game and improved it for this one.. sequel, a much better story building on the foundations that the previous versions built, improving the gameplay in every possible way while the previous games are already among the best in terms of gameplay, using all the PS5’s powers and turning the game into a completely next-gen game, next-gen visuals, extraordinary and non-repetitive level design, deep characterization at the disposal of the story, use of dualsense’s features, much more entertaining boss fights, much better cutscenes and much better animations. Read More. Can’t see what so good about it. I like traversal but it is all. Storywise first game is much better. A great sequel, better than the first in almost every aspect, except for the story. Otherwise it is fun with amazing gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love the way Insomniac upgraded the gameplay but the game's story is weaker than the first game's plot. And also Miles's character growth behind the camera was too fast. Or maybe I don't understand some details. The presentation was very good, the game has nice action and for this kind of game interesting character moments. But the gameplay is so overloaded, i died multiple times in fights because there is so much attacks you only can dode, other attacks only block and that combined with two attack wheels is to much. And the story is very naive, we have to save every bad guy every murderer. We dont care for civilians or **** that is the problem with almost every superhero plot and not just a problem of this game. I had fun, its one of the best superhero games. Nice graphics, mechanics (although pretty plastic feeling), but the story, narrative and so much ""woke"" stuff made me feel it boring and without teeths. pretty good game, would be even better if they'd stop showing woke bs down your throat every minute. Doesnt offer anything new from miles morales. If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy this too. Great game but next time don't make us play Mary Jane missions again. While a good game, Spiderman 2 does not do much to stand out or differentiate from its peers. If you liked the first two games, you'll like this one.. Spider-Man 2 builds upon its predecessors with better gameplay mechanics and a strong start to its narrative, but it falters in its execution of the final act and its approach to performance on next-gen hardware. While still an enjoyable experience, it doesn’t fully stick the landing, leaving room for improvement in the inevitable sequel. Fans of the franchise will appreciate the effort, but others may find it falls short of expectations.. Does everything better than all the previous games and the traversal system is the best in video game history. A fantastic gaming experience. Credit to the guys at Imsoniac. Honestly, I love this game. The graphics are good, its storyline is beautiful,, and l like how easy it was to play this game.. I know this game is praised by a lot of players, but can't understand why? Story is cringe and pretty bad, fights are interrupted all the time with pointless cut scenes and DEI stuff is ridiculous. Only fun is flying mechanic but this get bored soon.. The swinging through New York is amazing and the fighting system is so much fun. Huge downgrade compared to Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales in every aspect... Even the graphics and performance are way better in Spiderman Remastered... Only good thing is the redemption arc of Martin Li.... the game is really good it was a very fun time and overalll is an upgrade of the first Game. The only small problem i have is that the story is kinda short and i found the story of the first game to be a little bit better. But overall gameplay wise and mechanics its a solid upgrade and a must play for any open world game fan or spider man fan in particular.I would recommend :). this game is very good, but not enough to make it to 10. the story is very short, with 17 hours to beat it, if this game had, at least, 20 hours of story they could make it through to 10, although, this is a must play.. Great. Gameplay, but the characters and story were poorly done. Neutered the characters.. I was really enjoying the combat and story , right up to the point where they introduced parrying. Now I can’t stand the combat, and have no interest in finishing the game. Very dissappointing. Should have been called ""Spider-Man Me Too"". You spend the entire game watching Peter Parker get clowned on and upstaged by his new DEI counterpart.. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PS5 is an absolute blast. Swinging through New York City as both Peter and Miles feels amazing, especially with the new web-wings that make getting around so much more fun. The story dives deep, with tons of emotional moments and intense battles against villains like Kraven and Venom. Each character has their own powers—Peter's symbiote moves and Miles’ venom abilities—which keeps the combat exciting and fresh. The graphics are jaw-dropping, and the city feels alive and vibrant. Overall, it’s a fantastic ride that nails everything you'd want from a superhero game, It's awesome.. Wasnt much to it, and not as good as the original was. Dont really care for the direction they are taking the story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It was a fun story mode with handling symbiotes and helping others even showcasing how spider man should be even the ending of letting Miles be asked to handle the extra trouble while Peter does Peter human things. Just after finished with the objectives for things in it not much else to do.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Almost perfect. There are some bugs in battle, sometimes the commands don't work at time, and woke's stuff in the plot. All that aside, it's actually pretty cool.. I really wanted to love this game but i can't since sweet baby destroyed game's story. Gameplay is really fun, graphics are good, but story is garbabe woke trash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i enjoyed so much this game... i will never forget how smooth the story went.fantastic graphics. GREAT GREAT JOB. More of the same,repetitive gameplay. But the worst is her bloated face. Looks like a disease and she drowned in corticosteroids. Great game.Definitely must buy for fans. Miss some web of shadow playstyle though. Still. Really good game, the new mechanics were amazing. Had a good feeling in game and is overall pretty solid. Waiting for spider-man 3.. The game dives into deeper emotions compared to other Spider-Man games from the past. The gameplay was smooth And interesting all the way until the end. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its flaws but those are forgivable as the 95% of the game is amazing.. When we talk about how high class a game is directed and produced, we are once again talking about Insomniac Games and Spider Man, in this case Spider Man 2. Extremely stable 9/10, in every respect.. Middest game i ever played. It's my first pre ordered game and i regret all of it. Everything about the game is annoying: the combat, the little in-between missions, the constant phone calls. The game has great graphics and epic action pieces though.. As a long time Spider-Man Fan, this game gave me everything I wanted as a sequel from the 2018 game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. pros-good based combat,great first 2 acts storywise cons-3rd act is a little rushed,less gadgets then the first game,and miles evolved suit. story ****, boring characters, boring gameplay,lgbt propaganda,blm propoganda,web swinging is incredible,the most dumb way to make peter weak like worm. The best hero game ever. Great story, surreal graphics, extraordinary gameplay.. The side quests are dumb, boring, and well... How does anyone consider this a good game. Mary Jane...... my god what did they do to her. Sad times, poor game this should have been better written/developed/portrayed. stop hiring bad writer/developers.. Very fun to play. Excellent gameplay. Good story. Well done game. Can't wait for the next one.. The game looks and plays great, but the story is a major step back in comparison to the first game. There are flagrant problems with the character development, the world of the game ends up smaller than it is at the beginning, and the writers don't seem to know what to do with the excess of protagonists. The playable area is bigger, but we have less to do in it, the game is short, and the new characters are all less developed than in the first game, abd some of the old ones, as well. Miles, for instance, is there just to be perfect, as is MJ, and Peter, develops an addiction in two days, in game time, just so MJ, Miles and all the supporting cast can throw it back in his **** in all, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is alright, but should, as the publisher says, be greater.. This game had potential to be even better than the first one (which was the best spider-man since Spider-Man 2 on the PLaystation 2). Unfortunately, Sweet Baby Inc. ensured that any progress made in the technical and gameplay department was overshadowed by a constant presence of pushing their own preachy activist agendas. The sooner game developers learn that Sweet Baby Inc. is losing them money and trust from their community, and cut ties with such poisonous companies, the better. Ultimately, gamers will vote with their wallets - my only regret is that I have no way to refund this game. If these developers don't learn quick and begin focusing on actually making quality games again, they'll quickly learn that we have a large backlog of amazing games that can keep our attention rather than buying new games, and keep our hard earned cash in our pockets.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Improved game.,but mj got a silicone implant on her face so ugly compare to spiderman 1. The next part of Peter and Miles story. Bigger New York with new missions, collectibles and enemies. Combat getting even better with the addition of the symbiotic moves. Another great story with new villains. Game feels shorter than the previous part tho.. Good story and generally good **** you like the first one, you'll love this one as it's even a touch sharper. Technically speaking, it might be one of the best games I've played. The haptic feedback of the DualSense is impressive, and the game runs very smoothly with fast-paced movement through the vast city of New York. The story is entertaining and makes you feel like you're watching a Marvel movie with the quality they've always had (especially compared to movies from a few years ago). The only downside is that it feels like the game was rushed for its release, and many elements that were planned for the story or gameplay were not implemented in the final version.. I didn't like the first game and Miles Morales was okay at best for me, but this game really knocked it out of the park! The only thing I disliked is that some collectibles aren't as interesting as others and the beginning **** is a little slower. They really made a noticeable upgrade upon what they built in previous two games so kudos to Insomniac!. Spider-Man 2 for PS5 brings an exhilarating experience in terms of gameplay, offering smooth mechanics, stunning visuals, and a sense of freedom that fans of the series have come to expect. The web-swinging, combat, and exploration across the vast city of New York are top-notch, delivering a feeling of true mastery over Spider-Man's abilities. Insomniac Games continues to push the envelope on what makes a superhero game fun and engaging, and in that regard, this game **** game absolutely excels in delivering a refined and comfortable gameplay experience. Whether you're zipping through the city with iconic web-swinging or engaging in high-octane battles against villains, everything feels intuitive and fluid. Combat sequences flow seamlessly, with dynamic combo systems, gadgets, and abilities that allow for endless variety in how you approach different situations.Additionally, the visuals are spectacular, highlighting the capabilities of the PS5. The city of New York feels alive, detailed, and vibrant, with excellent attention to weather effects, lighting, and environmental details. However, beneath the surface of this polished experience, there are some glaring issues that detract from the overall enjoyment.Unfortunately, while the gameplay shines, the story leaves much to be desired. The narrative feels rushed, splotchy, and disjointed, especially when compared to the tight storytelling seen in the previous Spider-Man **** story also seems heavily focused on pushing progressive themes in a way that feels forced rather than natural. Many side activities seem more focused on promoting LGBTQ+ themes than on providing meaningful content that enhances the Spider-Man universe. It feels as though these elements are included for the sake of visibility rather than being integrated organically into the ****’s hard not to notice the pervasive presence of progressive values being pushed in nearly every corner of the game. This isn’t a subtle inclusion but more of a constant presence, where you're often hit over the head with it. A lot of this may stem from the fact that Sweet Baby Inc. was reportedly involved in the game's development. This may explain the sometimes awkward insertion of these themes, which don’t necessarily align with the tone of a Spider-Man narrative.Instead of focusing on what makes Spider-Man iconic—a story about personal responsibility, heroism, and sacrifice—the game takes multiple detours to emphasize progressive ideals. For example, side quests that feature LGBTQ+ characters or themes feel less like organic extensions of the plot and more like an attempt to promote a specific agenda. It detracts from the immersion and focus of what a Spider-Man game should be about: action, heroism, and a compelling story that fits the character's **** of the more frustrating aspects of Spider-Man 2 is the forced empowerment of MJ through missions that are not only unnecessary but feel over-the-top. In these missions, MJ appears inexplicably stronger than some of the main characters, to the point where she can incapacitate enemies with a single blow. These segments feel out of place in a superhero game where the focus should be on the heroes who have superhuman ****’s forced prominence detracts from the immersion and pacing of the game. It feels more like a statement about feminism than a natural progression of her character within the Spider-Man universe. The way these missions are handled feels more like an obligatory nod to modern feminist themes than an attempt to enhance the story.Another striking issue is how the narrative positions Miles Morales, the Black Spider-Man, in contrast to Peter Parker. It’s clear that Miles is intended to be the stronger, happier, and more optimistic Spider-Man, while Peter’s struggles are brushed aside or overshadowed. Throughout the story, there’s a noticeable imbalance where Peter’s desires and problems are largely ignored, while the plot focuses primarily on **** result is that Peter Parker—a character fans have loved for decades—seems to be stepping back, gradually moving into the background as Miles takes center stage. While it's understandable to share the spotlight between the two, the narrative seems to favor Miles to the detriment of Peter. By the end of the game, Peter is left in a more secondary role. Spider-Man 2 is a game that shines in its mechanics but falters in its narrative. The excellent gameplay and breathtaking visuals make it an enjoyable experience on a surface level, but the intrusive progressive themes and disjointed storytelling drag it down. For players who simply want a thrilling superhero adventure, the game delivers on that front. However, if you're looking for a well-rounded narrative that respects the core essence of Spider-Man while integrating its themes seamlessly, you may be left wanting.Spider-Man 2 seems torn between being a superhero game and a vehicle for promoting certain agendas.. Masterpiece ****! A showcase to what the ps5 is! I have loved the spiderman trilogy and this makes it a true next gen title. The variety in characters is just world class! One of the best games around. This is the best video-game rendition of Spider-Man so far. It improves upon the first two games in every facet. It’s a tremendous feat that during my 20 hours of gameplay, I didn’t encounter a single dull moment, it’s superbly paced. Every frame is content rich. The only criticism I have is that the boss battles in act 3 are mostly endurance tests, with 3-4 long phases per boss. Overall, it’s a great game and delivers on the hype.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Using the Spider-Man game as a tool to push liberal feminist propaganda by Sweet Baby Inc. No thank you!. This game is great and I enjoyed everything about it. From the story to gameplay The symbiote was absolutely great and Venom was cool wish the game were longer Also if you are mad that MJ looks different and she`s ""not hot anymore"" touch grass. The story-telling is boring. It's a shame that Sweet Baby Inc. helped make Peter Parker a loser. Mary Jane is an ugly self-insert. No Thanks!. While the gameplay is amazing, the story is so boring that it doesn’t even matter. The plot is good. I don't understand people who say that the second part of the DLC is for full price. The Mary Jane's remodel is very bad. LESS LGBT AGENDA IS POSSIBLE. This is already more annoying than pleasing.. The first game is excellent but this second ? Peter Parker becoming a loser who made many errors while Miles Morales become the heros by excellence ( even though he has less experience...). Abusing Spider-Man for a new “Right” Spider-Man. I agree with Peter Parker when he's in the symbiote “I'm the hero here, not you!”. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great story with a beautiful New York City to explore, not a perfect game but brilliant nonetheless, I think we should have seen more from Venom too.. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was highly anticipated by fans, but the game's inclusion of Sweet Baby Inc.'s story consultation has left a sour taste in many players' mouths. Known for its openly misandrist views, the company's influence is evident throughout the narrative. The game's portrayal of male characters is particularly troubling. They are often depicted as weak, incompetent, or outright villainous. The female characters, on the other hand, are portrayed as strong, capable, and morally superior. This blatant misandry is not only offensive but also detracts from the overall quality of the game. Beyond the offensive portrayal of male characters, the gameplay itself is repetitive and lacks depth. The combat is often clunky and the story is predictable. The game's attempt to be edgy and provocative falls flat, resorting to gratuitous violence and offensive language. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a disappointing game that is marred by its misandrist themes and lackluster gameplay. It's a shame that such a promising concept was executed so poorly by a company with such a harmful agenda.. The game is great but the wind tunnels kinda takes away the whole “web-slinger” aspect. Such a fantastic experience. Loved every minute of that. The graphics and traversal are amazing.. has involvement with sweet baby inc. narrative and story change (it's more like a dlc than a full game). Pros: swinging, graphics, abilities Cons: I really don't like the design that you have to beat a boss 3-4 times to finish a battle. It feels like there should have been a cleverer design in some way. The battels with minions can also become repetitive pretty quickly.. Incredible game! (Masterpiece) | Marvel's Spider-Man 2 | 95 Points (4,5 Stars) | Story 9P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 8P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 8P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. I had a lot of bugs. The mission design is not good and the story is disappointing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is great, however, it is almost a carbon copy of the original Spider-Man game for PS4,with slightly revamped combat, traversal mechanics, and a new story. The larger map is nice, and there is a lot more to do overall, but the game doesn't do much to expand on it's predecessor.. Boring, dull, and any story elements feel bland with its worst part being 2 main characters with miles having almost 0 part in the story till the end making this rushed experience disappointing to say the least. When it comes to gameplay, the beauty and smoothness of the game are truly outstanding. The game is both fun to play and visually breathtaking, making this aspect a perfect 10 for **** new features and the way the game utilizes the PS5 hardware were also pleasant surprises, with the instant travel feature being particularly impressive.However, the story is where the game falls short for me. Starting with the characters: MJ looks drastically different from the first game—her new appearance is off-putting and breaks my immersion every time she’s on screen. Peter was also recast, and while I got somewhat used to it after playing Miles Morales, it still doesn’t sit well with me. This is a negative point, especially since the story is central to these Spider-Man games.Peter is supposed to be Miles' mentor, but in this game, it feels like they've deliberately made Peter less competent, with Miles often portrayed as the more capable one. This dynamic was frustrating to watch. Finally, the story itself was disappointing. Unlike the first game and Miles Morales, this one didn’t resonate with me. Kraven was underutilized, and the Venom plot felt confusing and unsatisfying. I place a high value on story in games, and that’s why, despite the game being a technical masterpiece, I’m deducting significant points from the final score. It simply lacks the narrative strength that made the previous games so compelling.. This game is my favorite game off all games I've ever played. .. It was my most anticipated game in a long time. And it didn't disappoint. I love this game. May not be perfect, but it's amazing. I loved the gameplay, but the 3 act of the story is a little bit boring. other than that the game is amazing. This is the best game I have played in recent days. I am not much ****. I own ps4 and will play whenever I feel so. I just for playing this game I rented an ps5 and it seriously worth my money. Good game and good screenplay. Completed this game in 3.5 days as it’s a rent and I can never stop playing. :). I play this game 6 time, is perfect the sequel of the original Marvel's Spider-man. I love the story, but the 3°ACT is a little boring. The gameplay it's good but the game has not Update or DLC. How would anyone consider this a good game. The mini activities crammed into missions is so boring. This reminds me of the Atreus missions in God Of War. I see a PC in my future PS5 will probably be my last console. No innovation here Sony Spider-Man 2 is extremelyboring. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game for rainbow people and their *right* fantasies, worst game about Spider-man I've ever played. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a standout entry in the series, delivering an exhilarating and emotionally resonant superhero experience. With its engaging storyline, stunning visuals, and fluid gameplay, it captures the essence of being Spider-Man in a vibrant and immersive open world. While some side missions can feel repetitive and certain plot points predictable, the game excels in providing a dynamic and entertaining adventure for both Peter Parker and Miles Morales. The dual protagonists, memorable villains, and expansive content make Marvel's Spider-Man 2 a must-play for fans of the web-slinger and open-world action games.. Fantastic! Better than the first one, especially with the addition of the symbiote, which lets you play a segment as Venom himself. I loved that innovation. Despite some minor issues similar to those in the first game, such as playing segments with Mary Jane, the game is wonderful. It’s an experience that truly stands out.. This game is absolutely amazing. They made everything from the previous games even better, The story is amazing and very impressive. This game is a must-play for everyone witha ps5. One of the best and most impressive experiences of the 9th generation. It is a game that needs no explanation and shows the power of PS5.. With an amazing soundtrack, some innovations, a really good design with amazing graphics, and with a predictable story, this game was just what i expected, the original, but slightly better.. Incredibly disappointed. I love the other 2 games, but this one was just a massive disappointment, a 4 year wait and I 100%d the game in a day. Should of just been a dlc for the first game, Don't spend your money on this. Amazing gameplay spoiled by a disgusting cut-down plot influenced by everyone's favorite evil corporation. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you are willing to put up with at best mediocre story (especially compared to the first game) same boring repetetive and childish open world activities and woke agenda go for it. If you are looking for a great superhero game experience don't buy this. instead get first marvel's spider-man or arkham trilogy. although I will say swinging in the open world feels amazing with assist turned off and boss fights are better compared to the first game.. Negatives first, story is a little muddled mainly in the la",the story and repetitive side missions really bring it down . i think someone on the development team was under the impression that everyone loved the MJ and Harry side missions from the first game . overall story was good but weaker compared to the first .
302.The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD,"It's the original but better. I do think that the original looks better in some situations but it never really affects gameplay. Speaking of which has been improved by adding a new sail to make your ship faster and shortening the Triforce quest. I would recommend getting this one over the original.. It's a fun cartoonish Zelda game for the WiiU, It's still glitchy but fun to watch speedrun.. My personal favorite game of all time. Absolutely amazing world, incredible graphics, some of the best music in gaming history, the first time Zelda's made a good companion character, a top 2 story in the series, just play this game. This remake still feels like it came out this year.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfect remaster to the original game. Swift sail makes replaying the game and navigating way easier, and the shortened Triforce quest is welcome.. The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker is outstanding. From the score, to the gameplay and the story. Everything blends together to make what could be considered the series’ magnum opus. On top of that is a pleasing visual style to boot.. Peak Zelda. Peak gameplay. Peak story. Peak art style. You cannot get more Zelda than this game. Everything about it is so good. The song the goes with you while travelling the great sea just inspires you to travel more. While finding the Triforce can be seen as a low point, I believe that it makes the game the pirate adventure that it was already succeeding at doing before. Also Link stabbing Ganondorf in the head after doing a backflip is pure aura.. One of the best games ever made. This game is actually far more loved 20 years after than it was on the release. A must play for sure!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is amazing by far my personal favorite and the improvements the hd remake give it make the game almost perfect.. This Game Has such good vibes, I love it, plus the best version of Ganondorf, ""I Coveted That Wind... I Suppose"". Nice game, i like **** Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup.. In 2024 The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD feels like a little bit slow when it comes to the gameplay in the boat but the charming graphics, collectables and story will keep you playing it. This is without a doubt one of the best Zelda stories to date and one of the most memorable game experiences of all time. Love it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Once you get past the wild change in graphics it’s an amazing captivating game. this game has won my heart. <3. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Havent played the GC version, but the art style and graphics amazed me and like every 3d Zelda game its almost perfect with very few flaws with the soundtracks being just masterpieces.. Really relaxing classic zelda. The only negative i can think of is the very frequent menuing due to item switchting and the occasional confusing riddle. It could ve been like 2-3 hrs shorter overall but its a must play non the less.. This is my favorite game of all time. Please play it; it’s perfect in every way.. A classic Zelda game that manages to set itself apart from the rest — unique graphics, playful character designs, enchanting music, and a surprising plot. The swift sail and the 2nd screen are marked improvements. It's fun to sail the open seas and discover new islands (but it can still get tedious late-game). The parry mechanic is cool but the combat is too easy to make it a required skill. Overall, this game is just charming as all get-out. Oh, and Tower Of The Gods is a banger of a dungeon!. I wanted to love it as much as I thought I would, but it simply wasn't a great time any time I wasn't in one of the primary 4 or so dungeons. The world is so big yet so empty, and just served to get in the way of the fun dungeon puzzles and fights.. This game is great on another level. The gameplay, the puzzles, the dungeons, everything is fun to do. The puzzles don't get repetitive and the dungeons are some of the best I've ever played in a Zelda game. Don't let the cartoon art style fool you. This game's graphics in the HD version are incredible. Every playthrough I've done hasn't bored me like other Zelda games. This is a game I recommend to anyone. Even non Zelda gamers.. After more than 20 years, this game still holds up and its all thanks to the all so perfect and amazing toon style. Plus its fun to control and the story is so good. And this Wii U port just makes this masterpiece even better.. Wind Waker HD is a huge improvement of the original, which is a great way to experience this amazing game. The visuals are stunning and there are some other stuff added to make things easier. This game is amazing. Great dungeons, a huge astounding map to explore, no loading times when arriving in locations and a very unique artstyle to the series which fits perfectly with the sea/pirate theme. Also, the soundtrack is what you would expect to be like in every Zelda game. A must play game.. Traveling these seas is wonderful and the ending is amazing from the gamecube era so far it remains a masterpiece with cartoon graphics. I never played the original but from what I gather this is just the original but with better graphics. I love this game, the only flaw is sailing for the blue orb.. All the strength of the original are here with Quality of life changes its one of the best ways to play the game though their are some small Easter eggs taken out of this version like bombing Beatles ship no longer makes smoke come out of his ship and while the game looks great the original looks more like a cartoon compared to the remake and when compared with an upscale version of the original it arguably looks better though I'm not sure weather or not I entirely believe that it just means a definitive version of the wind waker no longer exists it'd be nice if Nintendo released it for the switch maybe with its own master quest mode and lost dungeons. This game confirms that Tingle is a serial murderer and link aids him in his escape from prison in HD. I prefer Wind Waker over Breath of the Wild, and you know how excited I was when they announced the game will be ported to HD, and it looks fantastic.. One of the best Zelda games and 100% worth it to buy a Wii U for. It fixes on all of the issues of the original and keeps true to the experience. My only complaint would be that the bloom effect looks weird on some places, but other than that it’s great.. Really enjoyable climax to a fabulous looking game, but a bit flat in parts early on. Lovely stuff overall though.. The WInd Waker was already timeless with its unique graphics and great gameplay, so now with upgraded graphics, better color saturation, and improved gameplay, it truly is a masterpiece! Although most argue that the dungeons are fairly weak, they are still Zelda dungeons. They really can't be bad. The Triforce hunt has been shortened which is a huge plus over the original, shortening it by a couple of hours. This game is for sure worth your money. Get it before its gone!. One of the best games on WII U, one of the best games ever released, one of the best games in my life.. The story, gameplay and dungeons are all top notch in this game. The graphics in this game are beautiful. The triforce shard quest is way less tedious in this game and with the addition of the swift sail, sailing is way faster. Definitely my favorite Zelda game.. this game is a master piece. i honestly cant be bothered typing out a whole ass review so imma just mention one part at the very end of the game after beating ganondorf, ""that land will not be hyrule... IT WILL BE YOUR LAND"" if im being honest that one moment is my favourite moment from any game I've ever played and really elevates this game to god tier, if you havent played it yet then it might sound a little crazy that one singular line has effected my opinion **** so much but it will make sense once youve seen it happen tldr: go play this game now. The most beautiful, charming, and funny game I have ever played, this game is way underrated!. WW is my all time favorite. Really good HD port of the game on the WiiU. Personally I liked the ""cartoon"" graphics and the whole setting. Sadly there's no more Miiverse support, but that's not a game breaker. Nice texture improvements and other qol things. Set the sails!. The original was amazing and was filled with so much adventure. The same is true for The Wind Waker HD. Also, I love being able to play this on my Wii U as the HD remgyioygfiake looks spectacular.. Swift sail alone makes this version worth it. I don't understand how you could put up with the sailing mechanics without it.. Amazing graphics and story, but you are very likely to get stuck, even if you've played other games in the series.. The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker the story of the Hero of time regain the Mastersword to restore peace to the land of Hyrule awaken the wind waker to sail the Great Sea's and Ocean's of Hyrule so as to defeat Ganon with the Mastersword once again in the great story of the Hero of time The Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker great Platforming fun addictive gameplay another great Zelda game to add to ur Legend of Zelda Collection. :). Great visuals/art style. This was my first Zelda game, and it's still my favorite.. The first zelda game i played and by far the best of the franchise. All in this game is perfect and thinked. I am giving this game a nine because of the slowliness of the story at the begining. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which has many puzzles but smoothly integrates them into environments in the game. When confronted with a river of lava, you have to figure out how to throw water jugs in the right pattern so that you can cross the river. When you are in a dungeon where the doors are opened and closed by a complex series of switches, you must figure out how to use items found in the dungeon (statues, etc.) to flip the switches so you can successfully get through all the doors. Some of these are quite complex; for example, some enemies in the dungeon are paralyzed when light falls on them. To get the doors open, you must lure the enemies onto the right switches and then shoot flaming arrows near enough to paralyze them to keep the door open so you can run out. But in all cases, the puzzle elements are natural parts of the environment, and the goals of solving the puzzle are direct goals of the player’s avatar.. An entertaining game with both flaws and great elements It’s a good game, but not perfect. Let me start eith tbe cons. It’s sooo repetitive with 49 treasure charts of which 80% or rupees that you don’t need. All enemies get best beaten by a parey attack or the grabbing hook, which again with the moderate size of enemies becomes a bit of drag. Whenever there was a build up of stronger enemies ur already waiting for the darknuts to arrive. One thing that really stood out is that I never had to buy arrows and only 3times bombs in the whole game. You keep being on 5000 rupees with nowhere to spend them on, One orher thing is that the game doesn’t tell you about the golden statues and how to obtain them as a person who played the first time without a strategy guide that is unacceptable. I don’t want to need to resort to the Internet to complete something. There are some great rhings about the game too. Windfalls village is near to perfect and the implementation of enemy parts and their weapons is great! Most of the side quest are great. And there’s so great stand outs like with Maggie. The Rito and Koroks have become staples of the series. And this the first -non sequel- game that was trying to build some lore. Overall this is 100% a true Zelda game. It got hindered by having to cut elements because of release deadlines. And that must have influenced decisions. I’m reviewing after completing it for the first time. The first time I cleared all the main dungeons and got put off by the triforce fetch quest. But as a true Zelda fan I had to finish the game completd with all charts, hearts and figurines. Which lesves me to the questions: is it replayable. Twice is MORE then enough If you are a Zelda fan, stop reading and play this game once from start to finish .. improves on every flaw the original had to make a perfect adventure game. this is what remakes should strive to be.. I think Zelda Wins Waker is my favorite game of all time. The gameplay of the original is the first game I’ve watched on YouTube and I loved it so much even if I wasn’t playing. I even re-watched the entire series a lot. When this version came out I was so **** happy. Everything about this game is great and I think it’s the best in the Zelda series (which is already saying a lot) if not even one of the best of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Improving nearly every aspect on the surprisingly incredible Gamecube game. Wind Waker HD not only looks better than ever, but also improves so many mechanics that kinda got a bit frustrating in the original. Sailing feels more epic than ever, the ending quest isn't as irritating as the original, and the graphics make this game better looking than ever. It just shows how to make an already awesome game and make it even better!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It was super fun, but was a bit boring at times, and the parrying ****. The best thing that comes from the remake is the visuals.. To start with i have to say that this is the first Zelda game i ever played back when i got my Gamecube console, so i wasn't affected by the cartoon design of Link which i know displeased fans back then. This game really gives me so many memories, it has a really awesome story that the beginning might sound a bit simple but then you find out and it gets really deep and there is a mayor plot twist later on the game. The characters were really charming and had very good design, maybe puppet Ganon was the only one i disliked tho because it didn't look intimidating enough. What i loved the most about this game is the exploring part, it really had an open world or should i say sea, and this was way before open world games were a thing, which unfortunately this exploring it lacks of in other games of the series like skyward sword. The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker is not only my favorite Zelda game, is also my favorite game of all time! I really would give all my rupees if there was a remake of the Phantom Hourglass on a much powerful console such as the Switch.. Excellent game (perhaps the best one of the Zelda series), hopefully some day it gets ported to the Switch.. A timeless art style and charming storyline do a lot to save this game from its less appealing elements, like an empty overworld and a distressing dungeon count.. This was the first Zelda game I´ve ever played, and I love it. It has a great emotional meaning for me and it´s so good. in the Wii U it looks so beautiful, I really got in love with this game.. The thing The Wind Waker has going for above all other pre-BOTW Zeldas is its unrivaled sense of exploration and freedom. There's nothing quite like staring at the Great Sea and looking at the silouhettes of distant islands, waiting to be discovered. Wind Waker has one of the largest worlds in all of Zelda. But in a way, this is kind of a delusion, since most of the game's 49 island are really small in size. This was a slightly disappointing thing to realize, but we cannot forget that this is a 2002 game. Still, I think the game would have greatly benefited from including an additional large-sized island such as Dragon Roost or Windfall. Wind Waker's gameplay feels like a swift evolution of Ocarina and Majora. The combat is fun, introducing the ability to utilize enemies' weapons. One gripe I have with the combat is that Z-targeting feels really clunky and limited. You have to be really close to an enemy in order to target it. As for items, Wind Waker has a fantastic selection, and I really appreciate how useful most of the items are. It's not like Twilight Princess, where most items become souvenirs of their respective dungeons. Here you can even use most items in combat, like stealing treasures from foes with the grappling hook, or killing a miniboss with a single fire arrow. Wind Waker's dungeons are enjoyable and memorable, but I wish they included more difficult puzzles. As it is now, I think it's probably the easiest set of dungeons in any 3D Zelda. As most people know, Wind Waker had a rushed development cycle, and one dungeon was cut off from the game. This is truly a shame. It's not that the game feels incomplete as it is, but an additional dungeon would have certainly made it even more well-rounded. The story is simple but good, and contains plenty of cool references to Ocarina of Time. Wind Waker also has the most interesting and mature Ganondorf of any Zelda game. The world of the game feels lively and is packed with secrets to find. The art style speaks for itself, there's nothing I can say about it, aside that it looks great. Music is also good. It's not my favorite Zelda soundtrack, but that's just a matter of personal preference. The Wii U edition features a very good graphical overhaul, but I still think the original game looks better in some specific aspects. Some people won't like the amount of bloom effect this remake employs. This remake also introduced a faster sail for the boat, which is very appreciated, but it kind of defeats the whole point of controlling the wind direction with the wind waker. I think it is good for aliviating the tedium of travelling all over the map in end-game quests, but I also think the game gives it to the player way too early. This remake also cut parts of the infamous triforce quest, but I won't be commenting on that since I never played the original. Finally about the Wii U version, I have to say that framerate drops can be just baffling at times, and there's way too much pop-in in the great sea. Come on Nintendo, the Wii U is more capable than that. Boarding the King of Red Lions and setting sails into the unknown, that is what makes this game special among Zelda titles. Wind Waker is a game that has aged exceptionally well. It's no wonder people love it so much. It has its rough edges, sure, and it could be better in some areas, but it is still highly enjoyable if you like Zelda games or adventure games in general. Score: 9.1 -. I've never actually played this game on the Wii U. Only on the GameCube. I've watched a friend play it on the Wii U and wanted to get myself a Wii U but never could. I got so many memories of playing this game on the GameCube and I absolutely love the art style, the characters and the monsters too, especially the chuchu's!! Exploring across the sea with our boat king haha. Seaguls singing in the sky. I want that on the Switch to recreate those memories. Soooo Nintendo it would be very lovely and i'd be very happy if this was released onto the Nintendo Switch!!. I don't usually buy remastered games but the truth is that this game is mandatory for Wii U. A zelda at the level of the saga and at the same time, different in the artistic section. Essential.. Believe it or not, i love this game way more than Ocarina Of Time. The game is really fun and does not make me want to smash my head on the wall unlike most other puzzles in OOT and Breath Of The Wild(The game is still awesome though!). The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and probably one of the best in the entire series. The story is meh. And as a remake, this game fulfills its purpose by building on the original Wind Waker. The puzzles are fun, the gameplay is fun and the graphics look amazing even today. So, do yourself a favor and either pick this game up for your Wii U or download a Wii U emulator and play this game, one of the best Zelda games of all time.. Very good game. Maybe a little childish and naive, but the feeling of adventure and the atmosphere are wonderful. When I was a teenager and the original Wind Waker came out, it blew my mind, I loved the art style and the sense of adventure, everything seemed perfect except for some minor issues, now replaying it, I see why I loved it (I still do) however, its flaws are more noticeable. As far as remasters go, this HD revisión pretty nails it, the cel-shaded effect is not exactly the same but it looks good, there are not a lot of modifications which make your experience more or less the same as the original, one welcomed addition is the introduction of a faster boat veil which is not tied to the direction of the wind, this veil comes at 2/3 of the game, so is more like an endgame item and doesn't affect your playthrough as intended. Another addition is to change items with your Wii U Pad, you don't need to pause the game in order to access your items, however, the game was not intended for this active system, so at least when you're fighting, expect to pause the game and change your item or be prepared for some annoying moments otherwise. There is also a message system (that was replaced with the GBA compatibility of the original) which sounds a lot like the message system of Dark Souls but it was part of the Miiverse ecosystem that has long gone, so I couldn't try it at all. As for a Zelda game is a solid entry, although it has pretty noticeable flaws, the most important to me is its linearity, from the start and till completing 1/3 of the game, you can't sail to wherever you like, your boat, in a Fi fashion (from Skyward Sword) will tell you that he doesn't recommend you to go to ""X"" way and reallocates you to the right way, this is pretty upsetting since the sea is there for you to conquer it but you can't. Another thing is the difficulty, you can play it in Hero mode from the start which is nice but is still pretty easy, the enemies with a few exceptions have pretty noticeable attack patterns, so you will be exploiting them a lot, also the dungeons are OK with the last one being pretty bad and annoying, the boss fights are fun but also incredibly easy and formulaic. For the good aspects, I loved the story, it has some nice twists and turns and also thanks to the art style it also tells it in an expressive fashion like no other Zelda before, to me there is no better iteration of Ganondorf, it feels like a human and he gives one of the most memorable fights and moments at the end of the game, it makes worth your time just to see what I'm talking about. Once you break the linearity barrier, Wind Waker offers a nice freedom of exploration, for budget reasons, there are not a lot of islands like towns (there are like 3 only) but in every island or ""corner"" of the sea is a treasure or a secret waiting for you, so it gives a nice sense of exploration, merge it with an outstanding score (which was also rearranged but is still true to the original) and you will have an amazing time onwards. As for the art style which was heavily criticized back in the day, it has aged like wine, maybe it was developed that way because of budget reasons but it turned out great, Link and every character has a lot of soul, mainly because it's easy to see their expressions through their eyes or animation. Maybe in some aspects, WW has not aged that well, but in anothers it broke the pass of time, is not a hardcore Zelda by any means but it has a lot of charm and pleasure to be had nonetheless, I think this is a nice introduction to the Zelda universe to a newcomer or someone that is not that ""hardcore"" with videogames.. Recently, everybody has been going on about Zelda's like Breath of the Wild non-stop. But I don't think it holds a candle to the masterpiece that is the Wind Waker HD. It essentially took every complaint large or small, against what was already one of the best games of all time... and completely outdid themselves. I mean, a personal and well thought out story with a mid-game plot twist, check. An expansive and revolutionary game world, check. Multiple interactive and rewarding Majora's Mask style side quests, check. An art style that has aged beautify, check. Very well thought out dungeons and bosses, check. This game has it all and is truly a must-play for any Zelda Fan.. For years I had been wanting to give The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker a second chance, and thanks to Nintendo I got to play this game beautifully remastered on the Wii U, and I'm glad that was the case because the power of HD really brought out the beauty of this great game. Despite the fact that the majority of the largest plot points were spoiled for me prior to playing it, my enjoyment of the game was not hindered in the slightest. The characters were fun and colorful, and the art was a fun change in the classic franchise. I do wish the game had more side quests available beyond treasure maps, which to me left a lot of wasted potential with such a big sea. But I'll give them credit that with it being a Gamecube game there was only so much they could do, and the amount of content in Windmill Village made up for it. Wind Waker may not have made my top favorite Zelda games list, but it definitely made for an amazing experience I'm sure I'll relive again one day.. its nice but some way boring . i dont like water in games and dont like sail around for hours. While the original is fondly remembered as the gem it is, I don't think enough people got the chance to experiment this ""newer"" gem due the wii u low sales. The remake only enhances the already good game, and its world looks even prettier. Almost makes me hope theres a switch version too just so more people can experiment what Im considering the best rendition of Wind Waker (and thus one of the best zelda games). Very nice looking game with satisfying combat and decent puzzles. This game is best for gamers new to the Legend of Zelda franchise.. Wind Waker HD breaks past every other game in one key aspect - its childlike sense of discovery and adventure. Being my first Zelda game, setting off on a voyage was a trip into a series full of amazing characters, difficult dungeons and timeless stories, and WW is the perfect example of this. 10-10. Just awesome. Except Forsaken Fortress. It’s just Metal Gear Solid in a Fortress.. An amazing remaster of a spectacular Legend of Zelda game. By fixing some issues Nintendo made this great Gamecube game not only look and perform even better but also look like it is a modern video game.. The user score for WWHD and WW went from 9.0 to 8.9, so I'll give the score this game deserves like I did with the original. 10/10. The thing is I did not play this game on the gamecube but I still think this game is a masterpiece. With different islands and sailing it makes the game feel like a true adventure. Plus if you pick the main quest or side quests they are just as fun as each other. Thus giving the player more freedom on what to do and when to do it. Which means at the end of the game there will be a bad mini quest. OH CRAP THERE IS! Luckily it is not to bad. Unlike the gamecube version where IT ****. It still feels right at home. But I think the boss with ganon is underwhelming. But I give this game a near perfection rating of 9.7/10 ( It will still be a 10 on the website ). A stunning masterpiece in every sense of the word. + The game is beautiful, and is one of the few Zelda games to have not aged a day, mostly due to the amazing cell shaded art style + The story is actually quite dark, and is really engrossing and fun + the world begs to be explored, and sailing the Great Sea is one of the best things to do in a Zelda game. + This game has easily the best iteration of Ganondorf. He actually has a character with motivations other than a generic evil guy. + The sidequests are really fun, and the minigames are some of the best in the series. + The music is ungodly. +The gameplay actually has a lot of depth to it, which is much appreciated. + Every dungeon is really well deigned and immensely fun to run complete + Medli automatically makes this game at least an eight. - The triforce gathering segment, while greatly improved over the original, is still quite boring. the mini dungeons are really fun, but paying tingle to unscramble three charts is not very fun. This game is great. First off the art style is charming and beautiful, and there is not a single part of the game that wasn't visually stunning. It is a lengthy adventure with an amazing sound track and fun dungeons...Except for one, leading to the problems. First off, the pacing in the game is really wonky, going from an extremely slow and dull first mini-dungeon to a fast-paced sailing section. Also, one of the later dungeons, the Wind Temple, was confusing to the point where it had no enjoyment in it, just torment, despite it using one of my favorite items in the series. Overall, this game is pretty good, but has many flaws.. wind waker HD the first Zelda game I ever played and it ensured it would not be the last. It has memorable characters and a very good story with an emotionally satisfying ending that leaves me with a warm feeling in my heart when I think of this game. The art style is beautiful and the open world of the great sea is fantastic with great looking water, dynamic gameplay and a whole host of unique islands to explore. The dungeons, bosses and puzzles are fantastic. The enemies are unique, easily distinguishable and blend interesting and amazing combat with their personality and have I mentioned the terrific music? Overall this is one of my favourite games of all time and will always have a place in my heart as my first Zelda game.. The quality of the sea in this game is beautiful you feel want to go every place of the map. The character is cute and it made everything better by changing to HD. The idea of the item and playing different type of music is something that is used in a lot of zelda series but this one had a lot of different types used in different stages.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I generally don't support HD remaster of Nintendo's games because it is a cheap money grab tbh, however I am not dissatisfied to play this game on the WII U than playing it on a Gamecube emulator (Who's for a Mario Sunshine remaster?). I hesitate between giving this game a 9/10 or a 10/10, let's be honest the game is not perfect, however it is still one great Zelda title and one of my favourite. It was the very first Zelda open world and honestly it was like infinitely better than Zelda BOTW. The musics were great, the visuals are wonderful (Even on Gamecube), there were many dungeons with interesting puzzles. What I'm also happy that this game luckily doesn't have are enemies whilst you are on the ocean with your boat (That joy was ruined with Phantom Hourglass). The story is EXTREMELY innovative compared to other Zelda games at first, but the plot spoils the fun. **** off Ganondorf please) I loved navigating on this gigantic ocean to find treasure chests and new islands. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who's interested into Zelda's franchise.. Most stylish Zelda game of all time, improved Trioforce quest, added faster sail and remixed music. And it's just a wind waker, great game. A waste that you can't turn off the shaders.. Did not like it. It peaked at about a third of the way into the game and then it was a lot of wandering around and looking for help online. I think they meant for this to have a social media element and maybe that was helpful in the beginning, but no more. On the Wii U store this has a 5 star rating. I don't see how that is. It plagiarized the sailing element from the PC Treasure Adventure game, but it's not fun. When so much is optional, it starts to become trivial, (side missions) and therefore boring. The fact that it's not Link and and it's sort of Zelda detracts from the story too. I spent a lot of time swimming in the water trying to get back to my boat and it ****. The ship fights are okay, but become repetitious. Other th","perfect remaster to the original game. Swift sail makes replaying the game and navigating way easier, and the shortened Triforce quest is welcome . this game is amazing by far my personal favorite and the improvements the hd remake give it make it almost perfect ."
303.Portal,"Absolutely loved this game! Funny, fun, just the right amountof challenge. Honestly already worth buying a gaming computer!. Short and simple. I don't mind how short this game is because how much it packs into its ~2 hour run time is fantastic. It's funny, its incredibly enjoyable, and it might have one of my favorite speedrunning scenes of all time.. portal 2 is better, but despite it's short duration of the game, i'ts worth trying it out 100%8/10. Another classic from Valve. Excellent game mechanic involving connected portals that can be placed on specific surfaces to solve puzzles. A little on the short side but still an excellent game.. there's nothing wrong with it. I just cannot bring myself to give it a 10. If I give portal 2 a 10 I cannot give portal 1 a 10, 2 is just so much better in every way that it doesn't even feel like a competition. I wanted to try it in 2024 because it was one of the classics. And i must say although the start was a bit slow, the games was really fun. Very creative job for just a simple mechanic. My score is an 8 because the game is as i said a bit slow at the start, but the end is really good. The community is healthy and if i played this in 2007 I would rate it a 9.. Portal is actually a very nice game, compared to other Valve games where adrenaline is high, it is a calm game and it is about solving puzzles. The puzzles are also easy. However, there is something like this. It is not enough to understand some levels. In some places, you have to hit the portal at such an angle that it makes a level a torture. As I said, there is no problem other than that.. Such a simple but fun game that has interesting puzzles and utilizes its main feature in many ways just allowing it to be all but better in everyway with the most surprising thing being that its just an addon for the orange box which shows how good valve can be.. Proof of concept - and I guess that's what this game was supposed to be. Well yeah, so it was decent for what it was?. This is my favorite game, I think the game puzzles are incredible, I had a lot of fun playing, I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who has the opportunity, I recommend it.. a bit short but a great start for the portal franchise it isnt too bad for a start but could be better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ah so fun to play Portal 1,2 in a binge. It's fun now, but how sensational was it when it first came out?. The concert for portal is one of the best not gonna lie and the whole portal thing was made by 10 people but it's super depressing. It is so story-rich and puzzling, it's good the first time, then better the next! Buy it with the orange box.. A brilliant idea that turned into a really unique puzzle game that becomes the poster child of it's own genre. portal is great. it has very well designed puzzles, and it is just a good game to crack out in a weekend and never play again. 7/10. Unique puzzle game which, even though it's short, is sure to test your problem solving skills in the latter stages of the game.. This is another example of Valve being a leading innovator in the industry. At the time there was nothing quite like Portal and now its hard not to see its fingerprint on most modern puzzle games. Smart, funny and completely enjoyable.. Great game, I loved it. I played Portal 2 first when I was a kid so I have more experience with that, but this had nice puzzles and will keep you satiated with its mechanics and story the whole way through.. Great Enjoyable Puzzles, But Sadly It Has No Replayplity Value, Glados is A great Protagonist, it's Very Entertaining Game.. Impossible to figure out just how much Portal has bled into literally every other game made since. Actually insane that a game almost 20 years old is still just as good as when it was released. If released today, it would of course be rated much MUCH lower, but that's an impossibility because games today owe their success to portal at least to some extent.. Lived up to the hype. The end might have been the best part and the dialogue at the end was hilarious. Even the credits were entertaining. A piece of PC gaming history for good reason.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun to play, good atmosphere. Love puzzles. 9/10 gameplay 8/10 graphics 9/10 story 10/10 environments. This game is very fun,there are moments where you are stuck and dont know what to do but you have to get smart,very fun game. It is engaging, intelligent, balanced and hilarious. A perfect game. Unforgettable.. Who thinks the lore here is 100 times bigger than the gameplay?. It was perfect.PERFECT.Down to the last, minute details.Only thing i dislike about this game is that it merely has one hour of gameplay.Sure the level design, lore and everything, it is crystal clear that it was not easy for the developers to make this game and i appreciate the underlying effort.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think i even liked the first game more than the second one. Sure the second one was longer but everything seemed to be destroyed.. Perfect, aside from being a little too short. Sometimes having a short game is kind of nice though, with how many 50 hour slogs there are now.. puzzle and story is great. Makes me think twice. but graphic is so-so. Because it came out in 2007.. Portal, released in 2007, is a triumph of game design, creativity, and wit. This puzzle-platformer, set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories, delivers an experience that is not only groundbreaking but also unforgettable. Portal's innovation in gameplay and storytelling sets it apart as a true masterpiece of the medium. At its core, Portal is a deceptively simple concept: players are armed with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, a gun that can create linked portals on specific surfaces. This ingenious mechanic forms the foundation of the game's puzzles, turning each room into a mind-bending spatial challenge. The gradual introduction of new elements and mechanics keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting throughout. What makes Portal truly remarkable is its storytelling. The game's antagonist, GLaDOS, is an AI with a sinister sense of humor that slowly reveals itself as players progress. The witty and darkly comedic script, combined with GLaDOS's increasingly erratic behavior, creates a sense of unease and intrigue that drives the narrative. The player character, Chell, is a silent protagonist, but her journey is told through environmental storytelling and the interactions with the AI. This minimalist approach to storytelling allows players to piece together the narrative and engage on a deeper level. Portal's level design is nothing short of brilliant. Each chamber is a meticulously crafted puzzle that challenges players to think critically and creatively. The satisfaction that comes from solving these puzzles is immensely rewarding. The pacing is spot-on, introducing new challenges at just the right moments. The game's presentation is clean and sterile, fitting the aesthetic of Aperture Science Laboratories. The sterile environment contrasts with the chaos and intrigue that unfolds as players delve deeper into the facility. The ambient sound design and eerie music contribute to the game's unique atmosphere. Portal's brevity may be its only drawback, as it can be completed in a relatively short time. However, its compact experience is a testament to its quality, and it encourages replayability and speedrunning. In conclusion, Portal is a groundbreaking masterpiece that showcases the power of innovative gameplay and storytelling in video games. Its clever puzzles, darkly comedic narrative, and minimalist presentation make it a must-play for gamers and a shining example of what the medium can achieve.. Portal is an incredible gameplay concept, that had an incredible game built around it. The story and pacing are good, the jokes are funny, and holy **** that 3rd act is something else Incredible game 9.5/10. Just a fun game puzzle with a fun story. Really not anything to dislike. Well done. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The villain makes this game prefect. Not gonna tell you much about the villain. But I will tell you that this game is a simple masterpiece. The test chambers in this game are pretty good. If it's a Valve game... YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. There's only really like 2 Valve games that are bad. This low count of bad games makes them the King of gaming (I'm looking at YOU 343). This game is not very story driven. That's not a bad thing for me. But if that's a bad thing for you, then you might not like Portal 1. This game is a game you should play before you die.. Portal was what sold me on the concept of the orange box, honestly. The concept behind portal greatly intrigued me to begin with. When I finally downloaded it off of steam and played it, I was not disappointed.. Too short for a full game. But existing levels are interesting, and the story is quite fun.. Valve really needs to make more new games with their IPs man. Portal has one of the most unique and creative concepts for a game I've ever seen, and the potential this series has is through the roof. The execution of those ideas, while flawed in a few ways, still made for an excellent experience, and I can confidently say that even with only two games, Portal is one of my favorite series. While the first game does suffer from the campaign being too short, along with a couple of bugs here and there, those are nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. The puzzles feel so satisfying to complete, the level design is very impressive, and character/story wise, it's actually a really funny game. Both games in the Portal series excel at what they do, and while Portal 2 has more depth and is way more replayable these days, you shouldn't count out the first game under any circumstance.. Best puzzle game I've ever played, even if not that hard. Portal is just amazing and I think every gamer should give it a try.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 10/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 9/10; Summary rating: 8/10. It's a good, cult game. It has no drawbacks within its own genre. Even over time, it hasn't lost its interest.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. The best puzzle game ever made and yet again it reminds me of the golden days of gaming when valve actually made games.... Gameplay - 9 Plot & Characters - 7 Storytelling - 6 Pacing - 8 Music & Sound - 7 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. It is a clear piece of work that showcases the mechanics and modernity of the Source engine. It is a game that must be played by those who love puzzle games.. Glados has more character and personality than 99% of peoples i met in my life, pure short masterpiece. Great puzzle game, thoroughly enjoyed almost every moment, some puzzles here are more frustrating than challenging, however, mostly due to the pretty wacky physics engine. Overall it's a great, simple puzzle game, that is merely overshadowed by just how much of a sheer masterpiece its sequel is.. A brilliant idea with the portal gun, the gradual introduction of new elements to the puzzles, a wonderfully built plot and atmosphere. My only complaint is that the game is too short!. One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Each level was hard enough to make me consider how to get past it but also not to hard to make the actual solution be nonsense. I just wish Portal was longer.. Perfect for speedrunning. Really good. In my opinion it has one of the best tutorial. Best thing are the turrets. THEY ARE SO CUTE! The Humor is not for everyone but I love it. 10/10. Portal's innovative gameplay, clever puzzles, and dark humor combine to make it a standout title in the puzzle-platformer genre.. A fun puzzle game with a very quirky character. its quite funny at times but ultimately failed to leave a strong impression on me. The portal mechanics were novel and fun but i rarely found myself struggling for solutions.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Strange story, complex and difficult puzzles in the whole good game that depends on you how much time you spend on it. One of the best puzzle games out there with one of the most charismatic ""villain"" in gaming that will make you love her rather than hate her,. Very interesting mechanism even after 15 years. Simple concept but you need to manage the concept to resolve the puzzles. The game design is also very smooth, you don't feel overwhelmed since the puzzles will guide you. The last mission is difficult but a very good example to show you how capable the game is. Didn't get a chance to play the additional missions.. Best puzzles, best villain, best immersion and music. Love it. ""Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center."". Have I really to rate this game ? (I will do it) This game is really good, in this review, I will not talk about the good points but about the bad points. 1) The game is to short (I know it was a bonus game in the orange box). 2) The less steps challenge. 3) THE CAMERA SHY SUCCES. This game combines sarcastic humor that is hilarious, with fun puzzle solving. Plus it has a good end. ;). portal is a single-player puzzle game, that has a lot of pros and almost zero cons, so let me list off the pros and cons pros: + the game makes your little monkey brain actually think on how to solve the levels and makes you smarter + most of the achievements are challenging, and fun to do + after you complete the game you can play bonus levels + the game has some comedy cons: - there is an achievement that is super hard to get unless you cheat your way out of doing it that's about it for the pros and cons, however i'm not done yet i'm flabbergasted that some people hate this game, because the game teaches you the basics and then leaves you alone and you have to slowly figure it out for yourself how to optimally figure out some puzzles and if you are stuck on a level for a long time, finally figuring out the solution fills your brain with dopamine. that's about it from me, the game is good and is a must-buy.. I love this game so much. Like it left a huge mark on me being the first pc game I have ever purchased, and it was worthy of a purchase. The atmosphere makes me feel like I am just alone, with my only guidance being an AI. The soundtrack replicates this so well, with tracks like “taste of blood,” “self esteem fund,” and “android hell.” The gameplay is also very good as well, since it revolves around solving puzzles with a gun that shoots portals (get cuz the game is named portal, you have a portal gun, what a revelation) and the icing of the cake (or a lie for that matter) is the story. It isn’t relatively a big cinematic story that has lots of characters and emotional moments, it’s just you, stuck in a chamber, alone, while an AI watches you solve puzzles. Overall, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10. This gaming classic brought us this super good portal feature. Very original and fun puzzle game. I never actually paid attention but also storytelling method is also still valid in 2023 for me. No real downside for the game but only I'd like to mention that I am fun of tense atmosphere.. LUCKILY… STILL ALIVE BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game was tested in the Still Alive version, 100% completed and the platinum trophy has been obtained. A WILD PORTAL APPEARS!: Portal, as a typical Valve title, features impeccable level design and attention to detail right from the start. From the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve; initially the player will find himself inside a closed cell as Chell, a young girl who has been hired to test some new Aperture Science technology. Apparently, the capsule in which Chell lingers would appear to have no way out, but after a few seconds, thanks to the appearance of a portal, the player will be free to begin testing the various chambers of the Aperture facility. From there on, the player will be faced with several tests, and when he or she has mastered the potential of the blue portal, he or she will also unlock the orange one, kicking off the full potential of the game. A NEW CUBY FRIEND: As can be inferred from the name of the game or the introduction of the reviews, it is all about using portals, mainly two, one blue and one orange. These portals do not have different characteristics, but are actually unlocked at different times so that the player can figure out how to use one at a time. Several other mechanics are present, which in the same way as the portals are explained right from the start, namely the use of cubes to press buttons; obviously it is very intuitive as a mechanic, but combined with the use of portals to reach tricky buttons makes it more fun and complicated. Other mechanics rely on dodging and destroying deadly turrets, or repelling energy orbs in order to activate passages. Plot-wise, the first chapter does not hold a candle to the second, with a rather simple story with few narrative twists. HEY, THAT’S ME!: Graphically Portal awakens perfectly to a game of its era; moreover, due to its simplicity the game becomes almost immortal. Obviously, the aesthetics of the logos and the use of colors are excellently done. HEARING THE RADIO: From an audio standpoint, there is not much to discuss; the use of sound effects to make clear the use of the various game objects and their interaction with the environment is excellent. ACHIEVEMENTS: The achievements in this title are fairly simple and quick to complete. The Still Alive version of Portal provides several extra levels to tackle and two challenges in the campaign that are rather tough, namely finishing the game without ever being hit by turrets and finishing it by going only through orange portals. The latter is an obvious nod to the Orange Box collection and provides a more thoughtful approach to the game's puzzles. BUT WHY 9? PROS - CONS: All in all, the original Portal does not have much to discuss; all the pros have already been mentioned in the parts above; of negative points, however, I personally struggle to find any, as it really is a near-perfect game. Small appreciable detail in both Portal is the Commentary mode, where the developers explain their approach in the making of this title, useful for young programmers or very curious gamers. RATING Gameplay: 10 Music: 7 Story: 8 Puzzles: 10 _. A great game! The only bad thing about it is that it's short. One of my favorite games.. Ah, good old Portal. Whats there to say that hasnt been said? Great Puzzle, GlaDOS is a great villain, i personally found the turret levels to be a bit frustrating but skill issue ig.. Simply one of the best games ever. Pure, original, mind-boggling smart and incredibly funny.. This game is like a prototype. The puzzles are short. It's not very confusing. As if Valve thought the game would not work, they made the game short and gave it together with the first orange box package.. portals are cool. Glados is funny. i like this game more than portal 2 (though i still love that too) the writing is great. i love it. it is in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Bu This game can be played by those who like strategy, puzzle a little, and action. But let me tell you from the beginning. The puzzles in the game are mind-blowing. Even I barely finished the game. So don't be upset or angry if you can't pass any level when you play. The puzzles in the game are already very difficult :xd. It feels like a horror game with the music being so quiet and the voice acting being so cold you can almost feel as a kind of cold hate coming from it. the portals are so fun to play It's amazing that they even make this game 2007. It's truly is the highlight of the Orange Box. In the later half of the game they make you use your brain a lot more when you can't use the normal porto sit-ups and it feels like a jungle of metal you are pushing through. The song in the games credit is the most adorable I had heard. Please play this game. It's one of the best you can use 2 Hours on and you will be satisfied. Only sad thing is there is only 2 hours of it, but there's a sequel that is not as good but can satisfy you if you need more of the game puzzles.. Good Things(+) -main story -puzzles İt Could Be Better -playtime -games finale Bad things(-) -none on record:3. A classic masterpiece that deserves all the praises that it gets. A game that everyone can enjoy regardless of whether they like puzzle games or not. Truly a must-play.. I've always heard of Portal but It just never sparked me any interest. Until recently when I found out it was in promotion on Steam and I've decided to buy it. I just finished it and it was the best gaming experience I've ever had.. + Nice puzzles - Very short - Simple plot - You expected something more - very overrated. An excellent, physics bending adventure through the quirky and oppressive test chambers of Aperture Science. The various test chamber puzzles are all enjoyable. Even the earliest, more tutorial oriented, test chambers find ways to keep the player engaged with the puzzle solving and the later game puzzles are difficult but fair, yielding a solid sense of achievement when they are overcome. GLaDOS is also a brilliantly written character that keeps you enthralled with every sentence. Portal is easily one of the greatest games of all time.. I belatedly tried the portal of Valves' representative work, and I found out why it is called a masterpiece. Literal definition of a perfect gameplay-based game. Great sound design, fun and original puzzles, amazing physics and controls, simple but remarkable plot and it's long enough to keep you entertained and short enough to not to make you tired. Graphics and performance are top-notch, but constant loadings in elevators are quite annoying. Definitely not flawless but hey, its an amazing achievement of game industry. Highly recommended for basically anyone.. Graphics - 6/10 Gameplay - 8/10 Control - 9/10 Detail control - 6/10 Optimisation - 7/10 Entertainment - 6/10 Personal taste - 7/10 Sound - 4/10 Physics - 6/10 Mechanics - 8/10 Plot - 6/10 Bonuses: Legendary +3 Atmosphere / vibe +1 Score: 7/10. Pretty fun puzzle game but nothing crazy and felt slow playing alone. A puzzle game I can actually complete is always welcome by me though.. One of the greatest of all time. Makes you laugh while it makes your brain hurt.. Took advantadge of black friday sales and finally got this gem I had lost before. Good game but I enjoyed Portal 2 more. This game is a classic that anyone should play. My only compaint is that its short.. Portal is a simple, yet brilliant puzzle game. The concept of Portal is incredibly novel, especially for the time, and I think it has aged quite well. It's fun, challenging, atmospheric, and iconic.. >Students made a demo game with innovative seamless portal technology >Gabe Newell liked it >He hired these students at Valve >It's been a couple of years of development >Received, albeit posing itself as an experiment, but an excellent game with a great atmosphere of loneliness, deep lore and with the very technology of seamless portals. I can barely describe how deeply immersed I feel everytime I come back to this game. Everything from the world, the ambient sounds, the music, the characters... Everything is so well connected. Completing the puzzles is really satisfiying and the storyline keeps asking you to move forward to continue to know what's next. If you have a computer than can run games and you have never played Portal, what the heck are you waiting for?. I really love this game. It has nice puzzles. Stylish design. GLaDOS is my love. The cake is a lie.. You cant not play this game if you own a pc, this game is so iconic there is nothign about it which hasnt already been said. Not a 10 because i think the 2 is better. It's has really good puzzles, humor and atmosphere but the second part just better lol. The classic. One of the most unique games out there. If you like puzzle games don't miss this classic.. All starts as puzzle solving game and it ends with a bit of story and kind of horror atmosphere, but nothing really to write about, nevertheless game is not only puzzle game in the end. Puzzles are nice and it definitely learns a player to think in 3D. I have finished after 2 hours; it was pretty good experience. If you dont know what to play and have 2-3 hours of time, give a shot. I guess there are not many people who will not be entertained with this title.. I bear no grudge against Valve's hats, but I really wish they would come back to making these awesome games. Portal is an amazing game that has aged amazingly well and absolutely everyone should play it.. Very interesting puzzle game with its unique features. It was extremely fun to exploit its main mechanics). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Recommended 5.4 hrs at review time Gameplay 7/10 Music and sound 7/10 Screenplay 8/10 Technical 7/10. Perfect game, short but perfect. It doesn't lack anything, it is just perfect (IMO better than the sequel). It is a must for all players, one of the most revolutionary and best games ever. I **** myself consistently throughout this game. A good game on top of food for weeks.. of course the second part is better but the first part is also not bad good puzzles voice acting also I thought for a very long time how to solve the puzzle but the game is very short I liked the final part of the game I recommend you play this game. Gameplay demo of portal 2 looking kinda nice But too short i mean i pay for this game 125₴, for this money game is REAL too short.. One of the best puzzle games I have played. The levels are very creative because of the very smaty gimmick of portals, and the story unravels in a very interesting way. However, the game is incredibly small in length. It took me 2 hours to finish. But giving the price of the game, that is not a problem. It is a must play.. A short but sweet puzzle game which is very original in concept, and with puzzles that are appropriately tricky to solve. If you pay attention to the dialogue over the loudspeaker, you will notice that this game has some goofy comedy mixed in. Portal is not nearly as good as its sequel, but it's nevertheless a very good game that’s worth playing… before moving on to the sequel. Seriously, the sequel is a must-play for everyone.. Graphic is still stable after 15 years, game-play is very original, Audio is amazing, the game is for everyone, you can play this game on a low-end PC, The difficulty is medium, The game does not have any bugs and you should play it.. An amazing puzzle game sure it’s short but it’s still an amazing experience. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very innovative game that has one of the greatest video game villains of all time in GLaDOS. Lack of replay value brings it down a bit though.. Unlike portal 2, this game simply does not hold up. It has value for its incredible concept and being the groundwork for the sequel, but if you had a choice between the two, there simply is no contest. I'd be less harsh on the game if it wasn't 2 hours long.. Repetitive but still a must play gaming experience! I wish more games like this were made today.... Portal is a how a game should be made: with innovation and a hell lot of humor.. Portal is boring to me. It's not funny, the puzzles are mostly about sitting around and waiting for the game to catch up to you, and absolutely nothing is satisfying to do. I probably won't ever understand the universal acclaim surrounding this title.. 10/10. The game has the best story in video gaming history. Valve has done some really good work with this.. This game is pretty much perfect. The puzzles are very challenging, its always fun, and the dark humor is incredibly funny.. simply brilliant! this masterpiece is a master class of level designing at its best! levels gradually get harder and harder each level(test chamber as the game calls them); you might think this puzzle game doesn't have that much of a story to tell but believe me it does and It's mysterious and amazing especially at the end with an epic boss fight! totally play it, not once, but again and again, because puzzles are fun to solve and at the end of each level you get a full satisfaction you never get from any other game! 9/10 just because graphics and some mechanics are too old for modern systems of nowadays; definitely would've given it a perfect score if I had played it back on the release date!. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 10.. This game is absolutely perfect. The puzzles and the story that has this game are one of the best I've ever seen. It's just a masterpiece. Good job, Valve.. Portal defines what a puzzle game can be . The game's excellent designing made it extremely enjoyable, it just has a little bit short gameplay time . I enjoyed each and every level and listening to GLADOS telling me not the touch the operational end of the device.. The best action puzzle game for your mind and your sleight of hand! The life of each of us is a period of trials and difficulties that we overcome from the first days of our existence in this World! We open our eyes and see everything around us, and take our first steps, and hear the first words around us! Let's try from the first moments to look at everything around us, draw some conclusions and understand who we are in this World, and what surrounds us here? But what if we get a Portal gun? We will then be able to open Portals and move anywhere, and it doesn't matter if we can walk or talk, or do something else, because we will have some kind of weapon in our hands as joyfully limitless possibilities!. I give Portal a lot of praise because it manages to take a genre I don’t normally like, puzzle games, and make it highly enjoyable for me. Part of that is it’s humour, which is fantastic, but it also take’s what is a very basic concept and makes it complex without being annoying. At it’s core you make up to two portals, but it’s up to you to figure out where to put them and how to use them to get to the end of a room. What I loved most was that for most of Portal it was very logical, it didn’t feel cheap or trying to be overly difficult for no reason. While a few times I felt stumped for a bit I always was able to figure things out because the game wasn’t being cheap in any way. The voice acting for Glados was some of the best I have seen and really made what would have been a great game into a classic. The end credits still make me smile to this day. The graphics were decent for it’s time, neither mind blowing or an eye sore. They have a very clean look to them for much of the time until near the end where you get into the bowels of the facility. The clean looking rooms were nice although the more dingy parts later showed the age of the engine more. The game does a great job of dropping hints about the lore as well as tying it into the Valve universe with Half-Life. I played Portal on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any bugs. There are nine graphics settings; four AA settings; six AF settings; a v-sync toggle and an FOV slider that goes from 75-110. Alt-tab didn’t work. You can manually save whenever you want. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t shocking given the age of the game. Game Engine: Source Graphics API: OpenGL Disk Space Used: 3.88 GB Graphics Settings Used: 8xAA; 16x AF; 100 FOV; v-sync on; all settings at highest except blur off GPU Usage: 17-60 % VRAM Usage: 1009-1448 MB CPU Usage: 3-11 % RAM Usage: 3.1-4.2 GB Frame Rate: 132-144 FPS Portal is a game that many will enjoy and still holds up today. It was a lot of fun and combines great game play with voice acting and presentation. It also does a great job of not overdoing it and not overstaying it’s ","it's funny, fun, just the right amount of challenge. i don't mind how short this game is because how much it packs into its 2 hour run time is fantastic . portal 2 is better, but despite it's short duration, i'ts worth trying it out 100%8/10 ."
304.The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass,"This game utilizes the touch screen in very fun and unique ways!! Spirit tracks is better in my opinion ,but if you liked spirit tracks then you'll like this too!. Is a decent game but if the Zelda name was not attached I can’t say I would be too interested. Is a very underwhelming sequel to wind Waker.. The controls did take a while to get used to, but Phantom Hourglass is a very worthwhile successor/sequel to Windwaker. It's a bit easier than most games in the franchise, but given that this style of Zelda game is geared towards younger audiences, it makes sense. I highly recommend it for Windwaker fans.. Just like with Skyward Sword, i don't like when Nintendo makes a Zelda game only with the purpose of using the console gimmick. I think the controls of this game are a lot worse than the motion control in SS. It doesn't feel right at all. Just because of that it ruins pretty much all the game. Where at least the motion controls in SS are fun. in this game they **** very much. very fun, altough easy at some times it has a really good ending, good characters and a pretty dark story if you really think about it!. The Sailing Gets A Little Boring, But The Puzzles Are Top Tier, Dare I Say The Best Of Any Zelda Game Also Goron Dugeon From PH Is the best Zelda Dungeon. The worst Zelda game.--- Actual in game quote ""It's no fun not being able to play using the +Control **** I have one regret, it's being so stubborn and saying such a thing...."" --- Nintendo should have allowed optional button controls. -- Basically, a lot of bad decisions. Touch controls feel like a gimmick, especially when changing weapons while fighting enemies.-- The world map feels small and unpolished. Normally Zelda games have really detailed and layered maps with sections locked until you get the tool needed to reach those locations. In Phantom Hourglass, you just aren't allowed to sail to certain areas until you progress the story. Hidden items are usually just places to dig...pretty lame.-- No heart pieces, but instead there are just 6 heart containers, and you get them by completing mini games. No finding them....pretty lame.-- The Ocean King Temple is just really poorly designed, and you need to repeat it 6 times, repeating the same puzzles.-- The trading sequence is just 4 trades long, and you can't start it until you are about 90% done the game.-- Music is really bad, no Hyrule theme or anything memorable.-- Sailing is also really boring.-- However the boss fights are really good, and the graphics are reasonable, but regular combat just scratches up your screen (Bought a screen protector specifically for this game).-- My friends told me to skip this game......I should have listened.-- My Zelda Ranker-- -Best- Breath of the Wild Majora's Mask Ocarina of Time Link's Awakening Oracle of Ages Oracle of Seasons Twilight Princess A Link Between Worlds Skyward Sword Wind Waker Minish Cap Zelda II The Legend of Zelda A Link to The Past Phantom Hourglass/Triforce Heroes -Worst- Still to play, Spirit Tracks & Tears of the Kingdom Wind Waker. The game depends entirly on DS touch controls which is a hit or miss. Dungeons are short and fun with clever puzzles and ideas (specially the boss fights). Sea exploration is bad to be honest and kills the pacing of the game and story. Graphics are really impressive even in today's standards (2023). Plot and lore are average. Overall it's a great DS game but an average Zelda game. Out of 10 Gameplay: 8 Story: 7 Graphics: 8 World: 7 Sound: 7 Overall: 7/10. A poor plot and mixed gameplay is saved by charming graphics and lovely characters.. This game is full of lore and I liked it a lot. It's really enjoyable with Tricky and funny Dungeons, even if the movement System it's not that good. At least the things to do outside the main story aren't that much and they're also pretty useless, like obtaining the gems to power up spirits, even if their abilities are pretty hard to use well. A Bad thing is the Temple of the Ocean King, that requests to be redone everytime you walk inside (5/6 times). At least is a good game to have fun and spend some good time.. My introduction into the zelda series. A very solid game that I still play regularly on my old DS.. Zelda comes to the DS in the traditional RPG/arcade adventure hybrid format, complete with cel-shaded graphics and Saturday morning cartoon sensibilities. It does make good use of the stylus, although I for one prefer to be given the choice to use buttons as well...something that is not provided here. Clearly aimed more at younger players but older retro gamers are sure to get a kick out of it too.. I think most Zelda fans would agree that this is the weakest entry in the mainline series. The forced touch controls are unnecessary, cumbersome, slow, and uncomfortable, which makes them especially badly-suited for heated combat situations, precise platforming, and long play-sessions (all of this could have simply been avoided with an optional button control scheme). The sailing/overworld part hasn't really been improved a whole lot from Wind Waker; it's still boring, slow, and there is still very little to actually do for you on the ocean besides waiting to arrive at your next destination (especially since you're not even directly controlling your ship anymore, instead just drawing a route on your map that the boat automatically follows because WE GOT TO HAVE TOUCH CONTROLS EVERYWHERE). The story isn't exactly going to knock you off your feet either and neither is its presentation, which almost entirely consists of characters just standing around and talking to each other, there is very little actually happening. The worst thing (apart from the control scheme), though, is the godd*mn Temple of the Ocean King, which may just be the worst set of ideas ever implemented in a Zelda title and by itself takes the game down 1 additional point for me. The redeeming factors are all the usual Zelda stuff, you know, a sense of adventure, cool puzzles, a satsfying and addictive sense of progression etc. Although one area where Zelda usually shines is also somewhat lacking, and that is THE MUSIC. The ""standard island"" loop (calling it a song would be vastly overstating it) is very, very lackluster and short and being forced to hear it all the time when exploring an island honestly just makes me want to turn the sound off.. Doing something on the touch screen, communicating with the microphone. Drawing various motifs on the tablets. Marking your destinations on the map and taking notes. Enjoyable fighting mechanics. If I compare it to Wind Waker. I think there was better world design. But the dungeons were a bit weak, could be better. It's the same with puzzles. Overall I had a lot of fun, the story and characters were also good. It was a game where I had a very good time.. A good zelda but with a very difficult mechanics other than that the game is very good. Had to rate this game very poorly because it frustrated me way more than anything. The touch controls were a terrible idea to begin with and often didn't work the way they were intended. Some of the items and puzzles using the touch screen were interesting ideas but they ultimately weren't worth it. Should have gone with a more straight forward Zelda title. Sailing was not relaxing, just annoying because you needed to watch out for enemies and random crap to jump over. I suppose they did it to make sailing more interesting, but moving the camera with the touch controls are atrocious so it had the opposite effect. The Temple of the Ocean King also made me miserable up until the 6th and final visit, what were they thinking? They were obviously just padding out the playtime with repetitive and tedious nonsense. A shorter and sweeter game would have been more welcomed. Just poor design all around, mistakes and ridiculous choices a student in a community college game design course wouldn't make. Apparently Nintendo agrees with me because they haven't let Daiki Iwamoto direct another new project, he's stuck directing remasters. In other words, games that have already been made so he can't possibly mess it up. He probably only got to where he was because he's been at the company so long.. A totally competent Zelda sequel that certainly fits the handheld mold for better and worse, having lower stakes than its home-console predecessor ""The Wind Waker"" but also some moments that are worthy of its series title.. Phantom Hourglass is the best exemple of what the DS can do. Graphically, it's just what you'd expect The Wind Waker would have looked like if it came out one generation prior to the GameCube. The controls are perfect, and I mean, PERFECT. Everything responds with such precision to your own movements that if you fail at doing something, it's always your fault, not the game's. The story is captivating and the characters lovable. The soundtrack is also stellar, alway pumps me up for whatever task is required of me. This is easily my favourite Nintendo DS game, although it can be a bit easy at times. People usually complain about that one dungeon you need to go back to several times, but each time you go there, you can clear it's floors much faster than the previous time, granted you use your brain and items effectively. Which reminds me, the items, the selection is also pretty good this time around. Now, navigating the sea. I think it's a little better than in TWW since it's smaller and more ennemies appear, keeping you busier. Since your boat this time has an engine too, you don't need to change the wind's direction all the time. There are several unique ilsands to explore, many optional. You can focus on the story and beat the game relatively quickly but exploration is so much fun in this game and rewarding. Anyone who loves Zelda and/OR the DS should at least give this game a try, it's truly a work of art.. If you remove the repetitive end-game dungeon that jolts you and the awfully long final boss, the game will be 10/10. It really upsets me to put such a review on a Zelda opus, but everything is so unbalanced here and the (most of the time) clever stylus controls can't compensate that on its own. Even given the hardware age, the game is not pretty, stylus controls are well thought except that it weighs you down in intense fights which can become frustrating. Intense fights by the way are rare and so the overall game is too easy. A feeling of easiness which is heavily contrasted by this awful central dungeon setup which you need to start all over again and again : excessively frustrating. And finally, the whole story/ universe feel so bland.. Some good ideas but without the usual neatness level of development/ finishing of the saga. I wait more from a Zelda opus, and moreover from the Windwaker ""sequel"".. Phantom Hourglass is not the best entry in Zelda series but,in general, it still remains a Zelda and it's an enjoyable one. The story is ok,the dungeons aren't very difficult but the gameplay with stylus is a fun way to play by my opinion. The game has incredible soundtrack though. It's definetely one of the best DS games though. Highly recommend it.. This game has decent parts but overall it's kind of a disappointment. It's way too easy and the sailing is still lame, I prefer my Zelda games on land. There's a gimmick with the ""main temple"" that makes you redo the dungeon a 100 times throughout the game, while it gets deeper everytime. That's just annoying.. The sea atmosphere is just incredibly beautiful and i liked sailing on the boat to other islands and the use of stylus in this game is total fun once you get used to it and it is very useful to use it on the map to mark a location or to draw a path or use it to solve puzzles ect. This is a very remarkable title on the DS. I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. IT'S TRASH!!!!! I guess it isn't horrendously awful it's just a really bad game. I was excited to play this game. I mean it's the sequel to Wind Waker, a phenomenal game. Zelda is probably the greatest video game series ever, but this is a terrible excuse for a Zelda game. First off you have to use the stylus for EVERYTHING!!! That in itself is bad, but the thing that makes this the worst game of the series is The Temple of the Ocean King. I didn't even finish the game because of this terrible dungeon. The fact that you have to keep coming back and doing the same puzzles you already did is bad enough, but what makes it even more horrendously awful is YOU'RE ON A VERY LIMITED TIME LIMIT!!!!!!! Everything else is just forgettable. Looking for islands and sailing has never been more boring. The dungeons are 6/10 at best. The bosses are 6/10 at best. The only thing I can say was at least good was Linebeck, and two pieces of music. Linebeck is a pretty cocky guy so when you see him cowering in fear, then right after taking the credit for something Link did was pretty funny. And the two pieces of music ''Linebecks theme'' and ''Island Life'' aren't anything to special, but they are pretty enjoyable pieces of Zelda music none the less. But the overall game is SO BORING, AND FRUSTRATING!!!!!! That is why I'm giving it a 3/10.. Indeed, as a Zelda game, it is rare that one say that a game is ""bad"" by most standards--and this holds true for that matter. Continuing the story of the Hero of Winds immediately following the incredible work that is Windwaker, Phantom Hourglass certainly continues to tell the legend we all love. And I did have a hard time putting the game down while playing admittedly. However, this Zelda game, standng amonst the other giants in the Zelda series, has a hard time living up to legend in some regards. While I truly and genuinely applaud Nintendo for doing something so bold with its touchscreen controls, I would retrospectively prefer to have the old school controls of most games in the genre. Truth be told, I did appreciate the approach for its uniqueness and still do, but sometimes playing this game was just a bit tedious and uncomfortable for me. With my arm contorted strangely trying to use my tiny stylus, meh. Also, as I'm sure its been said elsewhere in these reviews: Temple of the Ocean King. My goodness, Temple of the Ocean King. If there were any times in which I would have wanted to stop playing, its whenever I knew I had to return to the Temple of the Ocean King. I'm not sure if the developers did this as a way to demonstrate improved skill to the player, or to artifically increase play time, or to underscore something thematically. However, it was not needed. This was a chore time and time again and added to my annoyances of playing the game. Phantom Hourglass is ultimately a game I'm glad I've played and did enjoy the experience, but doubt I'll find any value in ever returning for a second playthrough.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really critics? A 9?? How much does Nintendo pay for good reviews? Between this and Mario, I have never seen more blatant bias in any other franchises. This is the first Zelda game that I have played, but I’m really not clamoring to play any others. This is the mighty franchise that’s better than Final Fantasy? Get this kids’ version of Legolas out of here. This is mediocrity defined and the people that play it just don’t have the patience for real RPGs. It’s like this game is made for people who are glued to walkthroughs and just want to say they beat a game. I’m not a fan.. This game is pretty average. Below average for a game series as amazing as The Legend of Zelda. All of the gameplay is played with the stylus, microphone and at one point even closing the DS or putting it on sleep mode if you have a 2DS. This makes the combat quite boring as you just tap the enemy you want Link to hit and it got quite old quite fast for me. The story is pretty average too and the characters aren’t too engaging really. Linebeck is very annoying and even the spirits in this game are bland. The temple of the ocean king is visited way too many times and is recycled after every one or two dungeons, making the actual dungeons seem amazing when there kind of average too. The boomerang and bombchus are quite fun to use and the bosses can be interesting but that’s about it. I really wanted to like this game and I do but it’s definitely not Zelda standard. If you really want to play all Zelda games then fine go ahead and get it but otherwise I don’t think I’d really recommend this game in the Zelda series above others such as Majora’s Mask, Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess or even Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.. I like it! The dungeons are cool, good bossfights and the graphics are on top. But there are few things bothering me! The sailing is over the time quit boring since you just draw your route and watch your ship travel. And after the 4th time the Sea King Tempel isnt much fun any more. It was so bad that I stopped after 4th time and didnt play to the end. Good aspects but you could cut out Se Kings Teample a little. 2 times are enough for one tempel!. At the end of 2018, I sat in my college dorm room wanting to relax after studying. The weekend was coming and I had some time to myself. I picked up the DS that I'd brought with me, but hadn't used yet since arriving at college. Upon looking through my game collection I came past Phantom Hourglass. This was a game I had gotten tripped up on as a kid, being that I was probably too young for an adventure/puzzle game. I decided to give it a shot and see if my favorite franchise was as consistent on the DS as it always had been for home consoles, and boy was it ever. Before I continue, I will follow up on my past remarks. The Legend of Zelda is my favorite video game franchise, and thus I may have enjoyed the game more for the similarities and differences from its predecessors as well as follow up titles. The art style of the game is so childish and cute, yet right at the beginning of the game you are presented with a dark backstory. The dungeons in the game have ominous music and lighting, which makes everything so much more exciting. You begin to feel like a helpless kid, just as the main character is initially portrayed as. Then, it happens. You finish your first puzzles. You beat your first dungeon. All of a sudden, you aren't such a helpless kid anymore, you're an adventurer! You lose yourself within the game, which is constantly moving you along to new islands and throwing speed bumps in your adventure. The innocent art style and mood of the world always sticks around, and you begin to feel like it's your job to protect it. I've never become so engaged in the fun concepts of a DS game as I did with Phantom Hourglass. If you're finding yourself wanting to pick up a classic DS game for fun, Phantom Hourglass is a great pick, and may just pull you back to the handheld console for a bit.. This is the first Zelda game on DS platform. I have a mix feeling about this game. I like the new ways to play game, such as shouting to the console, drawing the line, and using the touch screen. Nintendo show us how to play a game without the controller, but I do not like it. This is an easy game among Zelda franchise by using the controller. However, Nintendo intends to show the players how to play a game with two screens, so players need to use the lower screen all the time. This game takes the fully advantages of the console's technology. This game is accessible for newcomers, such as me. I think Zelda games are really hard, but this one is an easier one. The up screen can show you a full map of the current dungeon, which just like cheating. This is really convenient for me to locate where i am.. Horrible. My first Zelda game was a disgrace to the franchise. Pros: + Literally nothing except for introducing me to Zelda Cons: - Controls: Even Skyward Sword handles better than this trash. - Gameplay: Traveling in the overworld is REALLY boring. - Story: More barebones than BotW's. - Everything else Overall, Phantom Hourglass is SO laughably bad that it warrants a 2/10 from me.. Not the best Zelda game however it does live up to the standard that you expect from this franchise, just in a different way. In the beginning I was not a huge fan of using the stylus but the more I played it the simpler the controls became. Story is ok and comedic at times. This game is also one of the easier Zelda games I have played. This game was disgustingly disappointing in every way. Which is even more true when you think that this could have been an excellent sequel to Wind Waker. The controls are janky. You need to use the touch screen/stylus to move, use your boat, shoot with your cannons and it doesn't help that certain movements (attack movements particularly) are not responsive making it even more horrendous. People may complain about the **** wiimote that is used by Zelda Skyward Sword, but they have clearly never played Phantom Hourglass (Or spirit Track). What I loved about Wind Waker which is not present on this game was the fact the ocean was calm which encourages exploration, but in Phantom Hourglass, you can't do jack **** without being bothered by enemies, I just want to stay on an island to gather money in those circumstances no kidding. But the worst must be the puzzles, in the main temple which has a health draining curse, there are puzzles everywhere and the temple even forces you to be quick (this is some strong timer ****) and everytime you advance a little, you need to backtrack, HOW FRUSTRATING! This temple alone has the worst single puzzle in the ENTIRE franchise, at some point you will reach a room that you cannot leave with some sort of map and then you need to take your DS go to that thing and close it to complete the puzzle, not only it is NOT natural (it is a fourth wall breaking), but it is also said NOWHERE in the game that you should do that, not even a hint (maybe the fairy gave a hint, but it was so unhelpful) which forced me to watch a walkthrough and I swear that it NEVER happened to me before. It is the worst dungeon/temple in any Zelda game ever, even the water temple from OOT is better than that. Aesthetically, the game is good and the ost is as great as ever, but the gameplay **** to the core. This is also because of this game that I never bought Spirit Tracks.. Maybe for a DS game, it's okay, but otherwise this game is awful. The touch screen controls make me roll into enemies when I wanted to hit them with my sword! ITS SO FRUSTRATING! Freaking garbage graphics don't help the game either. It's pretty short and the soundtrack made me want to commit suicide, almost. AND THAT STUPID PHANTOM HOURGLASS WHICH GIVES YOU A TIME LIMIT! Do yourself a favour and don't play this game! At least spirit tracks had some fun dungeons.... Graphics - 10 Music - 8 Story - 8 Gameplay - 9 Content - 9 Personal Fun - 10 Difficulty - 7 .. This game is the worst Zelda game ever made. The touchscreen controls are terrible and unlike in the Windwaker, sailing is boring as hell. The Phantom Hourglass is one of the most annoying items in the Zelda franchise, and yet the game is named after it. Most of the game is boring backtracking, while I believe backtracking in Skyward Sword was amazing, in Phantom Hourglass it just made me suffer.. Apparently this one takes place after Wind Waker, so I'd expect them to correct their mistake of not having the underwater area 51, but nope, they're still **** around. But they put the Sands of Time from Prince of Persia in it for some reason to make up for it and that's pretty alright. The illuminati has the Sands of Time confirmed, now if we can confirm that they have the real DeLorean, we'll be set.. Phantom Hourglass may not be the most memorable or popular but the game is actually very amazing. The story, gameplay, controls, dungeons, and everything else is perfect!. Nearly finished the game myself, but as for now, I can say it is so great, and even though I am playing it for the first time 9 years later, it feels so good. The new stylus based gameplay is very good, it's different, but it's great. The only con is that my wrist gets a little bit tired after some time playing it. The characters, the whole ghost-ship story and controls are amazing. Would totally love to see a remaster of this game.. A wonderful experience from start to finish. The temple of the Ocean King may have been repetitive, but brought new challenges every visit. It is built perfectly around the touch controls and is truly one of the greatest games you can grab for your DS.. This game is fun but there are many problems with it. First of all I love the characters as you can see them change over time and you can see that what you are doing is affecting them. The story is OK but I feel like it doesn't know who or what the enemy is and the developers changed their minds part way through and didn't change the rest. The dungeons are alright as they have their own themes but they are very easy and quite short but this game is more aimed towards children. The world feels empty as you will go to an island and never need it afterwards. One of the big problems I have with the game is the Temple of the ocean king. It takes up about a quarter of your play time but you have to go through the same spots every single time. I love the customization with the ship as there is a lot to collect and when you have a full set the ship looks cool and you have lots of health. It is a good game but it can be boring but the following game Spirit Tracks makes up for the mistakes. Thanks for reading.. This game is repetitive, very very very repetitive. Every time you go into a dungeon you have to go back and go through the exact same temple of the ocean king again. It never changes, ever, they don't introduce new or interesting mechanics on levels you've already been to. Its just the same thing, over, and over, and over again with forced stealth mechanics and a timer and it completely **** any enjoyment out of the game for me.. Definitely, one of the Zelda games i liked the least. Story is decent, although not so relevant. Gameplay is in my opinion the worst part, the most casual Zelda in this terms, and the use of items could be better. Graphics are fine,too. Another thing I did not like were dungeons. They were meant to be for casual gamers too, so they feel way too easy. Bosses are really awful. Only dungeon I really enjoyed was Temple of The Ocean King (i know, rare choice here), probably because it was the most challenging part of the game. 6/10. It goes without saying that Zelda fans will probably like this game, but I do know someone who hated it because she gets stressed about timed segments in games and there is a recurring dungeon in this game that has a bit of a time limit to complete each time, hence the titular ""hourglass."" It didn't bother me that much because it is usually plenty of time and even if you run out you don't die immediately. You just start losing health like you ran out of air underwater, so you might still be able to **** by until the end of the dungeon, grabbing hearts along the way. I should also point out that people are calling that recurring dungeon tedious and repetitive, but it's actually kind of cool to return to the dungeon with new abilities each time so that you can find new secrets and get a better score like in an arcade game. I think my main complaint is that a lot of time is spent waiting for your ship to get to your destination, since you can't control your ship directly. You just draw a path for your ship and then let it go, and to make it even more annoying the game pauses while you're drawing, just like guiding partners in Okamiden. It would be better if you could alter your path in real time. Luckily, you do get a nifty warp ability that's a lot like in Wind Waker, but there are only six spots you can warp to in the whole world. Another major complaint is that completionists will hate not being able to find all the ship parts. For the rare ship parts, you have to rely on random chance, hoping they'll show up in the shops. You'll have to cheat your DS system by altering the date so that it thinks it's tomorrow, and you'll have to grind for rupees to afford the parts. That's not good game design. I like the game because Zelda is always fresh with new characters and puzzles and items and abilities and levels to explore. Since it's a Toon Link game on a handheld console, it comes across as a game for kids. But it still provides a somewhat adequate challenge for adults. Reasons to skip this game: - If you don't like Toon Link or Zelda in general - If time limits stress you out - If you're a compulsive completionist and can't stand to have missing items - The overworld is slow and boring to traverse - There's not a lot that's different about this installment in the series Key differences between this and Spirit Tracks: - Because of the titular tracks, Spirit Tracks gives you even less control in the overworld navigation - Spirit Tracks is more detached from the Wind Waker storyline - Spirit Tracks gives you a cool instrument to play like in other Zelda games - The recurring dungeon in Spirit Tracks has no time limit, and doesn't require you to redo sections. Set some time after The Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass opens with Tetra and her pirate crew along with Link chasing down a ghost ship claimed to have taken sailors and residents of the local islands. The crew discovers the ship, but when Tetra goes aboard to explore, she disappears. Link attempts to follow her but ends up adrift in the ocean.. Awesome game.... My first Zelda game. What a way to get introduced to the series. Controls for the ds are superb. Easy to get into for ask first timers.. Phantom Hourglass is all in all a good game. Some of the dungeons are great, but the sailing is boring. As you've probably heard, the Temple Of the ocean king is awful. However, it is a good game to play.. While it's not as great as other Zelda games, ""Phantom Hourglass"" is still a pretty fun and well-made game. The story was great; I especially liked the characters. They all seemed to have likable personalities. The dungeons were rather interesting as well as how the items were used and manipulated with the touch screen. The biggest problem, however, was the boat. The boat segments felt very linear unlike ""Wind Waker""'s free-roaming boat.. wen i in da field of africa and i travel 2 da america i wish i can se dah zeldo. wen i travel 2 da america i ask for da zeldo and dey giv me dis. now i vary hapy an i bring dis gam bac 2 africa. it was best gam of mah life oder than rhino hunting. but soon giraffe eat it now i sad. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass makes excellent use of the DS touch screen. The gameplay is more or less what you would expect from the series which is definitely a good thing. Some complain about the Temple of the Ocean King getting repetitive but I thought it added something new to the gameplay.. Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass is another great entry into the Zelda franchise, if disappointing given its pedigree. Phantom Hourglass continues the Wind Waker storyline, and that along with the characters that this storyline introduces like Tetra and Linebeck make it one of my favorite storylines in the the franchise. Phantom Hourglass draws heavily on Wind Waker as an influence, almost to a fault (Much like Twilight Princess did with OOT) The sailing mechanic is back, as well as the art style from wind waker, which looks really good on the DS graphic wise. The sailing is fun and adventurous just like in Wind Waker, but unfortunately the game itself is linear (meaning that you have to do dungeons in a set order, as opposed to WW where you could explore and complete each dungeon in whatever order you wanted.) This is unfortunate because it lessens the sense of exploration brought on by the sailing. The touch controls are also very innovative. While the novelty for touch only controls wears off very quickly and they don't always",the controls of this game are a lot worse than the motion control in SS . i highly recommend it for Windwaker fans . the world map feels small and unpolished .
306.NHL 2001,"Worse than nhl 2002 but still pretty fun nhl game from my childhood, so i will give it 8.. First NHL game I ever played, and it's still my favourite. The game made me fall in love with hockey. The PC version is the same as its PS2 counterpart. It does suffer from slow-down from time to time.. In fact, it was my first NHL what I ever played. It was awesome in these days, I can still remember all of these features in game. I can pretty remember all parts of soundtrack. I still enjoy NHL 2001 in the moment.. I'm sorry, but this game was NOT that good, even for its time. I ran into frequent glitches, and the game got seriously boring after only a few hours of playtime. Not one of the better PS2 titles.",the game made me fall in love with hockey . the PC version is the same as its PS2 counterpart . it does suffer from slow-down from time to time .
307.Jack Jeanne,"The best visual novel/otome game I've ever seen. It's so good even to a point I'd recommend it even for people who aren't intersted in otome games but enjoy visual novels. Everything was made with so much love, attention, detail, care, you can feel how every staff member really loved this project. The art is beautiful, the voice acting is spectacular, the songs are mindblowing. All the characters are amazing, well written, they never fall flat or boring. The story leaves no plot holes and even the few cliche aspects (childhood friend, a girl secretly in a boys school) are so well done that you can grow to like them. This is a must-play. It's an amazing game that changed forever the way I see otome visual novels.. Jack Jeanne is a magnific experience! Not just for the otome games but also for the visual novels industry. The characters have a very beautiful development, the plot is smooth, pretty and very deep! The music and the art are just perfect, Sui Ishida did an amazing job! Kisa is one of the best MC, she is strong, pretty, kind and a very lovely person! The romance is the most principal point but I think its more… natural? Than in others games, the love is part of the plot ofc but… its just SO SMOOTH- I love it. And the rhythm game is fun, a extra mechanic in a kind of game that is strange have this type of things! I love it! I play a lot of otome games and this one is right now one of my favourites! Please play! Oh rama Havenna!. EXQUISITE. By far one of the best games I’ve ever picked up. The plot was intriguing, the characters were all interesting in their own ways and the character development… oh the character development. It was fantastic. The amount of effort that went into this game paid off. The romance plots may feel like less to some but after really getting to know the characters, they feel right. The music is one of the best parts of this as well. Hold onto your seat for some of the semester performances— they had me in tears.. The creator of Tokyo Ghoul Sui Ishida did AMAZING work with this game. This game has a gorgeous, unique art style, the rhythm music games're fun with multiple difficulties and remappable buttons and the songs are all total bops I can't get out of my head. If you start a fresh save file every time you do a playthrough the random encounter events can be different from other playthroughs, making it feel less repetitive. Oh and the characters and romances? All wonderful, the group dynamic of everyone is gorgeous and everyone is unique in their personality, reasons, and reveals on their individual routes. I don't usually like stat raiser otomes, but this one's kept me going for 10 days, made myself sleep deprived numerous times, I've finished most every route already and am fiending for more. It's been worth every moment and lack of sleep.. This is a great game, it’s a solid 8/10, I watched my girlfriend play it and really enjoyed it even though I normally don’t like these type of games. I never would have touched this game if wasn’t for her. Game of the year -no, not even my favorite VN this year but definitely a no brainer if you’re an Otome fan. FYI… Take all the reviews giving this a 10/10 with a grain of salt, just like you should the 1/10s -some people go a little overboard. One part I liked was the similarity/referential to “Friendship, Effort, Victory” from Shonnen Jump. If you like Otome or maiden games this is for you, if you don’t then stay away as you will probably hate this!. This game is easily the best otome game released this year or possibly ever. The story is good enough to make you cry and the music is so catchy it’ll be stuck in your head for weeks. 10/10, obviously anyone rating otherwise *cough cough* have never even played and are just salty it got better reviews than a classic GameCube game. One of the best visual novels. Sui Ishidas artwork is absolutely beautiful, and he packed over 150 CGs into this game. The characters are interesting, the music is surprisingly beautiful. There's not a ton of romance, which can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes - I liked it, personally. The rhythm games are meh, but that's not what you're playing this for. If you like VNs, you'll probably like this game. If you don't like VNs, try something else instead of rating someone's hard work down.. Great novel with Persona's system of calendary. It's a solid 9 and one of the best of the year.","the art is beautiful, the voice acting is spectacular, the songs are mindblowing . all the characters are amazing, well written, they never fall flat or boring . the story leaves no plot holes and even the few cliche aspects are so well done that you can grow to like them ."
308.Advance Wars: Dual Strike,"Very similar to the Advance Wars games on the GBA but considering that they were pure genius, that's no bad thing. Perfectly suited to a hand held system and loads of fun.. Peak advance wars in my opinion. Story was fun, gameplay was spot on, and the new mechanics were definitely welcome. I love swapping between high altitude and ground in clutch situations to help the other. The dual strike mechanic was super fun to play with. Messing with different commanders to see how they play off each other was great. Sadly I doubt we will get a good follow up to this title.. i spent so many hours on this game it's simply addictive and it is one of my favorite turned based strategy game. Advance wars is a handheld turn based military strategy game. It has clear roots in Japanese gameplay and has a focus on some story telling. The story is not interesting enough to engage me into it, and it is clearly a sequel within an existing franchise. Its not really my type of game, but I could see why others may like it. The graphics are more reminiscent of the GBA than the DS, but it has a very distinct and charming art style. The game does utilize both screens well. There are tons of game modes and things to do. So for fans of the series, I'm sure there is much to enjoy. Unfortunately I couldn't get the Multiplayer to work on the DS, but from the wealth of content and idea behind the game, I can imagine it is a blast and I look forward to revisiting the game in greater detail.. By far, the best Advance Wars game in the series. Dual Strike added a great array of interesting weapons, new Commanding Officers, improved and fixed older CO's, added the Dual Strike feature, a great campaign, the new modes Survival and Combat (real-time fighting), an improved (and not superfluously challenging) AI, and ranks so it felt like you were working towards something. Days of Ruin may be technically more sound and fair, but Dual Strike is significantly more fun.. One of the best DS titles, and the best Advance Wars game to date. Fantastic. Would like to see a modern updated version. Skip Days of Ruin and play this one.. One of my most favorite games for the DS and all-time. You can tell since this review was posted nearly 9 years after its release, and I still play it from time to time! Decently long campaign, great gameplay, war room, and extra features make it worth the money.. This game is like crack to a dork like me. I'd pork the hell out of it if it had a ****. If you love turn based strategy and don't have a DS... well, go out and get a DS. An old hamburger one will do just fine. They gotta be pretty cheap by now. Any of the versions of AW are great, but I gotta go with this one as the best. 9.75 rounded down. I don't give tens.. As a fan of the first 2 Advance Wars games, I was happy to get this one. I've played through the campaign and I enjoyed it. The new units are interesting, but they honestly didn't affect any of my major strategies- that could be considered the main weakness of this installment, I believe. One of the great things about this game though is its replayability. You have dozens of missions to choose from after the campaign is over, and you can select different CO's in order win in different ways. If you haven't enjoyed this series before, I highly recommend it now.. Simply a timeless, amazing game. Even if your not a fan of TBS, it's a must try. The amount of options for gameplay are staggering, and the multiplayer and interesting new combat mode just sweeten the deal. Only thing missing is wifi battles, but that is included in days of ruin.. Addictive is the main word that can describe this game, having cartoonish graphics, easy controls and gameplay is a mist own DS game, or a reason to buy a DS, yeah the 3DS is already launched but whatever, just get this game instantly.. With a level editor, multiplayer, hard/easy campaign modes, a combat mode, time/money/turns survival mode, a soundtrack mode, a gallery mode, over 20 characters and over 100 pre-made maps, it is unrivaled in the amount of content and replay value it offers.. While fun to play, and keeping with the traditions of the Advance Wars series, I found this to be less than I expected. The GBA Advanced Wars games seemed so much better for their times.","sadly i doubt we will get a good follow up to this title . graphics are more reminiscent of the GBA than the DS, but it has a very distinct and charming art style . by far, the best Advance Wars game in the series ."
309.MLB 11: The Show,"the best mlb ever i have played mlb 13 and still isnt better than 2011 version its the best. I have always been a big baseball fan and love the graphics of this game but this game really ****. No matter what you do to try and win the game or how many different ways you try to win, the computer always seems to find away around it. There is no reason to play any game if you have no chance of winning the thing. I hate this game with a passion, because of that. I have no use for this game. The only thing this game does for me is frustrates me to the point where if the creator of the game was in front of me, that I would punish them for making a game that cheats to no end.. let's get real,honest for a change.This is the definite baseball title this year but I see a pattern,a mountain will you.Sony hit the high mark with last game's title and quite honestly it was the best baseball game ever made and probably will never be matched.This game has it all like last year but if you really go into it and put over 100+ hours like I did,you don't see the genious like last years **** 10 the show should of held back like most titles do but they went ahead and threw the perfect package.There is always spit shine like what they tried to do here but it doesn't match the mind blowing quality that last year brought **** die hard fans,this is a necessary buy for rosters sake, but for everyone else hold back,ESPECIALLY on there new title mlb 12 the show cause like I said,""down the mountain they roll!"". This is the best sports game ever made up to this point. It has amazing graphics and gameplay. I played over 150 hours on just the franchise.. Being a huge baseball fan and gamer, it's never been too difficult to find an MLB game that has the authenticity and stays true to the game, at least not in the last few years with MLB The Show around. No game has me as hooked as this game does. Everything is pretty much how baseball is. All the players are there, and if they're not, then you can do a roster update as it becomes available and you're set. Season and Franchise are both just as addicting as ever with small updates. Road to the Show is just as real and a great mode as the others. I can't say enough about this game, it's a must have for all baseball fans.. Best MLB game out there, but there is still more to improve, so I'm giving it a 9. The things I'd like to see are loose uniforms that blow in the wind, live weather via satellite or something, different swing types and personalities for different players.... The best sport series is back. The analog controls for batting, pitching, and fielding just add to the depth of the game. The only thing somewhat wrong with the game is the commentary.. I hate baseball. Cant stand watching it. That said this game is incredible. 10 out of 10. Best sports game on the PS3. Best baseball game ever made. The graphics are amazing. All the stadiums are so detailed. Even the minor league fields are accurate. The physics in this is are top notch too. I love playing the home run derby at heigh elevation maps. It actually takes into account the thinner air and that makes it so much easier to drop bombs.. The sense of accomplishment this game provides is substantial. This is the best of the series and one of the top baseball games of all time. It's not without its issues, however. The player models, for the most part, are drop dead gorgeous. You don't know how many times I've heard, ""I thought you were actually watching a game."" For the most part, especially from a distance, the stadiums look fantastic. The only gripe I still have is some of the textures up close in places that aren't normally seen close. Sometimes things will look bland, and things such as buildings in the background outside of the stadium just look horrible. The audience up close still doesn't look good. But the cutscenes, and the presentation, however redundant, will throw you a curveball on something new every once in a while. The analog hitting and pitching are the money makers. I started out the game overcomplicating the hitting and couldn't hit squat, so I toned down all the prepitch predictions and can get a solid game of hitting going where my guys are hitting realistic numbers. I did have to apply slider settings but I have it to the point where all the games are close. I haven't touched the pitcher settings on mine, and the only gripe I have is that when i put a pitch somewhere, it only goes to where i put it maybe 70% of the time. I can't tell if it's me, or if it's an accuracy thing with the pitcher i'm using, because I feel like i hit it right every time. And still there seems to be some scripted offense, to me, when playing against the computer. One random inning, they just seem to do everything right, and it's just that one inning, generally the third. I don't think i've won by more than 4 runs more than twice, the games are always close and compelling. Hitting a game winning home run is fantastic. The franchise and season mode still are consistent with the past. I don't play 162 game seasons b/c i don't have time for it. I'm playing a 30 game season, and what bugs me is the lack of thought put into generating a season. You play every team the month of april. No teams do any transactions during a season. I haven't done the franchise b/c like i said, no 162 game season. How bout do a franchise mode for once where you can portion the season. I don't like simming either b/c i like the players to have the stats I accrued, not the computer. I also haven't played online or done the RTTS, b/c that's just extra stuff, I stick to the season. But besides the few quirks I mentioned, which ironically haven't really ever been addressed, this is the most solid and satisfying game of baseball that you can play to date and is a must buy for baseball fans and maybe even worth the switch over to this system.. I have bought this game since the 08 version (ok I live in the uk alright, we dont get baseball over here)... and to be honest the series has got better every **** i feel this years version is very close to 10. The inclusion of analogue controls is a big plus , but Ive found that its very frustrating, sometimes it feels like it doesnt work properly as quite often ive pushed up and left (or right) and the ball goes in the completely opposite direction sometimes not at all ..its also seriously sensitive even on the lowest setting, and batting is just as hard. So for me ive gone back to the buttons. That aside, the game is visualy better, there are a ton of small ""**** the cpu will make more mistakes , the crowd has been ramped up reacting to play more often, different camera options etc...more online options this year as well. So imo if you have 10 and are not too bothered about analogue control, or smaller improvements (and lets be honest what else can they improve on!) then stick wih it. If you want to try the new control scheme then get this game. and of course one thing to remember as well if you play online alot is your going to have to get this as the MLB 10 servers are being turned **** thats a sham. This baseball game is probably the most true to sport game that I have played. Graphically this game shines esp when my buddies came over and thought they ere watching a real game. Batting in this game is real hard. The pitch speeds come in really fast so the game forces you to be patient and work the count.. if your playing a top tier pitcher your gonna have a long day. Fielding in this game has been improved with the analong stick throwing. You throw to the base with the stick in the direction the base is in and depending how long you hold down is the strength of the throw. you must wait as well til you get your fielder the ball or youll juggle the throw and will make a error. This makes fielding must more realistic and makes you patient. I had trouble with the sticks to pitch and bat so I did the classic meter and timing and it plays fine for me if your good with the stick then hey its a option they made for people to enojoy. This year they added Aa new announcer (eric karros) which makes it alot better in the box for the game so it feels like a broadcast and not as bad as the past few years of the show have been but it woulda been nice for them to make the old announcers have a bunch of new lines. Other than that its the show the best in the biz for baseball if more sports games would follow suit and pay attention to even the smallest detail which immerses you into the game they way it should. If you love baseball this game will not dissapoint. Oh boy. Where to begin? If you have played this series for the last 5 years or so, this should be easy to write. It's everything it's always been with some tweaks, improvments and minor additions. The new controls are nice. I didn't like the right stick pitching at first, and went back to the meter. After a few games I realized that I actually like the stick pitching better. It's more accurate believe it or not. The game still takes the pitcher your using into account when playing, so even though you may moved the stick perfectly, it doesn't always guarantee a strike or where you put it. Hitting, I found to be 50/50. In one hand, it's a little more forgiving than last years. When you get a good swing on a pitch, obviously you'll get a hit, homer or some other sort of gratifying result. The problem is, for me anyway, it was hard to aim with the left and swing with the right, causing me to strike out alot more than I usually do. Hopefully with some practice, I will get better. Than there's RTTS mode, which I find myself playing 80% of the time nowadays. Depending on the position(I personally like starting ptiching), you get alot more points for pitching well. It's feasable to have a beast of a pitcher by year two. Other positions need to be improved. Like catcher mode. It takes FOREVER to get through a game and will be boring for most. The only reason I play it is to get the Acheivements. The turn around isn't enough for me. My favorite position to create is an infielder. The reason being is mainly, because you can get through games faster. One trick is to put your sliders up for the first couple of seasons that way you can guarantee progress fast. After you acheive beast like status, adjust them accordingly. I love this mode, but it could use some more tweaking. It's very easy to throw to the wrong base, commit errros, and gaff on the basepaths when the camera swings around. I can't tell you how many times i've rounded third only to stop short and start running back to third because of this problem. They should give you the option to use regular controls for baserunning in this mode. A minor flaw that RTTS vets. will be able to overcome. Other than that, this game is SO deep! I have had it almost a month and havent even scratched the surface. Franchise has been modyfied. It's still the same pretty much except the interface has changed a little. What else? OH Yeah! Games will start during twilight and slowly make their way to night time. Day games will cast shadows thru the clouds, giving a cool light/dark effect when hitting. Some ball parks accentuate this effect, making it hard to hit during some innings when the ball passes thru the shadows. Can't comment on multiplayer because I havent had time to play it. Plus I stink against real people. I did dabble in the menu area and got my daily roster update. There seems to be some cool gamer rating stats and stuff if youre really into that sort of thing. From what I know and judging by the amount of people playing online, it seems to work. 10 of thousands of people online at once isn't a fluke. There you have it. If youre getting the B-ball fever, this game will give you the fix you need. p.S. the player models are as real as ever. Some of the animations are still strange, but there are also some cool things too. My 1st baseman ran to a slow grounder that was foul and in danger of rolling in fair. A run would have scored, but he ran to the ball and booted it away frrom the foul line with his glove to insure it would stay foul. The booth commented on the heads up move which was cool. These sort of things seem to happen at least once a game which gives you the illusion that every game is different than the next. I really love this game and even though it is still the same at it's core, there are enough improvements to keep you going all season long.. Strong Baseball game that builds on an already solid foundation. Lets start with Graphics? The graphics and animations in this game are one of the best I've ever seen... Each year Sony adds a little more in this area. If a player slides into a base the dirt gets messed up and you can see the slide marks. The mound will progressively get marked up through out the game because of the deliveries. The stadiums are Gorgeous!!! The back drops around them not so much but hey Im not looking outside the ball **** they got certain landmarks down, Im happy as there seems to be no dip in frame rate from what Ive seen! There are some collison detection problems when running into the wall an arm might go through it. It in no way takes away from the game. Score: 9.2 Sound, The sound is great you hit a foul ball you here a symbol crash. The fans cheer and gasp and groan on a call they believe should have been a ball or strike...depending on who they are rooting for. Authentic baseball sounds makes you feel like your at the stadium. The Commentary well its about the same as yrs past. I dont know if anyone will ever be able to get this down. As you can only put so many lines in before the start getting repetitive. That's my only gripe is it get repetitive quick. Other than that most of the time they are on point about the game and whats going on. Score: 9 Gameplay: Heres where its at you can have the best looking and sounding game around but if it looks and sounds like a porche but drives like a broken down pinto well then, Its just no good! This year Sony stepped it up. with the pure analog controls.. I will admit it at first I wasn't crazy about them but now I Love them!!! once you get used to them Im telling ya you wont go back to buttons. You have so much more control. Example when fielding the ball If you think a runner is going to go home you can push down to start the throw home, however if you dont let the stick go you can hold the runner at 3rd rotate to 2nd and get the easy out. I like this where as you push X to keep the runner at 3rd now you have a runner on 2nd and 3rd. Pitching is tight also with the pure anolog controls!!! You have control over the ball in the zone. depending on the guy on the mound you will have better control. Now for the **** course with the new anolog controls there come some problems. A lot of errors over throws at first etc. with that said I found you make less mistakes if you just hold the stick till its green and let it go. unless you have a gray hound running... you have plenty of time to get the ball over to first. the more you put on it and hurry the more of a chance you have of an E. They can improve on this for next yr! and if you dont like the pure anolog contols you can always switch back to the buttons. Score: 8.9 Overall Great Graphics sound and game play. Remember it looks and sounds like a porche it also drives like it as well. It has more game modes that will keep you busy through Oct and into spring training of next yr. A must have game for any sports fan! PLAY BALL!!! Over all Score: 9. If you say you don't like this game you either A don't have a ps3 and wish you did or B you are not a baseball fan. This is a great game. Makes you feel like you are there in the action. 360 owners I'm sorry this game is not available to you I really am but get over it.. This is the best baseball game in this year. Graphic is clean and easy to use More realistic player modeling and their animations. all looks great. Like this game.. The pros is that this game finally included analog controls for pitching, fielding and batting. Also the many ways you can customize the game cameras is a plus. Besides that it's the same game with updated rosters. If you own last years game you pretty much have the same game as MLB the Show 11. On a side note I'm very bitter that SCEA is turning off the servers for MLB 10. Not even EA shuts down servers this quick. SCEA has been doing this for the past 3 years and I will not buy a new game from them. Get last years game to get you through the season and then buy MLB 11 around December for $10 used off of Gamefly. This game is not worth $60! 1) Still no playoff tournament mode. 2) Online is really bad (lags) 3) Presentation is the same as prior versions (very stale and now boring). 4) Franchise bugs, wait for patch again. 5) Graphical glitches (ie players going through walls) graphics over bright. 6) Collision detection still bad. 7) Load time and game saving is painfully slow. 8) Features removed from the game (ie pitch count button) 9) Developer is lazy with player portraits on the stock roster that shipped. 10) New game, new bugs, old bugs, same shish different day. $20 DLC at best! MLB 11 is a good game, but 08, 09 and 10 were also good games, the only reason to upgrade is for rosters and online, but online is still broken.. The Show is always the best baseball game, this year's is no exception. I love the new controls but for me the single player mode is what seals the deal. Road to the show is the best - BY FAR single player mode in any sports title. Being a baseball guy I look forward to spring training, the launch of the Show and opening day all happening in about a month's span.. Still the most realistic sports game on the market. Could improve in some areas, but there are a lot of new features (co-op, challenge of the week). Watch the A's in 2011.. There's not much more that can be said about The Show series that hasn't already been said. The Show 10 was great, and 11 still manages to improve upon that. Is it perfect? No, but in my opinion a game doesn't have to be to warrant a ""10"" review. My favorite improvements are perhaps not ones that have been mentioned a lot. 1. Streamlined game play settings saving. Last years system was a mess and it felt like you had to save the same setting in 3 different places if you wanted to make sure all your games in any mode played a certain way. This year, you just make a custom settings profile and you can apply that 1 profile to any game mode at any time. 2. Fielding improvements. For example, a ground ball is hit to the first basemen; last year he would go through a short 1/2 to a full second animation to prepare to throw the ball to another fielder, when really all you wanted to do was make him touch first. This year, he'll field the ball and straight away you're able to control him and touch the bag. (this is just an example). 3. Home Run Derby is EXCELLENT with the Move controls added this year (though I'd like to see them eventually incorporated into the rest of the game as an option). the best is made even better - once again, ignore the lazy and biased IGN review (8.0 for graphics?? come on, who are you kidding) - this is one of the most incredible and deep sports games ever created, even if you're not a big fan of true real baseball.. You like baseball do ya? Then you need this game, tell 'em Phantom- Tommy sent **** might get some money off the game, but you probably wont. MLB 11: The Show is a fantastic sports game and should not be missed by any self respecting baseball fan, what more can i say.. Best baseball game on the market. Hands down. My friends and I rent each one every year to decide which one we should all get, and this is the second year The Show won, and this year it was unanimous. Truly a great video game all around.. Simply the best baseball simulation out. None of the old ea games or the current 2K series can compete with The Show. Definitely a system seller for the PS3.. The Show once again amazes. I am the kind of person that tends to get sports games every other year, because usually it takes 2-3 years for any major changes besides rosters to show up and make a difference. This is not the case with MLB, which makes the purchase well worth it every year. The big change this year is the analog control. Personally, I prefer the old style of controls, but the fact that I now have to option to change my control scheme (and even mix and match analog pitching with classic hitting, for instance) to another scheme that works really well (from what i can tell) and isnt just a gimmick is great. In addition to the above major change for this year, there are minor , yet nonetheless awesome, changes abound. You can now mix and match uniforms a la madden 11, which I have been wanting for years. You can now take your buddy sitting in the room with you and both of you can play online as a team. The fielding reaction time stat has been added, and makes you think when subbing players late in games. The only one of these changes that I not super thrilled about is adding eric karros to the broadcast team. His lines seem a bit awkward at times, but luckily you can adjust th volume of specific announcers so its ok. I'm sure there are tons of features that I have left out, but I want to finish writing this review so I can go back to playing! An easy 10/10 for me, and it should be a no-decision buy for any PS3 owning baseball fan. Why 2K even bothers to release their game on the PS3 baffles me :P. Every year I purchase both MLB: the show and MLB 2k series baseball games for the PS3 and Xbox 360 respectively, reason being i like being able to play baseball in the man cave ""PS3"" and also in the bedroom ""Xbox"" before i hit the sack. Needless to say I am familiar with the game of baseball as well as it's video game counterpart- which brings me to why i felt the reason to post a review on this game... IGN giving this game an 8 out of 10... seems suspect when everyone else scores it above a 90% doesn't it? Seeing as IGN gave MLB 10 The Show a score of 9.0* stating the need for analog stick controls as a big vice for the 2010 version, and as how the big addition to MLB 11 The show is finally analog pitching-hitting-and fielding controls, It's pretty clear IGN low balled the Show. IGN would have an argument for giving it a lower score than last year if Sony would have just added analog controls and left the rest alone waiting for next year to improve, but this is not the case. Right from the get go you can see the Menu overlays have been greatly improved as well as textures and player models- not to mention the lighting is literally night and day from last years lighting engine. And those are just the visual enhancements, commentary has gotten a much needed color boost by replacing Rex Hudler with Eric Karros, the ""Road to the Show"" mode has seen a huge change with the replacement of checklist style goals to an overall performance review style system, and not to mention the inclusion of both local and online Co-op play as well as numerous other upgrades and gameplay improvements- Dynamic Weather anyone? But all in all this years version of The Show is easily the best video game baseball game made on next gen hardware, IGN... Normally I'm a fan of your work, but this time- You struck out on 3 pitches. LET'S PLAY BALL!!. Such a fantastic baseball experience. The improvements made are well worth the purchase even if you own last years. The Fielding is fantastic and really makes a difference in the outcome of the game. Adding the new Pure Analog Controls similar to EA's old NCAA MVP Baseball is a blessing. It really adds more depth to pitching, making YOU put in control of everything now. If you're a baseball fan do yourself a favor and get this, it's only on the Sony consoles- so buy yourself one if you don't own one. It's worth the purchase of a system for any die hard baseball fan. tl;dr- If you're planning on buying a baseball game- get The Show. 2K11 is complete garbage. If you're still curious on it read the reviews they don't lie. Just ignore IGN's score it was obviously influenced by a check 2K wrote.","the best mlb ever i have played mlb 13 and still isnt better than 2011 version its the best . the only thing this game does for me is frustrate me to the point where i would punish them for making a game that cheats to no end . this is the definite baseball title this year but i see a pattern,a mountain will you ."
31.Gran Turismo,"The game is great despite being the First of the PSX console the truth would be The best of the saga but There is someone that surpasses it. Greates racing game of all time - nothing is close and nothing ever will be!. It may look and feel outdated in 2024, but upon release twenty-six years ago this was the pinnacle of racing sims with unparalleled realism and a huge selection of cars to drive.. There's a reason this series effectively birthed the sim racing genre. It's a great game, holds up quite well even to this day and the progression is as solid as ever. The sheer variety of cars, tracks, and modifications means that pretty much all playthroughs of Gran Turismo will be truly unique. You can't really name another series on PS1 that had economy cars like the Mazda Demio and fire-spitting racing machines like an LM tuned Dodge Viper GTR sharing the same CD. Despite the many things I love about this game, including the fact that it's the origin of one of my favorite game series, I do still have a few gripes. This was their first outing, so I have to cut them some slack, but the physics can feel a bit off at times, especially on high-power sports cars. When you brake, the nose of the car is supposed to dip, as you're putting more weight on the front suspension. This does happen, but in a way more extreme manner than maybe intended. Cars will frequently bottom out under heavy braking which can easily cause the car to slide as the back end threatens to overtake the front. This can be mitigated by ""feathering"" the brake, and stiffening the front dampers but the lack of analog control on PS1 does hurt here, thankfully this was addressed in GT2. Also the opponent AI borders on braindead and will simply ram into you mid-corner instead of even trying to take a different line. If you're in front this hardly matters, but if you're having to fight through to the front, this can be very frustrating as the opponents drive as if you do not exist. Now for a bit of a controversial take, I don't mind the license tests in GT. License tests in GT are series of small driving challenges that you must complete in order to be given a license, these licenses (B license, A license, and International A license) are required in order to access certain events. Sure, they're a royal pain when you're playing through as a veteran player, but these license tests are invaluable for teaching people unfamiliar with racing principles how to drive not only cleanly, but quickly and efficiently. One might argue they should've made it optional, but people are quite likely to skip a tutorial when given the option. Give this game a go, it's one of the weaker entries nowadays, but it's still a boatload of fun.. I remember back in the early 2000's playing this as a chield, average graphics but the gameplay is awful.. Really good racing game that still holds up really well to this day. A must play for any racing fans and Playstation owners. played this on emulator cuz of my friend of school said his big brother still plays it nowadays rofl. A complete revolution in car video games. With street cars and not just luxury supercars.. One of the best racing games ever made. Started a legendary franchise and Gran Turismo is a titan of racing sims.. Just before I start this review, I have absolutely no nostalgia at all for this game, simply because I am a 2000s kid and I already grew up with a PS2 with GT3 and GT4. Having completed my first playthrough of GT1 last year and subsequently scrolled through some reviews, I think it's quite unfair to compare this game to any of it's sequels. It was a massive step forward in the racing game genre, and everyone working at the time at Polyphony Digital deserve all the praise for their hard work and determination it took to create this game. However, even back in the day and by admission of Mr. Yamauchi himself, there was a lot of room of improvement. First off, the car list: in short, it's very good, in spite of being expanded massively in the next installment on the same console. The only thing I can find wrong with it is the bloat of some models like the Honda Civic or Nissan Skyline, which have some basic, tuned down, and ultimately unnecessary versions that don't have that much purpose at all, even for starter cars, Second, the track list: I love all this tracks, and they all became iconic in the franchise, however the low number becomes apparent very, very quickly. The quality is great, but the number is not that great, Finally, the career mode: I'm a **** for 100% completion, so I did gold all the licences before starting the career properly, which gave me some great cars to start out with. Even though I got my cars for free, I still noticed how strict the economy is on this game. For example, the Sunday Cup payments were very low (as you should expect), and the jump of difficulty between the Sunday Cup and other championships is very noticeable. You have to grind the Sunday Cup a lot to have money for a better car or serious parts to upgrade your car, otherwise you will be stuck very early on in the game. I'm personally fine with this, but I can understand those who have problems with this. Besides that, I found the career very enjoyable, with the implementation of features like an Upgrade Shop combined with the freedom to choose your own path to the GT World Championship resulting in a revolutionary and fun career mode. In summary, I see myself coming back to this game more times in the future, even though the sequels are superior in almost every single aspect. I recommend this game, a timeless classic that's never too late to be enjoyed.. Game of the year Game of the year Game of the year Game of the year Game of the year. the only downside of this game is THE SEQUEL IS BETTER, man what a start of an amazing franchise ****! *7th is still frickin dissapointing. Revolutionary game with endless content, great physique, graphics, soundtrack and gameplay.. This game is quite simply the most influential racing game to have ever been made. While it has been trumped by GT2 and GT4 in terms of content and gameplay, there is no racing game that helped define the genre quite like GT1.. I play this game in 1998 using PS1 and then now in 2023 with PS1 emulator on Vita. Not change, this game is very awesome, even after 25 years.. Gran Turismo originally released as Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator in Japan and Europe, is a 1997 racing simulation video game developed by Polys Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation.. The Racing! Best in time. Still brilliant. Ps1 must play game. Graphic look sad, but this is only one minus.. A brilliant video game, but substantially bettered by its immediate sequel. Classic. Miles better than the metaphorical car crash the series became- enjoyment was part of the series early on, before it became joyless and hateful.. This game is a masterpiece. I loved it back then in 1998. I still play my original copy. amazing game with amazing soundtrack (European Version Only), one of the greatest PS1 racing game. A true technical showcase for the PS1. It's a good game for it's time, and is still great today, but there are better racing games for the time. Gran Turismo 2 and Sega GT just to named a few.. This game is certainly realistic, and technically impressive for the time. But It come at the cost of being fun. If you want fast paced racing action, look elsewhere, because this game is a Driving Simulator, and not much more.. Gran Turismo has what i wanted for years in a racing game, a lot of cars... And thats it honestly, i think is half overrated. Everyone calls it the most realistic driving sim, but that's just not true. No realistic driving sim would let you ram a concrete barrier at 200 M.P.H. and simply bounce off like it never happened. No realistic driving sim makes it impossible to flip your car over. No realistic driving sim allows you to keep maximum revs for a half an hour in first gear without damaging your engine in the least. Gran Turismo excels at two things. Looking extremely good, even better than some PS2 racing games and the great variety of cars than even today racing games dream of it. Everything other than that is anywhere from average to terrible. the races itself repeats too much, you have to do a lot of licenses that some are almost impossible with so many difficult spikes, some upgrades actually makes your vehicle race worse or doesnt make much difference, and the steering of the car is terrible. While this is supposedly to be realistic, the AI doesnt have this realistic behavior (for example they can turn without oversteer or brake), and sometimes to minimize lap times you have to crash into the wall with the right angle instead of braking. Personally, the licenses would be much better if they give you much more time so they give you more time to brake and if you touch a wall or something they give you time penalty. The bronze trophies are so hard in the last license that they could easily be the gold ones. The races itself were decent, but they have a lot of problems, apart of what i said before: AI rubberbanding, grass makes your car hope, excessive oversteering and if you arent a car expert, you will never know what car is supposedly to be better than another since stats doesnt exist, but a bunch of random realistic specs that for the average player doesnt mean nothing. And for last, the tracks itself were very few and in the tournaments were very repetitive, this is even worse in the ""Gran Valley"" mode, where you have to do a 60 lap race, so annoying and just padding for the sake of being padding. If i talk about 1998 racing games i prefer Need For Speed 3 and Choro Q 3. This proves that better graphics, more cars and supposedly ""realism"" doesnt make a game much more fun and better, at least in my opinion. Gran Turismo is like a technical demo. I admit im impressed for what the developers had made in 1998, but is just more like a novelty, and not a game for play to the end, because finishing all the races with gold, is just one of the most tedious, boring and unfair experiences i have ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was just so much fun as a child, I still remember my favorite car even though I can't remember it's name!. You can't really compare a racing game from 22 years ago with a modern one, because racing games tend to evolve, because of driving mechanics, realism, features, more cars, open world maps. BUT, if you can compare them influence-wise, Gran Turismo 1 is the best ever. The feeling you had when you played this at that time, will never be matched. Yes Forza Horizon is amazing but, you can't get the same feeling that you had with Gran Turismo 1 back then. I really wish for a remake with today's graphics... I could get a PS5 only for that. Gran Turismo on PlayStation is one of the most important games in video game history. It did set the standard for probably every racing game that followed. Revolutionary in every aspect at its time and even today worth coming back to. This game is almost perfect!. One of the most iconic ps1 games imo. I spent countless hours in my teen years playing this game and its sequel. And my father is into cars so it was also a bonding experience. The cars and tracks, OST.. all astounding.. Classic that became stable and brought the real driving sim genre to the players and playstation. Real cars, licences, memorable tunes and hours upon hours of fun. This game made even me, who is not a fan of racing games, appreciate and enjoy this genre. Keep your car clean, heat up your engine and aim for the gold!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game was pure revolution at its time. It pushed back the graphic boundaries. Controls were a kind of simulation on a game pad. And these soundtracks were the best of music at this time. Even today it's still a pleasure to watch the intro with the remix of ""Manic Street Preachers - Everything Must Go"" by the Chemical Brothers. Simply an incredible, revolutionary and historical game.. This game is loads of fun, and it looks fine for something released in 1998. The only problem I have with it is the beginning cutscene. When I first loaded the game up (not sure if it was just me), but I had to sit through 2 minutes of driving replays (brand new memory card, so it wasn't that). The controls are fine, though not as smooth as I would like them to be, but the game is nice, and can be picked up for pretty cheap.. dis gam hav d first factor* so u cant repeat ur first experienc :/ fluorescents cars n a flawles pixeled atmosfer- i dont like football but i enjoyed internacional superstarsoccer deluxe for megadrive in the same way GT scarred my memory even if I dont play a racing game again. The greatest race game of all time, did you imagine a game like this in those years! Of course not!. 19 years have past, i was 7 years old and i still remember my first lap on this game when my dad brought it home. Played the heck out of it as all of us who had this gem. 10/10 masterpiece.. it was a good game for the ps one, the graphics, and gameplay are excellent, its also a hard game, it keeps you playing to improve and unlock new tracks. Spent countless of hours with this game as a kid, the game is really well done at makes you feel like you are driving ( at least when it came out) The game has several modes, and will take challenge you.. The BEST racing game EVER!! I Love it so much, for a start of this ultimate driving franchise! Hundreds of cars to use and more than 10 insanely competitive racing tracks to race in too.. Gran Turismo is the first video game I've ever played (in 2000) and at the time I thought it was the best game ever. But playing this in 2016 made me change that opinion real quick. Firstly the simulation mode is really short, and I mean REALLY short. It took me 12 hours to fully beat the game at 100% (excluding the gold licences) and no I wasn't usually overpowered cars, I was usually using cars that balances the rest of the AI. Well it could mean that I'm a good driver? Not really, I just think the game was too short to fully utilize everything from gran turismo. (Great example of this is ""One make races"") Secondly not enough content, like my first point. GT1 had a great potential to be a game to last 30+ hours... with the combination of all tracks (forward and reverse) you'd think that there would a lot more races, there was only 3 endurance races, (and 2 of the endurance race were from the same track but forward and reserve) I think they could have used mini endurances in other tracks which could have been a lot more interesting. Same with grand prix.. there weren't too many that stuck out and maybe more GPs could have been added, but that's just me. Next problem I have with the game is the audio quality, I know GT hasn't been the greatest with audio quality but the audio sounds too bland, the same tire screech noise played on a 1 second loop while you are drifting sounds dreadful, the engine revs sounds really similar (except for the LM cars) and because of this, car enthusiasts wouldn't be able to enjoy the sound effects of the cars because they probably wouldn't know the difference between a ""Corvette grand sport"" and a ""95' Honda prelude"". And if it wasn't for the interesting soundtrack, I would honestly play the game on mute. And finally the AI isn't great, I found the AI to be extremely aggressive which I find that they always bump into your car like bumper cars, I even found myself spinning out or going off track because the cars are pushing me to the side of the road, this makes the AI completely unreliable and so I find myself watching the AI for a smooth overtake because I'm afraid they'll pull a pit maneuver on me which will make me lose the race. But after all the negative comments, I do have to give these game credit. This is one of the best racing sims I've played on a console, GT1 pushed the PS1 to the limits with this game. The graphics, the amazing rendering for it's time and hell... the game could even play on 60FPS if it wanted to (See Hi-Fi mode GT1). And even so I found the game preform a lot better overall then it's predecessor ""Gran Turismo 2"". The car physics in GT1 has to be kinda wonky and tends to oversteer a lot which doesn't make a lot of sense, because car physics in GT2 and newer GTs tends to do the opposite and understeer a lot more. It makes GT1 cars easier to drift because of oversteer. But other then that it's a good game, I finished the game once but honestly I would probably never play this game again. GT2 is a much better game then GT1 and GT3 and GT4 are considered some of my favourites in the Gran Turismo franchise. But why I'm not going to play the game again? It seems like the game is too outdated whereas GT2 is not, and I'm not talking about the graphics, but the gameplay mechanics, the content and all of these races to keep you occupied, GT1 lacks in content, I've stated the gameplay mechanics are wonky and the lack of races seem to uninteresting. But GT2 seems to fix all of that and honestly I'm glad Polyphony Digital steered out of GT1's direction and made some changes. GT1 will remain a classic but some classics doesn't need to be reopened and played again.. Simply one of the best racing games of all time and one of the greatest legacies of Playstation (by not call the greatest, lol) Anyway, a great game for a great console... This game is my first game on playstation, i love it so much i have over 700 hours on it when i was just a 11 year old. This game is truly one of the best racing game i have ever played True score: 9.8. Best race game ever for me! Nice soundtrack, graphics, cars, ehm, ALL IT´S AWESOME! I still listen to the soundtrack, the nostalgia of it directly sparkle, until now I'm playing on an emulator, and I think that bathe PS1 to play it.. A PlayStation Classic. A racing simulator that was very influential and perhaps one of the greatest (if not the greatest). There really was not a game at its time that was more realistic than Gran Turismo. This could easily be on a list of ""The Greatest Video Games Ever"".. The racing game that set the standard for all the rest. Huge amount of cars and tracks for a PS game. Almost every modern racing game includes features that GT had back in 98.. The Best Game Ever? Not quite. But a very important one, nonetheless. I was too young to enjoy it when it first came out (I always lost), but five years later, and wow. I play it on my PSP even now. Anyone reading this probably all ready knows what to expect, so I won't ramble on. While the new generation systems have remarkable capabilities, every racing game after this one will still have a hard time measuring up.","the game is great despite being the First of the PSX console the truth would be The best of the saga but there is someone that surpasses it . the sheer variety of cars, tracks, and modifications means that pretty much all playthroughs of Gran Turismo will be truly unique . despite the many things i love about this game, i do still have a few gripes ."
310.NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition,"it changed my life, jesus crist yoko taro did what eiji aonuma didnt, write a lot of verry good storys whithout reciclyng the same""base"" or ""format"" i alwais cry when i listen tje soundtrack of this game this game have a lot of nteresting lore. This game is amazing, from start to finish. The story starts off very open ended and mysterious, but as the game progresses we begin to piece together what’s really happening. The combat flows nicely like a FF game, and the visuals are stunning. I like the side quests as well because they allow the player to build relationships with the characters of the world. Bravo, 10/10 game.. Completed on Xbox Series X in 2024. Gameplay, music, story, and a simply perfect world. Continuous homages to different modes of the video game's history. Different story told in chapters that invites you to finish the game several times. A marvel. Now I'm going for Replicant!. Nier: Automata is to gaming, what The Godfather is to movies, what David is to sculpting, what The Great Gatsby is to books, etc. Nier:Automata surpasses gaming as a genre and stands as a piece of art that can be appreciated by anyone, not just those privy to gaming as a genre.. This game is just amazing! Finally unlocked Kaine's outfit! Now I need to rank up to fight Emil and get the final ending! I can't believe there isn't a sequel for this one.. This game is the best example of a ""perfect game"" ..an open world with great story ends in a 26 way, 60 side quest and i enjoyed every single one, im so glad i played this game.. musics and story carry the game. gameplay was mid, albeit female android fighting style is good. too much gimmicks for my tastes. took me 3 years to finish the game. i tried multiple times but was giving up true ending is cool though the game try to do too much differents thinks, less is more. This is indeed a once in a lifetime experience and can have a huge impact in your life. Please, play this game, fellow gamer!. Best game ever made Music is 10 Characters are 10 Gameplay is 10 I played this game at 800/600 resolution with 24 fps and I don't care this game is so good even it being unplayable for me won't matter a bit Must play. One of the BEST games last generation. PROS: -Very interesting story that should be replayed 3 times to see all 3 ""points of view"" of different protagonists. -Amazing graphics. -Wonderful music. -Great controls and fast paced combat. -Gamepaly variety like no other game (you have 2D sections, other times you're controlling a ship and it's like an old arcade shooter, or you're fighting on top of a train, seriously the variety is insane and it makes the game a blast to play). -Extremely high production values everywhere you look at. With so many games releasing with tons of bugs it was great to see a game like Nier Automata perform silky-smooth. CONS: -I sincerely can't think of a ""bad thing"" about the game. It's one of the greatest games I've played in the last 5 years and an all time favorite alongside gems like Witcher 3, Mass Effect 1, Uncharted 2, Tomb Raider 2013, Dead Space, Bioshock Infinite, Ghost of Tsushima and a few others. CONCLUSION: -If you like action RPGs you must play Nier Automata, is one of the very best games the genre has seen over the last 10 years.. One of teh best games ever!!! awesome to play several times, I need more games like this one. This game is INCREDIBLE. Without spoiling, just try.. NieR is a beautiful game with an amazing soundtrack, a game that only keeps getting better.. This is a game for jrpg and souls lovers. Complex with a very weird and limited saving system. There is literally no save option in the beginning of the game at all. What is it you wanted to achieve by this - to annoy players? Well, congrats, you did.. Best game I've ever played. Has the best soundtrack and story I've ever seen in a game. Combat is fantastic as well.. i dont like the graphics it looks like a ps3 game and outdated not much i like about this game it hasnt actually reeled me in then i found out u can kill yaself by accident losing everything u worked hard to get omg that was it i havent been back since stupid idea for a stupid looking game. NieR: Automata is the peak of gaming experience. An awesome story with amazing twists, gameplay that is fun and does not get boring, even after 40+ hours of gameplay, incredible details in the world and side quests, a unique way of storytelling from the numerous endings and side characters. The music is incredible, graphics could be better, but they are still marvelous. One of the best games i ever played, definitely recommend to play it. Worth every second of dedication. Where should I start? This game is a masterpiece in almost every way. The story is extremely well written, but characters are unfortunately not as interesting as in the original NieR. Still, there is an extreme amount of fun to be had in this game. The combat is extremely fun and Platinum Games has done an extremely good job there. It feels buttery smooth and they really put a lot of thought into how it would feel best for the player. The soundtrack is a 10 out of 10, I still have a few songs in my Spotify playlist and enjoy them every time they come on. The music is extremely diverse and can be anything. Dramatic, sad, funny, anything you can imagine. The music also actually always fits perfectly with what's going on. NieR Automata is more than just an anime waifu, it's such an incredibly interesting and beautiful game that I want to erase all my memories of this game and experience it again.. This game has achieved something beyond what I thought to be possible. This game is undoubtedly one of the first games that I'd call perfect. Never have I felt so engaged to a story, it's characters and the messages layered within. If you haven't taken the opportunity to play through this game, play it. It doesn't matter if this message is read 10 years from now, play it. It doesn't matter if you are reading from the year 2040, play it. This is the game of the century.. This game **** complete ****, you play as a sex offender holding an controller remote which controls a female in the game. I give it one point for Chris because I like him and he likes it. You have to be cringe and unbased to like this.. If you appreciate gaming itself, beautiful music and characters, a dystopian world with an intriguing and thought provoking story about finding oneself then play this game, I give it my full recommendation and praise to yoko taro for his masterpiece. An excellent game with good story and nice gameplay. There are so many different endings in this game but there are 3 main endings and you play 3 characters in each ending. All of them were cool to play. But I will be honest this did not blew my mind. This was a damn good game but not enough for 10/10. With an incredible soundtrack, well-written, deep characters, expansive locations, and good, fulfilling combat, NieR: Automata is undoubtably one of the greatest JRPGs of all time. The story alone would make it one of the greatest pieces of fiction that I have ever experienced, but Yoko Taro builds on the story and makes the entire game an absolute joy.. This has to be one of the most weird, unique, and creative games ever made. There are countless memorable and thought-provoking moments. I would even describe some of them as powerful. I really enjoyed the open world, the depth of the combat, the serene soundtrack, and the engaging story and characters. My only grievances are some of the weaker side quests and the story can be a little too abstract, especially if you don’t do a little homework on it’s lore beforehand. I will be contemplating this game for a long time.. this is the best game i have ever played in my whole life, the story, the music, the gameplay, the side quests, ITS JUST WONDERFUL. 10/10. I would like to start with some FAQs: 1) How to save? -> After the tutorial, you can manually save almost all over the world, as long as the area is safe. For that you just have to unlock the checkpoints. 2) Is there fasttravel? -> A fasttravel system is available after a few hours of gameplay. You can then travel back and forth between the unlocked checkpoints. But before that you have to walk everything. + The maps/worlds are beautiful and varied - no matter if industrial, desert or forest area. At the beginning the world is quite big, but after the 1st walkthrough I have to say that it could have been a bit more. + The story is good. + A lot of action - sometimes as a 2D twin-stick shooter, most of it in nice 3D graphics. + Cool bosses +/- The 2nd walkthrough I can only conditionally recommend. The 3rd walkthrough is then really annoying. The enemies are 10-20 levels higher and you can't buy any items at the beginning. Without health boost it became so annoying that I quit the game. Big minus. - The ""tutorial"" (a kind of introductory map) really ticked me off. It goes about 1h and if you die at the end, you have to start all over again. You can't save in the tutorial either. And the stupidest thing is that in the tutorial is not shown how to use the health items manually. __ Ich möchte mit einigen FAQs beginnen: 1) Wie kann man speichern? -> Nach dem Tutorial kann man fast in der ganzen Welt manuell speichern, sofern das Gebiet sicher ist. Dafür müsst ihr einfach die Checkpoints freischalten. 2) Gib es Fasttravel? -> Ein Fasttravel-System gibt es nach ein paar Stunden Gameplay. Ihr könnt dann zwischen den freigeschalteten Checkpoints hin und herreisen. Vorher müsst ihr aber alles zu Fuss gehen. + Die Maps/Welten sind schön und abwechslungsreich - egal ob Industrie-, Wüsten-, oder Wald-Gebiet. Zu Beginn wirk die Welt ziemlich gross, aber nach dem 1. Walkthrough muss ich sagen, dass es noch etwas mehr hätte sein dürfen. + Die Story ist gut. + Viel Action - mal als 2D Twin-Stick-Shooter, der grösste Teil in hübscher 3D-Grafik. + Coole Bosse +/- Der 2. Walkthrough kann ich nur bedingt empfehlen. Es werden einige Aspekte der Geschichte von einer anderen Seite her beleuchtet, und mit dem Charakter 9S hat man etwas andere Kampfmöglichkeiten, aber unter dem Strich lohnen sich die zusätzlichen und sehr ähnlichen 10h nur bedingt. Der 3. Walkthrough ist dann richtig nervig. Die gegner sind 10 - 20 Level höher und man kann zu Beginn keine Items mehr kaufen. Ohne Health-Boost wurde es so annoying, dass ich das Spiel abgebrochen habe. Grosses Minus. - Das ""Tutorial"" (eine Art Einführungsmap) hat mich richtig angekackt. Es geht ca. 1h und wenn man am Ende stirbt, muss man alles von vorne Beginnen. Man kann im Tutorial auch nicht speichern. Und das dümmste ist, dass im Tutorial nicht gezeigt wird, wie man die Health-Items manuell benutzt.. I cannot stress how amazing and dare I say it, Revolutionary this game is! It creates such a fantastic balance of incredible story telling and gameplay that I have never seen in any other video game. This is my favorite video game of all time. Nier: Automata is a revolutionary work of art and I recommend it to every single person that has access to electricity, It's just that good. I have no complaints, please give it a try.. Amazing, masterpiece, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard.. NieR Automata is undeniably the best game of all time and I genuinely mean it when I say that. I will try to keep this review relatively short but also informative. The overall story telling is absolutely impeccable and has you hooked at all times from the very start with 2B's incredibly philosophical Monologue. I felt like I was genuinely contributing to the story the more I played which is hard to say for a lot of games in my opinion. Gameplay is so satisfying and fun. Getting huge combos on dozens of enemies at once feels great and makes you want it even more. Great RPG elements allowing you to upgrade yourself over time, although the system is quite confusing at first. Everything else such as graphics, art design, sound design and the soundtrack is amazing too. The soundtrack is so memorable and is even comparable to the Halo soundtrack which I would consider as the best of all time. Overall, NieR Automata is still the best game of all time and even that title doesn't do the full game justice. I beg you to play it if you haven't already because you will seriously fall in love.. Deep, thoughtful, engaging, fun. Just an absolute joy to play through. Masterpiece. I only have 1 gripe: too much revisiting old areas. 9.5.. Overhyped game. Music and B2 are great. Everything else is average or low scale. Story just OK.. Are you f**king kidding me??? I die to the first boss within a matter of seconds because I don't immediately figure out how to dodge his attacks, and now I'm back in the f**king MAIN MENU and have to START THE WHOLE GAME OVER AGAIN??! Not even being able to skip the goddamn cutscenes?! Is this supposed to be some kind of dumb meta-joke? Your game can be as good as it wants, if you don't have the basic common sense to put a checkpoint before a boss-fight in the BABY TUTORIAL MISSION where the player is just figuring out how to play your f**king game (which is also way more difficult than it needs to be, since your game is dogs**t at explaining stuff), I'm not interested in playing it. I don't have infinite time to spare on nonsense like this. F**k this s**t. Glad I didn't spend money on this but just downloaded it off Game Pass.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As someone who has had a general disinterest in video games for the past 4 years, I can safely say that I enjoyed Nier: Automata. I bought this game for 20 bucks off of the Xbox store and have invested a beefy 15 hours into it, meaning i just finished the first campaign. I think for now that's about as much as i need from this game though. I absolutely love the world building, characters, music; all of the atmospheric stuff comes a long way in delivering an interesting world. i loved spending time as 2B in this environment, and when I eventually come back to play more in the next two campaigns, I'm sure I'll enjoy it as well. The combat is really great. It feels fair, balanced, skillful. I LOVE switching between different weapons and fighting enemy spawns. Going after bosses was also a fun challenge. As well, just taking in my surroundings and enjoying the detail each developer put into the world building was simply fantastic. Everything about this game's atmosphere and design screams love, care, and detail. I even got both world guides because of how much I LOVE the creative energy of this game. The story is pretty cool as well. I can say that i had a great experience overall. The characters 2B and 9S are great. It was a blast playing them and discovering the truth behind the world so far. Each time they got a cut-scene it was super badass. Seeing them react to the different worlds and characters they meet along the way is also great. I also love how the story incorporates into the open world. Each environment feels connected, alive, and teeming with awesome creative energy. I can't say it enough, but I love the detail put into this game. I'm super excited to discover more about the story and unlock more about the world later down the line! However, it breaks my heart to say that my enjoyment plummeted after a certain point. The final chapter of the first campaign was pretty disappointing; It felt like the game **** all over itself! The bosses from the mega spider onward felt like a cheese fest of annoying battle ""tactics"". I seriously did not have fun fighting anything from that point onward. Forcibly lowering my difficulty and cheesing from vantage points effectively stripped any sort of enjoyment I had from the game, and it was even more heartbreaking when the last 14 hours of the game were done so right! The story also takes a bit of a left turn, and when I wanted to learn more about this world, i was pushed into a dramatic side-plot about how some dude's brother was killed (trust me, I'm not spoiling much). All of this beautiful world building and story set up is effectively out of the picture! WTF? I'm sure i get more good stuff from the next two campaigns but this ending for now is simply unsatisfying; it felt like a slog to the finish line. I know that I'll come back one of these days for the absolutely amazing stuff mentioned previously, but a lukewarm story sort of knocks it down. I'd like for this game to be a 10, but all of the good stuff honestly just sort of dissipates into thin air after a certain point. I can say that I will keep revisiting Nier: Automata, but i'm not exactly dying to play the next portion, more so, I'll keep it on my radar when i have the time. BONUS: I speak Japanese as my second language, and I must say, it was a blast to play it in pure Japanese with the JP subtitles as well. I went into this thing with zero English. I hope to find other RPGs that do this if I pick a few more up. And as for anyone out there that's looking for a great game to play in pure Japanese (whether it's for language learning or pure enjoyment) you'll be satisfied with this one! It's intermediate-advanced level, but I think that anyone with JPLT N3 or higher should be able to digest what's going on with ease.. This game is a game with flaws. But this game gave me an impression that I couldn't see in other games. ​I played this game because it had a high rating. I want to say thank you to all the players who gave this game a high score. It may not be your favorite game, but I highly recommend this game. It's one of the must-play games when you're on the Game Pass.. I got my Nier: Automata introduction from Final Fantasy XIV raids. After I tried game it just swallowed me.. like totally. It was like a drug that I needed more and more.. and it also haunted me while I was not playing it. My dearest gaming experience. Thanks Yoko Taro.. This game is a masterpiece in literally every way. The combat never gets old and flows incredibly well, the soundtrack is one of the best I’ve ever heard in the games industry, and the story is extremely thought provoking and engaging. You come to care about the characters a lot as the story progresses, and none of them follow typical anime tropes, it’s even difficult to actually call this game a jrpg with how different it is from the rest. For me the world never felt empty, and it was for a reason as large scale vistas were displayed in front of you. The only area I believe can be criticized is the lack of gameplay variety in side quests, however the side quests still add to the world, whether it be new weapons or adding to the lore of the world. This game definitely makes it into the top 10 games I’ve ever played, and even if you have the slightest inclination to buy and play it, absolutely do it because you will not be disappointed!. Beautiful soundtrack, art direction, and interactions. While the ending is tedious to acquire and my biggest complaint, it's still a overall wonderful experience. A game that deserved the praises and positive reviews it gets, from those are actually played it atleast. Played this on Steam but Im glad they went to release it on the Xbox, it's a game they don't want to miss out on.. This is the most unique game I've ever played can't wait to see what Yoko Taro does next, this is a must play. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is like emotional rollercoaster. Yoko Taro did great job. Soundtrack synchronized with gameplay pretty well. This game is so unique that you can hardly find game like this. My rating is only for Story, Music and uniqueness. I am so glad that I played this game,It was an amazing experience. This game make you ask yourself ""Is this world really meaningless?"".... The top negative review was literally an accident. What else is there to say? This is easily the best game I've ever played and almost certainly the best of all-time, and I imagine it will stay that way for a very long while. The game's sole issue is that the amount of things on screen makes it hard to see what's going on sometimes. Other than that, the story, characters, gameplay, music, graphics, performance (on console), is all perfect. If you haven't played NieR: Automata, what is truly wrong with you?. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 8/10 Story : 10/10 Technical aspects : 9/10 Repeatability: 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game, high playability and inmersing history, the RPG elements are quite creative, a must play for fans!!!. The good: Excellent graphics, good draw distance, lots of textures, lots of particles. Very good music if you like melancholic music and Japanese vocal themes. A great Japanese. Great customization of passive skills through chips that you find, farm / make or buy. This 2B “the Waifu” of many. It has good jokes and moments of involuntary comedy. Playing with 9S completely changes the gameplay. It has as many endings as letters of the alphabet. Its best playable and visual version is on Xbox One X / Series S / X. It's on Xbox Game Pass. The bad: Mix of genres (Hack'n Slash, Shot'em Up, Shump Game, Bullet Hell, Brawler, 2D Platform, 3D Platform, 2.5D Platform ...) so many that none of them do it well. To have touches of Hack'n Slash there is no customization of combos, they are already preset. Don't be fooled, this game has 2B but it's more **** of running errands, dodging lots of red balls, and making deliveries with touches of fan service. Many many moments of other people's pain. Very Japanese jokes that get lost in translation. The fishing game. There are areas such as the command center or the dressing rooms where textures and effects disappear in a brutal way. Its Pan-tone (color palette, range of colors) is very opaque, throwing more brown, brown, black and gold, mostly except in the heads where it changes to black and white that can take you out of the experience for totally white objects that seem very false. Only three types of weapons to make combinations (spear, sword / katana and great-sword). Meh !: This game is NOT a masterpiece or a joke, it is a good game only. This game is rated M, for the scared and those who later catch them doing dirty things in front of the TV. This game has moments of ""someone else's grief""/cringe, uncomfortable situations that could make you feel bad if you play in front of other people (or in front of your parents or in front of your partner or in front of interested people). The game is good and fun if you like the Japanese and the games of Navecitas / Matamarcianos and Bullet Hell. It has a very basic fishing minigame that will make you laugh. You don't have to play Drakengard 3 to understand him, but it helps. The phrase ""masterpiece"" is released with an ease that is scary and more referring to a game that, although technically good, has many playable deficiencies and sometimes it is well argued and other times its argument ""leaks everywhere"" ... the game is good, transgressive, uncomfortable, ridiculous, full of cliche, pedantic ... but not a masterpiece. To play with your character without a skirt or pants is not a Mod, seriously, no mods are necessary. For the story nier automata really nailed it and for the gameplay it never gets old but my only problem her is the game not having a dynamic level design for enemies like when I started route C I was level 34 but they brought enemies from level 50 and above so I had to repeat my 12 hours of playing and add 5 hours more just to level up to 56 so I can beat the enemies in route C easily and the graphics for a 2017 game isn't that revolutionary.. I like the way the gameplay switches instantly from side scroller, to 3d hack n slash, to bullet hell shooter, etc. And the story is interesting, but... you have to play through the first half of the game twice before it lets you go to the 2nd half. A-hole design #1. Then for the 2nd half all the enemies are scaled as if you did all the side quests on BOTH playthroughs of the 1st half. A-hole design #2. I had already seen the first half so there was no reason for me to do the side quests again, then suddenly in the 2nd half I'm getting 1 shot by everything. One of the best games on xbox one if now the Best game on xbox one! Not that there are many good games on xbox to compite with for that title. A true Masterpiece. Easily the best story ever told in a video game. Gameplay is very fun. Visuals are great and audio is among the best. The game has every element that you expect in a great game and much more. The game starts great and gets better as you progress, and in the end, well... you must see for yourself. This game will stay in my memories forever. Thanks PlatinumGames and Square Enix.. This may be one of the worst games I have played in quite a while, it's an utterly tragic affair. It tries really hard to blend rpg, platforming and shmup elements into some cohesive story rich experience, which is **** it simply stumbles and smashes it's face at every step. The ""platforming"" sections are marred by awful camera function and instill a massive sense of pointlessness. The exploration is a waste of time in the empty, boring world, which can take an age to traverse at times. The general combat is tedious and repetitive, with next to no satisfying payoff at any point. Shmup patterns and controls feel amateuring at best, leaving anyone with any experience in the genre bored to tears or laughing out of despair. The only redeeming factor is the soundtrack, which is just wonderful. It's just a sad fate for the composer, that their talent and hard work is forver attached to this sad excuse for a game. How anyone is giving this 5-6/10 is confusing enough, seeing the 10's on display is just outright hilarious. Quite telling that they often never say what is actually good about it and just call it a masterpiece. Avoid like the plague, or just watch a longplay and play anything else. You'll have served your time better in the long run.. best part of the game was the credits and i mean that in the nicest way possible. I am not a player of RPGs, And I have not been able to play NIER Gestalt (now I really want to play it). Because this game hooked me with its history, artistic aspect (visually beautiful for me), and its combat system. Recommended if you have xbox gamepass give it a try.. A lot of potentials and a lot of lost/wasted potentials too. On my 1st run, I really couldn't lay my controller down, I was really fascinated by the story and the characters. I'm at my 2nd run as I'm wiring this review, there just slight differences, it just feels like pain and struggle, the motivation and fascination fall almost down to zero! My good advice: Just leave it by 1 run and watch the other endings on YouTube. Side quests are boring and not really worth it. I hope that the next Nier game has some improvements.. Absolutely amazing one of the best games ever made.With one of the best stories I have even seen in entertainment.. Probably a hidden gem for most players. Runs excellent at 60fps and running with your character is really fast and fun. The music is awesome and the change of perspectives is nice too. Advice: play before it gets removed from game pass.. This game is such a hidden gem. Took me years to discover this incredible journey and I don't know why I never heard about NIER before. It's a game unlike anything I've played and I love it. Incredible work on the soundtrack.. Masterpiece. I enjoyed the gameplay, but the music, atmosphere and design are the real piece of artwork for me. I got crazy about the story behind of this setting after playing.. I enjoyed the hell out of this game and the uniwersum, Normally I would be pissed of while re-playing kind of the story, here I did not mind at all and stayed glued to my console playing for hours. Gameplay is fun, but I think the main attraction here is in story + characters. Loved this experience. 9/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing story and memorable characters. Excelent soundtrack. Good combat system.. One of the best games I have ever played. The graphics, music and the story are breathtaking. This is not a game this is an experience. I've been playing it on standard Xbox One and it is available on XPass. The game runs at 60 fps for most of the time with minor dips.. Highlights include a superlative musical score, memorable characters and overall just a top-notch game. I went into this as a stop-gap between AAA games I was playing (Death Stranding and Last of Us 2) thinking this should be a different experience. I can now understand the high-scores and universal acclaim and am now obsessed with the game and scanning any news about it everywhere.. It looks and feels like an indie, everything is very basic and there is nothing special about the story.. Nier: Automata kept me hooked throughout its duration, but on reflection I kept playing waiting for something that never came. Although it touches on a number of philosophical themes and has a decent story, it's not as deep and it's nowhere near as mind-blowing as people make it out to be. There is an interesting narrative here, and there are emotional moments, but for some reason I was expecting more, perhaps because of the near universal praise it gets. On the other hand, I loved the soundtrack - it's amazing, and fits the game perfectly. It really adds to the atmosphere which is already great due to the design of the abandoned city and other parts of the deserted Earth. The gameplay is pretty varied and changes between a few styles that are all quite fun. The hack and slash did wear a bit thin for me but there's enough customisation for you to keep it feeling fresh if you put the effort in. Overall, it is a beautiful game, and after getting the 5 main endings I can say it's worth playing. It's a creative and different title. I did like Nier in the end, but I just wish it had story beats I could have truly been surprised by and been in awe of.. The most philosophical ever. Amazing story, amazing gameplay and make u think, ur existence again and again. Make sure to play all 5 main endings. This game is literally a three part story across 20-25 hours if you're not doing additional side quests and item hunting for God tier weaponry and chips for your chip set. The story is so intertwined within itself and how it makes you replay it from a different perspective makes the same story feel absolutely different, all while listening to a beautiful soundtrack they dynamically changes on scenery and mood transitions throughout your epic journey to find out the true meaning of life in this futuristic world.. NieR:Automata is a fantastically immersive game. The combat and music really make it a must play, but just like with every masterpiece something is off, for NieR:Automata it‘s the maps and very unfitting artstyle. The maps just don‘t really fit with the overall artsyle, which makes it hard to look at some of the areas. In BOTW the map never had boring or unrelateable areas. In the first resistance camp the characters look like actual humans, but why doesn’t our character look like a human as well or wiseversa. If you can look over this minor annoyance this will be just the game for you.. Without being an AAA, this game is wonderful, Yoko Taro has a gift for going out of the ordinary and giving us exceptionally dystopian stories, with a quite polished and fun gameplay, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks in history, turns this game in one of the best of this generation. I hope and in the future Yoko can have a bigger budget to give us something even more legendary.. Awesome game even if it becomes a bit repetitive at the end, definitely worth the different playthroughs.. Nier automata is amazing in so many ways. The game is so mind blowing when played right. People often will play nier, complete route A and call it quits. This is a huge mistake as there are 5 endings, E being the true one. Another off pu","this game is amazing, from start to finish . the combat flows nicely like a FF game, and the visuals are stunning . i can't believe there isn't a sequel for this one ."
311.Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy,"A beautiful game with great movement. Incredible to see no loading screens. Some minigames & levels can be hard.. This is a pretty fun and charming platformer. The game's visuals are unique and appealing, with vibrant environments and intriguing ancient structures. The dynamic between Jak and Daxter add to the game’s appeal. Jak remains a silent protagonist while Daxter's wild personality and humor brings charm to the otherwise simple story. The NPCs are likeable, though not particularly deep. Gameplay-wise, it's a smooth and enjoyable experience with some minor frustrations, particularly the timing needed for double jumps. Tho Jak’s moves are very fluid and well-animated, making the platforming one of the game's standout features. Collecting Precursor Orbs and Power Cells feels rewarding, thanks to the dance animation with jak and daxter. The soundtrack is functional, if not particularly memorable, but fits well with the overall atmosphere. Some flaws, like the lack of subtitles and awkward jumping mechanics, can be a bit annoying, but they don't detract much from the fun. Jak and Daxter holds up as one of Naughty Dog's best, capturing the essence of what a 3D platformer should be. I think it's a must-play for fans of the genre, and modern games could use more of this kind of pure light-hearted fun. This charming plattaform was definetly ahead of it's time. An interconnected world, no loading screens, 60 fps for a ps2 game, enjoyable and diverse movesetthatkeeps the flow going. Maybe the story is more on the simplistic side and the level themselves are not that creative and even with it's flaws, this game is nothing but charming and techanlly impressive to this day, this hasn't aged a day in my opinion. 10/10. *Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy* may be a beloved classic, but it shows its age in several frustrating ways. For starters, the game’s story is remarkably shallow, offering little in the way of compelling character development or plot depth. Jak is a silent protagonist, which feels outdated and limits emotional engagement, while Daxter’s constant wisecracks quickly become **** gameplay, while fun at first, becomes repetitive and predictable as you progress. Collecting Precursor Orbs and Power Cells gets tiresome after a while, especially when the platforming itself lacks the challenge to keep things interesting. The game’s difficulty is inconsistent, with some sections being mindlessly easy and others frustrating due to clunky controls and an unreliable camera that often obstructs your view at the worst possible moments.Visually, the game hasn’t aged well. While the world was impressive at the time, the lack of texture detail and the repetitive environments feel bland by today’s standards. The enemy variety is limited, and most of the boss fights are forgettable and underwhelming.Overall, *Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy* feels more like a relic of the early 2000s than a timeless platformer. Its charm wears off quickly, and it ultimately fails to live up to the praise it once received. People are comparing this game to Super Mario 64. That is a complete joke... this game is how not to make a platform game... Peak atmosphere, peak level design, peak character design, peak comedic sidekick, peak silent protagonist, peak platformer soundtrack, peak Twisted Sister cameo, peak 3D platformer, peak collectible, peak coloring. I have been transfixed by the world of Jak and Daxter for a long time, and finally being able to purchase the trilogy and jump right in has truly been a joy. Such a beautiful and innovative game for its time, I can say that the Precursor Legacy truly retains much of its original magic several decades later. Jak feels awesome to control; some of my early frustrations with combat or exploration were quenched by finding new moves or combos that make the world a joy to venture through. The boss battles, while few, are clever and unique for a 3D platformer. The collecting is genius; menus clearly show you where to look for power cells or precursor orbs, which are smartly placed across each area. The animation and voice-acting are all perfect and brilliant; it's incredibly easy to fall in love with these characters, and I can't wait to play the next titles to learn more. Overall an underrated PlayStation joy that more people should be talking about and re-visiting so that a new title is possible.. There's a reason this game is a PS2 classic, plays incredibly well and the world design is amazing. One of the best naughty dog games would recommend it to anyone with a playstation 2. Open wolrd 3D platformer that's pretty to look at and pleasnat to play butfeels rather flimsy compared to the best Nintendo has to offer. More Crash Bandicoot than Super Mario Galaxy.. Naughty Dogs first PS2 game Jak & Daxter was one of the first games I can remember becoming obsessed with as a kid. Going back and playing it 23 years later I can strongly say Jak & Daxter has held up very well. Memorable characters and levels existing with a mystery about the Precursors will keep you moving forward, while the version of the PS5 is a decent emulator I'd recommend playing on an PS2 if you're lucky enough to still have one that works. This game is definitely one of the best PS2 games. A simple but addictive story mixed with exquisite gameplay. The characters and the world around them are brimming with personality. Practically the beginning of the unbeatable trilogy.. Since I was a child I have replayed this wonderful game and completed it to 100 every time definitely a game that every platform lover should play at least once in their life. I love, love, love this game with every fiber of my body. It took all that Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot introduced a couple of years earlier and innovated the formula with so many intricate but simple mechanics that made in my opinion this game an instant classic. This is my favorite platformer by far and one of my most favorite games of all time.. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is a very fun game for fans of games like Crash Bandicoot and Sypro the Dragon. It takes a lot of the same mechanics that made those games good and mixes it with its own to make another adventure for itself. Although often I was confused by the pacing of the story, and perplexed why the game never taught me all its techniques to play it. Jax and Daxter is still a good game overall. The only Jak and Daxter game I like. The colourful and friendly world captivated me as a teen. I remember i rented the game and beat it in just one weekend. Good old times.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. The first game in the amazing Jak saga. The story is amazing, the characters are very charismatic and the platforming and level design are awesome.. It was my first PS2 video game, great platform game, basic story but the Gameplay and Daxter are what put this note. It's fine. Small enemy and gameplay variety. Overall more boring compared to its successors.. It was the first platformer that I really enjoyed. The characters are very memorable and it is next to my memory of the time where I could not stop playing on the ps2. Great graphics (for a 20 years old game), stunning visuals, great characters and smooth gameplay. Brilliant game!. A great platformer with interesting level design and characters. Fun environments.. Great Game b I love it. Brief introduction for those unfamiliar with the Jak and Daxter game series - Jak and Daxter games are a Mario style platform game series distributed by Sony and developed by Notty Dog, and like the Mario games we have to go through stages and collect things to progress in the game. If in Mario we need to collect stars to advance in the game, this we need to collect power cells which is the stars of the game, Orbs which is the money of the game you give to get Power cells and flies which meanwhile I do not know what to do with them but very fun to collect them. And now let's start with the review: Gameplay - The game Jak and Daxter has survived the test of time well and is still fun to play and it feels very accurate with my pressures. But the camera is a bit frustrating sometimes, sometimes it happens that I press the jump button and Jak does not jump and then I fall off a platform or hit me at the jump speed. And despite these two flaws the gameplay is just a smooth and clean flow that you can not stop enjoying just walking around the big stages and jumping. Final score - 9/10 Plot - The main plot of the game is almost non-existent, but it is fun and entertaining. The characters are funny and fun to listen to in-game dialogues, maybe they are pretty silly and not fascinating in any way but in my opinion a fascinating plot in a platform game is something that is nice but not as important as gameplay and stage design. Final score - 7/10 Stage design - The stage design in a simple game is amazing, there is variety from one stage to another, for example at one stage you will be on a beautiful beach with lots of green surroundings and at another stage you will be on a snowy mountain. The details in each stage, the various obstacles, enemies and gimmicks add a lot to each stage and there were times I wondered what would await me in the next stage. Final score 10/10 Graphics - The graphics in the game are simply beautiful (even today) and it stands the test of time. All the details and colors in all stages, the characters that look great even today, and in general it's amazing how a game from the PlayStation 2 looks beautiful graphically even 3 generations later, it's true it can not cope with today's graphics but it looks amazing both for its time and today. Final score - 10/10 In conclusion - the first game Jak and Daxter is an amazing and fun game even today, it is a must play for platform lovers and is recommended for people who are looking for a fun platform game. Just a little tip for those who play: it is recommended to play the game with a lit YouTube video because the game does not explain how to get the things to look for. Final score - 9.5 / 10 - Amazing game.. The game features many platformer challenges with elements from the action adventure and brawler genres. Players are required to collect Precursor orbs and power cells in order to further northward progress. During the quest, new locations are visited, centered upon village hubs, with many new faces requesting of the duo the completion of various missions around the area.. Jak and daxter is one of the best platforms ever created, the loading sistem is revulotionary and the story of the game is one of the best for is time. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 7 Gameplay : 7 Graphics : 7 Fun Factor : 7 Environment interaction : 5 Sound effects : 8 Overall Immersion : 7. Until now this is my least favorite naughty dog game and even their worst game is a 8.. Worst Jak game. I can't believe that there are people who really enjoyed it. Jak is muted, Daxter is annoying, the plot is veeery boooooring, graphics ****, audio ****, and these looong cutscenes, which don't have any useful information, but you must watch it without skipping. Maximum percent I completed is 50.. Open world, not a mission to mission linear style of gameplay/storytelling. Amazing platforming experience, gradual difficulty curve and variable areas/challenges available. The players is free to explore and wander. Gorgeous visuals that will stay with me for a long time.. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is a PlayStation 2 classic that holds up remarkably well. The controls of Jak and incredibly smooth and easy to use combined with excellent level design and gorgeous environments to explore and you have a work that borders on masterpiece. My biggest criticism is with many of the female character design feeling over sexualized particularly when it comes to Keira who is only 14 during the events of this game. Overall I would highly recommend Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy.. A great game for the time! I had a lot of fun playing it, even playing it in 2021. The last part of the game has an excellent level game design!. wow i love this game son many colors,so many nice levels, so everything this game is one of the best of the ps2. as much as i want to like this game is just to boring in the beginning for me. the lack of a map does make it seem like a chore to play through. i like that its difficult but just not fun. one great thing is that there is barley any loading screens.. I Didn't enjoy this game and I gave it up quickly. Annoying characters with tedious gameplay, a very average soundtrack, poor level design and really tedious missions. This game also led to Jak 2 (one of the worst video games ever made in my opinion) being created.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such a shame, I love Naughty Dog but this game just didn’t click with me, the platforming was excruciating, (I’m looking at you spider cave) I found the story kinda stale and Daxter was just annoying. The last boss fight was ridiculously easy but I am just glad to be done with this game.. The best platforming game made by naughty dog. The gameplay is similar to Mario 64 and spyro with some unique aspects like the power cells and eco which it can give you abilities useful for combat and platforming, the levels are greatly designed with balanced difficulty, and collecting stuff and platforming never gets old, the graphics are amazing (for 2001) and I love the visual style, the controls are tight and exploring those big open areas are so much fun with no loading screen its amazing for 2001 game, and the story and characters are also good daxter is hilarious, I enjoyed the music and the boss fights are epic. It's nearly perfect but I can't give it a 10/10 because the game is too short you can beat it around 5 to 6 hours.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Idk if it actually is the first ps2 game I played or simply the first one that made a lasting impression but i will always be able to come back to it. An absolute masterpiece.. Unique characters, an interesting world and story and stunning level design. Jak and Daxter has everything that an amazing platformer in the 6th gen has. A great new franchise in Playstation's books and another win for Naughty Dog. Playing this game today it's... a dreadful experience. I regret everything.... Great game with a well designed world and plot to go with it. It's one of the best platformers but the levels can be a bit too linear compared to Jak 2 and Jak 3.. The only big problem about this game is the horrible checkpoint system, especially in some areas where you need to spend at least 1 minute to get in the same point you die/get off the edge. Most of the soundtrack is not so memorable like previous ND games .I'm actually impressed for a 2001 game not having loading times between ""levels"".. Naughty Dog’s new IP, Jak and Daxter is one of the very best platformers I have ever played. It’s hard to believe that this game used all of the PS2’s architecture to ensure that there are no loading screens or texture pop ins during the game’s development.. Considering the fact I gave Jak 2 10/10 I will say that I didn't like the first part of the series, but It has its moments for sure. I didn't have a chance to play this game then I was a kid and maybe because of that I'm not a big fan of this? I dunno. The game for me is too short. Secondary characters are bland and I don't see any interest in them. I guess most of my bad experience comes from the fact I didn't like the world. The platformer part is great tho, but again the game is TOO SHORT. So, it is only 7. I love this franchise very much but I don't like its childish origin. If they'll ever make a new game in this franchise I would love it to be the same as a Jak II.. Best in the series. Camera can be poor at times but it still holds up well even today imo. Characters are very enjoyable and level design is solid.. The quintessential adventure / platform saga on ps2. Fun, humorous and technically amazing. Essential.. a decent platforming action adventure game, tbh I actually liked the sequels more. still worth playing I'd say. Jak and Daxter 1 is of course a solid platforming game that offers both challenging and exciting level design that many players will appreciate, but god this game is very frustrating at times. At the time where game was released this game was great, but now in 2019 it is so many more better platforming games to play.. I don't remember much about this game, i mainly remember the characters being annoying and i never liked the graphic style of it, but i'll probably replay it soon cause it's been so long since i've played it. I will update or delete this review after i replay it though. But just off how i felt about it the first time, i'm giviing this a 4/10.. This is an absolutely beautiful game for its time, it has decent controls, [even if there's no option to flip the camera & a slightly faulty double jump] and a nice storyline. The Only flaw is that it's a bit easier than I'd like, but atleast there's no cheap deaths. [Or load time!] Overall, this game is beautiful and well made with few flaws.. This was the first PS2 game I've ever played and i still play it to this day. An amazing game through and through. It is sad that there are no games today with replay value as high as any of the Jak games. Everything from the art to the level design is astonishing for 2001, like it has no loading screens... The story itself is quite simple but interesting at the same time, get from point A to B with obstacles in the way and mysteries as to where the other sages have disappeared to. Soundtrack too is really good. If anyone has not played it, you are missing out big time. My favorite game of all time. This was my childhood. Great platformer and cheeky comedy. Sandover Village. Silent boy Jak and his loudmouth and imprudent friend Daxter sneak onto Misty Island, ignoring completely the warnings of the wise but brash sage Samos. They wish to explore the ruins of the “precursors” - the ancient omnipotent race that left behind the troves of various technology. Forbidden places are forbidden for a reason: hapless Daxter falls into the pool of Precursor energy called eco and comes out as… ottsel, a hybrid of an otter and a weasel. The only person who can restore Daxter’s shape is said to be Gol, the dark Sage, found far in the North. And so, under the reproachful guidance of Samos and with help of his witty daughter Keira, the pair set forth… but first they need to collect some power cells. However alluring perambulation might be, there are some nasty places that can’t be crossed by foot. Thankfully Keira happy to provide Jak and Daxter with flying vehicle, aliased Zoomer, her own creation based on Precursor artefacts. But to zoom it up Keira needs power cell, energy resource of Precursors. It quickly becomes clear that orb hunting will be the primary occupation of the pair as Keira asks for quite a lot but no power cell lies bare. Power Cells hunting realized as free roaming in the set of interconnected distinct locations. The sunny shore village, full-of-traps jungle, island littered with enormous bones, stuffy swamp, underwater facility and many other places will be visited by Jak and Daxter. Or skipped, if you gathered enough orbs: the game kindly allows you to complete the game by collecting only seventy two percents of the loot. The world is seamless, there are no loading screen at all, and the graphics are affecting: technically JaD is superb. Power cells themselves are placed sophisticatedly across the levels, each obtainable only by completing corresponding jumping puzzle or solving some action challenge. The journey starts from simple “jump through” ventures but each consecutive level brings something new and fun. In particularly, game expanding mechanic is earlier mentioned eco, found in form of orbs or erupting from ground streams. Once Jak steps into it, eco will infuse him with temporary bonus. For example, blue eco will increase speed and yellow eco will allow shooting fireballs from Jak’s hands. Another delightful mechanics are bird-riding and racing, both are very dynamic and buoyant. By the end of the game you will overcome all kinds of obstacles, from classic moving platforms or launching pads to sliding slopes, dodge-giant-ball ravines and complex eco trials. And through all ten or so hours it will be perfectly balanced, easy-going gameplay: only in the very end I started to grump about harshly placed checkpoints and too difficult paths. But power cells can not only be *found* but also received from various NPCs. Not once and not twice you will stumble upon eccentric characters, each kindly forcing you to complete some quest in exchange for power cell. Those quest come in two kinds. One is simply to *buy* power cell with precursor orbs, the most common kind of collectible found in JnD, and the second one is to do unique task, seldom realized through minigames. What is important about tasks though are NPCs themselves. They are humorous, entertaining and well-written. Take for example, Samos himself: in regular game he would have been a trite old man wisely guiding protagonists but in JnD he cannot stop but cheekily yet funnily berate poor Jak and Daxter absolutely for no reason. Or look at gambler who lost his clothes and now wears barrels as his shirt and pants. NPCs and music perfectly reflect the mood and style of the game. If you didn’t get it yet, JnD is in no way a serious epic, or even semi-serious, like Legend of Zelda. JnD is jesting, frivolous *game* of american comedy style. In fact, characters, though being well-written, are not original at all. As in all western cartoons they’re hyperbolic in both dialogs, appearance and behavior. Daxter in particular is overcooked for my taste: his cliche vim started to annoy me very quickly. The levels of JnD are not devoid of enemies. “Lurkers”, creatures supposedly working for Gol, are in infinite supply wherever Jak and Daxter go. The same can’t be said about bosses: their count totals to three, and the first one is mediocre at best. The most exasperating thread of combat system is not its general primitiveness but a health mechanic: green eco is supposed to heal Jak but to collect required amount is virtually impossible, so prepare for maximum-three-hit-allowed survival. And though flat combat and complete lack of character development might disappoint some people, everything else is done perfectly in Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. Yet it has one innate minus: it is just a game. It is just a foolish platformer and it is just a cartoonish story about banal heroes and villains. In 2019 you can’t score such games with more than 7/10. I'm sorry, but move over Mario! Because for me, this is the best platformer ever made and one of my favourite games of all time. All in this game is just perfect for me: The gameplay, the carachters, the humor, the graphics... All in this piece of art of gaming makes me feel as a kid every time I play it. I cannot recommend it more, just play it if you haven't! You won't regret it.. Its a good game to spend time, sometimes I felt lost, but nothing so hard. The plataform is very cool, somethimes a little challenge; the bosses: too easy but too few. The mini games is fun. :) Good Job after Crash, Naughty dog.. Without a doubt one of the worst video games I have ever played. The gameplay is tedious and relies on pointless missions that involves grinding ""precursor orbs"" (this games coins), doing pointless tasks such as herding cows into a pen or finding 7 flies (why?). The open world everyone brags about is poorly designed and very easy to get lost in. The story was also terrible as 5 minutes into gameplay I forgot what the story was and why I was doing these pointless tasks. Just about everything comes grouped with an unskippable 10-minute cutscene that is tedious to watch and breaks the flow of the game - the game disc contains more cutscene data than it does game data. The soundtrack is also lacking as the only music I've heard is a repetitive 10-second loop of generic bongo drums. The disc also seems to be programmed poorly as it makes a lot of noise in my PS2. And to top it all of - the game needs a massive 700KB memory card file despite not having much to save.. One of the best platforming games of the PS2 era. Everything from the design, story, and gameplay were fun.. This game is a masterpiece of graphic art and challenging gameplay, I was raised on PS2 and this is the first game I played Pros: no load times, beautiful graphics, addictive, simple, easy to play, hard to master, Cons: (enter hater here) If you like this game try Ratchet and Clank, uncharted, and the rest of the Jak and Daxter franchise (including Jak X combat racing). so good so good, the feeelz that this game make me try are unaccountable. please, give me an other jak and daxter, naughty dog... why you've become so serious?. This game is amazing, one of the best platformers of all time. The characters are really fun, especially Daxter. The gameplay is great, the story is decent (Daxter gets transformed into a combination of an otter and a weasel and so Jak and Daxter go to find a cure), the environments are really well done and the adventure is probably one the best you'll ever have. And no loading screens!. This is basically the Crash game we should've got, but didn't. The very first Jak & Daxter game is a really good platformer, but it can get a little boring at times. Once you figure out what to do where, it is really cool. You don't have to have new power ups to complete an area, you can complete a level in one go. It can be a little frustrating trying to get everything in an area, but it's not as bad as some other games. In comparison to the sequels, this might be the easiest and shortest Jak & Daxter game. Well, if you only include the Naughty Dog ones that is.. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is a platform video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Fun + Beautiful and Connected World. Jak and Daxter: The precursor Legacy is an excellent platforming game that shows why the genre is so loved amongst gamers. Naughty Dog managed to create a realistic universe, with luscious visuals, somewhat interesting characters, fun explorative gameplay and a seamless semi-open world with no load times at all. The plot of the game is fairly simple, your companion gets into trouble and you are sent on an adventure to find a way to return him to normal, of course this doesn't quite go to plan and the person capable of helping your friend, instead decides to rule the world, it is, admittedly a simple set up, and most of the characters are 1-Dimensional, but it serves its purpose well and gives the player a good enough reason to set off on their adventure. And what an adventure it is. You will cross through fiery canyons, snowy mountains, jungles, underground temples and swamplands. Each of these areas are brilliantly designed with different challenges ranging from punching a pelican to navigating a snowy fort. The game has very smooth controls with each move easily flowing into another, and allowing a more experienced player to navigate the levels more efficiently, which is a nice reward for those willing to understand the games mechanics. The game adds some variety in the form of a hoverbike and a bird that Jak can ride on to navigate areas differently and completely missions which would otherwise be impossible. While these are integrated nicely into the game and control just fine, it would have been nice if they were used in more levels, for more tasks as opposed to being in restricted areas. Along with this are some absolutely beautiful visuals, while not quite as polished as the sequels, the visual variety, excellent texture work, and fantastic lighting system make each level distinguished from each other, whilst still looking natural. The soundtrack of the game is generally understated and not the most memorable unfortunately, it works well to create an ambience within the levels, but none of the music is too catchy, which is a shame. Overall this is an excellent game that is a must play for fans of the platforming genre.. Oh my god, we're now heading into Jak and Daxter. I love 3D platformers, and this is just... wow. I was always a Nintendo guy, but this game made me get into Sony. If I'm not playing Mario 64, Sonic Generations, or The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, then it's this game. I don't spoil plots, but all I can say is that compared to the later games in the series, it's incredibly simple. Anyways, graphically, even for today's standards it's amazing. I always liked to just roam around, doing nothing at all, and look at how beautiful the game is. The soundtrack, while not perfect, is okay. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I highly recommend it.. this was a great platform game i enjoyed every bit of it when i first had ps2, i liked the levels and everything it inspired me, the gameplay was fun and daxter was funny, great job naughty dog. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is an outstanding platformer in a vibrant world, and has tons of humor along with that. The game has great gameplay, and many items to collect. The game itself is always fun to play, and the controls are good as well. The open world that is in the game is amazing, and no load screens within the game is an amazing feat. I love this game a lot, and have played it over so many times. It has great replay value, and it is extremely satisfying to collect each item in the world(s), and it is just plain fun to explore the world. My only gripes are that at times the game can be too easy at times, and a lack of boss battles might make it a bit repetitive. The moves you have are limited, and I wish you could continue to add more so that it would become more interesting. The game also doesn't do too many new things with the 3D platformer. It sort of just barely expands on what has already stood, but it still distinguishes itself from the industry. I still love this game, so anyone reading this, just give it a chance.. I have spent my life searching for the answers that my father and my father's father's failed to find. Who were the precursorus, why did they create the fourft monolift's that liver our planet? How do they honess echo, the life energy of the world? What was their purpose and why did they vanish? I have asked the plants but they do not remember, the plants that has the rocks but the rocks do not recall, even the rocks do not recall? Every bone in my body tells me that the answers rest on the shoulders, a young boy, oblivious to his destiny, uninterested in the search for truth and regeneralting of my guidence! And why would he wanted to listen to old Samos the Sage anyway? I'm only the master of green echo, one of the wisest men on the planet! So it seems the answer begins not with careful research or sensible thinking. Hey, as with many of fate's mistery's, it begins with porter smallight of disobidence. I just gotta say that I love Jak and Daxter because it's really nostalgic and really easy. My friend Jacob played on it as well and the main characters Jak and Daxter, my name is Jack as well. I completed it years ago and the only thing I was thinking about unlocking the cutscenes but my brother Daniel says to me ''I don't think it doesn't do that'' but oh well, at least I know the scenes. When I was kid I fxxking loving it. I love the graphics, the gameplay, the characters and the music! It's just awsome! It's just so atmospheric. I played on it a million times before and I will definitlely go play it a million times again.. [I played this game and reviewed it from a perspective of 2015, when I played it, which admittedly is un","the game's visuals are unique and appealing, with vibrant environments and intriguing ancient structures . the dynamic between Jak and Daxter add to the game’s appeal . the game's story is remarkably shallow, offering little in the way of compelling character development or plot depth ."
312.Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II,"Rogue Squadron gets some graphical flourishes and slightly deeper missions but the gameplay stays largely unchanged. Disappointing for those hoping for a great leap forward but very satisfying for those wanting more of the same.. El mejor juego de Star Wars de la Historia. The Best game of Star Wars of the History. This game is a prime example of Nintendo riding a huge wave right into the Gamecube launch. This game along with many other early titles for the GCN are a highlight of Nintendo's success between the late 90's and early 00's. This game displayed the Gamecube's great graphics and the controls were also incredible. There were great stages, all of which are aesthetically pleasing. While the game's concept is one that was already proven on the N64, it was still loads of fun in 2001-2002 and is still loads of fun today. It is far from being the most innovative early GCN release but it is brilliant to say the least.. This game was even better than the first one with better graphics and better game mechanics. Great game that brings all the Star Wars feels into you.. Even more star wars rogue squadron memories! This is one of the first Star Wars games I've played and it appears to be one of my favorite, not because of childhood, but because of the gaming itself.. This game is a good gem. Nice graphics, good gameplay with replay value that you can´t find today. The big weakness is the lack of multiplayer, however this game is much better than ST:BF. I miss Factor 5.. A very, very fun game. Had replayable missions, excellent gameplay, and good story as well. The story tied in with the movies and general SW canon, which is always important. The bonus missions are also enjoyable. Overall a very enjoyable game.. Star wars is bar none one of the greatest movie franchises of all time and the games aren't half bad either and i would say this is one of the most addicting and fun and has great graphics for an early gamecube launch title. I loved the first game and this game was probably the main reason for me to buy a Gamecube and boy was it worth it. I loved every moment of it. The graphics are impressive and hard to believe the Gamecube could pull them off. One of the best games ever, and the best star wars game to date.","this game is a prime example of Nintendo riding a huge wave right into the Gamecube launch . it displayed the gamecube's great graphics and the controls were also incredible . the big weakness is the lack of multiplayer, however this game is much better than ST:BF ."
313.Stephen's Sausage Roll,"One of the best puzzle games. It was really fun to play, the puzzles had a pretty consistent difficulty, and they were great. The puzzles were *not* too hard. Anyone can figure them out, it's just whether you enjoy thinking about a puzzle for a while or not which determines whether you will like this. Highly recommend this game, if you think you would might like it you definitely will.. some of the most unique and creative puzzles ever created in any genre. game is insanely hard, even right from the get go and has insane difficulty spikes. the joy of finally figuring out a way to solve the puzzles overcame any frustration possible. The puzzles are incredible, but this isn't a fun game to play. At all. It's too hard!. It is one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. And by best puzzle game, I don't mean that it earned its place on some ""puzzle"" best-seller list that includes Tetris and Puyo Puyo and Dr. Mario (all on the same list). This is not ""The room"" or "", 1000000. If you're looking for something like World of Goo or Fez then keep on walking. Those are great games, but they're not what we're discussing here. This is more in the vein of Jonathan Blow, Zachtronics, DROD, Saira, Tetrabot, Great Permutator, or English Country Tune. Games that are about the mental struggle and the escalation of that challenge to ridiculous but still-achievable heights. Spatial thinking and reverse engineering solutions. Eliminating false paths and reasoning about your goals in high level concepts and then breaking down solutions to individual steps. If anyone ever composes a list of top puzzle games and doesn't include at least a few of those titles on the list you know they're talking about a different sort of game entirely. Stephen's Sausage Roll with its seemingly insurmountable challenges and the way you gradually learn, practice, and master the mechanics is so very satisfying. And each time you learn something new about the system, the game throws a new twist at you. And it does so for 40 straight hours, never ever repeating itself, and never wasting your time. It is terse and brutal and the game stands confidently among the greats. I wish I could forget I ever played it so I could do it all again.. It's over, I cooked my last sausage. I feel complete. I feel empty. Stephen doesn't care about the game design best practices. No tutorial here, no gradual learning curve, you're thrown into an unknown world, with the first puzzles already being hard. You're a stranger to this world, don't expect it to be easy and welcoming. I left my first play session with a bitter taste in my mouth, hesitating to come back. This game is more expensive than it appears to be worth, and I just spent a precious time of my life cooking sausages with a ridiculously hard to control character. But I went back, passed the first island, and discovered a new game mechanic. But this mechanic wasn't brought by a new item to obtain, no, it was here all along, but the environment was just not exposing it. I feel there are other mechanics, hidden, just waiting for me to discover them. I continue, eager to explore to find these mechanics, and there are a lot, and the puzzles are ingeniously crafted to extract the last bit of juice each mechanic can offer. And when you think you're finished, Stephen reveals yet another mechanic, pulling it from the bottom of the sea right to your face, promising you more hours of frustrating puzzles. But no, the end is near, you feel it, and you must prove to yourself you're better than these sausages, you're alive, and you must complete this game. And I finished it, I waited so long for the end to come, I wanted to say ""I did it!"", but now I feel empty. These puzzles were mind-bending, always pushing me to the limits, forcing me to explore new ideas, making me go further, extending my brain capacity to think outside of the box. And this is it, every sausage is cooked, and I won't benefit from another brilliant sausage-based puzzle until the day I'll be cooked myself.. This metascore rating is the reason why I only pay attention to the user score. This game is a good puzzle game.. but so is kickle cubicle. This really shouldn't be on the first page of top rated games of all time.. The best video game ever created. The rules of the game are completely non-abstract; they are just simplified versions of real-world physics. The rules also never change: they are only revealed, through perfect level design. The sheer number of unique, orthogonal and surprising consequences of these rules that the game manages to pull out of its hat flattens me every time I even think about it. Stephen's Sausage Roll truly is a tour de force in pure level design, and is the strongest case for level design as an art form. If you are even remotely tilted towards puzzle games, please, please ignore its low visual fidelity, price tag, and so on, because you may just be missing out on an incredible experience. In some sense, it's like a beautiful work of pixel art: every single pixel is placed exactly where it is, and has the exact colour values it does, for a specific purpose: so that they can all come together to create something truly beautiful.. I know what you're thinking: 'not *another* sausage rolling game!' But Stephen's Sausage Roll packs enough innovation and fresh ideas that it revitalises the overcrowded and rather jaded Sausage Rolling Puzzler genre. The basic mechanic is deceptively simple, yet the puzzles are devilishly tricky, despite the fact that many are confined to tight spaces and options are limited. Each area of the world (and it is all set in an unexpectedly coherent world) introduces a new mechanic, cleverly building on what has gone before, so it never feels repetitive (though it can at time feel overwhelming). If you buy only one sausage rolling adventure this year, make sure it's this one.. Amazing logic. Truly a great game that reveals itself slowly but steadily. After 5h of gameplay you should already be obsessed. And finding out there is actually a sense is all this sausage rolling left me speechless. But for that you need to get to the end. And good luck with that!. This game is a spiritual successor of the puzzle game Sokoban, a puzzle game where you push boxes. Do you remember it? No. How about the mediocre Boxxel on the gameboy? No? Well you can see why I'm surprised when a game like Stephen's Sausage Roll lands 10/10 on numerous review sites. Yes, for a game about pushing boxes (or sausages in this case) it's well made. Possibly game of the year for ""Box pushing puzzle games fanatics monthly"" Magazine. Outside that narrow niche, next to other games given a perfect 10, it's laughable. Is it Super Metroid? Is it FF7? Is it even Cave Story? There's not much depth. There's no story. The levels are all similar. It's ugly. The feeling of progress and reward isn't there. Well-designed learning curve aside, it's nothing special. It's a good take on something inherently mediocre (.8 x .5 = .4). I tried reading other reviews for a taste of what's going on. What I pulled away with was this games the perfect storm of overrated. It's an indie developer creates a piece of ""art"" that appeals to your intellect. Another reviewer even mentioned how smart the game was and how smart he felt for playing along. Video game journalism, everyone. If you like puzzles games and have hours to devote to intellectual validation, go for it. You'll get your money worth. Just know I think you're dumb spending $30 on a back-patting machine.. 2000s browser game-tier experience shilled by The Guardian and other big name journos because the dev is roommates with the creator of VVVVV and Super Hexagon. This game looks crappy. Trust me. But that doesn't matter at all. Stephen's Sausage Roll is the most challenging puzzle game I ever felt motivated to play to completion. Each level is a piece of art. At various points in the game, new mechanics are introduced that feel natural in regards to the premise of the game (in particular, you will never need more controls than those introduced in the very beginning). The game has a (completely optional) background story that stems from the games mechanics (rather than the other way around). The game has a fixed set of rules (some of them might seem a bit odd at first, when compared to real world physics). I cannot remember any other game that explores its rules to the fullest extend possible as much as this game does. The game is not quite cheap, but considering that I spent ~30 hours enjoying the perfectly designed levels of this puzzle game, it was well worth its money.. I'm not finished with the game yet. Seems people are reporting an average of 40-60 hour play times if that is of interest though. So far it's great. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, ""Oh wow I can do that?"" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, ""Oh how was I suppose to think of that?"" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged. But don't be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. Of course I still have much to do so it's just going to get even more difficult. I can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well. The developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He's mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known games. But I hope more and more outlets begin to review/cover this game. Stephen's Sausage Roll deserves it.","this is not ""the room"" or "", 1000000"" this is not ""the room"" or "", 1000000"" this is more in the vein of Jonathan Blow, Zachtronics, DROD, Saira, Tetrabot, Great Permutator ."
314.Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ABSOLUTE CINEMA. I can count on my two hands the number of VNs I've played in my life but GDI this is a piece of art. Can't wait for The Other Side of Red Garden.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best visual novels I've played, without a doubt. I loved the story, and the remake compared to the original version is very noticeable. I've only finished Arcueid's route, but without a doubt, I can say it's one of the best I've played in this genre.. Tsukihime is peak fiction. Ciel is best Girl. Neco Arc. Lets try to push the user score together guys.. Tsukihime Remake was announced back in 2008. In other words, I've been waiting 16 years for this game. Type Moon did not let me down. This is one of the most beautiful and intricate stories in a long time. I don't play a lot of visual novels, but when I played the original Tsukihime back in the early 2000's, I fell in love. Each character is portryaed with psychological depth, Shiki's psychological issues feel real, the characters struggles are relatable. So far all the changes from the original feel like a step in the right direction, including the removal of adult content. Nasu has never been good at writing nsfw scenes, and removing it from an otherwise masterpiece **** was a step in the right direction. Overall, any fans who enjoy reading books (or visual novels) should stop and give this a chance. If I had one complaint, it would only be that I couldn't get this on my steam deck or play it on steam.. This is a very well written visual novel with deep characters development and mysterious plot, recommended. The most beautiful story that Type Moon has dedicated to the many fans of visual novels.. Top-notch visual effects, intricate psychological portrayals, and an immersive experience.. Everything TYPE MOON puts out is always incredible and Tsukihime is no different. It is a masterpiece from start to finish with brilliant writing and loveable characters as well as an excellent soundtrack, amazing visuals, voice acting and sound design. After finishing it, I’m just craving more and am desperately awaiting the second part with the other 4 routes ‘Other Side of Red Garden’ now. I never thought in a million years that a story and its characters would move me emotionally and make me love and care about each of them so dearly like Fate/Stay Night did. I never thought any story could surpass Fate/Stay Night as my favourite fictional work of all time, but Tsukihime has done that. It is now my favourite story of all time and Arcueid has become my favourite character ever as well.. goty desu. i don't see any competition looool. best game ever and no one can say otherwise.. A remake of the beloved retro visual novel ""Tsukihime"". A Piece of Blue Glass Moon covers the first 2/6 routes (originally 5 routes) of an urban epic. It is hundreds of times better than its original counterpart, elevated in its sound department, quality of life aspects, and writing. While it may seem like a 60 grating hours long story, Tsukihime Remake keeps readers on their toes for the sequel and final half of the story, ""The Other Side of Red Garden"".. Tsukihime is peak, the nasuverse is peak, everything TYPE-MOON is peak. Genuinely no flaws for me with the goated OST, great characters, worldbuilding, new designs and additional content. Can't wait for the far side routes.. Having originally read the fan translation for both routes about a year ago, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Aniplex delivered on a really solid translation, that was extremely accurate. Tsukihime -A Piece of Blue Glass Moon-, is by all intensive purposes a solid remake of the Near Side routes from the original Tsukihime. Kinoko Nasu’s impressive writing once again shines brightly, giving emotion and soul that many games these days could only dream of. When Tsukihime -The Other Side of the Red Garden- is released, I can only hope it gets a day 1 worldwide release, as this has allowed Type-Moon to really open up to a wider audience. Long live the night.. Masterpiece VN Peak Character Peak History Peak Narrative Peak Soundtrack Peak Writing. Great, remake of a classic visual novel with a fresh skin applied to mix it up for long time fans. I would definitely recommend if youre at least a fan of reading.","GDI is one of the best visual novels I've played, without a doubt . the remake compared to the original version is very noticeable . this is one of the most beautiful and intricate stories in a long time ."
315.Deus Ex,"Deus Ex ...what is real Deus Ex... young players not gonna understand that time smell, when everyone was playing Unreal Tournament (same music compositor as DeusEx). It's not about videographic, it's about freedom choice, about future, how Warren Spector was thinking how future realistic can really looks. It's about superheroes - half human, half robot, who is choosing what's good and what's bad! It's about NPC life, you talked with them and you were not getting bored, you were not getting bored from the Deus Ex world. In 2000y there were almost no open world games.... so Deus Ex was one of the first games, where you had a feeling... you are in open world.. i've created an account on this website just to give this masterpiece a 10. This game is Kino.. Deus Ex is a fantastic futuristic RPG experience and provides not only such a unique experience but it provides quite possibly the most encompassing RPG experience that is available on the market. The world building is a thing of beauty if a bit prophetic of 2024. It's clear great detail went into making not only the most fantastical world that can be made but also a very very well detailed world. With an excellent pattern of choice and consequence this game really set a benchmark for what an RPG should roughly look like in regards to make X choice deal with Y consequence, some routes are rewarded for player preparedness and planning whilst other routes are either completely closed off to the player or they are significantly more difficult whether by dialogue choice or by skill choice either way the player has the agency to choose how they play every aspect of the game. That door? You can pick it if you've got the know how, you can swipe the key if you know where it'll be or if you so choose you can just smash it down if you feel inclined. Every option is open to the player and there's no right nor wrong way around the games challenges its entirely based on what the player feels is best for them. The music from the original soundtrack is amazing and gives the player the feeling of being thrust head-first into the far flung future whiplash included. Graphically speaking in 2024 yes it's rough but the revision mod will clear that to a degree but even then it's not to everyone's liking, however speaking without the benefit of hindsight it does well to establish what each item is as well as what it can do and characters are easily distinguishable and unique in their own designs. The story is fantastical and conspiracy riddled but it never goes off the rails and loses itself or its identity and remains even to this day a great cautionary tale of the dangers of uncontrolled technological advancement. Every choice has an impact that matters even minor choices that seemingly don't matter can have larger broader consequences later on down the line and the player has the power to choose them all. All in all Deus Ex really set a high standard for the RPG genre as whole and even today maintains an excellent standard that few can lay claim to matching.. I liked mankind divided and human revolution, so naturally i wanted to like this. I gave it many chances but i just dont see it. Its just plain bad and completely outdated. The weapons ****, the story is meh, the missions are boring, etc... human revolution and mankind divided are superior in every way. I dont get why people are praising this, maybe they have nostalgia psychosis. And yes the game was good 25 years ago, but nowadays it just ****.. This is the best game ever not one major flaw anyone disagrees everybody dies. 10 / 10 A masterpiece in the gaming universe, if you want a extremely well written plot and excellent gameplay you should really play this one, even better than the newer ones.. It's not perfect, but its clear alot of effort has gone into this game and it's world. It is super rich, the story and the environment that is to be explored. Combat is not the best, but its a decent fps, as well with superdeluxe rpg features. Deus ex is a classic. Deus Ex is the gold standard of RPGs. It's an FPS like no other, and one of the most immersive games ever created.. The best RPG evermade ! every objective has 15 different alternatives every dialogue can become important and every boss can be defeated in 20 different ways. The game was very tedious and boring at launch. Outdated ""Unreal"" game engine and hopeless ideas. Total chaos in the story told and no atmosphere. Today, this game doesn't stand the test of time at all and doesn't live up to the standards of games like System Shock 2 and Hitman 47.. Outdated overhyped snoozefest ****. Only delusional purists that wear nostalgic glasses can enjoy this mediocre snoozefest.. I am playing games since 1983, and without hesitation I can say DX is one of the 5 best games ever made. A handfull and then some perfectly interacting base game mechanics (without meaningless bloat), a brillant story, a very nice RPG, a story and an atmosphere so dense, and last not least my personal favourite: this game and its main protagonist are just freaking COOL! Though graphics naturally have not matured well - the original was released back in 2000, this is still (2022) a plain awesome experience. Thank you Ion Storm, thank you Warren Spector! Did I say DX is one of my 5 favourite games? Well, it's more like one of the 3 ... or 1.. Amazing game. Graphics are good and the gameplay is really fun but challenging.. DEUS EX one of the best enviorments i have seen in any game. the story is top tier the gunplay is meh but still satisfying the ai pretty dumb without mods. the gunplay in general is pretty bad.. Before I write a review I usually read over a few of the recent reviews so that I don't end up repeating what has already been said. One of the recent reviewers typed ""combat is bad, sneaking is bad, charater building is bad, graphics are bad... 10/10"" The game is so highly regarded by the gaming community that people feel compelled to give it a perfect score even though they see many problems with it. Game is currently sitting at 9.2/10, and it is certainly not that good. Everyone praises the story, but it does have a few holes in it. Your choices do not matter. You can save someone's life, you can kill ""to-be"" villians early on, but none of this affects the plot, which is entirely linear. Want to stop following that obviously manipulative guy telling you what to do? Too bad. Don't want to ally yourself with a cringy statnic goth-girl? Too bad. At the finale you always have the same 3 choices for an ending, Mass Effect style. Gunplay is awkward, but this is on purpose to try to get you to use stealth. Enemies are blind, however, and won't notice you until you reach a certain proximity. You can trigger an alarm and defeat a group of 10 enemies, but the next batch a block down the street will still be patrolling regular routine as though nothing happened. Also, the XP system encourages you to save cats so you can upgrade your radiation resistance. Where the game does shine is in it's level design. The levels are large and there are always multiple ways of reaching your destination, based on your skills. The worldbuilding is great with lots of little books and emails, if you like to read through that sort of stuff. And the plot itself is thrilling if you don't want to fight it, and if you don't think about it too much. It's a good game, but not a 9/10. --Reviewed with ""Give Me Deus Ex"" version. I am amazed at how, operating with such a small number of tools, the developers managed to delay the players for dozens of hours. It seems to me that in this case it is precisely the merit of specific developers and Warren Specter in particular, who built the game mechanics in such a way as to encourage players for curiosity. It's interesting to look into every nook and cranny, to look for secret passages and stashes. I am again struck by the depth, semantic load and elaboration that old video games give.. What a game. A chilling RPG masterpiece with an extremely prophetic story. One of the greatest WRPGs of all time in totality. Mechanics might be clunky, but the game at heart is an absolute masterpiece.. Oh oh, I'm one of those who's very enthusiastic about this game, but due to its implementation I cannot give it a high score. The game looked really good in its day and now with mods (Revision) it looks still acceptable on my Windows 7 based PC. It's original as it has a deep storyline, intelligent conversations, lots of gaming-hours. You can go almost entirely stealth (no casualties), non-lethal stealth, non-lethal action, lethal action and everything in between. I went for both Deus Ex and DX2 stealth non-lethal. It was super rewarding. The most excellent feature was its message. Clearly this game was ahead of its time, attempting to expose governing forces bigger than us. But Deus Ex has a grand weakness and that is that the abilities you have are not very useful, especially if you go stealth non-lethal. I notice many reviewers have the same complaint. Next thing is that special abilities use a lot of energy and there's not enough energy re-supply available so that was totally uncool. If you know the map, i.e. having played this game before then it's obviously far easier, but going stealth non-lethal the first time is resource intensive and I wasn't catered towards this style. Almost all of my problems were solved by crouching behind a guard (crouching makes you still catch up with walking guards) and knock-him or taser him unconscious. Rarely was a special ability needed. You keep pushing those F-keys. Things like strength could have easily been made a passive ability, but everything you did was a drain on your resources which demanded continuous on-off switching. You feel like a beginning piano-player. It broke the immersion for me many times. I gave this game only a 6/10. What's the point of being special when your special abilities aren't very useful and labor intensive to use? The game is rightfully legendary for its story though.. This game requires mods to run properly on modern hardware. If you're willing to mod, oh my god Deus Ex is an amazing game. I beat it for the first time this year: 2023. This 23-year-old game still holds up extremely well due to how unbelievably well-designed the whole experience is. If you are a student of game design, you owe it to yourself to play Deus Ex as it is a tour de force in this regard. The story and story-telling are top-notch. The game's systems regarding choices and consequences are so subtle that I am still learning new things about the game even after multiple playthroughs. I love how Deus Ex emphasizes choices in gameplay, like how you help someone, or who you kill, or the simple reactivity that an inventory system can bring if you mismanage resources. It's such an amazing game, and I cannot recommend it enough.. I am really really sorry i couldn't enjoy this game i feel like this aged like milk controls gameplay everything feels unnaturally slow dialogs are like ai created.. Since people think this game is the best thing since sliced bread I tried it and I am beyond disappointed. It is sometimes laggy even on decent computers, the brightness settings don't work and the game is stuck at very dark, to the point that after the first mission you have to turn on the flashlight to see anything at all, which has limited use time. Even if you played the tutorial you often don't know how something works or how to do something.. + Many ways to get to the goal + Lots to explore (it's fun to get passwords to get more information or items) + Many locations + Milestone for storytelling in the game industry - The game has aged a bit badly (controls, graphics etc.) - You often run the risk of not finding your way (faltering progress) - The augmentations are tedious to use - Only English sound. Deus Ex is remarkably modern in terms of game design, yet it is so archaic both in terms of interface, combat, and graphics. This was true back in 2000's, and it is that much more relevant today. The modulable quests design and freedom of approach are two of the most refreshing aspects of the game and ahead of most modern videogame productions. Unfortunately, as an action RPG, Deus Ex can only hope to be as good as its combat mechanics, and that's precisely where the game misses the mark. If it is true that Human revolution and Mankind divided owe everything to the original Deus ex, it is also true that both these games are far superior to the original release. Deus Ex remains an important game, a remarkable and influential game, yet a game that is also mediocre in more ways than one.. The depth of the game, including the newspapers, random e-mails, random chatter all around the zones... And the atmosphere, characters, plot, skill system, multiple approaches to problems and so on make this game a pinnacle in its own time. The fact that the graphics have aged doesn't make this game any less good because you can use mods that improve textures and still enjoy it.. Deus Ex. What can I say that hasn't been said already? Rich gameplay. Amazing atmosphere. Thrilling soundtrack. And a story that predicted the next 20 years in human History. Deus Ex was a landmark in video games : it paved the way to modern AAA with rich gameplay and immersive story and provided an analysis of our society and humankind much deeper than any other game has. Even today. To play Deus Ex, is to understand our world and our society. To play Deus Ex is to play an IMPORTANT part of human culture. To play Deus Ex is to play the best video game of all time.. Great soundtrack great replayability and best story out there really. No other game in modern day will point out how international bankers actually run our supposed democracy. An iconic game that was before its time offering the players a lot of freedom in execution. The year is 2052 and the world is a dangerous and chaotic place. Terrorists operate openly - killing thousands; drugs, disease and pollution kill even more. The world's economies are close to collapse and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor grows ever wider.. A great game with a fantastic OST, great writing, good level design, outdated combat and extremely cheap. There is so many different ways that you can play this game that is mind-blowing.. Pros: Multiple ways of playing the game (stealth, combat, mixed), great world, good graphics for its time, good voice actors. Cons: Could not see because the game is dark (need to go to settings to make the game lighter) which I consider is kind of a hack, no visual indication on where you should go, bad gun hitting mechanic.. The master of the immersive-sim, one of a kind. Game Industry takes a huge leap forward at every aspect from this game and for the first time video games could arguably considered as art but not entertainment. In the desperately world of wounder and lost, this is the gem that reflexs truth and guides you to the light.. G.O.A.T. Conspiracy as a way of thinking. Gameplay: combat mechanics 6/10 stealth 8/10 atmosphere 9/10 Gameplay as RPG & ****: 10/10 Story 10/10 Graphics 9/10 Sounds & music 10/10 . J. Romero, thank you for ION Storm Austin with W. Spector and H. Smith !!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Another one of my Top 10 favourite games of all times. Masterpiece in it's genre.. One of the best cyberpunk FPS/RPGs ever created. Even the mod/update to play as the original female denton from the concept art is great too.. So fellow gamers know I played it and am therefore a hardcore gamer (have to make this 75 characters long). This game is a must play for all gamers. Brilliant story, characters etc. And what is really scary? It kinda forecasts the future.. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided it's a failure. Why Eidos decided to continue the story of Adam Jensen, which in HR was absolutely completed and didn't require any continuing. Anyway, in the Universe of Deus Ex needed a new main charact. Deus Ex. I’ve known about this game for as long as I can ****, what, since 2000? Yet, I never paid any attention to it; always just glancing over it; not knowing I’ve been overlooking a masterpiece all these years. Here I am, 21 years later, and I’ve finally decided to give it a go, and let me say, what a masterpiece this is. Okay, let me get this out of the way: the Game of the Year Edition is buttery smooth. Alright, let’s talk about the game. Great music, voice acting, level design, and decent RPG elements. Got it. Here is why the game was ahead of its time. The game follows a linear story and path, but if you want to hack computer terminals, run n’ gun, or sneak through each level, it lets you. Need a code for a door? Hack a computer. Don’t have the necessary skills to hack a computer for a code? Blow it up. Don’t have any explosives? Find a vent to crawl through. It forgoes the “one size fits all” style. It’s just simply one of the best games out there. Get it, get over the dated graphics, and enjoy the game that shaped future RPGs.. This game was surely so ahead of its time . Just imagine this game only came out 2 years after half life 1 .. Just the third PC game I have ever played till that point and what a great experience it was.. I played this game many years ago. I could not stop playing it, and so a friend of mine. It was crazily good, and also different from any other game.. For me the best game ever. Perfekt Story, Perfect setting, perfect characters.. Easily the best game ever made. Nothing can top it. It's ground-breaking like nothing no one else has ever seen before.. Simply unforgettable. None of the sequels even tried to match these gem. So many opportunities, so many ways to play, so smart so unique.. Overall i can see why the game is praised as one of the best FPS of all time. The story is very good, the RPG elements are implemented well, but it is overwhelming, However the game is very hard for new players and i wouldnt be surprised if you use cheats the first time you play through. If you are used to games like half life then you wont have a good time playing this game. The AI is buggy but managable. The small choices in the game you can make if you notice them are great if you notice them.. A game for the person who likes to think deeply when playing a game, it has lots of different ways to complete your objectives and each one is fun, giving you a real choice. But as no game is it is not perfect, so i give it a 9 for being a great game.. One of the, if not my favourite PC game of all time, but, I have to admit, some of the mechanics and the way the story is delivered in the beginning didn't age quite so well. Some of the skills (Like swimming and environmental resistance) are useless, the controls are weird for modern standards and don't synergize well with the stealth gameplay. Some of the weapons (like the sniper rifle) are much more viable options than others (namely the mini crossbow and the rest of the common firearms). The stealth is pretty alright, the game is pretty challenging sometimes but nothing that will make you get stuck or soft-block you. The story has some of the best and some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen. this basically summarizes the entire game, you have some amazing **** that you absolutely love but on the other hand you have things that you despise. And that adds some kind of beauty to all of this. What a shame.. Deus Ex is still an amazing game! The atmosphere, the soundtrack, the level design and the number of ways you can go about each mission have all stood the test of time!. I chose my nickname based on this game's protagonist. Needless to say, it's the greatest game of all time, and it's a milestone in the genre of immersive sims.. The beginning of a legend. The first Deus Ex is stylish and atmospheric. Everything from plot to gameplay and possibilities are unbelievably strong. Only the graphics were and surely are outdated, but this is a very negligible point of criticism with regards to the game´s greatness. Precious, even today!. To me, it is my top one, best thing i have ever played. Amazing plot, good RPG mechanics, still easy and fun to play, even in 2020. Some aspects, like atmosphere, variety of playstyles or soundtrack in Deus Ex are much better, then in most of the games.. Best game of my life ! I can still remember the emotions ... was playing this in the new year eve of 2001 ... didn't wanted to go to the party because I got so addicted to this gem. This and witcher 3 - best games ever made.. he was a good game ... lip smack ... what a wonderful way to live - What a game? Deus Ex.. Literally unplayable. I have a high-end PC yet it's still laggy af and if that wasn't enough, the controls are horrible, the gameplay is boring and even the tutorial is full of bugs.. Deus Ex is a video game masterpiece whose philosophical value and gameplay freedom effortlessly exceed the boundaries of time itself.. Even after 20 years Warren Spector's masterpiece is as captivating as ever. If graphical fidelity is a requirement, it isn't for you - It wasn't a particularly good-looking game even on the day of release - but get by the graphics, and you are welcomed by a storyline and atmosphere that well and truly haven't been matched in a video game since. Even the gameplay, which is, admittably, somewhat wonky in places, complements it in a way that the sequels couldn't quite capture. If there ever was a game that deserved a maximum rating, this is it.. This is a game that still manages to amaze. I've been playing this game for sure through at least 7 times. Both on PC and PS2. Why isn't there a remake of this game yet?. Absolutely a masterpiece Way ahead of it's time Still one of the best games I ever played. Thank you ion storm and eidos. Deus Ex shows what games can be. It couldn't be a book or a movie and offer the same experience. Your actions have consequences and it reflects in things you actually do, not just in dialogue line choices. Not many modern games follow that path, it is a difficult one and I'm sure companies hate the idea that a lot of content might never be even seen by a player, but that is the ultimate way to do it.. I'm writing this review near the 20th annivesary of Deus Ex, and it stills holds the crown of being the best PC game ever made. No game before or after it were able to make non-combat gameplay this fun, and had a plot this deep. Must play.. The best game in all our world. Of course there are more but it isn't mention. Why I think so? For at first, there is one of the most interesting plot. In the first cut scene more plot than in the biggest part of new games. For at second, that's immersive sim. What does it means? It means that this is realistic game. And realistic part there is made very good. The biggest part of it looks like in real life. And I don't I know what to say about this game more. Just play in it and you'll understand the sence and you'll fill that you are main hero. P.S. If I made some mistakes - excuse me. I am from Russia.. I played it many many years after the release, and while the graphics and mechanics don't hold very well in this day and age, the atmosphere and story about all the conspiracy theories turning out to be real **** you in like there is no tomorrow. One of the very best storylines and atmospheres in video games ever. A masterpiece.. This review covers both the revision and original content. The greatest piece of work ever made that isn't just a game, it is a reality. I've played this three times in a row and I will always recommend it to anyone no matter what. I think Deus Ex is a bit scary in how it has predicted a lot on modern life but even though it seems a bit weird at times because of this, a lot of what is said in Deus Ex makes you question a lot about reality. There are four major things that Deus Ex predicted (from my perspective): - The attacks on the world trade centre on 9/11 - Facebook's irresponsible miss-usage of data and other organisations exploiting data and using data mining algorithims - The worship of celebrities and opinion leaders in a modern age and how social media is used - The coronavirus Now I'm not saying that I agree with everything in this game. Obviously, there is no such yip yap as the illuminati, but what I can take away from it is that there is a secret ""elite"" somewhere out there who could be exploiting people and we don't know about it, but I don't 100% agree with this. But I chose to play this again during the coronavirus outbreak mainly because of how Deus Ex got this right. In the game, the plot centres around a virus that has caused lockdowns across the globe and forced governments to take control of the streets in every country and crazily enough this is just about what we are seeing at the moment. This doesn't mean the ""illuminati is going to take over"", it's just crazy how Deus Ex got this right. The Morpheus conversation in this game is the best scene in gaming history, I don't think there is anything better than it. Morpheus is 100% right about ""humans feeling amusement"" when watched. Just look at what we do today, using social media apps to post stories, post fragments of our life on there and what do people do? they judge, and what Morpheus says is that judgement is what fuels society. He is right. Then he said that after the worship of gods 100 years ago, people now desire fame and worship famous people and again he is right. Everyone follows a politician or someone famous, no matter what political ideology you hold, you'll just agree with what that famous person says 75% of the time because you worship them. It's stuff like this that make Deus Ex an amazing game. The story is just untouchable and by far the best plot ever written, and this is a game. I've seen middle-aged people talk about this game because of how good the plot is and I wish more people knew about this game and played it. For the gameplay however, while Deus Ex is an masterpiece, it has a steep learning curve. Don't expect to be a walk in the park, you need to really engage with what is being thrown at you. Use your skill points wisely, etc. When you get the gameplay however, you'll be playing this game for hours to see what the story has to offer you. Most of this game is just me relating it to the real world and its just truthful in how things have progressed. Now that the game is on sale for 0.69 p (notice how masterpieces like Deus Ex and Hollow knight are usually the most feasible games) I would highly recommend it to anyone. Of course, get the revision not just for achievements and the upgrades it has, but because it makes the game less buggier and gives great optimisation for win 10. Buy this game and experience it, you will not regret it. i would give it a 10 but i never beat it but i still love the game to death! over 1000 hrs on steam love modding this game too. Still the GOAT, even 20 years on. Of course, there's a good dose of nostalgia in my opinion, but even for new players, the atmosphere, narrative, and intangible 'sense' that the player is experiencing something special offset the obvious graphical and gameplay shortcomings. Play it with the GMDX mod for the best experience, and pray to the god of games that someone does a remake and that it captures lightning in a bottle a second time.. Overrated to hell. Gameplay is very average and the game just goes on and on. It becomes more nonsense with every hour and eventually the dullness gets to you as well. Voice acting is hilarious and some of the voice actor/character combinations are just pure fail. And just like with most games with multiple decisions and endings, you will find that it doesn't give you that much freedom after all. Many different actions still lead to the same path and if there are any different outcomes, they are done in a lazy manner. Characters you make sure survive, still end up not appearing much anymore after the big decisive moment...other characters you may want to kill are unkillable and kill you instead...some important dialogue options that literally point towards an opposite outcome, still force the same **** so much more. You are still forced to play the way the creators want you to play. It's disappointing. People can praise this game, if they liked it. But calling this game the best thing ever made is just disrespectful and cringy.. One of the all time greats. There's no weakness, everything is amazing, even today. Graphics are outdated but can be fixed with mods. A classic.. Deus Ex and it's sequels to a lesser extent are breathtaking experiences about realistic political arch-types that will leave you thinking. The game that incorporates RPG, action, adventure, and 1st-person shooter genres into a chaotic blend of real-world conspiracies, cliffhangers, and plot twists. A richly simulated world of unparalleled interactivity, engineered to react logically to your every action. The decisions and consequences are yours. - eidos montreal Need I say more. This game is almost perfect. Story 10/10 Originality 10/10 Game-play 10/10 Setting 10/10 Graphics 9.5/10 (with mods) Music/sounds 10/10 Replay-ability 10/10. Possibly the best game ever made. Sadly the new generations will not enjoy it because they havent even heard of it. The sad part is that its sequels didnt even manage to reach this masterpiece. No other game has even reached this diamond. Not sure if the people who made this game can even repeat this labour. A true masterpiece. What made Deus Ex so mind-blowingly awesome, such a hallmark of game design, is that it asks you to decide, for each single obstacle you face, which approach you want to use. You're not asked to stealth through the whole game even when combat seems a better approach, or to shoot and kill everyone even when creeping through the shadows would be smarter. It doesn't reward you for sticking to a single course of action during the entire game. It lets you decide what fits any given situation. Deus Ex, in other words, makes you feel like a superhuman spy with a massive toolkit fitted for any obstacle - your success depends on your ability to identify which part of your kit is best suited for the challenge you face. Contrast this to other games in the genre, which all to often restricts you to one set of tools for each and every encounter - since the character customization or reactivity penalizes you if you try to mix it up. Deus Ex understood what each of its spiritual successors has failed to grasp, and for that, I salute it.. Always my pick as the best game of all time and definitely the best PC game of all time. Best storyline of all time and the fact you can kill important characters and they won't be there later in the game to speak shows how ahead of it's time the game was.. Not really sure why Deus Ex (2000) is not top 1 game of all time/all platforms ever. I'll give that to ignorance and the new gamers.... A phenomenal pinnacle of video gaming, having first played this in 2018 I think this is the best game ever made. Deus Ex boasts a truly immersive experience due to its tactical gameplay, character dialogue, and engaging environments. One of my favorite systems is having 6 health bars: 2 for arms, 2 for legs, 1 for chest and 1 for head. If you lose one leg you will move slower, lose both and you cant stand up and have to crawl your way through the game. At one point I lost my right arm during a gun fight. Low on health kits I was no longer able to use my rifle and had to fight my way through with a mere knife. The environments feel lived in due to smart decisions in level design and script choices. For example the Hilton Hotel's LED name is broken; the 'hil' portion is blacked out and only the 'ton' remains. The local residents joke on this, referring it to the 'ton hotel. All of this is complimented with a stellar soundtrack and a game world designed to cause you to make choices, both for story and gameplay purpo","in 2000y there were almost no open world games... so Deus Ex was one of the first games, where you had a feeling... you are in open world . the world building is a thing of beauty if a bit prophetic of 2024 . with an excellent pattern of choice and consequence this game really set a benchmark for what an RPG should roughly look like ."
316.Donkey Kong 64,"I recently played it again, and the truth is that I thought that nostalgia had altered my perception, since I remembered the game too good to be true, but when I lived the worlds again, got all the collectibles and got the 101%, I realized that indeed I was facing a very polished and good game for its time, highlighting how fun the worlds are, the soundtrack and the characteristic difficulty that many people do not like, but that I personally love.Translated with **** (free version). DK 64 is my favorite N64 game. Does it hold up really well, No. Is it perfect for what it is and has no issues, definitely not. But what it brings is weirdness experimentation. This game is incredibly weird, everything from the levels, characters, animations etc. But it's all still charming. This game has glaring problems with it. There are too many collectables, the levels are so big and sprawling that it's almost impossible to not to get lost, the controls with the N64 controller can be hard and unforgiving to use, and there's literally a game breaking bug that makes it impossible to 100% the game if you don't fix it. But it's still great, it's still fun, unbelievably funny, and still worth playing today.. A 3D collectathon platformer that get way too much crap these days. It’s far from being perfect, but the character swapping mechanic isn’t TOO bad, and most of the mini games are genuinely pretty fun, with many exceptions such as beaver bother (it’s terrible). Nevertheless, still a pretty fun game, and actually playing it holds up well if you aren’t trying to collect every single thing. The DK Rap automatically makes this game amazing, regardless, so still worth it.. this game is very tedious and not worth your time. anyone giving it a review over 6 are only nostalgic for the game and can’t see its blatant flaws. the music is great though i love the dk rap.. A very frustrating, unrewarding and overall exhausting experience. Visually this game offers the best graphic on the Nintendo 64 and it look pretty even today, so on that side it belongs to the few N64-Games that still look beautiful. The humor Rare was famous for in the 90's is also there. However on this game, they gone to far with their use of collectible stuff. Golden bananas, bananas with different colours for each character, banana fairys, special coins and more are simply to many things. This combined with repetitive minigames you have to play to get the golden bananas and where some of them are really annoying and an overall bad leveldesign, results in a frustrating and exhausting experience. On top of that, Rare force you to play old arcade classics to reach the final boss. You have to play through the classic Donkey Kong Arcade game twice to get one of the two coins you need to reach the final boss. This is ridiculous. Although all of the five Kong Characters are fun to play with, they are the main reason for really tedious backtracking, because the bad leveldesign force you to switch between three Kongs to reach one of the 25 golden bananas per level. I played through it with my sister and her boyfriend, but I will never play this game again.. I'll start off by saying that I was never enamored with Donkey Kong 64, even in 1999. I always thought it had massive flaws. The controls are too sluggish for the oversized worlds, only being able to switch characters with the Kong barrel is tedious and the different color banana system for different characters is nothing but obvious padding. Most of the game feels like padding. The graphics are nice for the system but that's not enough. Just play Banjo or Mario 64 if you are jonesing for a classic 3D collectathon platformer.. Really ambitious and fun game but some QoL like being able to swap Kongs on the fly would make it amazing.. Mario 64 has aged incredibly well. This game revolutionised gaming: the first Mario 3d platformer. And what a good game it was! I really enjoyed getting all 128 stars (twice because I loved the game so much). Despite the n64's controller (remember it?) The controls were actually good, and the different levels are varied have just the right difficulty. Although my favorite game is Dead or Alive Paradise (which I have finished 4 times due to the hot girls playing volleyball and incredible and realistic Boob jiggle physics...) this game is the best n64 game and an incredible Mario game.. Another attractive looking, technically impressive but generic 3D platformer that's not as good as Mario 64.. Solid gameplay utilizing a colorful cast of apes and monkeys that all play extremely unique. Really solid level design as well as incentive to reexplore areas of the world with each Kong that opens up the level design in different way depending on their abilities and specialties. The only pain points of the game have to do with most Nintendo 64 era games, that being the camera. Multiple times I can recall precise platforming being made either more difficult or tedious via the camera.. Absolutely beautiful music and storytelling, but the gameplay gets really tedious really fast. Once you unlock all the kongs, you may as well call it. Still love the game though.. Very good and not flawless. If you could change kongs at any time, and if they fixed some of the more annoying minigames, this would be an easy 9/10,. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good game with an awesome soundtrack and funny characters but Beaver Bother and the beetle races are painful. Honestly this is the best Donkey Kong game in the series. It's art style and the way its played reminds me of a series call Banjo Kazooie. (former title of n64) Fun collectibles, honesty when I found the golden bananas, or the banana fairies i felt a fun sense of accomplishment! My personal favorite part is when your in the boxing ring with King k rool. Over all one of my favorite n64 games would 99% recommend this game! One little nitpick of mine with this game would be the 3d platforming could be a little tricky with the standard n64 joystick.. The Donkey Kong series is one of the most different adventure video games! The characters, the action, and the sure thrill of adventure makes this game a fun non-stop playing time! Below is a brief look how I think the game is! Game Play: The game play is very good. There is really basic controls here and is easy to perform. Novice gamers should have a good time here! Graphics: The graphics are wonderful especially for the N64! The backgrounds are really beautiful! Difficulty: The game is easy but as it goes on you find out that it will become more difficult! Music: The music is great! Just fantastic catchy tunes through out the game! In My opinion its some of the best music ever in a video game! Sound: The sound is great. Nuff said! Overall: I have always loved Donkey Kong 64! If you like excellent adventure up games then I strongly recommend you play this game!. one of my favorite games ever. yes this game has problems. camera **** everything is seperated between kongs. but i think in order to enjoy this game today you need a form of nostalgia for it if u play a level one kong at a time its a blast. bosses are great. and donkey kong says OK so its an automatic 10/10 ans also there is the dk rap that makes it 20/10. It's a must have, must play n64 title, the expansion pak usage was an issue with de devs team, so it doesn't use it as intended. Anyway, excelent title!. This game is a prime example of Rareware's dominance in N64 development. This game puts DK and all his friends into a 3D world carrying on the tradition from DKC. The levels are fantastic and controlling DK and his friends in an open 3D world is an exciting experience. There has not been a DK game since that has really made a mark like this one and the one's released before this one. A must have for any Nintendo fan and could be named a top 5 game for the console.. I busted out the Wii U to play this game again. The music, the collecting, the primates, everything about this game oozes nostalgia for me. I was finally able to play this game to completion now that I'm older and more patient. The idea to change characters mid level is neat, but I have always hated when I find a small hoard of bananas that belong to a monkey I haven't traversed that far with yet, but they had to pad the game out a little to give us more meat. My biggest gripe with this game has to be the mini games. At first they aren't that bad, but by the time you get to the 3rd world the mini games start to repeat themselves. The mini games are exactly the same but now you have more items to collect in a lesser amount of time. I know the N64 had limitations, but variety would've been nice. And holy mother of pearl do I HATE the mine cart levels in this game! I'll take the hardest kart ride or barrel rocket from the new Donkey Kong Country game by Retro Studios tenfold over this **** These were the most anger inducing portions of DK64 and made me question if 101% is worth it. In the end, I'm glad I stuck to it and finished the game. This could have been the Wii U version not being optimized, but once I got to 150+ golden bananas I had several game crashes. I was worried that my obsessive ""collect everything before progressing to the next level"" mentality was breaking the game. For a great blast to the past, boot this game up, but 101% completion wasn't as rewarding as I'd hoped. I the words of The Completionist, ""I give this game my Completionist rating of 'Finish it'."". One of the best Nintendo 64 games, providing fun that lasts many hours (a point that many complain about, for a variety of collectibles that tire), in addition to a problematic camera, which does not diminish the fun that Donkey Kong 64 provided at the time. Very beautiful graphics, spectacular soundtrack, gameplay that flows smoothly, making the game one of the best of its generation.. Platform game that despite being quite expensive at that time (about € 80 today) and needing a transfer pack (included in the game) is still a jewel of the Nintendo 64. Personally one of my donkey kong preferred.. The best 3d platform game along with super mario 64,excellent graphics and variety in gameplay. It holds up. You can't play this game and not laugh, smile and have a good time. Donkey Kong 64 is a shockingly impressive and good-looking collectible-based adventure platformer of the 90s. It gets a bad rap simply because several video game commentators choose to target this game as the point where ""collectibles went horribly wrong"". This is confusing to me, because collectibles were a part of nearly all N64 platformers, as well as many current gen and recent games, which provides the classic *100% completion* hunt for players who enjoy that sort of thing. DK64 is a masterpiece in doing what it intends to do -- provide 30-45 hours of engaging platforming (and very, very light ""third person shooter"") gameplay with various characters who learn multiple unique abilities over time. Because of this gameplay style, you are opening up new areas constantly -- with a nearly Metroidvania feel -- while exploring dynamically lit, animated, and rendered, giant group of worlds. The biggest frustration may come in the fact that you often have to switch between characters at confusing or inopportune times to use one of their abilities to solve a puzzle or reach the next banana. But I love it. There are 201 bananas spread out through gorgeous and expansive levels, and the fact that you are often switching between characters keeps the gameplay fresh, and gives many new ways for them to throw puzzles at you. By the time you've found ~90% of the collectibles, the hunt may get stale, but at that point, you are entering completionist-only territory, which means that you know what you're getting yourself into. While Mario 64 revolutionized 3D platforming, DK64 took everything that Nintendo had built, and added more variety, options, abilities, and even a fun multiplayer mode... well... at least for 1999. The graphics were excellent for the time, but I will admit that the textures start to look pretty bland, and the framerate often drops. The game does so much with lighting that the system can't always handle it, but thankfully it never crashes (with help from the memory expansion pack). The camera does have some issues, but it's a rare annoyance. The music is pleasant, and the game has a ton of heart, humor and silliness that is ridiculously endearing. It doesn't have much of a story, but cutscenes and sequences and the developing dynamic and structure of the island, and routes that are opened up, do give it the slightest story-like feel to it, even if this part is a bit lacking. I'm not sure why this game gets the brunt of collectible-rage (other than holding a collectible world record), as I could give dozens of examples of games that take far more than 40 or so hours to collect all the nonsense, and at least DK64 keeps it extremely fresh as you tackle each banana. Give it a shot, and soak up one of the last versions of pure Nintendo 64 platformer brilliance.. One of the great N64 games. The game looks fantastic-- especially considering the limitations on the console-- with vivid colors, cool lighting effects, and lively character designs and animations. And the sounds of this game are something else-- the music is absolutely brilliant, and the sound effects really help bring the world to live, being just cartoony enough without going overboard. The controls are smooth and responsive, with each character having it's own set of specialized moves. And the world is fun to explore, with some of the best level design the N64 ever saw. I know this game gets a lot of grief for taking the 'collectathon' concept too far, but i always found it fun figuring out how to get those last bananas in each level. It's my opinion that this is the best 3D platformer Rare ever made.. A lot of people have negative opinions about this game because of it massive amount of collectibles, but AlyssaW is right. This is still an AMAZING game. This is the kind of game that really challenges you. It has got some flat out nice worlds. Jungle Japes, Crystal Caves, Creepy Castle, Frantic Factory, Fungi Forest, they're very neat. Sure the graphics aren't the best, but the game still has some great level design and gameplay. If anyone was to ask me what world I think would most likely be poorly designed I would probably just say Gloomy Galleon. Even though it seemed like inside the giant mushroom of Fungi Forest that Rare was being lazy and putting the color-coated bananas everywhere so they could cut the players some slack. Although, This issue still does not affect the game. I for one think this game in my opinion is even better than Banjo-Tooie. Metacritic, you MUST rate this a Must-Play. I don't care what people say about this game. It's great, fun, amazing, and the only thing Donkey Kong got close to having a 3D Platformer. If anything, the game that fans should really give Rare a hard time for making is Jet Force Gemini. Though, it doesn't have as many collectibles as Donkey Kong 64, but its intense difficulty would really make it seem that way.. Dinkey Kong 64 is a stupid game. Its a 3D platformer on the n64 with bad platforming. its a collectathon with too many collectibles. Its a game with a lot of **** moments, and yet i still kinda like it. When I first played this game I thought it was a 4/5 really good game, but after looking back at my experience, and watching videos on it. I realized how stupid a lot of **** in this game is. But before I talk about the **** in this game. Lets talk about what I really like in this game. I love the soundtrack. Grant Kirkhope is a genius and he nails the soundtrack, he really does a good job giving atmosphere to these levels with the music alone. Like frantic factory the dark gloomy sounding music is a perfect representation of the theme of the level and the dark factory setting. The music is incredible. Also I love the DK Rap. I always really like the level design. Yes. I know that each level involves constant back tracking and character specific areas. But the overall level designs themselves are really cool. The Crystal Caves look beautiful for n64, Fungi Forest you get to climb a giant mushroom, and travels to different parts of the forest, and creepy castle. Which is probably my favorite level in the whole game. For some reason the last 3 levels are like the best levels in the game. I also like some of the boss fights. The second dogaddon fight where you turn giant with chunky and punch him. The jack n the box boss fight is pretty cool. And one of the best fights on the n64, King K. Rool. This fight is so god damn good that I wish all the boss fights were like this. Honestly I've been sitting here trying to think of something else I really liked about the game and I just can't, the different characters all have kinda unique personalities I guess. Their different abilities are pretty cool. It's satisfying when you get a banana, or overcome some challenge. OK lets get to the **** 1. BACKTRACKING. When I first played the game I didn't really mind all the backtracking and running through enormous levels just trying to figure out whats going on. But looking back I realize how boring and tedious it actually is. And this could of easily been fixed if you could just push a button, it brings up a screen with all the kongs, and you could just pick one. Why do you have to go back to the barrel so many god damn times. I swear this game has more backtracking than any other damn game. 2. ABSOLUTE ASSETRY. This game pissed me off so much when I played it, that I still writhe whenever i think about these parts in the game. Every single barrel mini game is **** Beaver Bother makes me wanna burn an orphanage down. The slot machine game makes me wanna commit a felony. And all the others **** too. The race with the dune bug in the desert, is suppose to be cool, but it **** complete ass. All the mine cart segments are ass. The arcade donkey kong mini game isn't that fun, and is also mandatory to beat the game. AND THE WORST SECTION IN ANY GAME EVER MADE. A CHALLENGE THAT WAS DESIGNED BY SATAN HIMSELF TO BE THE WORST **** STAIN ON AN OTHERWISE DECENT GAME. A SECTION SO FOUL THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD LOOK AT IT AND SAY ""THAT'S EVIL."" The god damn second rabbit race is the worst section in any video game ever made. I'd rather beat dark souls with key board controls, than ever experience this abomination of video game design. This race demands perfection with every god damn hop with every turn, with everything in general. Not only do you have experience the worst thing in video games. Period. But you have to revisit the level after you get an ability for lanky. And now that I realized I could've cheesed it with a simple glitch. Just makes me livid. Anyway donkey kong 64 is alright. 6/10. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. Horrible game design. One of the most tedious games in existence of gaming.. This game reminds me a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, it is good, but not great. I compared this game a lot to Mario 64. To me, Mario 64 set the standard for this type of game on the N64. This game was fun, but kind of dull... But thank you for introducing us to the expansion kit!. OK I think this game is good but not 10/10 good. I think this because the game has lots of things to do but I think those tasks are just not all that fun. For example you need to switch characters while playing but only certain kongs can do certain things making you go back to the tag barrel every time you need to do something new. Which can make the game tedious and boring at times. But the bosses are great and they wanted me to come back to the main game. And the minecart sections are fun and provide a fair challenge. But it is only these things and the music that make me not want to give this game a 4/10 so with those in mind dk64 gets 6/10. Donkey Kong 64 is an amazing game, but a few things stopped me from making this a perfect 10. The game feels a little clunky sometimes and the amount of collectables confuses the player, but besides that it is a fun platformer that gave a good name to the Donkey Kong series and a good name to Rareware.. What else can be said about this game? Everyone knows that it was amazing and still is amazing to this day. This is one of the main things that makes me so sad when I am reminded that Microsoft now owns rareware. They made amazing games like this that we will never see remastered. I would like Nintendo to try to get some of those rights though for them to remake this game. It was truly amazing and can't ever be replicated the same way. This game would be awesome on the switch though and I know for a fact that almost everyone that owned a switch would get one and people who didn't have a switch would run to the store to get one because this game is just that good. Platforming that is just perfect, music that is just magical, and the level design is just breathtaking. They did so much right here and this stands as one of my highest rated games of all time. One of my favourite 3D platformers, I grew up with donkey kong so being able to play a game like this was truly magical. The story is like a normal donkey kong game, the villain is back so you are going to beat bosses until you meet the final boss, it's simple but funny enough. A lot of people said it's a collectathon and it wasn't enjoyable, as someone who likes exploring, I didn't mind, I actually really enjoyed it and I love the variety of characters, you have 5 different characters with great personnalities, that's the game's greatest strenght it's personnality. It's full of comedic moments which makes this game a blast to play throught. I love this game and I highly recommend it. I have 100%-ed this game on three different occasions (2000, 2008 and 2016). As a kid 17 years ago, I was enamored with everything about this game. Every single music track stuck with me, courtesy of the incredible Grant Kirkhope. The level designs were so unique and thought-out that I could still remember where everything was years later. The characters are endearing and now my toddler is obsessed with Chunky and Tiny Kong. This game mostly holds up, but assigning 100 bananas and tons of coins to specific Kongs does lead to some annoying backtracking. Creepy Castle does the best job with colored bananas by mainly using them as paths to Golden Bananas, instead of scattered randomly through the level. Some of the barrel minigames are pretty brutal (I'm looking at you, Beaver Bother) but all in all, the game is a success.. For the Nintendo '64 gaming system, the two pre-eminent adventure games were Mario and Zelda. Those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories. Unfortunately, DK '64 doesn't have that same tight gameplay, and the story was never the strong suit of the series. The problem with this game is obvious after about 30 minutes: It's all about collecting items, and very little else. Whether it is coins, tokens, or bananas, this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items. Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features. The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character, but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous. The music in this game is engaging (the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience!), but other than that nothing really stands out. If you don't mind collecting item after item, you'll like this game more than I. If you prefer a developed plot, however, than stay away at all costs.. Rare's collecting might went a bit too far. The game is loaded with content, but collecting five hundred bananas with five different characters, having to go through the levels again and again made this the least fun of the big-named Mario 64 rip-offs.. A true grand adventure. DK64 is one of the most beautiful, large, and fun games to play. The soundtrack fits in with one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time, most of the tunes will 99.999999999% be stuck in your head for years to come. This is a game you TRULY feel like you on a quest/adventure, sure the 1st world may throw you off and you may think ""oh just another 3D platform game with a jungle world"" but after world 1 the rest of the worlds are pure, true, and creative worlds masterly crafted. The game controls great(that is if your playing the N64 version, and other version is a different story), the gameplay is fine if you liked games such ad Banjo Kazooie and Tooie, but if your not in to collecting stuff then this isn't the game for you. The only flaw in this game are the mini games that are sometimes VERY unfair, but many people fail to realize YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THEM unless it's a mandatory mini game. You see in DK64 some people believe you need to collect all 200 golden bananas to beat the game, hence them believing you have to do all the unfair mini games but thats not the case AT ALL, I beat this game only getting about 145-160 golden bananas, I think you can even get less to beat this game. The graphics are one of the unquestionable absolute best on the N64, better than Banjo Kazooie but not better than Tooies. The multiplayer mode is also a good time(if you have 4 people) where you and you're friends are in 1 of 3 maps seeking each other to murder one another with combat,fruit guns, and grenades. If the one friend gets the heat seeking ammo it's all over(unless you as well have some heat seeking ammo). At the end of the day DK64 is definitely one of the greatest N64 games period, you certainly get a lot of content for the money you spent to buy this game, heck it has MUCH MORE content then most games today(as well as better music,charm, and adventure). DK64 is about $15-$20 online and in retro stores.. This game was magnificently well done and well thought out. Nicely designed levels and game-play, challenging boss battles, combine all that and you got yourself fun all around for ages.. A good old classic that somehow managed to be full of modern stuff! With multiple characters, huge levels and a great variety of modes, this game really stands out of the N64 crew. Unlike Mario, exploration on exciting levels instead of doing missions is a huge part of the game and unlike Banjo, no, you don't really need to collect everything, at least not at once. And if that didn't sound good enough, there are also tons of minigames. Some of them can be tricky, but you can skip most if not all of them if you aren't going for 100% completion. Hey, not everyone of them is like Beaver Bother: races and mine cart rides are fun! If you somehow do manage to reach the 100% completion, that does NOT mean the fun ends! With multiplayer up to 4 players, you can go competitive with the Kongs. Being a good mix of fighting, shooters and platformers, the multiplayer mode is truly beautiful with all of its modes. Trust me: it's better than Super Mario 64 DS. A LOT better.. I spent hours on this game and this game is an endless pool of fun. I love the variety this wonderful game has. The graphics are great and the game is enjoyable with great fun times. I recommend it.. The Game was innovated And Great Back in The Old Days, But Time Past and The Game started to Aged not in Good Way, Constastly Backtracking, Bad Game Design, Forced Mini Games, but The Game still have DK Charm. Back then, when Nintendo were entertaining, I played Donkey Kong 64, the game were near perfect, nice music, interesting mechanics, the graphics were not that good, but still good, something bad from this game was the lack of voiced dialogue, but the game can really compensate that.. Donkey Kong 64 will always remain the best modern Donkey Kong game, and as in modern, I mean the original games after the Donkey Kong Country trilogy. Lovable and outstanding, Donkey Kong 64 is a must play before you die.. Im playing this game on my Wii U with HDMI 55"" TV! Graphics: 9/10 Sound: 6/10 Controls: 3/10 Overall: 6/10 I never played it back in the days. Sure it looks very nice, but it has aged for worse than Mario 64. Donkey Kong 64 didnt survive the test of time :/. This game is decent. It's not my favourite Donkey Kong game in the series; however this game is the most unique from others: It's the first 3D Donkey Kong game. The story and controls are fine. King K. Rool is awesome. The character models look good. The Graphics are okay. The Intro is so awesome, it's DK Rap. I like the Smash Bros. Remix slightly better though. Great game though, and you should either pick it up, or download it.. amazing rap music. the game is okish, but the rap alone made it worth it 100%. I now randomly say ""HE HAS NO STYLE"" in public, and my friend has adopted ""HE'L MAKE YOU SMILE WHEN HE PLAYS HIS TUNE"" the DK Rap is the most magical thing you will ever experience. it exceeds the entire soundtrack of DKC2 by 1000%. This game is an all around masterpiece It features 5 playable kongs (The previous Donkey Kong games featured 2) each differentiate greatly from one another. The game features 2 ranged weapons that are both great additions to the gameplay. There are lots of coins and golden bananas that are good in creating replay value. The music is very nostalgic and reminds you greatly of the beloved donkey kong country series. Some funny and entertaining scenes and generally silly character movements( Don't move your kong and you'll know what im talking about. This game is very very long, and makes you so proud of yourself when you beat it. Overall a masterpiece. I would like to say THAT **** BUNNY IN FUNGI FOREST PISSES ME OFF. Graphics: 10 Sound: 10 Gameplay: 9 Fun/Story: 9 Another great game and a fine graphics example of N64 capacities. Although not being a DK fan, this game really made me fun and smile.. Donkey Kong 64 is literally the best game that I will ever play. Everything in this game is perfect. All of the collectables in this game will keep you busy for weeks and weeks. After every golden banana or blueprint you collect is rewarding in every way. This game makes you work hard to collect everything, which is something that modern games don't make you do. The music in this game is also some of the greatest in video-game history. It really amps up the gameplay experience to a great extent. This game could get repetitive to some, but to me, this game is perfect. The difficulty, though, can make it tough to collect everything and get a 101% in this game, but when you finally collect everything, the challenge was well worth the rewarding feeling you get. I couldn't possibly find a fault in this game if you paid me and I will always love this game. To me, this game is a pure masterpiece!. Its a good jump ´n run and worth to play but its not overwhelming.. I dont get why so many people are giving this game a low score and saying its too difficult i could beat this game when i was 10 and its one of the best games ever.. For a good 3D game similar to Super Mario 64 it sits well, for a follow up to Donkey Kong Country... not so much. I am a huge fan of the Donkey Kong Country series, DK 64 takes it in a different direction and overall does a decent job. Story (8): Same ol' good ol' story here of King K being a banana thief and reacking havoc on DK's life. Graphics (9) Damn good, pretty much the best 64 has to offer. The island is pretty cool, does feel a bit like DKC and has some rich areas. Sound (8): Some of the music and sounds bring back memories and some other music is pretty mediocre. Gameplay (9): Definitely a fun game to play, the controls are nice and the areas are diverse. There is actually a lot to do, you can interact with other characters as you progress and they can unlock different content for you. Endgame (8): The game is fairly large, and there are a lot of extra thin","this game is incredibly weird, everything from the levels, characters, animations etc. but it's all still charming . there are too many collectables, the controls with the N64 controller can be hard and unforgiving to use, and there's literally a game breaking bug that makes it impossible to 100% the game ."

318.Panzer Dragoon Orta,"I simply loved it. It may seem a bit on the hard side, but with a bit of practice you get the hang of it and have a great time. The gameplay is great, it's the most varied on-rails shooter I have played so far. If you got any system capable of running it (literally every Xbox iteration plays it great), don't doubt on trying it out!. This is, in my opinion, the best Original Xbox game. One could say that the two Halo games are better, and I definitely cannot argue with that! Panzer Dragoon Orta is just more up my alley. Panzer Dragoon Orta's graphics transcend the era that it is from, it is an absolutely stunning game. The soundtrack is amazing and fitting as well. All I'll say about the gameplay is that it is an on-rails shooter. It has a very alien, ancient, and primal aesthetic. If any of that sounds cool to you, and if you like games like Star Fox 64, then do yourself a favor and try this game.. A very good game, great gameplay, controls, a very, very underestimated classic, today such games are not made. Its a fun and unique game, but can be difficult. Once i'm actually able to get past the 4th level ill get back to you.................................... As you can see, the negative reviews are complete baloney and make no good points about any supposed flaws in this game. In reality, this is the king of rail shooters. It takes a ton of skill and practice to complete the game even on normal mode, and the mechanics are very deep. You have a lot more freedom to move and shoot than any other rail shooter out there, as you can pan the camera 360 degrees to shoot things all around you. You can even move around bosses, literally, to the front, sides, and back, as you please. Add to all this the ability to change dragon forms between 3 different dragons, and a complex leveling system, and you have a crazy gem ****. There's absolutely loads of replay value here, too. Besides just trying to master the main game, you can unlock special scenarios and the original full Panzer Dragoon game that came out on the Sega Saturn. The only flaws the game has are just in figuring out how the heck to beat some of the bosses, but as this does add to the replay and challenge, it's really no big deal. With a beautiful shooter like Orta packaged with the original classic game, you have to give this game a high score. The effort they put forth is tremendous, and it shows.. Perfect Game. 10 fast levels, with a magnificent gameplay skill-based and a lot of tough boss battle. The graphic is awesome, expecially for the year of release, musics also are good. The background story is really interesting and it's a shame that Panzer Dragoon Saga, the ""prequel"", is so expensive to **** rare to buy. This game introduced me inside the ""Panzer Dragoon world"", Orta is probably one of my favourite game of all time. Hope that Sega (maybe with Nintendo?) one day will retake this series again... 10/10, brilliant, perfect, awesome.. This game was incredibly underrated. It's a shame not that many people got to experience this amazing game. It's kinda sad that a next generation version of this franchise hasn't been made yet.","panzer Dragoon Orta is an on-rails shooter with a very alien, ancient, and primal aesthetic . it takes a ton of skill and practice to complete the game even on normal mode . besides just trying to master the main game, you can unlock special scenarios and the original full panzer Dragoon game ."
319.Portal: Still Alive,"Portal: Still Alive A clever and enjoyable puzzle game that lives up to its reputation. The cake is indeed a lie.. Wasnt expecting Portal to hold up as well as everyone says it does, but this is genuinely a very fun time with some very well designed mechanics. This first entry does feel like a bit of a demo, with only the last chapter having any sort of challenge or interesting story beats, but its a very long chapter as well, and takes up what feels like 25 percent of the game compartively.. The main story is jam packed with exciting adventures and I definitely recommend this game for anyone who has an hour or two on their time to go through with this adventure.. LUCKILY… STILL ALIVE BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game was tested in the Still Alive version, 100% completed and the platinum trophy has been obtained. A WILD PORTAL APPEARS!: Portal, as a typical Valve title, features impeccable level design and attention to detail right from the start. From the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve; initially the player will find himself inside a closed cell as Chell, a young girl who has been hired to test some new Aperture Science technology. Apparently, the capsule in which Chell lingers would appear to have no way out, but after a few seconds, thanks to the appearance of a portal, the player will be free to begin testing the various chambers of the Aperture facility. From there on, the player will be faced with several tests, and when he or she has mastered the potential of the blue portal, he or she will also unlock the orange one, kicking off the full potential of the game. A NEW CUBY FRIEND: As can be inferred from the name of the game or the introduction of the reviews, it is all about using portals, mainly two, one blue and one orange. These portals do not have different characteristics, but are actually unlocked at different times so that the player can figure out how to use one at a time. Several other mechanics are present, which in the same way as the portals are explained right from the start, namely the use of cubes to press buttons; obviously it is very intuitive as a mechanic, but combined with the use of portals to reach tricky buttons makes it more fun and complicated. Other mechanics rely on dodging and destroying deadly turrets, or repelling energy orbs in order to activate passages. Plot-wise, the first chapter does not hold a candle to the second, with a rather simple story with few narrative twists. HEY, THAT’S ME!: Graphically Portal awakens perfectly to a game of its era; moreover, due to its simplicity the game becomes almost immortal. Obviously, the aesthetics of the logos and the use of colors are excellently done. HEARING THE RADIO: From an audio standpoint, there is not much to discuss; the use of sound effects to make clear the use of the various game objects and their interaction with the environment is excellent. ACHIEVEMENTS: The achievements in this title are fairly simple and quick to complete. The Still Alive version of Portal provides several extra levels to tackle and two challenges in the campaign that are rather tough, namely finishing the game without ever being hit by turrets and finishing it by going only through orange portals. The latter is an obvious nod to the Orange Box collection and provides a more thoughtful approach to the game's puzzles. BUT WHY 9? PROS - CONS: All in all, the original Portal does not have much to discuss; all the pros have already been mentioned in the parts above; of negative points, however, I personally struggle to find any, as it really is a near-perfect game. Small appreciable detail in both Portal is the Commentary mode, where the developers explain their approach in the making of this title, useful for young programmers or very curious gamers. RATING Gameplay: 10 Music: 7 Story: 8 Puzzles: 10 _. amazing game for logic with good company and good gameplay .. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 9 Music: 6 Story: 8 Total: 8.17. best puzzle game I ever played.solving puzzles with a portal gun is amazing,fantastic work from valve.. This is a really great puzzle game. I just wish it was longer / more replayable. After you beat it the first time, which you can do in a few days, there's not much left to do. Still great though.. Just Portal 2 but with less content, but it is still portal with its fun and challenging gameplay .. This is probably one of my favorite games of all times. And i love just coming back to it and quickly playing through it from time to time usually its worth it just to hear the song at the end. I cant recommend this title enough its charming, funny and has some real brain teasers .. This is one of the most well written and genuinely funny video games ever made. Not much I can say about Portal that hasn't already been said. You can complete it in a few hours so if for some reason you've never played it, go do it now, you have no excuse. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Portal: Still Alive is an overall great re-release of 2007's Portal. The original atmospheric, yet humorous campaign is still there for newcomers and veterans alike to enjoy, but the developers at Valve have added a heap of new challenge maps that will stretch your brain-cells as you desperately scramble to complete them. Overall, these new challenge maps add an hour or two to your playtime, extending the playtime, which is good, because the campaign is pretty short. All in all, I would recommend getting Still Alive rather than the regular version of Portal 1, because it boasts more content to play.. My other favorite game of the past 10..15 years. (The other is Braid.) I love this game. One of the best indie games ever released. Still replayable too.. An unconventional first person shooter/ puzzle game. It combines sharp thinking, atmosphere, and great humor and adventure. But the fun doesn't stop there! Portal bends your thinking skills after you complete the main game with the advanced bonus levels, and there's plenty of achievements to work for as well. A great, spectacular, must play valve game! And if you want more portal fun, play the sequel!. Portal Charming and Challenging Portal is easily one of the most charming games ive played period As you make your way through the game solving increasingly difficult puzzles, your progress is being monitored by an unknown character that will effortlessly make you laugh, Playing portal just to hear the commentary is worth the journey through the game alone, but the good news is, the game is just as good. Portal starts you off slow with one portal gun , you use this portal to hop gaps and move objects, youll eventually get to a point where youre given 2 portal guns which at first feels a bit easier as you feel more free, the only problem is by time this happens, you are already halfway through the game. You use one portal to makes an exit, and the other for that exits entrance The 2nd half of portal is where puzzles can get a bit tricky and no longer feel all too intuitive, It may just be me not used to having to use my brain all too often to play games, but I found the difficulty spike to be just a tad bit too intense. The complexity of the levels go too slow in the beginning and too fast at the end making the game feel kind of frustrating, I didn’t really feel clever when I got through levels, it was more guess work, I felt kind of lucky. While you may lose some hair over figuring out the perfect way to drop boxes from the ceiling, avoiding lasers, and getting over obstacles, youll feel great going through the gate onto the next floor. The feeling of guess work isn’t satisfying, but somehow portal still manages to pull you forward always wanting more., but while I say that I felt like portal gave me just enough. Portal will only last you about 3-5 hours, and as a puzzle game of its kind I found this length to be pretty perfect. The game kept pulling me forward with its charm, but I wont lie and say I wasn’t fully satisfied when this brain exercise was over. For what it is Puzzle Platformer 8.5/10 Overall 8/10. The developer commentary featured in the ""Still Alive"" XBLA version of Portal is incredibly insightful. Well aware that they had created a completely new animal, the first-person puzzle platformer, the guys and girls at Valve explain how each of the 19 puzzle chambers was carefully engineered to gradually ""train"" the player and equip them with the necessary skills to tackle the increasingly more complex challenges. Some levels were modified, some cut completely, and additional ones added based on the responses of the playtesters. There's no filler, everything is there for a reason. It really illustrates how impressive the game is - not only refreshingly original, but also constructed to perfection. Portal is short. It can be completed in a couple of hours, but it houses more new ideas and memorable moments than most other titles ten times its duration, and that's really what matters. The escape sequence at the end, which all that training has been leading up to, is the highlight, and means that the game is one of very few which continuously builds up all the way through and peaks at its conclusion. The characters are also excellent - the menacing GLaDOS and her chilling dialogue, and player character Chell for the exact opposite reason - because she is silent and almost invisible, giving the player a real personal connection to the villain. The sequel, released four years later, was also spectacular, but the first game left a much greater impression on me. Portal 2, while possibly the funniest game I have ever played - largely thanks to Stephen Merchant's portrayal of Wheatley, was understandably an evolution of the first game. It contained some nice innovations and furthered the physics-based puzzling with a handful of new obstacles, but the exploration sections of chapter 6 just dragged far too much for my liking. The success of Portal meant that the budget and scope for the sequel was much greater, and it ended up not quite being as concise and perfectly-formed as the first game, which was perhaps to be expected. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic effort. Playing through Portal felt like returning to the early days of videogaming, when everything was new and every game needed to be learned from scratch. A first-person game which didn't involve killing bad guys by shooting at them? Who would have thought? (Shooting a portal onto the floor underneath a turret doesn't count.). A good puzzle shooter that will keep you entertained for a few hours. ""Only a few hours"" you may say and yes. This game is really short, but it got replay value so no worry. But the average time to beat the story will be 2 hours or less. There are also some Challenge Maps that you can do after beating the story, but this will most likely stretch the playtime to about 6hours. This is just the only negative thing about this game, the rest of the game is nearly perfect. It's fun, challenging and it's also having a great humor. Buy it. I have finished portal a hour ago, waw great experience, one of the best puzzle games ever, brain breaking tests for the thinking gamer, great black humor history, and the big motivation to get the cake, i still want to taste it.... Every once and a while a game comes along and takes everyone by surprise with its quality, Portal is one such game. Originally ported to the Xbox as part of Half Life 2: Orange Box collection its clever physics based puzzles and strange sense of humour was like nothing that had ever been seen before. Whether you like puzzlers or not Portal is a game that everyone should experience.. I never got the Orange Box (nor do I want to) so I was glad when this was released on XBLA as it was the only title I was interested in. Portal is just a truly great, funny, imaginative and unique game that really does add something fresh to the gaming market. I get that it was never intended as a full release, but the only critique I have of the game is that it is far too short and it leaves you craving more. Overall: A must buy, regardless of your preference in gaming.. AS someone who wasn't going to waste money on the orange box for a single game, this title game is wonderful for those who just want Portal. The extra maps are nice and unlike the achievements in the Orange box, these ones are actually possible to obtain by human beings.. Original good concept, but not much meat to it. Single player can be completed in one hour.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Portal is meant to play only by genius people. People that complained about this is because they cannot handle the puzzles. Never in my entire life thought about some company to put the FPS genre and fuse it with( as already said) puzzle genre. The graphics looks good and bad, but thats not necessary. The controls are great and the puzzles itself are bizarre.. When I played this the first time, I stayed up all night with my nephew and his foreign exchange girlfriend until we beat it. It transcended the language barrier. It was like nothing we had played before. It was clever, mind blowing, funny, challenging, innovative...just an absolute blast and completely engrossing. There wasn't much reason to play through again, and it only lasted one night (about 6-8hrs) but I will never forget the way it made a portal in my brain when I first stepped through one, saw myself, and went...""Whoa!"".. Portal is a great concept, brilliantly executed. Wonderful, intuitive puzzle design, a great visual aesthetic, and some of the funniest dark humor narration you could want. Short but there's not a bad moment to be found and this version of the game comes with a whole new challenge mode where you complete short puzzles under strict time limits to earn medals...this encourages some really creative portaling!. This is one of my all time favorite games, funny lines, puzzles that look hard until you remember you have a portal gun, greatist thing since sliced bread deserved a full release and a sequal","the game was tested in the Still Alive version, 100% completed and the platinum trophy has been obtained . from the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve . the main story is jam packed with exciting adventures ."
32.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty,"One of My top 10 favourite games.Everybody who played this game in early 2000's was blown away by this game.️. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolute masterpiece, loved all the boss fights and Rex is badass, what is not to like?. Arcydzieło gatunku, gier. Opus Magnum Kojima-san. Best meta-narrative ever made of gaming industry.. A brain-breaking, subversive masterpiece. Completely changed my perception of what gaming could be.. Released in 2001, Metal Gear Solid 2 came for the PS2 as a direct sequel to the last release of the franchise, Metal Gear Solid. The game this time around has 2 main storylines, The Tanker Incident, which happens just 2 years after Shadow Moses from the first game, and The Big Shell Incident, which happens 4 years after Shadow Moses. In the Tanker, the player controls Solid Snake once again, this time with the objective of photographing a new metal gear being developed by the US Marine. Although it is relatively short, this first story line serves as a ""tutorial” for the new mechanics that mgs 2 introduces to the franchise. Not only that, but despite the Tanker's story being quite short, it helps us understand what happened to Snake and Otacon after Shadow Moses, further developing their relationship which proves to be very important later in the game. The second storyline however, has you playing as Raiden a supposed FOXHOUND agent who we learn was trained entirely by VR missions that replicated the Shadow Moses incident. Although this came as a surprise to many players who were expecting snake to be the main character, we slowly learn to like Raiden and accept him as the protagonist as we learn more about his background. Aside from the new protagonist, MGS2 also introduces various new mechanics, due to the less limited hardware offered by the PS2, that greatly enhance the stealth experience of the game by giving the player several new ways to approach a situation such as holding up an enemy, hiding bodies, and more. The only thing that slightly bothers me in this game are the dialogues. Not only are they very excessive in this game, but they sometimes may be a little bit goofy and unnecessary, especially the dialogues with Rose, which sound extremely out of tone, given that Raiden should be in an important mission. Nonetheless, Metal Gear Solid 2 is still a masterpiece considered by many to be one of if not the greatest Metal Gear game and will be remembered in years to come, as it not only was a game changer to the Metal Gear franchise, but also to the gaming industry, as it expanded the possibilities for stealth games in a way that no other game had done before.. a life changing experience in the shape of a revolutionary videogame. Only the best pieces of art have this power, and metal gears solid 2 delivers it even when, purposely, it doesn't work.. Wow, left me speechless, and maybe a bit confused. MGS2 is a spectacular sequel from MGS2. Gameplay wise it did not change much, has some QOL improvements and first person shooting which makes stealth and inmersion better. For 2024 its fine on this aspect, completely tolerable and even enjoyable but not among the best. It has room for experimentation although it was a bit disappointing coming from MGS1. Bosses are decent and the overall design of the maps were good. Now story its on another level, incredibly good ideas for its time, memorable characters and a very solid acting and VA. The plot and its twists are incredible but i would say that all of this picks up mainly in the second half of the game, leaving a first half somewhat dissapointing and generic, but its thanks to this that achieves such impact. I dont want to say a lot about the story other than its incredible but i will remark that there were flaws and if you missed one concept or got distracted for a second you might not understand anything at all. Codec or nanomachines were a good way to cut costs without it being as bad as tapes and be enjoyable. Its really good overall but it demands full undivided attention for you to not get lost.. A game ahead of it's time, truly. Narratively, it's just pure prophetic meta political mind-bending madness.. Anytime I play a Metal Gear Solid game my mind gets blown more every time. The stories are always out of this world with mechanics and features that shouldn't even exist on the ps2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Don't fall for the bait that diehard Metal Gear 1 fans say about this game. It truly is a work of art and a masterpiece by Kojima. From top to bottom this game is packed with impressive ""tactical espionage action"". A must play for any fan of video games.. Definitely a masterpiece, i liked this game more than the first one (mgs1 is really good of course but this one is better for me) mainly because i like the controls here more than the first one, the story is beatiful and the gameplay is really fun, this game is also full of fun little details that they didnt have to add but they did, showing how they really cared about this series. This game is super fun and I think a really good successor to MGS1. Raiden is a really fun character and the existential themes of the story are super intriguing. I enjoy the gameplay despite not being a big fan of shooters, and the aesthetics are absolutely gorgeous even with PS2 graphics.. So, when I finally beat MGS1 and got to this game I was legitimately curious how my feelings for it would be. The only thing I knew about this game is the fact you play as a new character for most of the game instead of the one we truly wanted to play as. But once I got to this game, I loved it even more than the first game in every way. The gameplay mechanics were so much better and made my experience through the game much more enjoyable than the first. The graphics look incredible for a PS2 game and hold up exceptionally well to this day in my opinion. The story is such **** and legitimately insane, but I still love it for that reason. And, man, it's eerie how Kojima was able to predict the way society today would become with the advancement of technology and the introduction of the internet. In regards to Raiden, I believe he was way too overhated, I personally think he's a great character and a good videogame protagonist. While I too would've loved to play as Snake the entire time, Raiden still adds a lot to the story by being a different character. With all the technological advancements provided by the upgrade to PS2 software, you can really see Kojima and his team pushing the boundaries of gaming once again. Also, that last third of the game is one of the most unforgettable experiences while playing a game I ever went through, it's honestly worth playing on that moment alone. So, if you have already played the first game, I highly recommend playing through this fantastic game, especially if you love Metal Gear.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever.Thaisgame combines a imersive gameplay and an envolving story. Metal Gear solid 2 is a prediction of our future 20 years in the past. Kojima is a pure genius Timeless Masterpiece. Aside from the over-abundance of nonsensical movies and com-link chatter, there is a really decent game hidden on this DVD. The freedom to explore and ultimately play this game as you see fit within the confines of the parameters of the script is a great feature that offers excellent replay potential.. This game does not beat snake eater, but it sure is a masterpiece in its own right, I loved the story although it was confusing, and the gameplay is good, nevertheless it is a true gem of the metal gear series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I tried so many times to play this. I cannot. Garbage controls. Garbage music. Chaotic level design. Nothing of interest happens. MGS was a great game That I enjoy replaying except for the part right after Metal Gear. Snake Eater was amazing too. This one is truly unplayable for me.. The best game in the history of RPGs forever, with legendary music and a great director. MGS 2 is perhaps the most memorable PS2 game I ever played. It's a masterpiece that surpasses the first MGS in both story and scope. This is an intriguing, twist-filled sci-fi tale with statements on technology and war-torn governments. It's brilliant. In terms of the gameplay, it expanded upon the original and pushed the console's technology to its limit. Overall, ""Sons of Liberty"" is a highly inventive, humorous and entertaining ride. It's easily a 10 out of 10.. The first chapter/mission is close to perfection, the second one ehhhhhh, its not Raiden hes fine, but the bosses.... The atmosphere is the same everywhere, its just a building, every room looks the same, most NEW characters **** too. Its not horrible, it could have been better... Good game.. This game is very very very big trolling by Hideo Kojima, but this game classic and I love that crap). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is perfect. Improving upon the combat of the first game, and adding a brilliant story that delves into topics rarely seen in video gaming, Sons of Liberty is a technical achievement and a fantastic game to this very day.. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I really enjoyed my time with it, and if you haven't played it, you should. It is a sequel though so you'd have to know what happened before it, but it doesn't affect the story too much, mainly just references to Solid 1.. 'Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty' breathes into the MGS series maturity of medium, and fear-inspiring recency. What felt less personal then, feels a lot closer now.. Best game of all times!. FUTURE FROM THE PAST BEFORE WE BEGIN: MGS 2: Sons of Liberty is a video game produced by Konami and directed by Hideo Kojima. It was originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and then remastered the following year with an alternate title, MGS 2: Substance. The title was also completed for the Xbox 360 in the HD Collection. WET SNAKE: This chapter of the Saga begins by boasting fantastic direction right from the first few seconds, as Kojima started testing in the first installment. After just a few hours of watching the first in-game cutscene, we will finally take control of the great soldier Solid Snake in all his glory. We find ourselves aboard a mysterious naval ship suspected to house a new prototype of Metal Gear. Our task is to infiltrate the ship to uncover more about the matter, discovering various familiar faces and new, extremely well-characterized characters along the way. The quality and attention to detail in the game are immediately notable. THE NEEDLE IN THE DETAILS: The gameplay in this title is both complex and detailed, as well as simple and limited, depending on the selected difficulty level. Many basic stealth mechanics from the predecessor have been retained, such as stun guns, first-person aiming with weapons, and basic actions like using items or hiding in various spots. The noticeable differences lie in the intelligence of the enemies, who exhibit realistic patterns and interactions, from calling for reinforcements if they suspect something to engaging in banter with other guards. Countless other details can be discovered as you progress in the story, some of which are very secretive and subtle. Some game areas can be explored in different ways with alternative approaches, utilizing secret areas and acquired items. Moreover, a significant portion of the game features different movements, which I won't spoil. The bosses, while limited in number, are extremely well-structured and offer various approaches and secrets to defeat them. Finally, the codec serves as an endless source of story and assistance for the various puzzles throughout the game, which are scattered throughout the campaign to keep the player engaged. THE SEA IS MOVING: Aesthetically, this game was at the forefront of the PlayStation 2 (until its sequel). This is because it had a substantial budget and development time, as well as a new facial animation system that made characters expressive and clean. The environments, thanks to the console's technical advancements, were made much more complete, detailed, and immersive. Unfortunately, the backgrounds may appear sparse but are never a real hindrance to gameplay. The aesthetic care given to certain posters, walls, clothing, and in-game objects has made it an immortal gem, still enjoyable in modern times. !: The audio department, while simple, follows the same standard as the other aspects of the game, featuring music appropriate to the gameplay situations and accurate sound effects. Furthermore, the limited voice acting available in a few languages allowed the voice actors to give their best, resulting in several iconic voices in the world of video games. BUT WHY A 9? PROS: It's extremely difficult to talk about the immense strengths this game offers without giving away spoilers, but I'll try. This is one of the very few titles that manages to bring together all media to their maximum potential, not just in gaming. This is because Kojima, that genius, managed to develop a terrifying meta-narrative that is still remembered to this day. Furthermore, the perfect characterization of certain characters is astounding and makes one wonder why there are still titles that cannot replicate it, even to a fraction. The dialogue of certain characters is so well-written that it made me, in first person, ponder how realistic they are. The character design, music, story, together form a unique and unforgettable experience. Without giving away spoilers, thanks to this title, Kojima managed not only to critique the society of its time but also the current one, predicting a detailed future nearly 20 years ago. CONS: Incredibly, what doesn't work in this game is what Kojima did not oversee and what resulted from fan complaints, which were somewhat misguided. I'm referring to the ""Snake Tales,"" which are essentially a reproduction of the entire campaign, played only as regular Snake, without voice acting, animated scenes, and with extremely annoying walls of text to read. To make matters worse, these are at the highest difficulty level, and without the exploration possibilities of the base game, it quickly becomes a nightmare. Additionally, the VR missions are excessively exaggerated, with a completion time of about 20 hours for missions repeated more than six times. RATINGS Gameplay: 9 Music: 8 Story: 10 _. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty is personally my favorite chapter of the series, even admitting that Snake Eater was the pinnacle of the series nothing can make me stop thinking about how much this game was ahead of its time both on the technical side that from the depth of the plot, it is true that there are problems with the balance between Gameplay and Cutscene, but honestly after a while you get used to it in my opinion. Must Play.. Probably my least favorite game in the Metal Gear Solid series, although that doesn't mean this is a bad game at all. I still think the story is pretty great. The graphics and gameplay are also a big step up from Metal Gear Solid. The core game mechanics are essentially the same, but plays out a lot smoother and more optimized.. It was a blast back then and holds up very well today. As far as computer games go, this is the Bee's knees.. MGS2 set a gaming standard for its generation, offering exceptional stealth-action gameplay, challenging bosses, and immersive storytelling. Its enduring quality, subversive narrative, and thematic depth make it a timeless classic.. Game of all time. Play it or else. I remember playing this game when I was back in high school it brings back great memories such a great game. It set the gold standard for games of its generation. MGS2 provides the best stealth-action gameplay to date. Many creative tools littered throughout a dense sandbox of enemies. Some of the more challenging bosses in the series, each with a unique spin. Every little detail in this game brings the environment and characters to life, without compromising on the fun. It never gets old. Amazing acting and unapologetically 'gamey' writing. Being aware of playing this game heightens the immersion. This allows for interesting ideas and themes, including humanity's interaction with information, and the self-insertion of the audience into a piece of fiction. A first playthrough may suffer a little from the dual-introduction and some wordy explanations. However, the gameplay and presentation is polished and shows no sign of wear 20 years later. This game reminds me that video games are fun. Endless replay value, subversive and unpredictable narrative, top notch presentation.. Playing this game is a core memory from my childhood. It probably shaped my personality in ways i cannot even comprehend.. One of, if not, the best (story-based) game in the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 2 is phenomenal at game play and story telling. In my honest opinion, it stands up to games we have today in every aspect. The game has so many twists and can be so enjoyable even if its a cutscene or a codec call. Though I will slightly spoil the game, you do not play as Solid Snake through a lot of this game. The graphics are on par with amazing games like Half-Life and Skyrim (maybe stretching it there). Absolutely deserves the Rewards and Must-Play status.. Besides RE 4, this is the most memorable PS2 game. Cool characters in an amazing story. Overall rating: 9.5.. Potentially the greatest game of all time. Graphics are great for a game released in 2001, the story is incredibly deep and complex yet has aged like a fine wine, the controls are a bit weird but work really well once you have the hang of them and the gameplay itself is stealth at its arguable finest. This was the most detailed game of all time till red dead 2 came out. The characters are great and the enemy AI is insanely smart, especially for 2001 standards. Not to mention the would you kindly level plot twist that is more relevant today than ever. Do yourself a favor and play the original metal gear solid, then Metal Gear Solid 2, 3, 4 the peace walker and 5. You won't regret it.. Even better than its predecessor, this is the ultimate MGS experience. Hideo Kojima at the top of his game. A cult game that you should not miss.. Although I like the first game more, this game is just as good. First of all, the graphics are very good. The atmosphere on board is very good. The characters are still good. Although the level design is a bit repetitive as in the first game, the game progresses in various ways. Jack reminded me of Stave in resident evil code veronica. They have a somewhat clumsy demeanor. And his voiceover is a little funny. I would like to play snake a little more. Well.. that's how they preferred it. Combat is fun. Weapons are diverse. The story has plenty of twists. And the storytelling and the ending satisfied me. The music at the end is very nice. As I said, Kojima wanted to make a game like a movie. Lots of dialogue and cut scane. I think it's a nice combination. You feel like the game is playing with you, not as if you are playing a game. A good sequel. I recommend.. This is simply one the greatest games anyone could play in their lifes, easily the greatest script written by Kojima and by far the bravest one. The importance **** that, without spoilers, takes the scariest step possible after the massive success that its prequel was, is without a doubt remarkable. Kojima could have made another Snake adventure and write the tale of the hero everyone wanted to see, but he taught us all to look beyond, to see that stories aren't made just to be cool and epic, but also to spread the ideas that could shape better future generations. Not to mention the amazing step it was in terms of gameplay and unique details that no other game could offer at the moment. Always grateful to one of the most amazing pieces of art that videogames have ever given.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One the best games on the ps2. Everything about it it’s just perfect. The story might be a bit confusing for a newcomer but still I think it’s great. Highly recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. my favorite game of all time the gameplay is great the story is my favorite story in gaming. Never understood the Kojima fandom. The first Metal Gear Solid was good. But somewhere during the making, or between MGS and this one, he must have fallen and slipped, or eaten tons of shrooms. His games has since then been goofy as heck. Weird story plots, over the top and comical, downright hilarious villains. (This one has a vampire special soldier.. LOL right?) Twists you giggle at and lots of non-sense. Ever since MGS his games have been downright weird. All the way up to that DHL Simulator. This game though is just a slog to play trough. Controls are the same, gameplay likewise. But the most annoying part is the endless loooong cutscenes and the codec going off every 2 min with equally looooong conversations.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still holds up so well. Even being a 20 year old game, it still has features that can surprise many. A perfect video game in every way. Top tier writing, gameplay is an improvement on the original in every way and feels silky smooth, incredible stealth mechanics that are revolutionary to this day, and beautiful graphics for 2001 standards (and still look good to this day.). Warning: Spoilers This game is a masterpiece to the first game that was also a masterpiece. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty features more stealth moves like hanging off railings, first person view mode which is useful for aiming your weapons and hiding in lockers, it also has some of the best cut scenes ever, they're just like watching a film and the music score is the best and is like a movie music score. The main theme music in MGS 2 is my favourite score. The Tanker level lets you play as Snake and is the Prolouge to the main mission that features a new hero named Raiden that you will play as in the Big Shell mission, this doesn't mean Snake isn't in it after the Tanker because he is using a false code name called Plisken (Homage to Snake Plissken in Escape from New York) but later he reveals to Raiden he is Solid Snake. The Big Shell mission is set two years after the Tanker incident where Metal Gear Ray was being made, the oil has spilt into the sea and a huge clean up facility called Big Shell has been created around it. Raiden (At first using the codename Snake) enters the facility when he gets a call off Colonel Campbell saying his codename has been changed to Raiden, his objectives are to infiltrate the Big Shell and rescue the President, Raiden then discovers that his girlfriend Rose is on this mission as the Data annalist. Once in the elevator Raiden is told that the group that has took over Big Shell are called the Sons of Liberty and the leader of it all is the legendary soldier Solid Snake but it can't be THE Solid Snake because he was killed in the Tanker two years ago. This is the reason why Raiden's codename was changed from Snake to Raiden. Of course neither is true because Snake is disguised as a navy seal with the name Plisken so the leader is someone using Snake's codename, it also seems a group called Dead Cell (Similar to Special Forces FOXHOUND) are in Big Shell, they all have their own skills, Vamp has the skills to dodge bullets and run on water with quick speed while also drinking blood like a Vampire, Fortune has the power to reflect any projectile fired at her and Fatman has the the skill to create bombs. Also their is another Cyborg Ninja that is in Big Shell and is using the codename of Mr. X. Ocelot is also in Big Shell working with the leader of the Sons of Liberty, the leader is Solidus Snake one of the clones from Big Boss and is Solid Snake's brother. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is a great game with a superb plot that is full of twists. This is a game that should be played. 10/10. Literally no need to explain why I'm rating this game a 10. The story itself is better than most of the TV shows I've watched. Everytime i play mgs2 i enjoy playing the tanker chapter the rainy weather and the ship goes together really well and of course the big shell in the plant chapter playing as raiden with snake support and drones flying around patrolling and hearing the seagulls flying what a great moment in these two locations, gameplay is the best part of any mgs title everything works out well, the last fight and ending was a bit simple. On of the best games of the ps2. It really has a great acmpaing with amazing gameplay details that carry and affect the whole playthough. It's also incredibly tense, the music makes you feel you can be discovered at any time too. And the story is at the same time the best and worst part bout this game too. On one hand, it's a great tale of how the media and goverments control what and how we think which is showed through gameplay, but at the same time it can feel sort of overcomplicated for no reason at all. Even then I would recommend this to everyone.. Incredibly important political plot branches from fiction to non-fiction. With all it's wacky stuff it has, it is the equivalent of hiring an artist to draw a picture of what they think the world will look like 20 years in the future. PS: Wikipedia's page says ""GamesRadar+ has cited the prescience of the game in relation to the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal (""Truth"") and the fictional ""Russian interference"" in the 2016 United States elections."" (The latter was proven false and was falsified by Hillary Clinton for a political agenda that is rich in xenophobia, russophobia & cold war II/world war III rhetoric. - Proven in late 2020). This is easily the most ahead PS2 game of it's time, a mindblowing experience for 2001 standards. Probably the most advanced-to-the-era game ever.. Awesome game! There are simply no words to describe the admiration for this game. The game allows you to empathize with the heroes and hate some at the same time. The breaks of the fourth wall are generally a head dump. I wish every person to play and enjoy this masterpiece from Hideo Kojima!. konami action game with good story plot and more , with Japanese humour , guns and playtime of around 16 hours , it shows good render and good design for detail , its worth to play even on the ps4. Ahead of it’s time as usuall when it’s Metal gear, the graphics, soundtrack and cinamatics but most importantly the small details + revoultionary moments and dialog in this nearly masterpiece, only nearly cuz of the protaginist Raiden, you can’t replace Solid Snake especially with a femboy + the antagonists a huge downgrade to those in MGS 1. one of the best games ever made, amazing storytelling, graphics, & top of the line voice actors. my favorite game of all time.. Forever in my heart. I finish this game at least 3 times every year since 2007. I fell in love with the characters, the story, the game play. Just the best game of all time for me.. Even after 20 years since MGS 2 release it still can impress such cynical zoomer as me. Despite my contempt to anime, main plot turned out to be pretty captivating and intriguing, a bit ridiculous yeah, but nevertheless still essential to these days, thanks to prophetic ideas and concepts laid down in it. Gameplay abounds in details, several are so bizarre i wonder how could anyone come up with them. Level design sets the quality bar for years to come — sandbox-type closed stealth arenas with vigilant guards and lots of kinds of interaction with environment. A huge step forward from more arcade MGS 1 . Graphics is top notch for those times, all the small visual details such as realtime melting ice cubes, steam from the mouth, flies revolving around light sources and etc., appear not so often in videogames even nowadays. Besides, all OSTs are extremely beautiful and atmospheric . Even that standing out jazzy RnB song in the end credits was something. 9/10. When I played this as a teenager, I actually thought it was the best game i'd ever played. Now 20 years later, as an adult its flat out ludicrous. The plot of the game seemed really thick and intriguing, but now it comes off as a bad conspiracy theory meant only to rope you in to the next video (think Alex Jones) or in this case the next game. Now I realize that the writer/creator Hideo Kojima put this plot twists just to play with you. Speaking of the plot, it mostly deals with dated Cold War politics and deals out generic corporate/ military jargon, and it all adds up to a giant agile robot that supposedly shoots nuclear missiles. But can be destroyed by a single guy with a rocket launcher. This aspect has especially aged poorly since a nuclear launch may very well be launched from smartphone tech. To be fair the giant robot thing is steeped in Japanese culture, especially in old films, but putting it in a spy game just doesn't seem to work well. The controls are terrible and I can partly attribute that to the terrible broken X-Box controller with its dead spot analog sticks. You'll end up hitting the wrong button and fall to your death, and have to do a section of the game totally over. The game introduces poor characters, then has no problem disposing of them quickly. Its supposed to be emotional, but after playing MGS1, MGS2 and MGS4 you realize that its a way to do the same thing over and over again. The gameplay takes a backseat to endless exposition and codec dialog that feels like it never ends (hence endless). Believe me it goes on and on and on. Then there is the midsection of the game where you hold E.E by the hand and escort her while trying to be stealthy Introducing the ""stealth"" mechanics part of this game: After playing for a while, you start to realize that the enemies wander in a ridiculously simple repetitive pattern making getting around them very easy you just have to wait for the right moment. BUT WAIT DERS MORE. Actually its easier to just tranque them and cheese it, by leaving the section and returning. If you don't, there are points in the game where you'll by instantly spotted by enemies because its so unclear where thy are. Yes a lot of places are well done but some are so poor its worth mentioning. I know i complained a lot here, but there is some fun to be had so its not all a lost cause.. The game provides classic infiltration game experience with amazing story provoking philosophical thinkings.. I will never forget my first playthrough, words cannot convey why this game is a masterpiece. MGS 2 can be considered an improved version of MGS 1, this masterpiece made MGS 1 faster and more comfortable (let's be honest, in many PS1 games the control ****).. this game is the worst evar!!, there is no first person cardboard boxing. kojima was mad because of this review.... This is the game that blew my mind back in the day, and i was so much in the story. You play as Raiden(mostly) and not Snake in the game, but that does not play the game any worse. I enjoyed all of it, and the style of movie that Kojima makes in this game, left me speechless. I loved this game, 10/10 without a doubt. One of the best games ever made in my book. It improves on a lot of things from MGS 1, but it's unnecessarily difficult at times and that ruined the fun for me.. Right now it is a really old game and The control is really bad and clumbsy but if you want to enjoy a good story game with som nice sneaking action, I would highly recomend this. At the time (2001), there wasn't any game out there that could challange the graphics. The humor is also fun, if you are a person who don't get offended easy.. I recomend Play MGS3, MG, MG2, MGS1 before this one, to me this is the best of the whole saga, raiden is a good protagonist, not better than Snake or Big Boss, but he get's the job done. Wit","metal gear solid 2 is a direct sequel to the last release of the metal gear solid franchise . the game has 2 main storylines, The Tanker Incident and The Big Shell Incident . the dialogues are excessive and may be a little bit goofy and unnecessary ."
320.Half-Life 2: Episode Two,"This game is the sequel to episode 1 of half life. It's simply incredible, the story, the ending, the gameplay (no wonder). There's not much new, despite a new enemy, but otherwise the extension is superb !!!!. one of the best games I’ve ever played, among so many others, truly stood out to me. It's captivating mechanics and the engaging story drew me in. It’s amazing how a game can create such a memorable experience!. Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 6/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 8/10. Half-Life 2: Episode Two is similarly to Episode 1 the further continuation of Half-Life's story. Episode 2 is superior to Episode 1 in almost every way. The story not only picks up pace, but also gets a lot more exciting with a clear goal in mind. This game has a lot more creative objectives. It genuinely features a lot more creativity in general. There are a lot of new enemies, new surroundings, like the mine, cave and the forest. From the beginning of the game you have a clear goal, and i think the game really drew a huge benefit from this. There is again a vehicle sequence in this game, but you can clearly feel that the developers learned from their earlier vehicle levels because this time it just feels much better. Your car receives meaningful upgrades and it just doesn't feel like driving down a boring piece of road anymore.There are more creative maps, like the aforementioned mine, or taking down the autoguns in the junkyard. I really liked the last battle, in which you had to use the Magnusson Device to take out the striders. It felt great because it was truly exciting and made me feel anxious at times. Making the player feel a particular emotion is great, especially in a setting like this.I only would have wished that they implemented perhaps a handful of new weapons. The game would have benefited greatly from more weapons, because those are still the same old weapons from Half-Life 2.I don't have much more to say here. Half-Life 2: Episode Two is Half-Life at its peak, and if you are thinking about picking this one up you have likely also played or plan on playing Episode 1. I advise you to go for it.Final Score: 10/10. This game sticks to its crazy action feeling and good story to the end with the only iffy part being its finale with the player just running around a bunch. But its best part is its ending which sets up so much for a future we'll never see. The best of the 3 parts. This game felt good to play and extremely varied. There were multiple intense set pieces that were way over the top. Your allies were much more likable than E1. The story moved forward quite a bit in this one. The environments were extremely varied. Walking away, it left me wanting more.. Great ending to the series, cool final fight, great cutscenes, excellent npc characters. The ending will make you wonder what happened next in this master piece.. A masterpiece that everyone should have played. I would also like to take this opportunity to wish Gnome Chompski good luck on his new adventures. Maybe I'll see you soon in Half-Life: Alyx ;-). Half Life 2: Episode Two is one of the most anticipated installments in the Half Life series of games, which brings a continuation of the exciting story and enhanced by impressive graphics. Full action and a story that reveals in more detail the main events make the game attractive to all fans of the genre.However, despite all its merits, Episode Two is merely an expansion of the story and does not offer revolutionary innovations compared to the previous installments of the game. Some aspects of the gameplay also remain unchanged, which can cause the setting to feel like a set-piece, making the player tire of the repetitive **** graphics and atmosphere of Episode Two are impeccable, from the very beginning of the game you will be surrounded by the atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world and the madness that characterizes all games in the Half Life series. However, the combat system and difficulty levels are on the same level - this may be a disappointment for those who were expecting more options to progress through the game.Episode Two's story is interesting and engaging, however, episodes in the middle of the game can sometimes lose their emotional power for a moment, which can create some fragmentation in the game's tight narrative. Many players also note the relatively short length of the game, which can lead to Gefühl that wasted money on brief enjoyment.Overall, Half Life 2: Episode Two is an exceptional game that continues the legacy of the series and strongly entices with its compelling story and gorgeous graphics. However, the lack of revolutionary innovations in the game, a few repetitive scenarios and some flaws in the gameplay reduce the overall rating of the game to a 7 out of 10. Recommended for fans of the series and those who want to know the continuation of the story, but don't expect a complete 180 degree flip in game mechanics.. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, a game that pushes boundaries. Over the course of its 5-hour story, players are treated to some of the most incredible game design - from superb graphics to a thoughtful, engaging story. However, as has been mentioned in other reviews, this game has a cliffhanger that is yet to be resolved, and the only flaw in Valve's thinking is that the ending to HL2 seems rushed and still awaiting resolution.. Episode Two's immersive world, dynamic characters, and heart-pumping action create an unforgettable gaming experience.. Half-Life 2: Episode Two, released in 2007, delivers another compelling chapter in the Half-Life saga, seamlessly continuing the story from Episode One. This episodic installment maintains the series' high standards of storytelling, gameplay innovation, and atmospheric immersion while leaving players eagerly anticipating the next episode. The game picks up immediately after the events of Episode One, with Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance still on their journey to deliver critical information to the resistance. Episode Two takes players through a variety of environments, from the forests of the Outlands to the dark and mysterious underground tunnels. The narrative continues to deepen, with revelations about the nature of the Combine threat and the role of the enigmatic G-Man. As with its predecessors, Episode Two excels in delivering a richly immersive world. The level design is superb, providing a mix of exploration, physics-based puzzles, and intense combat encounters. The environments are beautifully detailed, adding to the sense of a post-apocalyptic world that feels both eerie and authentic. One of the standout features of Episode Two is its character development. Alyx Vance continues to be a central and endearing character, and her interactions with Gordon and other NPCs add depth to the story. The emotional moments between characters contribute to player investment in the narrative. The gameplay in Episode Two maintains the series' reputation for innovation and intensity. The Gravity Gun remains a versatile tool, and the addition of new enemy types and weapons keeps combat fresh and engaging. The game also introduces vehicular sequences, providing a change of pace and adding to the sense of scale. The pacing in Episode Two is impeccable, with moments of action, suspense, and storytelling blended seamlessly. The game also includes optional exploration elements, encouraging players to seek out hidden caches and easter eggs, adding replay value. The Source engine continues to impress with its visual and audio fidelity. While not groundbreaking by contemporary standards, the game's graphics and sound design contribute to the immersive atmosphere. The voice acting is top-notch, enhancing character development and storytelling. However, Episode Two's biggest drawback is its cliffhanger ending, which leaves players hungry for more and, unfortunately, awaiting a continuation that has yet to materialize. The lack of closure can be frustrating, as fans have been eagerly awaiting the resolution of the story for many years. In conclusion, Half-Life 2: Episode Two is a brilliant continuation of the Half-Life 2 narrative. Its superb storytelling, character development, innovative gameplay, and immersive world-building make it a must-play for fans of the series. While the cliffhanger ending is a source of frustration, it doesn't diminish the quality of the experience.. A near perfect experience from start to end, improving on all problems that appeared in previous Half-Life games. Shame the series never got completed.. The overall package of this addon is pretty good, Valve quality from beginning to end. No experiments, nothing too fancy, valve just kept on telling their story further and delivered more of what has already proven as very good. Valve at is peak. Episode Two is not only the highest point for the franchise, but also one of the highest points in FPS history. A great game that, unfortunatly, did not receive the sequel it deserves yet.. Excellent dlc for most ambitious game from the past. Thanks Valve for my childhood. This one is amazing while episode 2 is rubbish! This one is pure action and adventure with few mediocre dialogues. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Perfect, totally wrecks me that this is the last half life 2 chronologically speaking.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Episode Two's immersive world, dynamic characters, and heart-pumping action create an unforgettable gaming experience.. His drawing is beautiful. It motivates people to constantly look ahead. Dialogues are very entertaining. I hope we can end our **** life with 'Episode 3'.. THE WAR THAT WILL NEVER END BEFORE WE BEGIN: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is the second installment of a trilogy that was never finished. Developed by Valve in 2007. THE TRAIL WILL BE LATE: Half-Life 2: Episode Two, unlike its predecessors, begins by immediately relinquishing control of the celebrated Gordon Freeman to the player, without going through introductory cutscenes. The player finds himself inside the derailed train in the finale of the first episode, devoid, as usual, of any injuries. The first sections of the game are extremely linear and devoid of enemies, so as to give new players room to learn the basic mechanics of the game. In addition, these early lines serve to re-bond the player's relationship with Alyx, the protagonist's traveling companion with whom one has faced the previous chapters of the saga. TWO ISN’T BETTER THAN ONE: From a gameplay point of view, this chapter does not add extremely noteworthy features compared to its predecessors. Certainly the AI of enemies has been improved, notable by the fact that they exploit completely new and realistic tactics to overpower the player, but less attentive players will tend to completely ignore this change. There is no new weaponry of any kind, and many mechanics such as the Half-Life 2 base car are reintroduced. The only new mechanic is that of a sticky mine, taken from some concepts set aside from the first chapters. GREEN IS GOOD: Graphically, the second episode of the Half-Life 2 trilogy excels the most. The introduction of several technologies that can improve game lighting, such as HDR, introduced in the first episode have been vastly improved, leading the final graphics to be extremely clean and pretty. POUNDING HEAVEN: On the audio side, there are no changes made from the previous chapters. I personally enjoyed the OSTs of this chapter much more than the previous ones, but they are all extremely congruent. BUT WHY 8? PROS: Half-Life 2: Episode Two comes across as an extremely clean game. With two successful titles behind it, it is almost problem-free. The game, from a plot perspective, is the first to reach a really high climax, but one that unfortunately will never be continued. This is because the third installment of the trilogy is likely never to be released. CONS: The few negative points of this latest episode were inherited from its predecessor, namely all those very long standoff stages where it is necessary to fight hordes of enemies, which are often monotonous and exaggeratedly verbose. RATING Gameplay: 9 Music: 8 Story: 9 Level Design: 8 _. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. Good Things(+) -main Story -game progress -chapters -puzzles -gameplay İt Could Be Better -play time Bad things(-) -none on record:8h. This episode makes the best in half-life's combat. The hunters and antlion workers are fun to fight against. I also love one of the last chapters.. Userscore too high. Userscore too high. Userscore too high. Userscore too high.. It starts with one thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mockin' me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so far Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter. (I played this game with MMod.) A continuation of the excellent Half-Life 2 story with a few new levels. This episode is simply better than the first episode, and the levels feel fresh with new environments including caves, an alien insect hive, and a pine forest. There are two cool new monsters as well. Unfortunately, the grievances I had with vanilla Half-Life 2 remain, which include too many checkpoints (which makes dying inconsequential) and the fact that explosive stuff is disproportionately dangerous. I'm still eagerly awaiting the sequel, 15 years later.... Oh, how I wish that I could have a Dog. Or a Gravity Gun. Or at least a crow bar that never break.. The best HL chapter I've ever played! The nature presenting in that game creates a unique ambient which makes Episode Two somewhat different from other parts of the series. I played in that game many times and it still don't boring me. A piece of art. Without a doubt.. Episode Two offers some of the best Half-Life experiences anyone can ever ask for.. I liked 2 series more than 1. In 1 series I was bored to play and I wanted to play it 100 times. And the 2nd episode I really liked, I liked the new mechanics, I was interested in playing the game. It's a pity that Half -Life 3 did not come out ( An incredible game for her age, but today it can be boring for players.. Still waiting for Episode Three. Pros: Amazing storyline Fun run and gun Some amazing scripted sequences Characters you care about. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For Xbox 360 Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 8 Music: 8 Story: 9 Total: 8.67. Episode Two was the pinnacle of the Half-Life series as far as I am concerned. It combined all the best aspects of the previous games as well as had the best story. It sadly ended on a cliffhanger that never may be resolved but at could have been worse as at least it left us wanting more as opposed to wishing for it to end. There isn’t much to speak of in the innovation department as it only introduced one new game play mechanic which was the sticky bombs for the final mission and a new enemy in the hunters. The graphics, voice acting and physics were all as good as before. The driving segments are back and brought back some variation. If I could make one complaint it would be that I felt the final mission lacked enough rockets. There were only maybe a half dozen I found in it’s duration so to deal with the hunters I resulted to running them with the car or throwing tree trunks at them. I would also say that having to keep an eye on Alyx more than previous games once again exposed some poor AI. It would have been nice if she sought cover more often. I played Episode Two on Linux. It never crashed on me. There were 4 AA settings; 6 AF settings; a V-Sync toggle; 9 other graphics options and an FOV slider that went from 75-90. You could change the difficulty level at any time as well as manually save at any time. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t surprising given the game’s age.

Hopefully one day it gets the sequel it deserves but in the mean time enjoy what it does give you. I finished the game in 5 hours and 18 minutes on the hardest difficulty. It’s current price of $8.99 CAD is a steal.

Episode 2 is in some ways even better than the original Half-Life 2 but of course it's way shorter and not as revolutionary as the base game.. The gameplay has changed in the game and the world and locations have become much more extensive and open, which made it possible to overcome long distances, the energy of the flashlight was also added, because earlier the energy of the air and the flashlight was the same. The second episode became much longer than the first. The physics in the game has become much better. Detailing the world at a new level and working with light and shadows have become much more alive. The plot has become much more interesting, in the course of the passage we meet new enemies and game situations, the game also ends with a bad and sad end. I recommend going through the second episode, you won't regret it!. All I can say after finishing this game is.... WOW!!! Every single thing about it left my jaw hung open! Valve has impressed me yet again with their awesome ability to make such a great storyline, and with their limitless source engine. The ONLY problem i have with this game is that it is a little bit too short. Still, 10/10. I just wish that my jaw could have hung open just a little bit longer.. Really good. Better than Half Life Episode 1. It was longer and it had much more story and the ending is just the worst cliffhanger (In a goodway). Play through the entire series and up to here and youll see why everyones so desperate for a new Half Life.. The second episode of Half-Life 2 outshines the first one, it still feels like a chapter but my god does it feel like a new adventure... There are new encounters, new enemies, more great soundtracks and a complete aesthetics overhaul. The ending was so emotional and satisfying simultaneously but i guess i, just like other video game enthusiasts, have to wait for the next chapter of this magnificent saga. Hope one day i'll be able to play Half-life: Alyx.. Amazing, I can't say if it's the best of the Hl2 trilogy, it's certainly better than its predecessor, I recommend everyone to play it.. Half-Life 2 Episode 2. That's a lot of 2s and to be exact it's two 2s... Weird. Episode 2 felt superior to the first episode in almost every way. Valve nailing the environments and story once again and the ominous feeling throughout this episode continues until the breathtaking ending. Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was a very fitting entry in the franchsie and putting it alongside portal in the orange box made it even better. I think episode two surpassed some of the design choices in Half-Life 2 and the soundtrack (while leaving you wanting more) is as deep and mesmerizing as always. Episode 2 is more great Half-Life 2 but remember... After playing this entry you will enter a lasting depression until the final episode of Half-Life 2's story occur. Have FUN.. Half - Life 2 Episode Two is a masterpiece ,excellent drama and story at all.. THIS IS THE BEST HALF LIFE EVER!! and also my first half life that i have played on my PC. With all my love I can say - 10/10. hl3. volvo pls all kidding aside, hl alyx was good and all, but now we want more. and i know the legends at valve can do just that. Half-Life 2 episode 2 was the true continuation we wanted for Half-Life 2, it contains new enemies, better visuals, a whole new playground for story-telling and a fantastic journey that has a lot of emotional weight to it. Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was the next step for the Half-Life franchise but unfortunately Valve never finished this doomed story; definitely check this episode out it's longer, better and more advanced than the previous episode.. Just like ep1 this brings nothing new to the table, it is too same and short.. This game is pretty much Half life 2 in a countryside setting, it works really well. Seriously though the ending was the downfall of valve and it still pisses me off to this day. We'll never get part 3.. Excellent drama and story at all. Cool gameplay and cool shooter at all. Enjoyed a lot.. I liked it more than Episode One, although it ended with a cliff hanger. The graphics were closer to that of CS:GO, perfect mechanics still unchanged.. This game is longer than Half-Life 2: Episode One, and it really helps. Unlike Episode One this game adds new stuff, has a good story, and sets up for a great sequel... a sequel that we still haven't seen yet.. Half - Life 2 Episode Two is a masterpiece with a few nonsense. Your review must be at least 75 characters long.. It's a 10 in every aspect, specially the story. The only con that i can think of is... that there is not an Episode 3!!!!!!!. Valve outdid their HL2 work with these episodes. The gameplay is as fun as it was, and the new mechanics just make the game better. It's a shame we still have to wait for the conclusion of Gordon's story.. This will go down in history as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Epic story, great blend of extremely dark setting with sprinkles of humor, insane graphics/voice acting/environments for its time, and great blend of puzzle solving and shootout arenas. While it lack any character development for Gordon Freeman, the world around still feels alive and real. It takes more of the Zelda approach, where the main character has no in game personality, because YOU are the personality. While this is not my favorite style, it was pretty standard for the time. And the character filled world, makes up for it.. Recommended 7.4 hrs on record ""Dad... No....."" I felt that 9/10 gamers must playyyyy. Game based on checked before ideas and mechanisms. Missions are still diversed and exciting, puzzles and quests are varied in a good way. The storyline seems to be more interesting. Textures looks noticeable better than in HL 2 and Episode One. Sound keeps the same, nice level. Succeed continuation offering a little bit more fun than Episode One.. This is probably my favorite game of the series. The slight improvements from HL2 and HL2E1 are evident, and it makes for a truly groundbreaking experience for its time. Graphics: 9/10 Per usual, the graphics for a Half Life game are ahead of it's time. The setting is a total change of pace from the previous two titles, and it works perfectly. There are some exceptionally great visuals throughout the story and the final mission provides some of the coolest effects you have seen in a while. I'm writing this review in 2020, having just played the game for the 3rd time ever, and I can honestly say that these graphics hold up for a game that is 10+ years old. Narrative: 9/10 HL2E2 tells a touching story with some of our most beloved HL2 characters, along with a new addition that meshes well into the dynamic. There are some warm moments sprinkled throughout, and a few heart-wrenching scenes that will surely weigh down your chest. Protagonist: 9/10 Who doesn't love Gordon Freeman? Still would love to hear him speak, though! Characters/Interactions: 10/10 The supporting characters are phenomenal in this game, and I love how a lot of them tie into previous HL titles. Alyx, Eli, Dog, Kleiner, Lamar, and even Magnusson are all given an opportunity to be fleshed out properly, and by the end we have a sense of direction to where the story is headed (still waiting, Valve). Gameplay: 10/10 This game is just so fun. I always think back to the original Half Life (PS2) game case, and how on the back it says ""RUN, SHOOT, THINK, LIVE"", and how it's such a simple idea. But somehow, Valve turns this style into some of the most intriguing gameplay I've ever seen. The final mission stands out the most for sure. It's a challenge, but it's such a blast that you will be wishing for more. The ending will forever give me goosebumps, and I just hope that someday we will get to see what's next for our beloved Gordon Freeman. Overall Score: 9.2/10. Just like episode 1 (ep 1) this game felt like a more polished Half Life 2. The game picks up from ep 1, but doesn't close out the series like it should if it were supposed to be the last game in the franchise or even the last game for a long time. The feeling of urgency and more engaging story writing from ep 1 continued with this game. The puzzles/map design were at times hard with harder boss fights and new stronger enemies to match them, I found myself dying as much as I did during the original Half Life. A new very fun vehicle was incorporated into this game very smoothly. Overall, the game play was peak polish and the story/characters were engaging, if the ending closed out the series or if episode 3 actually followed suit I'd rate this one a 10/10.. Great game to continue the saga. -------------------------------------------. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It has been years and still we haven't seen the action in this game in any other.. Why did they have to do us like that for so long? A fantastic episode in the HL2 storyline featuring great new locations, enemies, and... Jesus... that ending.. Valve will never make Half-Life 3 which is why I give this game a 0. The game itself is meh.. Twice as long as Episode One, and twice as good. Episode Two amps up the story and gameplay. All concluding in a nail-biting set piece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even better expansion comparing to the first one. Unfortunately it ends with cliffhanger which will be never explain... or will be ?. If you went through the first and second part of the game, then the first and second episode are necessary to fill in the gaps of the story left after the second part.. Half Life 2 Episode Two exceeds any and all expectations and manages to be the best of all of the Half Life games.. Played it on a PS3. Episode Two is easily my favorite entry in HL2, it has the highest highs and is a very complete experience in its gameplay and story. As you may know, the story ends with a cliffhanger but an incredible and organic one, I think that is worth to play the whole series just to get to this episode and let's hope that HL3 or Episode three happen soon.. Actually my favorite game of all time. My username says it all. I know it is an expansion, i don't care i just love it. I think people kind of neglect this game when mentioning great games because of its humble expansion pack existence. The graphics and story are excellent, especially the way characters act. The gameplay is much better than half life 2 because the gunplay is much better and battles are more well set up. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I didn't like Half Life 2, but enjoyed Half-Life 2: Episode One. Episode Two, however, I think is a great game. This one, unlike the previous Half Life 2 games, is extremely fun to play with full of breathtaking moments. It is also the only one I totally enjoyed shooting -especially at the striders in the final chapter-. The story also seems to be more focused. At the end, I would not consider myself as an Half Life fan but it was a blast to play this final entry to the series.. Why did I come back to play this again. WHY? I've never had such conflicting feelings after completing a game. I'm still amazed by what how masterfully done this is which makes me even more frustrated and sad at the fact that we'll never see its continuation. It's painful. I just. I Can't. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh. HALF-LIFE SAGA ENDS HERE. 1998-2007. R.I.P. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Half-Life series. FOREVER. But VALVE....Where is my, our, 3? THREEEEEEEEEEEE? Give us episode series at least 3, 4, 5, 6 and then give us Half-Life 3. And more. With PERFECTION in every aspects. Then maybe we will forgive you guys. Maybe.... ...PLZ.. When I finished this game, I cried for more. But sadly, I'm probably not going to see more of these. WHY VALVE? Just don't leave us with a cliffhanger!. Another masterpiece Valve has created in their franchise! More epic storyline, more compelling moments, and more plain awesome fun! But this can't be the final Half-Life game! Where are you Episode 3!? How can this game franchise end with such a major unsolved story plot, and a whole new adventure waiting! But keep praying that the defining day in video game history will come when Half-Life: Episode 3 is released! But still all the games are memorable and awesome in their own right!. This is my favorite of the entire series. Things can't get better! When I thought Episode 1 was okay with only memorable gameplay mechanics, Episode 2 sets the series on the track again with a highly engaging story, new environments and the most fun/difficult boss fights of the series that forces the players to come up with a strategy. Unlike Episode 1, the story progression is extremely rich. There are moments which you totally don't see coming. It put me in great emotional stress in the first quarter of the game. The tension was so thick, I was sick worried! The thing that I missed the most in Half Life 2 is covered by the episodes: teaming up with Alyx. Alyx is with us only for a brief time in HL2. Episode 1's lack of story is up for by this element. But now, not only is Alyx with us the entire time, but we experience a series of great plot twists and amazing story development with her. Seeing her reactions, her pain, her suffering almost becomes our own! It seems as if Valve is learning! The boss fights are extremely smart and engaging. One of Half Life's (the whole series') strength's is that it d","the game is the sequel to episode 1 of half life . it's simply incredible, the story, the ending, the gameplay (no wonder) there's not much new, despite a new enemy, but otherwise the extension is superb ."
321.Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4,"Persona 4 is my second favorite game on the PlayStation 2. I am glad that such a masterpiece was released for the PS2. The story was engaging and alluring; it helped me finish it. The friends felt real, and every character had a special place in my heart. It's truly a game to play at least once in life. Once it ended, I wished to forget the story and play it once more like a novice player, but alas, that can not happen. The gameplay is awesome but the story is even better. I felt as if the characters were my real friends and family. The mystery and fog in Persona 4 is something unforgettable.. Nice game. Although it is a very good game nice story and gameplay It is just too grindy Like when you play the game for 50 hours trying to level up you will only level up by 4 levels. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Launching in the West only one year after the release of its masterful predecessor, Persona 4 is every bit more of what you liked about Persona 3 with only minor refinements to A.I., dungeon design, and setting. Persona 4's story is at its best when it's focused on its refreshingly smaller scale M-rated Scooby-Doo-like murder mystery. When it does eventually go bigger with the standard RPG world ending peril, it feels a bit misplaced and off brand with the rest of what the game is going for. Still, Persona 4's exceptionally strong characters, themes, style, soundtrack, and gameplay make for a superior RPG experience.. Persona 4 stands as one of the absolute best games ever made, Amazing novel experience, exceptional gameplay & storyline, the atmosphere is straight up the best I found in a PS2 game, the art design screams soul throughout the whole experience & the soundtrack is incredible, Persona 4 stands tall as one of the most memorable experiences ever.. Very nice game. I think the story is the biggest advantage of that game. The second one is interesting gameplay - fusing persona etc. Things which are not the best: * Lack of voiceover for most dialogs * Generic dungeons. The negative people, take your negative asses outta here! I've had it with hate! OUT! OUT!!!. The Persona series is probably one of my all time favorite game series in a long time and Persona 4 was my first ever introduction to the series (play it back in 2018). I feel a lot of people should be introduced to the series through this game and it's even more accessible now than ever since it’s on PC. Now I'm going to tell you why Persona 4 is a Masterpiece. Now let's talk about the story you play as the protagonist name (Whatever you want) and he moved to a small town recently with his uncle and cousin. Later on in the first half of the game you learn about the Shadow world inside the T.V. and the evil creatures known as Shadows. Of course the team doesn't think much about this at first until they realize it is linked to a bunch of people deaths in the town. So you and your new friends have to figure out who is causing the deaths in the town and how they are doing it. I gave you a very basic run down of the story with most of the big plot points being left out but if this seems interesting to you then you should check it out. Now to talk about the gameplay there are 2 components to this game that should be brought up. This game is a visual novel mixed with a turn based RPG. In the game you get to choose whether or not you spend time working on your social stats and your friends' relationship or go into the T.V. world to save the missing person and defeat shadows. Let's talk about the social aspect of the game first. In this game you get to spend life as a high school student which means typical high school things you can buy items to help you in the T.V. world, Work a part time job, Study, Go out to eat, and hang out with friends, During this segment you have this thing called Social stats there are 5 different social stats these are Courge, Knowledge, Expression, Understanding, and Diligence and all of these stats can be raised by doing part time jobs, doing certain task, hanging out with certain characters, and yes even fishing. Now this might not seem that important but they are very important for Social Links and Certain jobs you need to work at. Speaking of which lets talk about the Social links. Social links are this thing that represents the bond you have with your friends and going through this social could help you out during battle by giving your party members new attacks and abilities, Increase how much exp your persona fusions get, and even let you have discounts of a full hp and sp restorses. Not only that but the characters' stories are all very interesting (I recommend finishing Yosuke Social link even if you don't like him) but there's one last thing. You can romance almost all the girls in this game. It's completely optional and doesn’t change a thing to the gameplay, it's just for story purposes. Now onto the RPG aspect of the game. When you get the ability to enter the T.V. World through the Midnight Channel you get this amazing ability called a persona which represents your characters personality and of course since you character is almost a blank slate he can wield multiple personas this comes in handy because your character can become a healer, tank, mage, or a glass cannon depending on what persona you use. Now i'm going to get into a bit of story here but basically each of your party members have a shadow that look like them and this shadow sort of represents the hidden feelings that character wants to be hidden from the world and basically every character denies their shadow as being apart of them which lead to the boss fights of the game. Just a warning these bosses are super hard so look up a guide on how to beat them or start the game out on easy. Then there is how you obtain a persona. First there is the possibility of getting a shuffle time where a bunch of cards pop up and there are either one or two cards that have a persona on them and if you get the card with the persona on it you get to keep it. There is also the other option of fusion. Basically if you have way too many personas on you and you need to make room for stronger ones then you fuse your weaker persona together to get more powerful ones. Think of the RPG element as a more mature pokemon game. Although there are some gripes I have with the game first of if you die you have to go all the way back to your last save it could be really annoying when you have grinded a whole bunch of exp and then die and have to go all the way back it **** but other then that the gameplay is great. Now some of my final thoughts on this game. This game has done a lot for me so I might be a bit biased but this game helped me out through a really dark time in my life and when the game was over I basically cried I really enjoyed this game and seeing this characters that have become my friends says goodbye is the most heart wrenching thing ever. Yes it might not be a perfect masterpiece but not everything is perfect and everything has flaws. Give Persona 4 a chance you won't regret it. Also the music is amazing. -Booker. The best JRPG ever made. Great storyline, soundtrack, gameplay and artstyle. And to top it off, great animated shows too.. Pros: An amazing story that gets better as time goes on, awesome characters and a fun social/school system. Good dungeon visual themes as well. Overall nice music but nothing insanely good. Cons: The monster hit system to start a battle in dungeons feels so weird, sometimes you would easily hit them to start your team in advantage and sometimes you would apparently miss the sword swing 2 feet in front of you.. We are living our lives.... Abound with so much information!!! The theme is awesome and I loved the game, in some ways better than 5. If you are looking to get into the Persona series, I'd recommend Persona 4 first since it has both aspects of P3 and P5 that are important. While I think P5's soundtrack is superior by a little bit, I think P4's soundtrack shines better than P5's in some cases. For example, I prefer the music while you explore Inaba. As much as I like Tokyo Daylight, Your Affection and Heartbeat, Heartbreak is better than Tokyo Daylight combined. The 6th Dungeon Theme I believe is one of if not the best dungeon theme behind Whims of Fate. Overall, i loved this game, probably Top 5 all time for me. And I recommend it.. I have avoided gameplay videos and so forth for 12 years now because I wanted a genuine, fresh experience. Wow, was it worth the wait, I found a PS2 at a flea market for $5 and since have went through PS2's amazing catalogue of exclusives. This may have been ported to other platforms and PC, but playing the original P4 on original PS2 hardware is amazing. The storyline makes the game for me, it is interesting, it **** you in, I am in love! Gameplay itself is fun, and I like when the game really picks up and lets you adventure around town. After about 5 hours in, I decided that I wanted to play Persona 3FES, so once I beat this, that's next on the list. So thankful to have this experience, thanks Atlus!. It’s very good. The story is amazing, the characters are lovable, and it’s overall just a well-made game. Good stuff.. How I rate games: Game-play, Music/Sound, Graphics & Visuals, Story/World-building, and Characters each get 0-2 points adding up to a score /10. 0 is non-existent or bad, 1 is average or N/A, and 2 is better than average. Game-play: 1 The gameplay is basically the same as P3, showing little improvement for the series. Music/Sound: 2 There is a huge library of music and most of it is very nice and the voice acting is definitely an improvement over the P3 games. Graphics & Visuals: 0 While they aren't bad, the graphics were not improved over P3 at all which is a big problem as the graphics for the P3 games were not great. This game looks like it much, much older than it is. Story/World-building: 2 The small town limits what you can do but plays perfectly into the characters and the story. The story, while a touch bloated with high-school slice-of-life crap, works well as a simple murder mystery. Characters: 1 This cast you will either find boring and unlikeable or you will be **** in like you are one of the gang. I found them unlikeable as they told eachother to accept their true selves while doing things like bullying their friend for questioning his sexuality. Many of the characters behaviors have aged terribly to the point where if this game gets remade post 2020 there will need to be some serious edits just to not cause a boycott. TOTAL: 6/10. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: AWESOME. Dialogue: GREAT.. Despite some randomness on the fights and the difficulty menu selection (because easy is VERY recommended if is your first game), is an excelent game with beautiful graphics and not so heavy load screens,which for the PS2 generation is amazing, the game can give you easily 100+ without without noticing, and the menu managment if you like it is very entertaining.. Good game, but far from perfect. The game has some really good elements, a concrete story, and great battle system, but this is probably my least favorite persona game. The plot is TOO happy (with music to match) and it makes the game being about murder off putting and you'd wonder how a game that is a cousin of the SMT series came out with this. The characters are so really boring - other call it 'realistic' but some of the characters life issues come across as whiny and makes them unlikable. They are also the type to sit around and wait while someone is dying in another dimension and it feels in character considering the snarky comments they like to make towards eachother. If I wanted this kind of dull and mean I'd go talk to random people off of the street and not play a video game. The weather mechanic also was a lot less straightforward than following moon cycles like Persona 3. But when it is good, it is really good. The murder storyline was good, the twists were good, and the use of 'your true self' laid bare is good as both a story beat for developing characters and great for boss battles and creative imagery in the dungeons. So while I don't think it is unplayable, I think 'overated' would be a good word for this game.. A bit too light hearted for an SMT or Persona game, but it's fun none the less.. Great music and presentation doesn't overcome the average gameplay and mediocre writing.. My favorite game of all time, great story and characters, unique premise and an emotionally satisfying ending if you pursued the true ending. The game has a better difficulty curve than P5 and is more challenging, requiring strategy while not being *too* hard. The story is very emotionally charged and the true culprit once you find them is a very well written villain. The cast is great and I found that I liked all the cast. The game picks up right about when Kanji Tatsumi joins your party and gets better and better from there. probably the best game of the persona series. highly recommended. unlike its predecessor. great music, characters and story. Legit one of the best games ever made. This is my personal favorite persona and PS2 game! This is a must play for anyone who has a PS2.. This is my favorite game of all time. (If I had a PS Vita *cough* or if there was a Vita emulator *cough*, it would probably be P4 Golden). If you plan on playing the game, please go for the true ending, it's not that hard, but even if it were, it would still be very much worth it. There are multiple, very good spoiler-free guides on the internet. The best part is the characters. The combat is also fun, but interacting with your S. Links is in my opinion, way more entertaining. Give it a try, even if you don't like JRPGs, Visual Novels or Anime/Anime games. You should also give the game a bit of time. It gets really entertaining at about hour 7, I think, not sure. btw Rise is best girl. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The weakest entry I ever made for SMT games and Persona. I did not like Persona 4 really. It felt way too happy and it didn't really feel like a SMT game. The story didn't grow on me whatsoever, the soundtrack became really annoying after just two hours, the characters are by far the worst choices with the worst development, the analysis characters become really annoying, the main character is the worst choice, Mr. Perfect and the school life somehow is WORSE then the 3rd game. I had to force myself to finish this game and the payoff wasn't even worth it. Newer fans might like it because of how happy and lighthearted it is in comparison but for me it's not worth ever playing again.. THE ONLY REASON I AM GIVING THIS A 9 IS BECAUSE PERSONA 5 EXISTS. after playing persona 5 and crying at the end because I didn't want that amazing game to end and never be able to play it for the first time again. I spent $100 to get a ps2 and another 25 for this game. and other that the game play aging compared to Persona 5, the characters and story are still amazing, a must play in my book. It's one of the best RPG's that I ever played. The Game has a fantastic Story (after 10 Hours Playtime) It's also a fantastic Game for Anime Fans because It's Just Like a playable Action Anime. The Soundtrack is also one of the BEST gaming Soundtracks that I've ever heared. Play the Game It's a MUST PLAY. This game has to have been written by a turtle with how slow it is, there is so much talking that ultimately goes nowhere in a majority of the cutscenes, and like Persona 3, everything between ""Date A"" and ""Date B"" where the plot will progress just feels like filler. The initial mystery is hooking, but when almost everyone's shadows center around their teenage angst and how flustered they are with their sexuality or gender, the mystery ultimately goes nowhere until much later in the game, taking a back seat for quite a while so we can watch what makes Kanji all hot and bothered... This game could go from 70+ hours to 15-25 if the plot was devoid of filler. At least in this one you can actually choose to control every party member.... I rather play fortnite than this crap. Persona 4 is absolute poop, no metaverse.... Not as good as Persona 3 but still a very solid entry nonetheless, wish it was about 15hs shorter though.. This could be really nice game, but 3 things throw it out from my best 10 games list. 1. school events was really bad written and had something I hate in japanese culture. Bullying boys by girls in anime always acts on my nerves, and all school events in P4 was the same. Even main hero's girlfriend acts like she hate him, when it comes to main story events. 2. In main story, when you try to resolve mystery, even when you have to choose what to say, someone always repeat what you just said and all characters ignore fact that you said it first. It is stupid and takes away all satisfaction. 3. fighting shadows is really boring and frustrating, when you need to analyze every new enemy to find its weaknesses.. I was never really into the J-Rpg, but this game, even if you do not like it, is worth playing. 7.5. The game starts with the MC (YOU) moving from the BIG CITY to a small, foggy town called Inaba as a transfer student. There you live with your uncle and his cute daughter Nanako. After starting school and making a few friends something shocking happens in the small town. A lady is found hanging murdered upside down from an antenna. The police investigators are obviously stupid, so it’s up to you and your friends to solve the murder mystery. The main characters soon find out that the victims are shown on the mysterious midnight channel before they are murdered. By literally entering the TV and fighting the victims’s inner demons they can save them from the TV world and their death. While the gameplay is divided in 2 parts it isn’t necessarily 50/50. The game is based on time and scheduled so that certain events take place on certain dates. The first part is the social/story part which I’ll talk more about in a minute and the other part is the dungeon gameplay where you can spend your time in the dungeons grinding levels or equipment and items. Grinding is not something that is really necessary in this game though. As long as you fight all enemies you happen to meet, you should be fine. It’s very nice that the game doesn’t have random encounters. Instead you see the enemies on the map and you can easily choose if you want to fight them or not by cutting them with your blade or just running away from them. The most important factor in fights are the Personas you fight with. They have physical attacks draining your health to deal damage and magic attacks draining your SP to buff your party or deal magic damage. By hitting an enemy’s weakness or hitting a critical hit they are knocked down. If you knock down every enemy in the fight you are allowed to perform a very satisfying all-out attack that usually ends the fight. The entire fighting system takes the basics of a normal RPG fight and removes ALL the annoying stuff while adding a fluid, fast and straightforward system. For example you can change the ”summon” a.k.a. Persona equipped without wasting a turn, which is not something I think I’ve ever seen in a turn-based RPG before. That’s how the majority of the game is. Take the best of both genres and remove the annoying parts of them. The other part of the gameplay is social life simulation. Here you experience the story, the sidequests and the preparations for the dungeons. The most important thing you will be doing here is improving your social links, or S. Links for short. By hanging out with friends your bonds with them will increase, to the point where you can get intimate relationships with the female ones. You could always try to get all of them, but I would never do something like that… no, I’m serious, I only had one girlfriend, being the **** from the drama club. Joining clubs is optional, but don’t skip that **** your stats can be increased and **** The stats I’m talking about are stats like knowledge, expression, courage and such. Those stats are not used in combat, but rather to unlock more dialogue options, sidequests and part-time jobs giving you money. Almost everything you do has a consequence as almost everything you do is indirectly related to one or many stats of yours making you involved in everything you do. One aspect of the game that scared me before playing was DUNGEON CRAWLING. Usually exploring dull, depressing, disorienting areas makes me angry in RPGs, but this game made it endurable enough for me to somewhat enjoy dungeons. You see, the dungeons are varied in theme and are easy to navigate as they aren’t even that big. The largest dungeon in the game has like 11 floors, and takes under 2 hours if you do everything in it (unless you level grind). Another pleasant thing when exploring is that you with the right item (it’s cheap as **** in the normal store) can return to the entrance and continue exploring another in-game day with HP and SP fully restored. HP is almost never a problem as you can easily restore it to max with SP or HP items. The SP is on the other hand a slight problem as you can’t buy SP restoring items except from the periodically refilled vending machines in the shopping district. This means that you might sometimes have to quit mid-dungeon because of lack of SP, but this is not really a big problem as blasting through a dungeon in one sitting is tiring to begin with. Luckily the save points are placed well too, so losing a lot of progress because of you being bad is probably not gonna happen. The overall atmosphere is further improved by a great, catchy soundtrack and a very unique stylistic style in menus. The game hits the perfect combination of dark and happy and it’s lovely. I’m happy to say that this is one of the best RPGs on PS2 and so also one of my favourite games of all time. Truly a unique experience.. Persona 4 really surprised me with how good it was even with it coming out almost a decade ago. Each character in the game has depth with their own problems as well. The Story was very interesting with the game having you go throughout your everyday life trying to solve a murder mystery. My main problem with this game was the dungeons, they were just boring. Not saying the story bits were boring or the combat its self-was boring either but the actual means of searching through it. Every floor looks the same until you reach the top. Each dungeon had a cool theme but I wish there was more to it. There were also some moments in the game where the bosses felt cheap, like kanjis and the final boss. Which is apart of another problem with the game which is you can't win if you don't grind. Some of the bosses will just straight up one shot you if you aren't a high enough level or if you personas aren't then the battle will be long and drawn out until you lose your sp and die. I'm not against grinding in games at all, but in this, it just felt like you had to do it at every boss and for quite a while too which wouldn't have been as bad if the dungeons were a bit more interesting to go through. Other than the dungeons everything else about this game was great even the almost 10-year-old graphics didn't bother me as much as I expected them to. Long story short, if the game sounds interesting to give it a shot it's like 10-15 dollars on the ps3 store and there's an extended version with persona 4 golden on the vita.. Personal 4 is certainly a unique experience and if you are a fan of JRPGs with turn based combat this is a game that should not be missed. The visuals are a weak point and the dungeons are bland but that is made up for by an excellent story with a ton of depth and detail. There are countless things to do in this game, the soundtrack is memorable, the characters are well fleshed out and the experience is immersive. The story covers an entire year with several major characters who are all fleshed out. Switching between the real world and the tv world gives a good variety of game play and really gives incentive to reach the next goal. The story is well paced and a good blend of fun events and serious dark twists. I can't think **** that is both very light at times and very dark at others. Some aspects of the story are just ridiculous silliness but those moments are entertaining and are well offset by moments that are equally serious and dramatic. Each character you meet has their own arc and dozens of story events. While the story is very weird and may not be to everyone's taste, it is undeniably well done for what it is. If you hate anime tropes this story is probably not going to appeal to you. If you enjoy or can tolerate that side of it though, you are in for something special, a story full of mysteries, twists and emotional moments. The gameplay is a mixed bag. The combat is can be fun when you get new abilities or fight bosses but it becomes very repetitive fighting your way through dungeons. All of the dungeons look different but they are basically just hallways that you run through killing monsters, there is very little detail and interaction within them. Collecting and creating new personas is one of the best parts of the game and that is what really makes dungeon crawling worthwhile. There are countless personas to discover and upgrade. The life sim element of the game is really addicting and the game does a great job of always introducing new elements the further you progress. Characters are probably one of the strongest aspects of the game. There are at least a dozen characters that all have stories to be explored. Each character is unique and has depth. You can also choose how well you get to know each character or group of characters by choosing to spend more time with them. These interactions spread throughout the game really help you relationships with each character feel immersive as characters will start to treat you differently the more you get to know them. While many of the characters seem very one dimensional or cliche at first, the more you get to know them the more complex and real they become. Each character has their own set of problems, that you have the opportunity to help them through. My only major problem with the characters is that the anime tropes are often extremely cringe worthy and a few characters never evolve beyond their cliche anime personalities. For example the little sister character is overly cutesy and never really evolves beyond that even though she has tons of screen time. The sound design is mostly excellent but once again, not for people who hate anime. The songs are catchy but get very repetitive in dungeons. The voice acting is very good though and the sound effects are all good. Overall Persona 4 is a special game, it has a ton of depth, and deserves a lot of the praise it gets. On the other hand it is a game that will likely only appeal to a certain type of audience. It is a game that fully embraces its anime quirks and that can sometimes be off putting. I really enjoy certain anime but some anime tropes drive me mad and this game is no exception. There are many great moments and the overall experience is definitely worthwhile but there were many cringe worthy moments as well and part of this game that grated on me. I give Persona 4 an 82% Story/Progression – 9 Gameplay – 7 World – 6 Uniqueness Ideas – 9 Sound Design – 8 Characters – 9 Visuals/Style – 7 Length/Amount of Content – 10 Atmosphere/Theme – 9 X-Factor - 8. One of best games if I already play on PlayStation 2, Give a chance for this game. One of the best turn RPG game with I ever play. Very good, play it.. It's amazing how an RPG blends so well with slice of life genre that are rarely as popular in gaming nowadays. It emphasizes the same trend Persona 3 made with a unique gameplay equivalent of friends = strength. The story is not too shabby either considering it has to follow suit with its predecessor's dark storyline. Collecting personas is still as fun as it was before and their is no doubt of the series' continuing success in the mainstream market.. Everything that made Persona 3 great, Persona 4 has and then some. A new setting, a new story, new characters, and everything feels just as great as its prequel. Persona 4 sets the bar just as high as Persona 3, and even surpasses it in some ways. If you want to read what makes Persona 4 great, you can read my review on Persona 3 FES, because the dungeon crawling and the high school social life aspects are still there. The characters, however, are even more relatable and likable than before, with some part members feeling like lifelong friends that you would almost wish were real (Yosuke, AKA Brosuke). Each character has their own personal struggles in life, and in connecting with them they'll open up to you and reveal more about themselves as their trust in you grows, and you will feel a connection to these people on a personal level. They'll become stronger in their resolve as you support them, and in turn will become more effective in combat, unlocking certain techniques such as instantly recovering an ally from a status ailment, or even taking mortal blows for you, up to resisting fatal damage once per battle. The characters are believable and very human, and are a very central part of the game as a whole. The themes of the game are a bit more lighthearted than 3's depressing motifs, but its every bit as engaging, revolving around a supernatural murder mystery that provides intrigue and suspense, as well as its fair share of twists throughout the entire thing. The game will make you think and deduce things for yourself, and as the main character, you don't just passively watch as the mystery solves itself like in many other games. You are a part of the team, and you are every bit as involved as your friends, and you will be required to think and solve things yourself from time to time, making the game engaging and fun, though it will sometimes test your ability to critically think and deduce solutions from complex situations, which isn't a bad thing, but it can sometimes make you feel in the dark unless you've been paying complete attention. Collecting Personas is just as fun as in 3, and fusing and creating new ones is a blast. Finding Personas is all well and good, but creating your own is where the magic happens. That feeling when you create a new powerful Persona and take it for a spin is unbeatable in satisfaction, though the combat will always find ways to test your ability to strategize and think ahead, and the addition of allowing for player control of all party members adds even more strategy and options to combat. Luckily, the AI for team members are smarter than they were in 3, so leaving them to their own devices is just as viable an option, though I personally prefer player control. Just like Persona 3, Persona 4 is a must own for JRPG fans, and hell, even people who aren't into JRPGs and just want a good narrative. It has a slow start, but stick with it and you'll find so much to love.. really good game. obviously nowhere near persona 3 which was perfect in every way but still. not all the characters are that appealing but they are fun in the setting. a must play game. great music, characters, gameplay, tone. really good game. It would be wrong to call this the new Final Fantasy because eventhough it's a turn-based RPG there are way too many differences with FF, but if there's one saga that's to continue with the legacy of the great turn RPGs, it's Persona, and Persona IV is simply the most refined in the saga. Great characters, great anime-like graphics, great storyline, great music, great everything basically. I just can't think of any RPG saga that is close to Persona nowadays.. How should is say it...this is really hard to describe the beautiful things and all of the feelings of this game. love,Friendsh","the story is engaging and alluring; it helped me finish it. the friends felt real, and every character had a special place in my heart . Persona 4's story is at its best when it's focused on its refreshingly smaller scale M-rated murder mystery ."
322.Hollow Knight,"One of the best combat systems in all of 2D gaming; the bosses are extraordinary, and the games difficulty is always just right. 9.5/10. Hollow Knights one of the best thing is its amaizing soundtrack and really good story desing. Hollow Kight provides enough challenge for advanced players but not too much for beginners. Hollow Knight also has an really good controller and keyboard playability so you can enjoy it with almost every dervice. I have really enjoyed Hollow Knight and the +100 playhours propably tell it.. This game must be one of the top metroidvanias and it still stands up after 7 Years. Amazing. The start might be boring simple and slow but it gets better and betteri love this game, it's a hard game andin some bosses you will have to retrayed a lot of times. Beginning : The beginning is slow and boring. Easy bosses that have almost no purpose plague this game and make it waste even more of your time. There is no guidance for anything. The beginning made me wish I never paid for this. Middle : You are guaranteed to die on the mid-game bosses while trying to learn their attacks. The game punishes you for dying with a ton of backtracking. The entire meat of the game is walking around waiting to find a new ability or boss. Endgame : After all of the upgrades, there is no challenge. You spend your countless hours slaving away in godhome. Godhome is a garbage dlc that is half baked. Pantheons 1-4 are bearable but start to feel tedious chore when you introduce bindings into the mix. pantheon 5 is the most annoying, tedious, boring, stupid, and garbage time wasters that this game has. You go through 42 mostly easy bosses just to die to absrad, and her unfair attack patterns. Once you die, you have to go through the 40 minute torture again. This game is not a test of skill, but a test of endurance and patience. Why would you hide your ending in an area that majority of your fan base won’t be able to beat? Do not buy this game. I am a perfectionist. Not completing this will make me feel like a failure. This game has actually had an effect on me mentally. It has made me bite, hit, and pull my hair out. If you want to play this game, forget that that fat slug called the Godmaker exists.. Simply put, an amazing game. Sure the mechanics aren't really original, but the game makes them feel very fresh. A ton of content, great open world for a 2d platformer, and deep story. Recomended for all ages.. Best game ever, with a compelling message and deep lore. Plenty of gameplay that provides a challenge for people at all levels.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even though it starts like a Souls like game it eventually become a hack and slasher rogue like. The game play may look same as other platformers but the ability and the charms make it dream play. It has a nice and confusing story. Its something you have to figure out on your own by interacting with the NPCs most of the time. Thats another cool aspect for the people who wants to know the story. I bought this game 4 years ago and put it down because it felt so hard but today I finished it with an Awe. A must play game. I would highly recommend it. If you are confused with all the maps and stuffs please do use the guides no shame on it.. This is the best made game I've ever played, besides having a good story, good and well developed characters, we discover the story little by little the setting and scenarios They are so amazing I dare say it's one of the top ten games in history. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hollow knight is a game that inspires massive exploration in a small world. However that world is far greater than anything you could imagine, including any expectations you had before. Also, if silksong doesn’t release next year I will crash out. A brilliant and at times dizzyingly overwhelming Metroidvania Soulslike platformer. With insects. It's one of a kind.. This is an amazing game, I love filling out the maps! I like having to kill enemies to buy things, because in real life everything costs money.. This is one of the best games I've ever played. The atmosphere and characters immerse me in this bug world more than 99% of games I've ever played. The combat was fun to learn and master, plus new abilities kept the gameplay feeling fresh. Finding and exploring new areas also kept the game fresh, it made me curious and exited to learn more about the game world, even after I beat the game there were still places to explore and foes to conquer. Overall I'd recommend this to pretty much everyone, even if you're not a fan of metriodvanias or souls-likes I'm sure you'll enjoy this game.. Certainly the best game Ive ever played. Better than HOMM3 (all addons), Diablo II LOD, Undertale, etc… try it, u will not believe How addictive it is.. its perfect. Hollow Knight is, in my opinion, the current peak of the metroidvania genre. Its combat is fluid and fun, its platforming is simple yet engaging, and its exploration is absolutely stellar, with dozens of collectibles and areas to explore. All of this game is just phenomenal. (now if only Silksong would actually come out). A master piece. Challenging game, beautiful music, nice graphics on switch, many hours of play, no bug at all !. War thunder is the best Nintendo game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!))!)))))))))))))))$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hollow knight is one of the best metriod-vanias out there no competition. This game is a pure masterpiece that shows what indies can bring to the table. I highly recommend playing it. this game is honestly so amazing like from the soundtrack to the combat and amazing breathtakingly stellar environment hollow knight is a must play for anyone who wants an entry to the world of metroidvania. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The world created by the developers is genious and varied with a brilliant art direction. The exploration is implemented perfectly and is very rewarding. The game has also good platforming and combat, with complex but fair boss fights. The only downside is sometimes the boss run backs that are often long.. This game is great. I loved the whole world and I liked exploring. It is possible that other people did not like exploring, but for me it is the best. It is also part of my real personality. I love exploration and it has always not been easy, even in our real lives, but in this game it is the best... also the way to play. I am a myth.. Thank you, Hollow Knight. It'sj just an amazing game overall, the beautiful scenery, the fun combat, the great characters and hidden sotry, it'sjust amazing, probably my favorite game ever, i 100% reccomend it to anyone who likes metroidvanias. XSubtracred onepoint cause im dumb, I player the game then after falseknight forgot which way I camre and missed the upgrade, then as few monthas cltrer I frien again And did the sdame thing, A year later I actually got pAT OPENING then I plasyed through the whole game and loved it -. This game is a masterpiece this is such a great game can't wait for silksong. Really fun, cute, visually atractive and engaging metroidvania. The game excels in pretty much every department. Most of the game/bosses while being challenging feel fair, and most times it only takes a little bit of practice or moves memorization to beat a certain boss. On top of that the controls are very responsive and this lets you move smooth as butter, which feels incredible, and gives you the perfect reaction time for everything. You never feel clunky or as if the controls were not responding. Also with the free dlc provided it adds new content and makes the game event better, so in general is one of the best metroidvania experiences I have ever played and it deserves a 10/10 without a doubt.. It's honestly one of the best games that you can get for 15 dollars. Hell, I would say I commited daylight robbery. It's super optimised for the switch and has loads of content. this game is so immersive yet so simple that I was genuinely surprised by how immersed I became in this games storytelling despite the lack of voice acting which some might argue helps the feeling of immersion. I literally cried after completing the game 112%. still waiting for silk song.. Absolute masterpiece, I cannot recommend this game enough for someone who likes challenges and exploration. the best game ever i played, is difficult but this dont changes the gameplay the story is very interesting and the music is amazing. Can't even think about a single flaw. And it was made by only 3 people. Unfortunately none of us is gonna be alive for Silksong.. A perfect game : -difficult -playable again and again -achievement hard but satisfying -a great history -memorable fights - and all OST are incredible A perfect no ending game. I've played this game a few times now. Incredible artwork and world building. replayability as it best and it can be as hard as you want. Simply a perfect game. The combat, movement, exploration, art direction, and soundtrack are all top tier.. When i first played the game, the feeling i got from the game was magical. Every time i entered a new room shivers went down my back. ONE OF THE POGGEST GAMES EVER RELEASED THIS GAME CURED MY DEPPRESION AND MADE ME HAPPY. ITS AN BANGER AND THE SOUNDTRAXK SLAPPS THE BOSSES ARE FUN THE PLATINUM THEOPHY IS FUN TOGET. U HAVE TO PLAY THIS. Its the best game i ever played in my life everything is perfekt the lengh of the game, the suprises the difficulty, the lore and the bosses. An actual MASTERPIECE i can not stress enough how amazing this game is I completed the base game and am currently moving on to the dlc content. I made this account simply just to review this because this is genuinely the best game i have ever played. Thats perfect you cant surrender in your first dead, it is a souls like... U need explore and learn the mechanics the map is so big and with secret zones... Maybe you could do one oportunity... We need Silksong Now. Literally horrible, the gameplay is boring and bad, the game is very hard and estressful, and ita very confused the routes and the map, i cant even understand whats going on, never buy it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is perfect, the settings and music are killer, the controls are so smooth and the combat is so simple but so perfect. Some parts of this game have tremendous difficulty but the difficulty scaling is done to perfection.Anyone who has never tried this game is making the biggest mistake of their life.. This is the game that comes closest to perfection. This game is a masterpiece, its enviroment, music, enemies, story, gameplay ( that is extraordinary) This game has changed my life, it has a lot of content that anyone, no matter if you are a child or adult, can enjoy.This game is by far, my favorite game you should play it now. Stunning game, 60+ hours of content, free dlc, captivating story, revolutionized the metroidvania genre, difficulty that feels fair, you know why you died (especially since the Traitor Lord rework). fun to speedrun, watch, play randomized, mod, Must play, all around masterpiece.. Gripping atmosphere, responsive controls and great art make this game unforgettable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Few games have been able immerse me in them as much as Hollow Knight did. Exploration, artstyle, bossfights, smoothness of gameplay and above all, the soundtrack... There is just something special about this game that I'm not experienced enough to explain.. The atmosphere,OST, exploration and combat are perfect. Came late to party but I'm glad a came and I hope most give it a shot and not quit halfway and to take on the path of pain for the greatest ever reward ever seen in a video game.. While I have completed this game multiple times over the past couple of years, I just recently achieved one of my greatest feats in gaming, completing the Pantheon of Hallownest and truly conquering this insanely hard yet incredible game. The three talented and hard-working individuals that makeup Team Cherry deserve all of the praise in the world for crafting such a polished, beautiful, and wildly fun Metroidvania platformer that I have gladly poured several hundreds of hours into. There simply is no other game quite like this, especially at its low price point on such a wide variety of platforms, with this amount of content, replayability, and true sense of wonder. The combat is tight and difficult with many possible builds, spells, and charm combinations. The exploration and overall world is purely magic; words cannot justify its excellence and splendor. The sound design and music are all perfect, epic, and atmospheric. One of my favorite games of all time; if you play video games, playing and falling in love with Hollow Knight is inevitable.. This is the first 2D platforming/Metroidvania style game I've ever played, and it's probably gone and ruined all others for me. The amount of content in this game for the price is insane. The music and visuals are just gorgeous. The controls and movement are so well executed. The progression system is practically perfect. The story and lore are so well thought out and well written. The challenge curve is great. I have nothing bad to say about this game. It's probably the first game I can say I feel bad I didn't pay more money for.. Absolute masterpiece, this game is the epitome of excelence. Team cherry went insane while doing this piece of art. I can't fathom a metroidvania that can top this. This is not meat riding, it's just stating facts whether you like it or not. Don't even need to analyze its characteristics, everyone knows that this game is outstanding in every single aspect.. Hollow knight is an amazing game with one of the best osts I’ve ever heard the combat is really simple but incredibly fun and the bosses are incredibly hard and rewarding. I think this rating dont needs a explaination. .. Very nice game ! A metroidvania at it finest. The game isn't perfect but it's still veryy good !. This game is phenomenal! If you like 2d platformers, in particular metroidvanias, you'll like this. It's better than Cuphead, and its combat is quite fun. And the lore I enjoy, partially because it is so dark. The exploration is amazing as well. Constantly finding new enemies, colorful new environments, and new NPCs to interact with is very fun. Unfortunately, I completed most of this game. I wish I could play this for the first time again, because it's just amazing! Can't wait for Silksong to come out! There were times when the game was really angering me, but I'd chalk that up to me **** at the game since I'd never played a 2d platformer on the Nintendo Switch before. So I probably won't have those rage moments with Silksong. But apparently the pacing at the start of the game is really bad. It's fine for a Metroidvania, but most gamers don't like that. So if you are not enjoying the game at first, maybe try looking up a guide through the forgotten crossroads so you can get to the really good parts if you're not a fan of the Crossroads.. Hollow knight is my first metroidvania and one of my favourites **** is a must to play.. Masterclass in gameplay, storytelling, atmosphere, music, exploration and boss fights.. Best Game Ever I Love It, And You Will Love It Too. Can’t Wair for silksong. The best game ever created-------------------------------------------------. This is the best adventure game out there, and there is a reason so many people agree with that. Hollow Knight is a experience so unique in so many aspects, even though it's concepts have alredy been explored elsewhere. This is probably the best looking game i have ever played, it's art is made with such care that it is hard not to fall in love with it. Everywhere has a personality built into it by the art and the music which is also one of the ost out of any game. The gameplay once you get certain abilities gets so fluid and has a learning curve that is so natural and rewarding. Some of the the boss fights in this game are up there as some of the best too. The other part of the gameplay is the metroidvania aspect, which of course, is taken to perfection here. The world feels so connected and cohesive. It is alive while also feeling desolate. This is a must play for everyone, i don't know one person who dislikes it, there is something for everyone, be it the cute characters, the challenging combat or the exploration of Hollownest.. One of the best games I've ever played, easily the best 2D game. The game makes you feel lost, but it's not frustrating; it actually makes finding a new resting point or exploring a new area even more rewarding. Now, 150 hours after I forced myself to pick this game up, I can recommend it to everyone.. Hollow Knight is easily one of the greatest indie games ever made and undoubtedly a modern classic. It has such a massive captivating world filled with enormous and unforgettable areas to explore, deeply enthralling lore to uncover, a colourful cast of characters, and utterly spectacular art direction. Almost every environment you visit in this game feels hand crafted and distinctly unique in its visual design. You can be exploring an awe inspiring long abandoned city one minute and delving into a pitch black underground labyrinth of caverns the next. The mesmerizing look and feel of these locations are also enhanced by a brilliantly enchanting soundtrack which compliments each area perfectly. The mysterious lore surrounding the world is gradually pieced together through cryptic NPC dialogue and subtle environmental clues. The story is surprisingly engaging on an emotional level once you actually gain an understanding of what is going on and many of the key moments in the story are legitimately heartbreaking (especially the final boss battle). The gameplay of Hollow Knight is equally as challenging as it is rewarding. The game does little to hold your hand and you are not given much instruction on where to go. However, this works to the game’s favour as it has the effect of making exploration feel incredibly natural and satisfying. The areas in the game also continuously ramp up in difficulty with regards to traversing them as the player gets more accustomed to the platforming. The combat is simple at first glance but quickly gains a staggering amount of depth and complexity as the game progresses. The healing system rewards aggression as the player can only gain life back if they build up enough “soul” to do so by landing consecutive hits on their enemy. The game also boasts a charm system where the player can acquire numerous charms throughout their playthrough that buff their abilities during combat in various ways. Many of these charms have very situational uses and figuring out when to use each charm is a complex but immensely worthwhile process. The player’s knowledge and skill with this combat system is frequently put to the test by Hollow Knight’s vast and diverse roster of boss fights. When at their best, the bosses in Hollow Knight are absolutely blood pumping battles from start to finish. The aforementioned stellar musical score is at it’s most intense with the boss fights and delivers some of the most breathtaking and enthralling tracks you will ever hear in a game. The best bosses also usually have incredibly compelling lore and visual design to go along with them. Almost every boss in the game tests the player’s skills in a unique way and beating them gradually gets more and more demanding as the game progress. This culminates in Hollow Knight’s endgame content which contains some of the hardest and most gruelling bosses I have ever encountered in a video game. However, even when the challenge is at its peak, the game almost never feels unfair. Each time you die it usually feels as though it was because you didn’t respond to the boss’s attacks correctly and not because the game cheated you. There are notable exceptions to this with a couple endgame challenges that feel borderline unreasonable to complete but these are few and far between. Overall, I believe Hollow Knight has earned the right to be called a masterpiece. It’s extraordinary world design, masterful art and sound design, and unforgiving yet rewarding gameplay all make it a must play for anyone with even a passing interest in 2D platformers or Metroidvanias.. I enjoyed a lot of aspects about this game. The art is so beautiful and detailed, the very different boss fights are difficult, but rewarding when you finally beat them. However, there are aspects of this game that I do not like as much. The exploration is too hard, as the whole map is vast, and there is no hints as to where to go next. Also, the backtracking when you die, to get back to your ghost, or to get back to the boss you are currently fighting, is just dull. It really takes a lot of the fun out of the game, and the backtracking feels more like a chore than fun. In addition, for me, the difficulty becomes too much. I needed too many attempts to beat some of the bosses, to the point where it becomes more frustrating than anything. With some guidance on where to go, and some slightly easier boss fights, this could have been a top game for me. I still think it was fun to play, for the most part.. Godly. If someone says something different idk. Everything is perfect . the soundtrack is goated idk what you cant like about it. Oh boy, what a ride! While it might be overwhelming length and difficulty at first, once it clicks it becomes an instant classic. Everything about this game is a work of art, a truly masterpiece.. One of the best games I've ever played. Original story, beautiful characters, intriguing and definitely challenging. Can't wait for the next one!. Great game with one of the best atmospheres ive seen in gaming, great fluid combat paired with some amazing bossing and breathtaking areas and osts. With such a highly thought of game I really wanted to like this one. I have given it several tries but I just can't waste time not having fun with this game anymore. The main issue is that the combat is awful. And with combat being such a huge part of this game it really makes the entire game an unpleasant experience. What is wrong the combat? First your attack range is incredibly short. Second, many things you attack move towards you after being hit. You only dash forwards. Everything you try to attack is more than likely to hit you in return. So you spend the entire game running away for the things you are trying to fight. Then, after nearly every enemy, you have to stop and heal. You can't wait until you're really low on health because you can only hold enough magic to heal 3 hits and you have to stand there defenseless for a good second for each health point. So just with trying to keep your health up you never really have the flexibility to use your magic for other things. There is an equippable upgrade that's supposed to increase your attack range. But it really doesn't make a noticeable difference. I think that the world they made is interesting and the art is nice. So I give it as high of a score as possible for that. But the game has to be fun to play as well. With so many other options out there I just can't give this one my time anymore.. Hollow knight is peak level gameplay and is incomparable to any other **** you want hours of amazing fun for the best prices,play **** is a musical masterpiece and emotional story.Hollow Knight is more than a game,it's a story.. Gold standard of metroidvania games, Im not sure it will ever be topped. My only complaint is that silksong is taking too long.. Literally peak. It's a bit confusing, but that's by design. I love the characters and story. The boss fights are really tough, but fair. It genuinely has some of the best boss fights of any game I've played. Learning the patterns one death at a time and finding what works until you finally win is incredibly satisfying. I can't think of anything negative about this game. (Except for the Grey Mourner quest). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Hollow Knight is a real masterpiece, this music, this graphics, this plot and these characters! And above all, the gameplay itself! Unforgettable emotions! Outstanding position!I recommend everyone to give our little worm a chance!. Perfect game. Very beautiful with a very captivating atmosphere. Very hard at the beginning. I was quite frustrating at first, but at last i really loved this game.. If you like metroidvanias, hollow knight is your game. I have spent 50+ hours exploring the depths of this world and for a cheap price of 15 dollars this game is a must play.. Hated how difficult it was at first but as soon as I started getting into the lore and story I was super hooked. This also has one of the best soundtracks of all time imo. For me this is one of the greatest games of all time. What makes this game so great is a combination of great elements that come together to make an amazing experience. First of all i would say that the exploration of this amazingly detailed world is the best thing about the game. It is a game with so many different areas that are visually distinct, have unique enemies, bosses, and mechanics that you can truly get lost in. The game is similar in structure to games like super metroid and dark souls in the sense that there is a sort of intended order in which you explore the world, but you are able to split off and play the game in a unique order because all the areas are connected to eachother and they all have different entrances and exits. To summarize the game has an amazingly complex and detailed world that you can get truly lost in. Another great aspect of the game is the gameplay. The gameplay consists of of combat, exploration and platforming. These are performed by exploring at your own accord as the is no mission system in the game or anything like that. You start the game with relatively few abilities, but throughout the game you get a whole lot of of abilities that make the combat and platforming enjoyable. The thing that really makes the combat shine in my opinion is the boss- and enemy design. The bosses and enemies are very well designed and they progressively more complex throughout the game. Altogether a lot of fun. The story of hollow knight is quite untraditional. There is not a lot of dialogue or cutscenes in the game. The story is moreso told throughout conversations with npc's and by looking at the environment. If you put in the effort, uncovering the mysteries and hidden story of hollow knight is a lot of fun, although you may stille be a bit confused at the end of the game. For some negatives of the game, there are a few small ones that dont bother me personally, but that i will still list. First of all the game starts of a bit slow, with wich i mean the first hour or two. These earliest hours of the game are without your first upgrade, and they do feel a bit slow and confusing. if u have stopped in this portion of the game, i would urge you to play on just an hour or two maybe three until you get some upgrades and abilities. Another ""problem"" is that you are bound to get lost, wich is part of the game but i know some people dont like that. The last negative point is that, to reach the best and most fun ending in the game, you have to put some things together in your mind that are almost impossible to do during a first playthrough. My advice is, do not be afraid to look up on the internet what to do for this ending, but also in general if you dont know what to do or where to go. The game is also really cheap for its playtime on a first playthrough (20-40h). This combined with a great world, super fun gameplay and an interesting story, makes it a game i would recommend any fan of metroidvanias, action games and exploration drives games gives a shot. Thanks for reading this, i hope it was helpful. Must own if you like exploration games and can get past the difficulty. There's no one thing that makes the game special, it's really a combination of a million things done perfectly (ost, combat, secrets, abilities, traversal, attention to detail, etc.) The only thing is that some people think it starts off slow and only gets good after about 3-5 hours. I would disagree but it is a common take so the game does nothing for you at first maybe you just need more time.. Absolutely brilliant video game, the only real way to describe it is with the word ICONIC. Iconic sound design, characters, music, maps and especially the combat, the way such simple combat feels so complex and lively is really magical.. AMAZING GAME ive 112% the entire game 4 pantheons all charms white palace and path of pain done most achievements all benches all life blood and well most of what this game has to offer its a must buy 10/10 game truly legendary. A legendary metroidvania, my favorite game. Anxious for Silksong, it will be amazing.. i'm beyond impressed that TC was able to craft a game this good and this large in just 2 years, with 2 people and a shoestring budget. if they manage to make Silksong with even a fraction of this quality, it would still be incredible. By what they say and with the time they have to make the game, it's likely several times better than this game. honestly, that scares me. I can't even imagine how they could do that, or what there is that they could improve.. One of the best metroidvania in Indie game! the game is very solid , good and very reactive! Cant wait to play Silksong. Wow. just WOW. This ""game"" does nothing new or innovative or anything to push this genre forward. The only point for this ""game"" existing is for the devs to say that they can copy other peoples work. Everything single thing in this ""game"", from the ost to the art style has all been done before and done better. Now the devs are using the Silksong hype to sell more copies of this ""game"". Silksong is never going to happen but they dont want you to know the ugly truth.. A promising start, but is also not clear on how to actually progress through the game. Combat is nothing special if not impractical for down attacks, who's execution in games like Rogue Legacy 2 is much more intuitive and easy to get down without compromising on the notorious difficulty of the genre.. It was a fine experience and I had a lot of fun - however it is very confusing when you are not able to surpass some levelterain - is it because I lack the right ability or is it because I am to dumb?. It is just perfect and very beautiful. Looking forward to the second part.. This is one of the best games of all time. the art style, hardness, level design and the story is perfect. There is nothing bad about Hollow Knight. Even if you hate games you need to try this masterpiece. So to sum it up: This is perfect for everyone and everyone should buy it.. okay... it's insane. took me four tries to fall in love with it. For all, who don't like it: Don't go in wiki. Create screenshots yourself if you hit a dead end with missing skill. The game becomes nearly perfect afterwards. so much quality and quantity of such a small team. Incredible work. Team Cherry, thank you for this masterpiece you given us. This game has amazing bosses. Every area feels special and unique. It's difficulty is definitely tough but makes this game feel incredibly satisfying. The NPCs are fantastically weird. Hell, everything in this game is weird! There is much more I could say, but Hollow Knight is a perfect video game. And you should play it right now.. One of the best indie games of all time. I bought this game because it was cheap and people said it's fun. Ended up being one of the best games I've played. It feels like I'm stealing from the devs because the game is 15$ even though it's 1000 times better than most AAA games.. Just play it. Go ahead! I ins","i have really enjoyed this game and the +100 playhours propably tell it . beginning might be boring simple and slow but it gets better and better . pantheon 5 is the most annoying, tedious, boring, stupid, and garbage time wasters ."
323.MLB 09: The Show,This was the iconic step up for the MLB The Show franchise and also the first I purchased and played non stop. Many hours were invested in this game. Despite some obvious flaws this I think will be the game that future franchise copies will be measured against.,this was the iconic step up for the MLB The Show franchise . despite some obvious flaws this is the game that future franchise copies will be measured against .
324.Blast Corps,"I love blowing stuff up. A lot. Not enough characters still? Fine. I’ll kee. Love this game! So addicting and satisfying to play. The missions are great, and I love the variety of vehicles to use throughout. The only knock would be how sometimes it can be tricky to figure out what they even want you to do. Also, the graphics are a little tough, but what wasn’t for the N64 haha!. A rather unique little arcade game that takes ""collateral damage"" to a whole new level. Smash, bash and crash your way through levels of destruction in a simple but addictive formula that's difficult to pigeonhole. The most important thing is, it's fun.. Very boring l like the music but the gameplay is just a complete zzz snooze fest.. Ehhhhh. I liked the game...didnt love it, just liked it. It was fun at times, but the game got boring. The different vehicles all did their own thing which was cool, but to me, the game wasnt as great as everyone else says.... When I looked at this game I thought it would be BAD. When I played I was addicted and loved it and it is one of the best Nintendo 64 games of all time.. Rare knew what they were doing between 1996 and 2001. Never have I played a more uniquely satisfying, acceptably challenging, ""it's your fault you messed up"" kind of game. This is one of few games I frequently go back to on the Nintendo 64 that doesn't feel outdated. I can't think of another destruction puzzle game as good as this. If you're a Nintendo 64 collector, get this game ASAP. You won't regret it.. Another great N64 game that required time and patience. It wasn't the easiest game by any means, nor the most difficult but you had so much fun playing through it. You never got bored of the game, or at least I didn't and I can't say that about many games. If you own an N64 then you must own this game.","a rather unique little arcade game that takes ""collateral damage"" to a whole new level . if you own an N64 then you must own this game . i can't think of another destruction puzzle game as good as this ."
325.Ori and the Will of the Wisps,"This is just my personal experience and opinion. I've heard great things about this game in both its story and gameplay but I don't personally see it. I already don't really care for story in games and paired with what I think is just mediocre gameplay leaves me wanting to play something else. I have it at a four because I have friends that say otherwise about this game.. Masterpiece is the right word. When it came out I thought to myself ""can'tbe better than the first one"". I was happily proven wrong. Still can't say it's ""better"", but it definitely is on the same shelf. It does make justice to its reputation. Did many things better than the first one.. This game drew me in with it's graphics and art style, but was kind of a drag playing through mostly because of the boring combat system. The combat was fixed in Ori 2 which makes that game far superior.. Beautiful game. Absolutely love it. I think OBF is better for me personally but I highly recommendthis game. The boss fights can be pretty tough though and it is way longer than its predecessor.. Larger, prettier, more forgiving: Ori and the Will of the Wisp is a worthy successor Ori and the Blind Forest combined the charme of a Rayman game with the cruelty of Dark Souls. Ori and the Will of the Wisp makes no bones about its heritage, but attempts to bring meaningful improvement to the weaker aspects of its predecessor. The core game is unchanged: Ori, a small woodland spirit who might as well hail from a Studio Ghibli film, jumps, runs and fights his way through a collection of landscapes organized as a 2D metroidvania game. All the core movement mechanics and combat skills are still here and just as delightful to employ as ever. The Wisps brought Ori a few more combat moves, which is nice of them, but we have to pick and choose which three of them we want mapped to the upper three action button (the lowest as ever triggers the jump). This is an unwelcome change from the Blind Forest, where the entire move roster was accessible at all times, but I do get that when you add more moves to a character whose move set already made use of every feasible button combination, something has to give. What else has changed? The art has improved quite a bit, which is high praise since the Blind Forest already was a stunner ****. There are a lot more detailed animations bringing the environments to life, and the regions are much more varied now, as are the enemies. The difficulty curve has been flattened a bit, mostly because Ori doesn’t die at the merest touch of a hostile bit of environment any more. A few bona fide boss fights as well as chase scenes brought over from the Blind Forest make for satisfying region climaxes. There is quite a bit more real estate to explore. A few NPCs handing out exposition and quests are a welcome addition. The script isn’t exactly stellar, but I was surprised how much drama and pathos can be wrung out of utilitarian writing in a children’s story that is uncompromising enough to go to some surprisingly dark and fascinating places. This game tells the kind of children’s tale that doesn’t talk down to its audience and does include the odd scare now and then. All in all, the Will of the Wisp is a kinder, gentler, prettier Ori. It only occasionally tries to prove a rage quit from you, except for the final fight, which, it might be argued, is allowed to be unfair at times. And now and then it even lobs a surprisingly good story beat at you. All of this makes Ori and the Will of the Wisps an excellent Metroidvania. TLDR: Come for the pretty, stay for the challenge. Or the satisfying movement. Or the joy and tears the story will bring. There are many reasons.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mechanics: The mechanics of the game are awesome, there are a lot of moves and abilities that you can unlock throughout the ****: Every frame of the game is wallpaper.Music: It is the cherry on the cake. It's the reason why the game feels so magical.Story: It's quite short and there are a lot of secondary missions that my point of view don't aport something relevant to the gameFinally, comparing with Ori and The Blind Forest, there are a lot of things the designers improved here. Like introducing Boss Fighting, A greater map, An environment more alive, automatic saving, improve abilities, and so on.. A truly magical game. It's one of those games that are polished in terms of gameplay, story, music and over aesthetics, and it's short! What not to love about it!. Makes you think is an easy and relaxing game then it puts you against difficult bosses with buggy controls. Rage game.. I hate those primal aspid looking green guys. Legit **** game design at it,s peak.. Ori and the will of the wisps is, along with the first Ori game, among the best game ever created. An amazing heart touching have with superb platforming, lots of areas to explore and probably the greatest Metroidvania ever (sorry Hollow Knight). A must play.. This game is one of my all-time favorites. I bought this game because I loved Hollow Knight and was looking for similar games. While this game doesn't take the crown from Hollow Knight in my opinion, it comes quite close. I played Ori and the Blind Forest first and liked it pretty well. The most impressive thing about this game to me is that they improved literally every single element from Blind Forest. Will of the Wisps takes the flaws of Blind Forest and fixes them and takes the good of Blind Forest and makes it absolutely incredible. The graphics are drop-dead gorgeous. The scenery looks like it could have been the subject of a Van Gogh painting or something. I don't have the words to describe how good the music is. Listening to the soundtrack is nearly a spiritual experience for me. The gameplay is fantastic. Ori's movement is so fluid and incredibly satisfying. The movement is so fun I don't actually want to use fast travel. The combat is probably the biggest improvement from Blind Forest and allows for a lot of creativity on the player's part. The story is beautiful and the ending nearly moves me to tears every time. I'm out of words. Buy this game. It's so good.. A Metroidvania game notwithstanding, a lack of knowing where to go next gets tiresome after a while. The game is absolutely gorgeous and the music, as always, is some of the best to ever grace your ears, but, much like the first game, not knowing where to go next becomes a tedious chore. Having said all of that, the game is absolutely beautiful and definitely worth your time.. One of the best game ever from all possible points of view. Best gameplay, best soundtrack, best storytelling, best visuals, best characters ... A game (two games actually) with a real soul.. This game has amazing visuals,music and is very fun, but also challenging,I've beaten star wars jedi survivor on the hardest difficulty, and it is a similar difficulty to the normal difficulty of this game. I really enjoy playing this game when i feel tired as it's very relaxing.. Great visuals, great gameplay, beautiful world. I can't get enough of it. The smooth operation on the Switch is also excellent. Play it.. takes ori 1 and makes it an rpg, but like not like too much of an rpg, just enough. I liked Blind Forest better. (Ranked it a 9) But WotW is still Ori and it’s fantastic. Highly recommended.. Strengths:- graphics and artistic style- music- precise controls- level design- gameplay and progression negative points:- unstable frame rate- small freezes. An incredible metroidvania with one of the best and most satisfying gamesense in the whole industry, with a deep and funny combat and a story and graphics that complete the experience. I found some technical problems when I want to enter to other section of the map.. The game is horrible, boring, difficult and it costed me 40 dollars. The worst game ever. Also, it doesn't let me to put a 1. All the Osts touched me so much. Feeling very emotional from the stories and cutscenes this game presents. The gameplay is absolutely stunning. I can clearly see some inspirations it takes form other game but it is a big plus!. From the sound design, the music, the gameplay, the graphism, everything is so well made in this game.. This game is enchanting, visually stunning with amazing musics. The gameplay is fast and pleasant. The only thing I disliked about this game is that playing it for the second time is pretty boring,which means that once you finished once it's over.. One of the best games ever made, full of beuti, well made level design and great game mechanics.. The best game xbox studios ever made. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the greatest games ever created, and you need to play it. From stunning visuals, story, and soundtrack to the most smooth platforming and amazing combat, this game exceeds all **** and the Will of the Wisps is a platformer in which you play as a little spirit named Ori, who gets caught in a storm while flying on his owl friend, Ku. He is left abandoned in an unknown place, separated from Ku. From there you must attempt to navigate your way through an unfamiliar, hostile world, and avoid the terrifying creature, **** and the Will of the Wisps is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The world is lush with so much depth in the background, in the world, and on the edges of the screen. The locations range from the frosty Baur’s Reach, The lush, colorful, and whimsical Luma Pools, To the eerie and pitch black Mouldwood Depths. And to top this all off, it is all painted by **** story is engaging and extremely sad, where we get to take a look at how the villain came to be, as well as Ori’s journey. The soundtrack throughout this is absolutely incredible, from the most epic boss battle themes you’ll ever hear to the very sad tracks. It is all played on an orchestra, and has some of the coolest songs ever. My favourites are Luma Pools, a beautiful song with a choir, A Shine Apon Inkwater Marsh which has such a cool climax to the song that gives me shivers every time, and Mora the Spider, an epic boss track. All of these songs fit so well with the game and contribute significantly to the game. The platforming and combat in this game is some of the best I've seen. The movement is so smooth, with dashing and double jumps making the platforming feel amazing. The combat is super, super fun, as you get to unlock really cool weapons and chain together attacks and spells to defeat enemies. The shard system is awesome too, giving you different perks. Overall, this is my favourite game of all time, and if you haven’t played it before, you’re seriously missing out. This game is so incredible, props to the developers for creating this masterpiece.. Genuinely one of my favorite experiences in the past 5 years. A wonderful metroidvania with great platformer control, a beautiful OST, and emotional story. What a great way to end off the Ori games.. THIS GAME IS JUST PERFECT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH HHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh. First metroidvania I ever played and game turned out to be a masterpiece. Amazing boss fights. Good Game. Can give it a second try in future, I might like the gameplay and visuals. I usually don’t play games like this but I gave it a shot because it was on Xbox game pass and this honestly one of the best games I’ve ever played it’s beautiful environment/graphics and solid controls make this game a must play the story is also touching and sincere you actually care about the characters. An instant classic for me and like I said I don’t platformer games.. Ori and The Will of The Wisps is Amazing. Another Masterpiece from Moon Studios.. IMMORTAL OAK INTRODUCTION: Ori and the Will of the Wisps was developed by Moon Studios and released in March 2020. As the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, it boasts improvements in all aspects, both technically and creatively, enhancing the beauty of an already excellent title. The game has been fully completed at 100%. FIRST STEPS: The introduction of Ori and the Will of the Wisps consists of short playable sequences interspersed with scenes illustrating the growth of Ori and Ku, the young owl born after the events of the first chapter. These scenes provide information about the characters of Ori and Ku for those who haven't played the first game and showcase their development for those who have. Moreover, the small movement phases give players a taste of what the gameplay will be like throughout the game. Once the introductory sequence is completed, the player finds themselves alone, fighting the corruption that afflicts the forest of Niwen, and a good set of skills is essential to survive and progress in the story. Finally, during the save creation, players can select the difficulty level, which is divided into three stages, with pretty huge gaps. ESCAPING FROM ""THINGS"": The gameplay of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is that of a pure Metroidvania, a genre based on the progression of the game map through power-ups found at different points in the story. This ensures that players have several hours of exploration to overcome previously inaccessible paths. Additionally, the gameplay is fast-paced and frenetic thanks to various obtainable dashes. Like the first game, there will be various power-ups, with at least one in each game area, allowing players to explore hidden portions of the map. However, this second installment adds several complexities not present in the first one, incorporating more distinct RPG elements. Players can equip up to 3 usable abilities with different effects, both for combat and exploration. These abilities can be freely swapped at any time without cost, and the game freezes to simplify this exchange. There are also several equipable perks available from the pause menu, which provide effective buffs to Ori's combat skills or sustenance. Passive upgrades that unlock through game progression are also present. A hub with various interactable NPCs has been introduced, useful for purchasing and upgrading the aforementioned abilities. It is also designed to accommodate different secondary quests that provide in-game currency, damage and sustenance upgrades, as well as further development of the game's storyline. One of the most appreciated mechanics from the first game, the enemy chase scenes, has been multiplied and greatly improved, adding exciting variety to the gameplay. Finally, true bosses with unique mechanics and designs have been added. THE RADIANCE: The most impressive and carefully crafted aspect of this game is undoubtedly its graphics and the aesthetics of its game world. Every detail, be it animations, backgrounds, cutscenes, or enemies, is meticulously designed. In each game environment, players can pause to admire the background and discover an infinite number of details. The use of colors to evoke certain sensations is carefully crafted, with darker and gloomier areas adorned with vibrant colors to provide a sense of tranquility for players, and tranquil areas where formidable enemies lurk, easily predictable thanks to the game map's design. The menus themselves reveal the passion with which this game was developed, with drawings and illustrations that update during gameplay in response to encountered events. The addition of three-dimensional cutscenes further showcases the studio's skill in pushing their boundaries, bringing to life an astonishing title like this. THE CALL OF THE FOREST: The soundtrack of this game is impressive and surpasses that of its predecessor, incorporating different styles and evolving the ones already used. The attention to sound effects perfectly complements what has been described for the aesthetic aspect. BUT WHY A 9? PROS: The merits of this game are so numerous that they are indescribable in such few characters. This is one of those reasons to purchase a console, as it was exclusive for years. It is an almost flawless title that reaches aesthetic levels capable of setting a very high bar in the 2D platforming landscape. CONS: The drawbacks are extremely limited. They could be the limited number of different enemies or the potential bugs that can be encountered. The lack of a true endgame area, present in the first game, can also be considered a con. Additionally, the inspiration from Hollow Knight could be seen as a downside since various features, such as the amulets, are clearly influenced. Lastly, due to the game's frenetic pace, combat can often become chaotic and it is easy to take damage without realizing it. RATING: Gameplay: 9,5 Music: 9,5 Story: 8,5 Exploration: 9,5 _. Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.. Excellent sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest that improves on the original in every way. It's apparent that the series took some lessons from Hollow Knight, and the combat and sense of exploration from that game can be seen here. The art design looks absolutely fantastic, and the feeling of movement as you navigate through well-designed watery worlds and forests is a rush. On the downside, although it's very good, this game doesn't quite match Hollow Knight. The combat is a bit messy, and a step below the precise movements of Hollow Knight. I was very ""meh"" about the storyline. It's a bit oversentimental for my taste.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Much worse than its predecessor - less captivating story, unnecessary RPG elements, worse soundtrack. Combat is more interesting. In other words, regression in 3 departments and progression in 1.. I like this game it's very great and I'm still making my way through this big up to Microsoft. This game is an artistic masterpiece and one of the best experiences of my life, the right combination of gameplay, story and visual effects. For me the best jump n run game out there. what a incredible movement and graphics. Ori and the blind Forest was good already, but this take it to a next level. This is Pixar animation level, simply amazing story, gameplay and soundtrack. A must buy for any player.. I didn't like the first Ori very much. I thought enemies were hard to see, some of the platforming was frustrating, the chase sequences frustrating, navigating the world a pain... Wasn't a fan. Will of the Wisps solves basically all the issues I had with the first. It's even prettier than the first game. The different locales all look and feel different, and the level design is improved. The action is also better this time around. Instead of shooting tiny dumb sparks, Ori has a cool spectral sword. Secondary weapons involve a wimpy bow, a grenade-like projectile, a Guilty Gear Burst, and a massive exploding spear. The spear is awesome. And the improved arsenal actually comes in useful in the brand spanking new boss fights. Boss fights! In an Ori game! They're actually pretty fun if a bit messy. I still have the odd issue here and there. Some late-game platforming can get frustrating, though it's not as bad as some of the stuff from the first game. The final form of the final boss actually confused me, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Was I supposed to find a platform that was off-screen, like in the previous steps of the boss fight? Where's the boss attacking from? What's with all this smoke? I can't see anything, help a brother out. Anywho, that issue only took a few minutes to resolve, and is a pretty minor blemish on this very good game. The story even has some poignant moments. Will of the Wisps won't make it onto my all-time favorite list, but it is extremely well made. It's gorgeous, touching, and just plain fun.. If you loved the first game you will not be disappointed. The combat system is so much better and it takes inspiration from Hollow Knight. This is what video game sequels should aspire to be.. A brilliant sequel to an already brilliant first game. This game is the peak of 2D platformers on next gen consoles.. this game is a blast to play with agile movement complimented perfectly by level masterfuly weaved level design. the music and enviornments are beautiful, i dont think its a stretch to say that this is the best looking game ever made. my only problem with this game is the lack of unique enemies and intresting combat. in every area the same handful of copy-paste opponents can be found and the best way to defeat them in to smack them with your sword. overall, moon studios has done a fantastic job creating a masterpeice ****.. Ok so, BF was awesome, FUN and flowed to the finish. Well, Wisps is going to crack you. I think the devs want some sort of hero badge for hardest platform ever. They actually built in cheats to hack your jumps FFS, and navigation makes no sense. You will have to search YT every 10 minutes for the hidden clues that nobody will ever spot/ fail.. Ori is the greatest platform game experience ever it’s laterally epic in every way .. I started playing the first part a few days ago, to be honest I didn't know the franchise, in short I loved it! Now I'm starting with the second part, but I know it won't disappoint me, I loved the music of the first one, and the characters are totally beautiful just like his art style. 20/10 A love letter to video games.. OMG!! That music and the atmosphere so awesome. Every time i see, i want to play again.. Its visuals are beautiful, its gameplay satisfying, its music powerful, and its story touching. Since I completed Ori and the Blind Forest a couple of years ago, a followup had been high on my list of anticipated games, and I am beyond happy to say that Ori and the Will of the Wisps gave me everything I wanted in a sequel and more. With a relaxed pace playthrough lasting me just over 12 hours, the launch price of $29.99 is well worth the cost of entry. The performance of the game was excellent on my PC (980 Ti/i5 6600k/16 GB DDR4) that is approaching 5 years old, and aside from a couple of minor audio/visual bugs that did not impact my gameplay experience, the game was incredibly well polished for its day one release, which is refreshing in this day and age. I don't know whether Moon Studios plans on making Ori into a trilogy/saga, or if they will explore new ideas for their next project, but they have certainly gained my loyalty as a fan and I will be eagerly awaiting their next story.. Best game that I experienced in my Xbox one, but I feel ashamed that microsoft is just paying attention to dead Halo!!!. Just like ""Ori and the Blind Forest"", the sequel is a stunning game with lots of surprises. A little bit more difficult from the first one, mainly because of the bosses and being able to choose only 3 special abilities at the time, it introduces auto-save which is very helpful. The landscapes, the music and the story are still amazing, the plot is even better than in the first game. The only issue for me, personally, was the amount of frustrating combats which, for me, don't suit to actual ambiance and style of Ori games. Nevertheless, this is still one of the best platform games out there, totally worth playing. Looking forward for the next title from the series.. An excellent sequel, not quite as good as the original but still really enjoyable.. A beautiful game with a compelling narrative, adorable creatures, and (for me) a perfect balance of challenge/difficulty. Worthwhile even if you don't usually like platformers. It reminded me of Hollow Knight but is MUCH more accessible, less punishing. I loved everything about the game except some of the music, which struck me as a little overdetermined in parts, a little too Hollywood.. Absolutely masterpiece! Amazing storytelling in the stunning environment. If the boss fights weren't hard, I would finish whole game in one take.. Masterpiece. One of the best games last generation and one of the best platformers ever made.. Ori and The Will of The Wisps - One of the best games ever. Literally no negative things to say about it. There is no words to describe the beauty of this game. Story, mechanics, gameplay and music. I never seen any other platformer to be that good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best game ever it very fun and I am playing on my Xbox series s and it very fun this is must play one of best games made by xbox studios. This game is beautiful. Like wow, I really think it’s in the Top 10 most gorgeous games I’ve ever played. The score is incredible too. The story is so heartfelt but also isn’t afraid to get dark at times. The moment to moment gameplay can be tough but so rewarding and addictive. It’s a fair kind of difficulty that challenged me but didn’t break me. Of course at times I got very frustrated at some chase sequences & puzzles, but for a Metroidvania style game I never felt lost. Ori & Ku are adorable & I’m really curious as to where Moon Studios can take the series next. The biggest downside aside from momentary difficulty spikes is the tendency for the background to get blurry, like a motion blur but a lot more distorted. I highly HIGHLY doubt it’s my Xbox, this is the first game I’ve played on my brand new Series X & I played it on 4K 120fps. Not sure what the blur was about, but it cost me more than a few deaths at times. There wasn’t an option in the graphic settings to turn off any motion blur so I’m at a loss as to what design choice that was. I still highly recommend this title to anyone with an Xbox as long as you’re ok with tough but fair platforming.. EN: A phenomenal sequel to the first part. The game is pure art. The level design is fantastic, the graphics are concise and extremely vivid with lots of beautiful colors. The controls are simple and basic, and the boss fights are extremely challenging, the gameplay is fluid and on the next-gen Xbox supports 120hz in 4K, the music is amazing, a perfect synergy of graphics, gameplay, music. There was a small problem with one level, but Microsoft quickly released the patch and made that stage easier. The main character is great and has abilities that are unlocked and extremely helpful in further progress. One of the best Xbox exclusives. SRB: Fenomenalan nastavak prvog dela. Igra je čista umetnost. Level dizajn je fantastičan, grafika je jezgrovita i izuzetno živopisna uz mnoštvo lepih boja. Kontrole su jednostavne i bazične, a boss fightovi izuzetno izazovni, gejmplej je fluidan i na next-gen Xboxu podržava 120hz u 4K, Muzika je neverovatna, perfektna sinergija grafike, gejmpleja, muzike. Postojao je mali problem sa jednim levelom, ali je Microsoft brzo izbacio patch i olakšao taj stage. Glavni lik je odličan i poseduje ability-je koji se otključavaju i izuzetno pomažu u daljem progresu. Jedna od najboljih Xbox ekskluziva.. Ori is a must play on game pass this game is so beautiful the hdr use is incredible best work i’ve seen. It's Marvelous! When you play it, you feel that you are playing a ""painting"", that's Magic. This Game is Magic! It's better than first game and that is AWESOME. The first was Perfect, this sequel is a Jewel. This game is amazing. It has a magical artstyle that makes it feel like a marvellous painting that you can play. Exploring every nook and cranny of this magical world and making your way around diverse obstacles has nevr felt so good and defeating enemies has never felt so satisfying. All of this takes place while also being accompanied by the most magical soundtrack and stunning visuals. This is one of the few games that I consider as being, simply said, near perfect.. Veryyyyyyyyy good! This is one of the best games I have ever played. For those who have an Xbox, I definitely recommend this game.. Pros: - Graphics, presentation, themes - Vastly improved combat, great boss fights - good platforming sections - charming story with a great ending So-So: - Side missions, and in general most side content (shards/powerups) are uninteresting and underwhelming/ unrewarding. Cons: - The metroidvania elements in this game aren't very deep, I tried to look through every nook and cranny only to find life and mana powerups, and money 95% of the time. It all ties back to the so-so section... the shards was a wasted opportunity, rarely there, and not very interesting. Will of the wisps is an amazing linear experience, with improved combat, emotional story, and pretty good platforming. The side content and metroidvania elements, however was underwhelming. I wouldn't try to 100% the game on your first playthrough, because I think I would've enjoyed this game more if I hadn't tried to look for everything.. This game has been overlooked. It's great in every area, from art design to gameplay, from sound effects to score. It doesn't have digital sports cards or machine guns, so it will never sell as well as the big dogs, but Ori's quality is extremely high.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very kind and beautiful game. Amazing soundtracks. Thanks creator's for this game.. Best metroidvania game ever. The story, graphics, sounds, gameplay mechanics and variety, music everything is very good. It's a masterpiece.. art design - 10/10 atmosphere - 10/10 sound - 10/10 game design - 9/10 gameplay - 9/10 The best and the most beautiful platformer I have ever played. 10/10. Amazing game. Awesome story and awesome graphics. Very good controls, Moon studios nailed it.. Beautiful world, great music and story. GamePlay is awesome. So many skills. I don't know what to say, I'm not a reviewer. It's a really fantastic game.. Its a beatiful game, smooth movements and precise controls bring an A+ experience. Also difficulty is just right, being a challenging but fun experience at the same time. The game has beautiful visuals, but I had a real challenge with already 1st boss wolf on a normal difficulty, which did not at all correspond to the overall game difficulty before the encounter. Boss fight require some sharp actions, but clumsy controls don't really make it easy, neither the overall mechanics when you end up in a corner with no way to avoid hits and die instantly. ""abandon challenge"" option in a pause menu tells something anyway - instead of balancing the gameplay, lets just add an option to skip some parts of it. Seems like another game which make up difficulty not by gameplay challenges, but overall controls and mechanics clumsiness.. I usually don't rate games 10/10, but Ori and the Will of the Wisps is AMAZING. I didn't really like the first Ori game - yes, the art design was cool, but the fighting was so boring. Moon studios learned their lesson: they took everything that was nice at the first game, upgraded it, and created this masterpiece. The fighting is awesome, the level design and the puzzling are interesting, the story is more emotional. The game's score is one of the prettiest soundtracks I've heard. The bosses are intense and memorable. I'm new to the Action-Platformer genre, and Ori and the Will if the Wisps surly gave me a taste for more.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really enjoyed Ori 2 a lot. I struggled to get into the first game because of its save system and long opening but Ori 2 I found more engaging from the start. I appreciate that it was always clear where I needed to go and the warping system made it easy to cross the map. There were a few sections which weren't super fun like a section in which you have to navigate through the dark but for the most part it was really enjoyable. The other issue I ran into was that it crashed as soon as I beat the final boss. I was still able to watch the ending on YouTube but that still kind of ****. Regardless ori 2 was a pleasant surprise :). Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an awesome metroidvania platformer and one of the best Xbox exclusives of 2020. It’s got an engaging story, fantastic gameplay and overall a worthy addition to your Xbox game collection!. All aspects of this game are extremely well-done. From the graphics to the mec","i've heard great things about this game in both its story and gameplay . but paired with what i think is just mediocre gameplay leaves me wanting to play something else . this game drew me in with its graphics and art style, but was kind of a drag playing through mostly because of the boring combat system ."
326.Sid Meier's Civilization III,"Best grand strategy game of all time... New versions are more fine-tuned and with more beautiful graphics but neither version of the game impact as Civ III impact in his release time. Infinite options with simple concepts. This is where Civ3 starts shining: There are many core gameplay mechanics, that started here and which improved the game a lot: ivs with own traits and unique units, better diplomatic possibilities and so on. I played Civ 2 and 1 and maybe they were great in their time, but today they are outdated and the fun begins in Civ 3.. Very good game, with excellent evolution. A good diplomacy interface with other civilizations. The only reason I don't give it 10 is because it's very slow when the whole map is revealed, the NPC's play calculation time starts to take a long time. It was the game I played for hours back when I was a kid. Now, it's different. Pros.: - It was a huge step forward after Civ 2. - Graphics, layouts, maps - all was good. - New unique features of the civilizations. - Different victory types and automatization. Cons.: - Weird face animation that became a meme. - Always backstabbing. Everyone ALWAYS backstabs. - It was hard to actually win and advance in a diplomatic way. There was always a moment when your neighbors, even friends will betray or just start hating you. - As a small nation - very low chances to win. If you're squeezed between neighbors - you're done. - Always needed to fight at the beginning made the game quite annoying. Resource problem happened multiple times with the coal.. Without doubt my favourite installment within the Civilization franchise. The fact that almost a decade after it still **** me in like the first day is a testament to its ever lasting appeal. You only know when you start a game but you never know when you'll put it down or finish it; it's just so addictive unlike Civ V which has no lasting appeal. For me Civ 3 felt like digital chess. It's a game that has you continually thinking what your next moves will be and rewards handsomely forward-thinking and carefully planning ahead. I even like the graphics which are not as cartoonish as Civ IV. Along with Brian Reynold's Alpha Centauri, Civ 3 is my all-time favourite game. The amounts of hours I've poured into it can be tallied by the thousands. If you like 4X TBS games you owe it to yourself to play this classic. The Conquests expansion infused new life by way of historic scenarios which are fleshed out very nicely. Special mention goes to Rise of Rome and the Napoleon scenario where you relive the glory and bloodshed of the lost Empires. Civ IV has overshadowed its predecessor significantly but Civ 3 will always have a place in my heart and harddrive and I return to it at least twice a year.. I chose Civilization III as my first Civilization game because I wanted to see how the series evolved over the time. As a newcomer, take my review with a grain of salt since there may be some concepts I did not fully comprehend. Civilization III had big ups and downs. It’s an aesthetically beautiful time sink and similar to Heroes of Might and Magic and X-COM (although mechanically I would say Civilization is more similar to Settlers), it hypnotizes you every time you play it. You lose concept of real life and time and end up playing for several hours non-stop. I’ve had the feeling it plays very much like a board game and I wouldn’t be surprised if Civilization series were heavily influenced by them. There is no real campaign. You decide the rules (map, weather, victory conditions etc.) and start your custom game which can easily take dozens of hours. There are many civilizations to choose from but they are diverse enough to offer unique gameplay. You start in ancient times, build cities, research technologies, conquer other civilizations. There are some aspects I did not really like though. Firstly, some early strategies have too much influence on your fate. Don’t build enough cities or invest enough in technology, you may find yourself in an unwinnable state. AI obviously cheats in harder difficulties so you’ll have to play in specific strategies in order to win rather than a flexibility on strategies. Diplomacy is pretty much broken and the AI never accepts your fair proposals, making the entire game mechanic obsolete. Corruption may sound like an interesting idea but in the case of Civilization III, it does more harm than good. Also, in mid to late game, you end up micromanaging hundreds of units and one turn can take quite a long time. I think it would be fair to say a game in Civilization III takes way too long with plenty of downtime. I would say Civilization III aroused my interest to the series and I will definitely be playing other titles. On the other hand, I can’t ignore its flaws and I’m pretty confident I won’t return to Civilization III specifically.. OVERALL - 84% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 6/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 6/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 10/10 A good addition to the series.. Superb game! Literally SUPERB! Days I spent playing this masterpiece. I liked every part of this game.. Sid Meier's Civilization III, and all the remain franchise games, are all that a turn-based strategy game should be. For me, as a fan, they are a reference to the genre. I played a lot more than Steam registered because I played before Steam, a physical copy that I bought in 2001 when the game was released. Old ages, physical copies, games in CD, no one remember them... But now, in 2018 I replayed it, and without noticing the passing time I almost played 10 hours in a row. I still loved it. Of course the CiV V is for me the pinnacle of the franchise, but for the 2001 game, it is still better them some other games of the genre. I get a few resolution issues but nothing serious for a game of this age, totally understandable. Fully recommend it, it's a classic for a bargain price, a ""must have"" to any Steam collection.. A great strategy game made mediocre by luck. There were matches I lost simply from bad luck. When your units fight, a calculation is made based on their stats, the land they are on, who is attacking versus defending. Much of the time my chances of winning a fight were 66% or higher but I frequently lost those fights. It is frustrating to work hard to gain superior technology to another civilization only to lose what should be a winning fight. Even playing on the easiest difficulty isn't very easy. That said, the game looks good (for 2001), has compelling history and scenarios, interesting micromanagement of cities, and great diplomacy interactions. I very frequently found myself completely immersed in a match, always pressing for the next turn or my next big move. So much so that I forgot to eat sometimes! Bought the Complete Edition on steam sale for $1.24, played 80 hours, recommended.. I would have to say this game, overall is great. The only main complaint I have with it is that you can have an infinite amount off units on one tile, as the AI tends to always produce so many units. It can be really annoying if you don't have animations turned off.. It's a great strategic 4x game, nice graphics and very addictive gameplay. That 'one more turn' thing appears almost at the very beginning. It's definitely a must play.. This game requires a MASSIVE learning curve for people who haven't played Civilization before, but for the people who have played before, it's a fun and deep game.. Not particuarly great. It does have colonies, which I love, but it is too expansive for me. Combat is annoying due to one unit who fights is destroyed. The scenarios, however, I enjoy! Once again, numbers required to win pisses me off! I like doing it germany through russia style!. A fun game that you will want too keep playing even though your AI opponents seem to be able too accomplish feats you would never be able too. The graphics are good and the user interface has been improved. But still the game play is not as good as Civ II.. Well if you haven't already got this game don't get it, instead get Civ II or Civ IV both of which are light years better than this bargain bin game. This is basically a 2nd release of Civ II but with more bugs, still isn't ""horrible"" but it's a waste of money when you can just get Civ II. My ranking of the civilization series Civ IV (95/100) Civ II (92/100) Civ I (88/100) Civ V (76/100) Civ III (54/100). Good game. Great scenario editor for non-coders. Civ IV is more customizable, but it requires more of a coder mentality (and optimally, be a coder that is willing to code outside of work). Great game for those with older computers (5-8 years old).. To date, this is my favorite game hands down. You have the freedom to expand how you want. Will you win by military domination? Will you win by scientific development or a cultural victory? Will you win through political intrigue? You decide! This is by far one of the best games I've played. While graphics aren't the best when compared to modern games, it is an excellent game for those who wish to focus on the overall campaign instead of individual battles or graphics. To date, this is the only game I've played throughout the night and into the early hours of the morning. This game was definitely an epic win for Sid Meyers. The biggest problem with the game is the lack of a dedicated online community (if multi-player is your thing.",without doubt my favourite installment within the Civilization franchise . almost a decade after it still **** me in like the first day is a testament to its ever lasting appeal .
327.WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role,"I have had lots and lots of fun with this game. Smackdown series is the best game series of all time.. one of the best games of the brand. A game mode more frenetic than other deliveries, and quite entertaining. the roster is good and has the most iconic superstars of that time.. Great game, i remember creating my own character and love customizing it, awesome gameplay great for a ps1 game, don't know how many hours i've spent playing this, what a good time. Awesome game about wrestling on PS1,nice soundtrack,big choise of wrestlers,it's on of the legendary games about World Wrestling Federation.. What a game!! The Season is really long and you earn to unlock new people. The vids that come up every week can get repetitive though, but I still love it!. A brilliant varied game with a range of moves, specials, customisable characters and arenas.. The best wrestling game on the original Playstation. Yukes knew they would have to up their game after the original Smackdown as Aki Corporation released WWF No Mercy on the Nintendo 64 a few months prior and boy did they do a fantastic job. The wrestler models looked good for 2000 and still look good today. The entrances were good but **** that they were shortened by memory limitations. The gameplay is super addictive. The controls are tight, responsive and easy to learn. It had a near perfect roster and all the match types you want. The career mode is good and the loading times are not irritating as fans claim they are. The create a wrestler was improved. It introduced the TLC and Hell In A Cell match types for the first time and the series would continue to introduce new match types. I really liked the BGMs. These were the main problems with Smackdown 2: There is NO selling from wrestlers when you grapple them and even when you perform a finisher. The Hell in a Cell looks terrible. Most of the finishers are reused and some of them look crap. The next game in the WWF Smackdown series, WWF Smackdown: Just Bring It fixed some of the problems in this game. The entrances would start to become more realistic after JBI, the BGMs were getting better, the finishers would look much more brutal and realistic as the series continued, every wrestler would get a second finisher from this game, new match types would be introduced and the Hell in a Cell would be improved on after this game. A classic.. There is the one of the best wrestling game of all time, and the best fighting game after Tekken3! The Rock Layeth the SmackDown. Real video entrances of all wrestlers than in WWF No Mercy due to cartridge's limit!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was a defining game for the first Playstation as its gameplay was good, the unlockables seemed infinite, it had a great list of playable wrestlers and was generally enjoyable.","i have had lots and lots of fun with this game about wrestling on the original playstation . the gameplay is super addictive. the controls are tight, responsive and easy to learn . i really liked the BGMs in this game ."
328.VIDEOVERSE,"A short but great visual novel. Story is touching and told in a really great way, graphics are 2d pixel graphics but made with a lot of care. It really throws you back to the early 2000s internet. Can recommend!. Wow, I loved this game! I really enjoyed seeing a video game era I was too young for. VideoVerse is both cosy and comforting, while also being a raw, cringe online simulation. I don't think I've played anything like it. I fell in love with the characters and their struggles and just want to protect them all! The soundtrack is amazing too. I want to replay VideoVerse again and get another ending since I heard there are a few.. Really lovely and touching game, felt really authentic in its world and narrative to that early internet/2000s experience (visuals are obviously stylised in different way to lean into retro feel but felt they fitted in with overall vibe). Surprisingly touching in places as well and some interesting bits of branching in narrative as well - definitely diving back in to see how choices affect overall story. Impressive effort as well for such a small team working on it - in presentation and also in going beyond usual limitations of its engine.. visual novels aren't my cup of tea but this one was extra boring like the whole starting sequence introduction of character i just couldn't do it. Come for the nostalgic 2000s vibes, stay for the heartfelt story and memorable characters. Essential for anyone who grew up with MSN messenger or spent their teens investing in online forums.. Very fun game, extremely nostalgic if you are a 2000s kid, the story and characters are awesome and the choices you make have a huge impact.. Very good quality game makes you want to play, I like the friendship mixed with romance, perfect game, very good. Moreover, there are plenty of choices to play in incredible different ways. The only problem is that it's like something is missing, we don't know what happens when she gets off the bus at the end.",a short but great visual novel . graphics are 2d pixel graphics but made with a lot of care . throws you back to the early internet/2000s era .
33.Grand Theft Auto Double Pack,"GTA3 and GTA: Vice City in one package at the time was like combining chocolate and milk for the first time.. This is review of GTA VC because that was the one I completed the other one I could not get myself to play , What can I say about GTA VC it was my favourite game when I played it as a child , And now I played I still love it but you really feel the age by now , But it's still fun I played it on an Xbox 360 so I don't know if the problems with the game was because of backwards compatibility, is it just played really poor original on the Xbox Does not have a stable frame rate but it's really fun games , The story is also very good I'm third all the way through and feels sorry about Lane Danes , if you are that kind of weird that enjoy playing old games Then I would wholeheartedly recommend GTA Vice City. Grand Theft Auto Double Pack includes the first two iconic 3D Third Person games of this series, GTA III and GTA Vice City. And the Xbox versions of them are simply the best ones! Better graphics and effects, controls are perfect and the sound is incomparably good. The storylines of both games is terrific, even with today´s standards! A superb package, which includes dozens of entertaining hours. A must have!. Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto Vice City are masterpieces. GTA3 is a open world game set in Liberty City during modren times. The main story is great and the side missions and activities are also great. GTA Vice City is a open world game set in Vice City during the 80s. The main story is great and the side missions are really good.. What's not to love with having two of the best Grand Theft Auto games on the Xbox? Both games play exactly the same as the PlayStation 2 versions but have improved graphics in terms of character models, textures, reflections, better audio and a custom soundtrack. There are some things that have been added to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and some things that have been altered. -They fixed the control and handling problems with the RC plane, helicopter and the boats in Vice City. -A new menu selection called tutorial and unlocked items has been added to Vice City. -It feels like that the difficulty for Vice City was toned down as well. -The song ""Running With The Night"" by Lionel Richie was removed from Vice City's soundtrack. -Many bugs are fixed. Overall they're more polished than the Playstation 2 versions. A must own.. Grand Theft Auto Double Pack includes Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which are a couple of the greatest sandbox games ever. Grand Theft Auto III absolutely stunned gamers with its free roam and not so linear gameplay. The missions are great with lots of action, the story is good, and the characters are also pretty good. The graphics were decent for 2001 but now they are obviously dated. This game revolutionized the gaming industry by creating a whole new genre and everyone should try it out. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is such an amazing game, and I personally believe it's a big improvement from the previous title. The biggest aspect I love most about this game is the setting; it's in a 1980s, Miami-like atmosphere, so it's pleasing to see all the bright colours from club lights and the beach front strip and also seeing the cooler sports and super cars, which Grand Theft Auto III didn't have. All of the characters are amazing and unique, the story is amazing, and the missions are amazing, everything is amazing. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is such an incredible game that everyone has to play.","gta double pack includes the first two iconic 3D Third Person games of this series, GTA III and GTA Vice City . both games play exactly the same as the PlayStation 2 versions but have improved graphics in terms of character models, textures, reflections, better audio and a custom soundtrack ."
330.The Last of Us Part II Remastered,"I didn't like the story and characters. Graphics were good, but that was expected. Overall i don't consider it as canon and i'm going to treat Part 1 as the only game in this series.. For me it was definitely worse than Part 1. It's very slow and annoying gameplay, the characters are illogical and the fight at the end was a complete flop. It was so depressing to make my way through this story that I felt relief when it's ended.. imagine loving a remake to a game that's only 2 years old and loving the slop and people say Sony is good. I don't have the words to express how emotional I was during this game. I truly became obsessed with the debate the game brought. I am happy because I got mad. It made me think about life, death, and what is important to preserve and pursue.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever ! One of my top 5 games of Life. The storyline is so deep and complex. The game makes you feel a bomb of emotions. Graphics are perfect on ps5. This was my very best and most intense gaming experience ever. The quality of this game is just unbelievable. There is no aspect of modern games which was not perfectly covered by this title. On PS5 Pro it looks incredible. The Last Of Us Part II is simply an outstanding masterpiece in its own class. Thanks a lot to Naughty Dog for creating this journey I will never forget.. Great gameplay, frustrating and unsatisfying story that cannot be described without spoilers. But essentially: If you play for the first 2 hours and you don’t like what you see, know that it’s only gonna get worse and more irritating.. Remains a great game. Enjoyed the new rogue mood lot more than expected. Worth the upgrade if you own the original game.. It's one of the best games I've ever played in my **** LIFE for 3 reasons. 1: it has A VERY GOOD STORY (although I like 1 better). 2: the graphics are THE **** BEST, and it's from play 4. the way the gun upgrades are made are almost exact (if not exact). 3: THE **** GAMEPLAY is incredible... I'll leave it at that. (if people say it's a bad game it's because they are homophobic).. Naughty Dog literally can’t miss! Everything they touch transforms into solid gold. Can’t wait for Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet.. I was one of the people who managed to stay away from every trailer, leak or other ways that could have spoiled me before the game... Looking back at it, I wish I would have seen the leaks and been able to save my 80€. If this would have been just a random game it might have earned a 6 out of 10 for the effort and for trying, but for what naughty dog was able to deliver in the past, this feels like they didn´t care at all about the story or the characters of the first game. This game is just nice to look at but you have to be able to completely shut down your brain, not know or not care about the first game and just want to enjoy nice graphics. The writing in this game feels like a low budget teenage high school soap opera. The graphics are sadly so good that you can see the bad acting, and I don´t want to say the actors are bad, but the characters and dialogs really just feel shallow and are surly directed by someone who doesn´t have contact with a lot of real humans. Most of what happens, happens because of unbelievable coincidences (also called bad and lazy writing) and almost nothing that the characters do is relatable or even just true to how you know them from the first game. This truly is ""Game of Thrones Season 8"" Naughty Dog style mixed with ""Terminator dark fate"" with the twist that they try to make you sympathise with the Terminator who killed John Connor for 10 hours, but giving you nothing to be able to. I could go on for days but overall: if this game was made to make gamers feel stupid for caring or trying to bond with video-game characters and showing them that playing games is a waste of time, then the message was delivered 10/10!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not a bad game, too bad ""the Message"" was more important than the storyline.. I get the reason why some people are not happy with the game. But for me it was enjoyable for the most times. The story, graphics and gameplay are well done.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this is the only game i cried in and enjoyed every moment of it. it was the only time I didn't know which side was right and I felt sympathy for both sides. this game really disappointing its fails to capturethe feeling of the first game,where Joel and elliebond and theirjourney is so **** we got a generic revenge story. Bad game always from sony don’t play that game just find better game to play and enjoy the good games from andy dev. Great setting and graphics! I really enjoyed the subtle changes to combat mechanics, character progression, and movement. The story is thought-provoking and left a lasting impression after it ended—exactly what I was hoping for. No happy endings here, just plenty of food for thought.. Waist of a perfect gameplay and graphics for a terrible story line. The plot in this game is really ambiguous and causes a lot of controversy. But he is very mature and has repeatedly caused me a lot of emotions. I really enjoyed playing this game. From the point of view of gameplay, the game does not raise any questions.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The most graphically impressive game of all time. There is not a single mechanic in this game to fault. From cutscenes to gameplay, this game is so incredibly fluid, it will have fans applauding the effort put into this game. The story is a common controversy; however, I found that the game effortlessly places the player in the position of both shoes, with an ending that can be heavily debated, yet, I found to be perfect. This masterclass of storytelling is a must-play for anyone who considers themself to be a gamer.. This game looks brilliant, but developers forgot they were doing a game, not a movie. 50% of the game are cinematics, 10% - stupid animations of climbing over locked doors or crawling, 10% - pointless accessing of workbench, the rest is kinda game itself. And when it gets to actual gaming and fighting - game **** unfortunately. 6 points from me for beautiful art and graphics only.. Never deserved the hate it got on release. 10/10 gameplay and a well crafted story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ya just like play it for yourself and make your own opinion ? Please enter at least 75characters apparently.. This game is an absolute masterpiece! I've played the original part 2 back in the days on my PS4. Now, playing it on the PS5 again, it is a real joy. Technically this game is very (very!) well made. The visuals I must say are stunning, sometimes mind blowing. This and Horizon FW are the gold medal winners of what I've seen displayed on a PS5 so far. If I switch to another game it is like going back to an older gen console sometimes. The level of detail is insane. There is some LBGTQ+ stuff going on here, not my cup of tea but it's not into your face all of the time so I can live with it. Story is good. There is a nice way of upgrading your weapons and skills and such,with parts you scavenge from buildings. There is loads and loads of stuff to gather: in the options menu there is an option that lets you auto pick up materials. Turn it on it's a life saver!enemy AI is top level. Fighting is brutal! It is a must play game. People scoring it 0 and such are real losers.. I played the first game just recently and after I finished it I was so excited to start the part 2, in the first hour of the game all what I learned is the relationships and sexual orientations of the characters, Ellie became a very unlikable arrogant aggressive person, and all of her dialog (and other characters' dialogs) make me feel that I'm playing a high school teenagers game that all what they talk about is their relationships ,, this is not a post-apocalyptic survival game anymore. Such a disappointment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game offers a balanced experience in terms of story and gameplay. Compared to the first volume, the second volume is much more open-ended, which can be counter-productive. In many cases, the world is too open and looting has just become boring. Story-wise, the first part set the bar too high, but the second part doesn't lag behind. The story is engaging, the ending is unexpected and the last fight is a bit unnecessary.. The pacing is messy, and Part II doesn’t quite match the tone of Part I. However, its flaws are easily outweighed by its phenomenal strengths. This game is a masterpiece and an emotional roller coaster. I've never played anything like this. The Last of Us series has set the bar so high, it’s ruined other games for me. Nothing else compares and I can't wait to see what Naughty Dog comes up with next. The quality of the storyline has significantly declined compared to the previous installment, and I don't think it deserves this score. I give this game a 2, only because of some nice .mechanics. However, the game most of the time is frustrating, with a story that makes no sense. The change of the main writer from Drackman to Haley Gross, was.... catastrophically gross! Obviously, she did not exactly know the scenario of the first part, other than the basics. She tries to promote through the game am agenda and while his is not always bad, in her case she shows no talent in writing. It is not understandable, why hiring Gross, who as a writer always was mediocre and never had any success as an author.. This game is fantastic. It looks incredible, the gameplay is such a joy, and the story is so mature and well told. Don't trust anything below 9, you need to play this game. It's as good as Red Dead Redemption 2.. Best graphics on PS4, great physics and soundtrack. Mindblowing story and deep message. It provides a unique experience, sometimes uncomfortable. It is a videogame that makes you experience the deepest emotions. I have felt like this playing a videogame before.. I'm judging this game as a whole, not just the remaster aspect. And it must be said that even in 2024 this game remains peerless, still untouched by the competition, the best solo-narrative TPS ever in my humble opinion. - crazy animations - Surprisingly intricate gameplay, much deeper than it seems - dialogues are top notch especially for a video game, setting a high bar for the industry - Impressive replayability for a solo narrative game, playing in grounded feels like a whole new game, it turns it into a gripping and intense new challenge - AI is pretty well balanced, contributing to the overall immersion. Didn't need a remaster. Was barely a sequel to the first anyway considering they killed off the main character. Better to consider it a spin off.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is nothing short of a masterpiece, and for me, it easily earns a spot in my top 5 games of all time. Revisiting this game in its remastered form reminded me why it’s one of the most emotionally gripping and technically impressive experiences ever **** story is raw, heartbreaking, and brutally human. Naughty Dog has an unparalleled talent for creating characters that feel real, flawed, and relatable. Ellie’s journey and the intertwining perspectives of other characters left me questioning my own judgments and morals in ways few games dare to explore. The narrative hits even harder with the enhanced visuals and performance upgrades, making every scene feel more vivid and impactful.Gameplay is equally outstanding. The stealth, combat, and exploration are polished to perfection, and the level design offers plenty of opportunities for creativity in how you approach encounters. The tension during combat sequences is palpable, while the quieter moments let you soak in the incredible world-building. Every detail feels intentional, every moment **** remastered version takes an already stunning game and pushes it further with improved graphics, better frame rates, and additional features that make it the definitive way to experience this story. Whether it’s your first playthrough or you’re revisiting, the remaster is absolutely worth it.. This game is all about story so let's just look at that. I came into this with an open mind, I heard about the ""wokeness"" of the game. I'm not bothered if someone is gay, but this game felt a little preachy about it. I wouldn't say the characters aren't written well, but in a post-apocalyptic world they seem highly unrealistic which breaks the immersion. It's not the worst story in the world but it's nothing groundbreaking.. Still the best 3d person shooter ever created, on par with Uncharted 4. All the best games still belong to the PS4, Sony has become garbage like most western developers and we'll never again see shooter masterpieces like these. Eastern developers are very talented but they mostly do rpg or action rpg.. The graphics and gameplay in this game are amazing as well as the ****’s not really anything negative I can say, but if I had to nitpick for children under 15, I would not recommend this game because of the sexual content and bisexuality in this game.I think they should leave those kind of things out of games Just my opinion. Never get tired of this game. It is by far the most immersive game I’ve ever played and a console seller for PlayStation and is an absolute adventure and masterpiece. It is top drawer gaming experience and the haters are probably just salty about their last cod round. NeilDruckmann hits home runs and crushed it with this one. if you like single player thrilling stories, look no further. The Last of Us Part II is hands down one of the best story-driven games I’ve ever played. If you’ve played and loved The Last of Us Part I, then Part II is an absolute must. I originally bought it for the PS4, and I enjoyed it so much that I purchased it again for the PS5—and savored every second. No other game has ever hit me so hard emotionally as The Last of Us. I was genuinely heartbroken when I finished it. The characters felt so real, their individual stories and growth so compelling, that they truly left a mark on me. All we can do now is hope that one day, we’ll get another installment in this incredible series.. Best game i’ve ever played, amazing writing, amazing storytelling, almost flawless gameplay.. Almost unchanged, the story is weak. For some reason, the woman has the biceps of a man on testosterone during the post-apocalypse, but the gameplay is awesome.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. TLOU 2 Remaster is simply a timeless masterpiece and one of the best games of all time. I hope we get another TLOU3. A Remastered expensive garbage from a game that's not old enough to be remastered.. This game is a slap in the face to everyone that loved the first game. Do not buy this and save your money. The truth and context of this game is much worse than the leaks. Before I get into one of the worst stories ever. The gameplay is very average in today's modern gaming generation. There are minor improvements from the first game and enemy AI is dumb as ever. There are more cut scenes and walking than actual gameplay. SPOILER ALERT..... they destroyed all of your favorite characters. They dumb down Joel's character on purpose to make him weak and stupid. In the first game he was very smart and had a ton of experience. He didn't even trust a guy that was sick on the road. He chose to run him over. Later we find out that stranger on the road was not sick and it was all a set up. They do everything to make you dislike Joel and continue to spit on him. They have a trans female/male shoot him in the leg and torture him with a golf club right in the first 2 hours of the game. They spit on him literally. They made Ellie unlikable and a selfish human being. She kills everyone and continued to blame Joel for saving her life. She cared so much in saving humanity because she has the immunity but instead she became a lesbian and chose not to reproduce. Let that sink in. She even let's Abby the one that tortured and murdered Joel in front of her get away with it. Abby also bit off two of Ellie's fingers. Her letting Abby go is basically saying Joel deserved dying. A loveable character who is the main character of the game. There was no justice for Joel. This game robbed everything from you just for shock value. The current narrative of destroying the male character to make the female character rise is very weak story telling. It is disrespectful to both genders. Females even hate it. Worst of all the pacing of the story is horrible. You literally play as Abby the character we hate for half the game. They tried so hard to make us like her but none of it worked. This game is a waste of time and money and should have never been created as a sequel. The critics are liars and they don't care about what the fans want. They only care about their political narrative and force you to like something that you will never accept. Then they insult you by calling you names because you don't like the product they are praising. They are the worst kind of human being. Trust the gamers that actually love playing the kind of video games you like. Those are the ones who you should listen to. Vote with your wallet and avoid this dumpster fire. Why care for a game created by a studio that is run by Neil Druckmann who is a male feminist and does not care about the fans and the people he works with. That's why 75 percent of Naughty dog left the company due to how he treated them. This game is created by people that don't care about you and backed by people that hate you. The game wasn't made for the fans and gamers. Vote with your wallets and avoid this at all cost. Especially how they are trying to trick everyone with false advertisement into buying this. Look it up on YouTube. Don't trust the shill media. Watch the negative videos about this game and you will see the **** to The Last of Us franchise. stole this from another user. i love the gameplay style, but everything else is garbage.49 people found this helpful.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Last of Us Part 2 has grown on me so much in the many times that I have played it. The themes in the story are so heartbreaking but realistic and are written in mostly great ways. I also think the performances are great and the cast deserves the most praise. The score is again amazing in this game, so good. I love the gameplay and atmosphere of the game that has made me comeback to the game 6 times. The problems I have are with, who would’ve thought, Abby. I just can’t get into her story as much as I would like. While her story has grown on me a little more, the fact they make me play as her for half the game after she kills Joel is just unacceptable. I have no problem with Joel dying but just the way they executed it and how quickly into the game he dies makes me not feel anything for Abby when we eventually get to her story. It makes me not care… I love this game and will defend it but I will not say there isn’t flaws…. So this game caused many to become divisive since the story had some controversial decisions such as Abby herself, a narrative that shifts quite often, and well, a major death of a certain character (no spoilers). Some even criticized the lesbian relationships here which idc tbh, people make a big deal out of that for no reason at all. What I don't like is the story and plot. It's just so boring and doesn't give me any good reason to care for these characters. The gameplay tho has some nice moments but it gets too annoying toward the end. Overall, it's just a mediocre experience despite the graphical improvements. Sad cause this could've been much better with better writing.. A pretty bad game in the narrative, the conflict is understandable but then it declines a lot, the way it develops is terrible. Playability and graphics are at a high level but in history it falls apart, a game that is based completely on the narrative cannot fail in narrative. It is a shame that the game was far from the expectation. and it's not a relatively big game to remaster, it's not even a big saga, barely having two titles. and they already release a remake of the first installment and a remaster to the max. On the other hand, the sound section is very poor, it seems more like a remix of the music from the first game and with some new ones, but nothing memorable.. I have beef with everyone who hates this game. Some people didn’t even give it a chance, I pity them.. Good multiplayer, but that's all, chahges in graphic near 0. But still good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story is really good and I get what wastheyrs intension. But I can't say the story is better than first one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolute masterpiece yet again. Great story, awesome graphics, intense moments, relaxed moments and a long enjoyable game. This game seems polished off perfectly. Cannot fault it. Only downside I can think of is that the enemies only see you and not your partner when running around.. The game is amazing. Having played on all PS genetations I would difenetelly say, it is the most fascinating game I have ever played.TLOU is GOAT story. Bravo!. There are many great video games like the RDR, GOW and the ghost of tsushima but the only best game of all time is ""TLOU"". One of my favorite game ever in storytelling. I dont really get the hate. Some say its too woke etc. I mean are you talking about that 20 min. from whole game ? Well its your opinion for sure but its kinda weak compared to games like concord or even Apex Legends or LOL etc. To be honest its very weak argument and i also hate IGN and poor takes on reviews that want to see only inclusion etc. There are some holes in storytelling like in ""part 1"" but message is much more mature, messy and complex like our real lives. I think some of you want to see world thru eyes of the ""good guy"", story pushes you in not so comfortable position and you must confront yourself. In this case i must say ... i dont think you are mature enough, in other cases i agree, there are some problems. My only problem with this game is price. Well first of all I want to start with saying they made everything but everything so the game would last long and I want the game to be long also of course but they just filled it with crap and not even good crap. Its just boring crap. I don't care about Abby or Lev or her sister fr. I loved the story and also at the same time I hated it fr. It could've been so much better but they decided to just f*ck it up all.... Story pretty bad. They strayed away from what they had originally planned if you would take a look at the first the last of us 2 trailers. We've had high hopes, but way too high. First game was already perfection and sequel just ruined it all and future games. A remaster for games that don't deserve it or need it lmao. There are many great video games like the RDR, GOW and the ghost of tsushima but the only best game of all time is ""TLOU"". Masterpiece in story telling. The last of part 2 is one of few games that will take you on rollercoaster ride that you won’t want to get off. On its ups downs where the story goes , you cannot deny the innovation in gameplay exploration and the stunning graphics, this is one of the best games created and is must play for any gamer.. While people don’t like this game, I love it so much. I think the main reason people don’t like it is because of a part in the beginning of the game, I will not spoil anything. I love it because the game puts you in a world so realistic you feel completely immersed in the experience. I love it because of the gameplay and the way it looks. Most importantly, I love it because of the way it makes you feel. It makes you feel horrible, it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and you won’t see games the same again. That’s why it’s so good. It shows you the tragedy’s one can cause and how horrible people can be. And I like the first game more than this one, because that makes you feel deep love and happiness. This is the opposite, a sad, dirty love letter. This is a review for the remastered, so I might as well include no return; I like it a ton, it puts a rogue-like element onto the amazing gameplay. This game is phenomenal, and if you don’t like brutal, heartbreaking, cinematic things, then don’t play this. But if you like all of the above, it’s a perfect game for you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game will always be awful. It plays incredibly well, but put the best aspects of this game into the first game, and then call The Last of Us Part I a remake, but this story never existed. Abby... LOL. You can tell she was Joel at some point, because they play EXACTLY the same. Naughty Dog just decided to start writing stories that were as bad as The Acolyte.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I make this review for people like me who believed all the unfounded criticisms of bad history, activism, etc. I had bought the game at a discount and I had not played it thinking that it was a mediocre game and that it was going to disappoint me. It ended up being one of my favorite games, a roller coaster of emotions with a courage to propose new things and script twists designed for Hollywood movies transported to video games, don't believe what people say, I liked it more than the first. A true masterpiece.. Loved the first playthrough and I loved this playthrough. Graphics and story are amazing.. Incredidable game! Graphics are gorgous. Story telling is amazing. Cant wait for part 3.. The greatest game in the history of the world. I've finished it 10 times etc only play. Captivating experience which is a graphic and storyline success with a surmountable difficulty which allows the exceptional realism of the game.. While I think naughty dogs resources would be better used at a new game it is definitely worth the upgrade from the ps4 version.. The last of us part II is a great game maybe if it didn’t lack some writing and didn’t include the “other point of view” and the ending meant something or gave me some sort of gain in the end it was just the feeling of nothingness at that point and I think the writers wanted you to feel that way as a player and have a similar feeling to what Ellie felt at the end however the gameplay is so interesting and give the feeling of control of how you want to approach your enemies and how to calculate your attack and the crafting is great the feeling is great how if you crafted a med kit you couldn’t craft a Molotov and that goes for all the other types of crafting this games is really great I mean the beginning of the game had a lot of controversy and how is the aftermath of that event and how it’s all based over coincidence’s and something for the players who played the first game would know that the character would never do such a stupid and out of character mistake as Jole did but they did it anyway and that goes back fort the lack of story writing and poorly handled as a huge and one of the best characters as jole they changed what makes jole himself the person how never trust anyone else and other stuff however everything else in this game is great and topnotch quality and its a must play for me and I would recommend it to anyone by all means this game is very dear to me and I love it so much thank you for Reading. The main disadvantage of the remaster is that it was made at all, the game is only 3 years old and it is good today, most likely the remaster was created not to improve the game but to make money. But the remaster came out better than the remaster of the first part of the game, they added a lot of new things for creativity and a new mode and that makes me happy. If you don’t play it you won’t miss anything. The gameplay is generally good but the story is bad and unnecessary. I feel like they really wanted to make another game but couldn’t come up with a good story. Play something else.. Remake wasn't really necessary, but it was a lot of fun to play through this again anyway.. Really Good Game! (Masterpiece) | The Last of Us Part 2 | 90 Points (4 Stars) | Story 6P | Side Story 6P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 10P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 7P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. I liked Part II more than Part I. The gameplay feels better too. I love the story and Abby. It was an emotional rollercoaster.. The game itself is a 10/10 but the remaster is horrible. A 40 dollar price tag with nothing new to show but new skins and ""graphical improvements"" that are overall nothing but at least it gave me a reason to replay this fantastic game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still trash. Don't trust these 10's, you will hate yourself after playing this if you loved the first one. The story is the worst thing that has happened to playstation ever. Simply one of the best games ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It was an amazing experience. I love that you can play the both side of their story. Hoping for a third part for some good closure of Ellie's story, I'm now on my second run of the game, trying to hit the platinum trophy. 9/10 for Ellie's part 8/10 for Abby's part. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite the amount of hate this game got for story choices, this is one of the best single player games you will possibly ever play. My only complaint is how long the last act drags on. Other than that, this is one of my favorite games. a very good single player game, there is nothing better on the market in terms of story. This game put me through an emotional wringer. Mind-blowingly brave, Naughty Dog. If you don't make Part 3 where hope (even if it's bittersweet) is the main concept, I'm gonna riot.. Best game I have played all year. Really builds on the first game and leaves you wanting more.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awesome game. And only a $10 upgrade if you already own part 2 on PS4. Great deal.. This game is the most unpleasant and disgusting game I've ever played. It seems like an arrogant developer considers insulting game fans an artistic endeavor.. Honestly, this game is a spit in the face for The Last Of Us fans. The game is god awful and would give it negative if I could. Don't waste your time and money, in fact they couldnt have paid me enough money in the world to get me to enjoy or even play this gameAbby is a murderer and if her dad didn't decide to be a hero then this wouldn't have happened. Abbys playthrough of this game is an ill attempt at making her seem relatable which she is not. Game of Thrones ended better than this trash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There was no need for a remaster but can understand with the show coming out, still a masterpiece.. After years of following internet debate threads, I took the plunge and decided it was time to form my own opinion of The Last of Us Part 2. Knowing what I already did from the spoilers not only made it easier to start this painful journey, but also got me excited to see how much I didn’t know along the way. Strictly speaking, this is a very fun game. Combat was greatly improved from the original making enemy encounters more fun, especially in every unique boss fight with the highlight to me being a one of a kind infected fight that lasted two parts. This game also successfully kept me coming back every night interested to see what happens next","i don't consider this game as canon and i'm going to treat it as the only game in this series . overall i didn't like the story and characters. Graphics were good, but that was expected . i am happy because i got mad ."
331.LIMBO,"What makes Limbo special is the way it forces you to be patient, to think, to find solutions in the midst of chaos. There are no promises of a happy ending, but you continue, driven by curiosity, by the challenge. It's not just a game, it's an experience.. This game definitely knows how to make a player want more; you just want to keep going. Playdead is one of the best companies in this style. You feel Limbo's loneliness. I think his desire is not to find someone to get away from here, but mostly to find someone to not be alone anymore. He isn't afraid of dying. He doesn't know where he is or why he is here, and this fact makes him want to find someone more and **** may be said that it has no story, but I can't agree with that. It just hasn't been taught fully and lets the player find and connect pieces and add a bit of their own imaginary. The game's achievements are as interesting as the game itself. Some of them are easy, some of them are hard. I had so much fun while doing ""DING!"" achievement. I would definitely recommend this game.. Creates a moody and dark atmosphere, but the effect loses steam over time. Neat puzzles and some suspenseful segments. Overall, not a bad effort.. Super frustrating game. The only game that made me want to fling my Switch against the wall. Rage uninstalled TWICE. Avoid!!. Atmosphere and lighting are really good, and I like the fact that there are no cut scenes. But get ready to get stuck and die a lot. Needed a walkthrough so many times that wore the fun off a bit. For me, it's a 6,5/10.. Gameplay: (Good) ----- Graphics: (Good) ----- Story: (N/A) ----- Score: (N/A). A very unique, pretty, and beautiful puzzle platformer. Despite its simple graphics, it's still gorgeous. The gameplay is meditative and some puzzles are quite tough which makes the game more interesting and remarkable.. Limbo is a dark and terrifying game in a way, I found it agonizing to play. It's a great game, it's very different from the conventional one. Its setting is frightening.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has a unique charm, a unique experience and is unpredictable. Wonderful!. I tried it for about 5-10 minutes. I got stuck. I think it deserves a 3 or a 4.. For puzzle game enthusiasts, Limbo offers a satisfying head-scratching experience.. It's a fine platformer. This game is mostly an experience and is not so much about the gameplay or mechanics. As such, this is less my style. I didn't hate it, but I have no intention of replaying it or similar games.. Game is an alright side scroller. Got it on sale and was worth the price. Nothing mindblowing but fun.. Over rated. Just finished this up with near completed gamer scrore. The puzzles and platforming in this game are indeed brilliant. The atmosphere is absolutely engaging and the story is haunting, but the gameplay, button input, and controls in general are pretty rough. I think it is worth playing but I would say Inside and Somerville are better by a landslide. You will get frustrated playing this game. And the hardest achievement is really annoying and honestly not worth trying for. Don’t get me wrong I see the. Brilliance of this game, it just is a little rough around the edges. It’s not a masterpiece but it was the step needed to make the masterpiece called Inside!. i dont usually like side scrollers at all but this was ok game not bad for an indie title. A young boy awakens in the middle and is immediately forced to fight for his life when a giant spider tries to kill him. # Limbo combines solid, if unremarkable, platforming action with some of the most striking visuals seen on the console to make yet another Xbox Live title more than worth the price of a download.. great game good gameplay good graphics interesting story i want see more limbo games. A really unique and good indie game. Super puzzle-ish good tones and vibes, very misterious cant really describe it that detailed, but it s really fun and engaging 8,8/10. Dark, haunting, unforgettable. A real eye-opener for what videogames could be when I first played it.. I loved everything about Limbo so much that I went ahead and got it on next gen consoles as well.. LIMBO A dark story and challenging puzzles Uncertain of his sisters fate, a boy enters limbo. Limbo is a puzzle platformer where you play as this boy searching for his little sister The entire game aside from a few exceptions is black and white, this makes for some really great moments in the beginning of limbo as its hard to tell whats a trap or enemy and what isn’t.. this keeps you on your toes and suspicious of everything… These initial moments of this little less than 4 hour journey for me was my favorite.. The game is very much a game of trial and error, and the game is generous with its checkpoints being nearly instantaneous.. knowing where youre going to mess up and most of the time having an instant spot for you to try again keeping this games momentum steady… After these initial moments of dealing with traps and a giant spider, the game slowly starts to be more puzzle focused and this is where I started to fall out of love with this game… Not that the puzzles are bad, im just not a huge fan of problem solving while im platforming and looking out for suspicious shadows.. Youll be pulling boxes, throwing switches, and timing jumps and other buttons to progress through the game.. I found a lot of these puzzles to be decently challenging, though none too complicated or having too many steps… but a few definitely did come close… and I may or may not have had to look the answer up for a couple.. with so many limbo clones out there now, going back to play limbo and playing through these puzzles is a bit of a drag because ive seen them so many times now… I would’ve preferred if the whole game was like the first few chapters of deception… I felt there was something really special there. It kept me hooked and intrigued hoping for more moments like this later on, but sadly they never came Personal preferences aside, limbo is a very erie and dark game, youll die gruesome deaths, the game will disturb you and turn your stomach at times… and it will get your mind going… both for the puzzles and trying to figure out just exactly whats going on with the story… even with the dozens of clones out there, limbo stands out as something special and unique.. one of the most enjoyable and unsettling puzzle platforming games ive played I give limbo an 8/10. I don't understand the high rating of this game. It's boring, repetitive, the puzzles are ok at best and it's way to short to be enjoyable. For me it's way overated.. Limbo is one of the most beautiful, dark, and mesmerizing games i have played. The art direction is dark and gritty, the atmosphere is strong, the puzzles and encounters are fun and scary to traverse through, and the tension grabs you in the beginning and builds it up throughout the entire game, releasing in one big sigh at the climax. I'll be reviewing the follow up to this game, Inside, once I've completed it. Go out and buy this masterpiece Limbo ASAP.. One of the best indie games I played. I rate it for what it is - excellent puzzle platformer with unique graphics and atmosphere. Id love to see more games with so much soul as in this one.. Beautifully haunting best describes this fairly low budget and short lived indie side scroll puzzler. A simple but artistic world shaded in only black and white might not sound too appealing but boy is this game gorgeous. The game is simple, start left and move right until the end is reached (which should take under 2 hours all in all). Along the way are puzzles, traps, swings, spikes, pits, boulders and giant spiders. Most of the time you will just die without realising you were in the middle of a puzzle but since the respawn points are every couple of minutes, you wont mind going back and using your new found knowledge to tackle the obstacle ahead. As for the ending, well its near enough the most perfect ending there is. You will definitely be straight on Google afterwards trying to understand your take on the situation. Fantastic game design.. Everything that all the highly positive reviews say about this game is true... Until about halfway through the game. It's an amazing game at first: artistic, eerie atmosphere; an intriguing story; and a variety of clever mini-puzzles. Sadly, at about the halfway point it stops being about puzzles and starts being about running as fast as you can and perfect-timing every jump. Add to that the ending is a huge disappointment story wise (no real spoilers, but suffice to say: it ends like an Arthouse movie, not at all like a fantastic mystery). Thoroughly disappointing beyond the first half.. Limbo exemplifies so much of what I value most in a successful videogame. Fundamentally a puzzle-platformer with really only two possible actions (jump and grab), the game is beautifully uncomplicated and uncluttered by extraneous nonsense. It's a design philosophy which extends to the plot. Open-ended and shrouded in mystery, the only official backstory given is the single sentence: ""Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO"". Yet, the experience is so much more compelling, memorable and moving than the vast majority of other games with their intricately thought-out and scripted stories. This is partly down to the monochrome art style and ambient sound design which define an atmosphere the likes of which you would never have imagined a 2D platformer would be able to foster, but also because it lets you, the player, fill in the blanks to let the game affect you in whatever way you interpret it. As a result, it's a deeply personal experience. The puzzles that the boy has to overcome are more cunning than you might expect for those that lie within the parameters of the game's elementary structure, and usually timing is of critical importance. This invariably means numerous deaths as you try to perfect your response to each situation. Far from being a flaw, this is intended design. Indeed, the creators have labelled Limbo as a ""trial and death"" game. The forgiving frequency of checkpoints and the delightfully gruesome nature of the boy's deaths are testament to this. The ultimate challenge offered is to finish the game without dying, thereby attaining the elusive 111% leaderboard score, and in order to get anywhere near accomplishing this feat you will need repeated playthroughs in a short space of time, reminiscent of the spirit of 2D shoot 'em ups. The game is short, but of perfect length - if it had been any longer it might have been in danger of outstaying its welcome. However, it concludes on a high, following the thrilling instability of an alternating gravity section, and in ending it at this point Playdead illustrated total mastery over their creation. In almost all aspects, Limbo is the videogame embodiment of ""less is more"".. X-Box One version: Awesome little platformer that tells its story in a unusual art-house way. The game has some challenging moments, but in general, it is balanced very well. The monotone nature blended with the soundtrack makes for a very immersive game; kind **** fairy-tale. Really was impressed with this, albeit a little short. Worthy 8/10 for me.. Superb atmosphere. Creepier than any Resident Evil put out in the last decade, but so is Sim City and Nintendogs I guess. At any rate, I give this trial and error platforming puzzler a couple of thumbs up.. Ever wondered what it be like to go through purgatory? The developers at Playdead do a very impressive job at making an eerie black-and-white visual design of what purgatory may very well be like. You play as a young boy, and what a very courageous little boy he is. With absolutely no way to defend yourself within this dreamland-like world, you face many opponents that are there to kill you. With smarts and courage, that little boy can get away without one single scratch. You'll face hostile natives, an assortment of traps and other deadly creatures. The developers really **** you into this game. Between the gorgeous 2D side-scrolling black-and-white action, the sound effects, and an amazing sounding musical score, you just can't put down the game. There are a lot of puzzles, which will also get you real involved in the game. Some puzzles are really simple, but then later in the game you'll encounter harder and more complex puzzles. Some puzzles you can take your time on, but other are timed and everything must be done perfectly or you'll have to face the consequences. Limbo is a well-designed, visually astounding game with amazing sound and a down right impressive musical score. But sadly, however, as you get real into the game, it abruptly ends and all you can say is ""I want more!"" So hopefully the developers at Playdead hear our plea for another installment for this awesome and involving game.. Good concept and smooth gameplay. I enjoyed the secrets in the game and most of the puzzles. While it starts down a story path using environment and character elements, it nevers ventures past the superficial, missing out on something great. In the end, you might feel you traded places with your character.. Simple yet challenging, immersive, beautiful, engaging, atmospheric. Limbo is a highly artistic, black and white, water color themed side scroller puzzle game. In essence Limbo is post modern, allowing the player to draw their own meaning upon completion. Extremely minimalistic, from gameplay mechanics to the soundtrack. In Limbo, less is more. The soundtrack, if you can call it that, practically contains no ""music"" at all, more like ambient sounds and at certain parts, rising, edgy, huge, chords. If you can imagine what sound saturn emits or maybe mars or even a black hole, then you can imagine how this awesome soundtrack sounds at times. Be sure to play this one with the lights off in the dark with no distractions. A perfect game 10/10. Must play.. This is a fantastic first outing for Playdead. The world is dark and grisly and there is no dialogue and no story other than what is given you in the game's initial description--and yet it's been a long time since I've played a game that feels so alive. The runtime is regrettably short, however, and this causes the world of Limbo to leave much too soon. It will take many attempts on these puzzles, but every success is a big one and by the game's finish, you feel like you've accomplished something of substance. This is a work of art.. This is a great game while it lasts. It was super fun to beat it with zero deaths. The hidden eggs are all really cool as well. I love the atmosphere of this game.. Why!? I wanted to love limbo like I do so many games, and really like to art and style of it, But after beating it in under 4 hours couldn't help but feel I lost 15 bucks. Now had I only paid like 6-9 dollars I might have felt better, but this game is too short. It started off really good, and had some really neat ideas but in the end the game was too short which is the same complaint I have for any other game like this, journey. Anyways there was one part were the puzzle seemed to not make any sense and it was almost frustrating but I figured it out, which didn't give me near the accomplishment that I felt with Braid and Portal. Don't know why that is? Good game, but if your price sensitive wait for a good deal to play it.. The game had a amazing art style and great puzzles which were hard however with regular check points i never got annoyed playing Limbo. The game was a bit short i managed to finish it is around 4-5 hours and i'm not very good at puzzle games however for the money it is wroth it!. Limbo is an amazing game in both art and game play, the creative visual solutions and sound design makes for a wonderfully eerie atmosphere that most games fail at even coming close - Overall it's incredibly alluring for a game so void of dialogue and direct story, the visual storytelling is fantastic.. Based on the reviews, I was sure I'd like this game, but I was wrong. The only way to figure out the puzzles is to die over and over and over. For me, at least, this makes it completely impossible to get immersed. I want to be scared for the kid, but I can't do it. I want to be curious about the place, but I can't do it. Without those elements, the non-obviousness of the game has the frustrating part of ""challenging"" without any real reward. All these reviewers feel good about figuring out a puzzle by trying every possible thing in the world, and dying 20 times? Not me. Three times I quit, got talked into doing it more and then quit again.. A very beautiful game, with a hint of something very dark. Honestly, a lot of what I remember is the art direction. Probably not the most difficult game I've ever played, but it kept my interest and was almost like watching a slower art movie rather than playing a game--which was something I appreciated but might not have been for everyone.. A incredible innovative platform game. I really got scary in certain moments of the game, and puzzles are hell of a challenge. But sometimes, the game mechanics are imprecise.... A good unique game, a bit short though.. Most of the critics for LIMBO come right to the point that it is short. Of course, compared with open-world games released everyday in which you can spend hundreds of hours in, LIMBO is short, it will take you 3-5 hours in the first time and 2 in further times. But, the hours you spend with LIMBO are fantastic. The game has one of the best art directions ever seen, with a innovative way of telling the story. The character doesn't speak one word, but you get attached to him in the first minutes. LIMBO's puzzles are incredibly clever, not very hard at most times, but after solving them you will probably be like ""oooooh, I'm so stupid"", because they are just simple and intelligent. So, altough LIMBO is short, it gets a 10, because it is innovative, beautiful, clever and overall one of the best experiences you can have.. The most atmospheric and wonderfully puzzling game on XBLA. The art direction is superb and adds to the story, gameplay and the world itself. The price is a bit steep for a game with little replay value.. Limbo is one of those games that you can't really resist, even with the quite high price point. Made by Playdead, the game tries to implement puzzle into the side scrolling genre of games and does it very well. Personally it has an art style that you can die for, it's something unique and definitely drew me into the experience. The puzzles can be quite challenging as they often involve quick reactions as waters continues to rise as you move things out of the way in order for a certain object to float. Or something quite simple like moving an object on top of another in order to continue. The puzzles are nice and varied and you don't feel like you do the same puzzle twice (unless you die). The environments that you are in do change nicely, once in the forest then you go into more of an urban environment. The game looks beautiful, and there is no denying how well the execution has done. The verdict: If you have some spare Microsoft points lying around then get it; however the only draw back is how long the game actually is, coming in at about 4-5 hours (depending on your skill of solving puzzles) the price is really steep. But this is one game worth playing.. Without a single word of dialogue and hardly any sound or assistance, Limbo captures me instantly and takes me on a journey through the dark, in hope of finding some light at the end. With clever puzzles supported by simplistic controls, this game lets you focus on the task at hand, and is a dark beauty with an atmosphere unlike anything else.. When all's said and done, it's the art style and atmosphere that made this game a success. The puzzles are generally above average for games of this type, although they mostly use rather vanilla mechanics that have been seen before in countless other games (push blocks around, swing on ropes, pull levers to change states of machinery etc. etc.) They do get repetitive, and after about halfway through the game the puzzle design becomes far too reliant on precision timing, and frustration tends to dominate. What I found was that you fairly quickly work out *what* you are supposed to do, but the act of *actually* executing the sequence is bogged down with endless trial-and-error as you have to constantly micro-adjust the positions of things, and re-adjust your timing until you hit that split-second and pixel-perfect ""sweet spot"" that allows progression to actually occur. When it takes 30secs to figure out the solution, but 10 minutes of repeating the same sequence over and over until you hit that jump just right (for example), then there is something obviously wrong with the design. Best way of summing it up - it's a bit like how Braid would have played if you we're allowed to rewind time. Ouch.. Loved the atmosphere and the puzzles were definitely fun. At 3 hours playtime it won't take much of your time (you're busy after all), and at 2.5$ it's quite the bargain (also gives that immense satisfaction of supporting indie game developers).. LIMBO is one of my favourite games I have ever played. It convinced me that artistic expression can be found in video games. The stand out factor of this game is no doubt the dark, eerie aesthetic. The game has a unique look and feel that has yet to have been used in other games. The puzzles are challenging, but not too hard and eventually you will make it through. My only downside of this was the length, however I feel that LIMBO is a concept game, similar to the first Portal game. It is a breakthrough in gaming, however there is a lot left to explore and I hope there are plans to make more LIMBO.. Thoroughly enjoyed this game. There hasn't been a game in black in white that I really love that I can truly remember. The gameplay was difficult but rewarding, and who can forget that spider? Scary!. Innovation at its best. Top notch gameplay feel. Amazing sound and visuals. Mastered ambiance. Anyone who cannot appreciate this game's genius is simply blind.. One of the most visually impressive games ever. It's crazy to think that something in black and white could be so fascinating! Definitely recommended for those skeptical on the best XBLA has to offer.. I love this game so much! Its dark surreal environments coupled withheld the eerie atmospheric sound effects make for a highly enjoyable experience. my only complaint is that its too short;you can get a through it in about an hour. After I finises playing though I started it over again. Definitely worth the $15.. It's one of the best arcade games I've ever bought. It's wrong to say it's too short because it's full of traps and enigmas that sometimes take a lot of time to be solved. I suggest to buy it to everyone who wants a real challenge and likes puzzle games!. Limbo is a dark and scary game from play dead studios. A boys sister has been captured by some weirdos and uncertain of her fate he enters LIMBO. The story isnt fantastic but you play this game for the puzzles. It looks fantastic the darkness and silhouette style is great. The sound off just rushing wind and that slight piano playing makes it sound great too. The puzzles are unique and each failed attempt at a puzzle sees the boy get slaughtered . Overall it's a unique creepy little game i'll give it a 7.5 The review will be on my blog at ****/2011/08/limbo.html. Turning the limitations of a small Indy game into a strength, Limbo is short but fun, has a memorable art style and is a must play downloadable game. The visuals of Limbo are simple and effectively create an eerie atmosphere better than most AAA video games. The game play is simple but adequately fun, the game physics are great and there are some memorable little game moments found in Limbo. Less can be more which is a lesson that the rest of the industry should learn. Recommended.. LIMBO is a atmospheric puzzle platformer so much filled with challenging puzzles that had me stumped for a while to solve. I really enjoyed the immersive and eerie experience this game provided. It's a real shame that it ended so soon (4 hours). I commend the developers for developing a game that EVERYONE can play (I'm hearing impaired). No dialog is played at all, just the beautiful music that play in snyc with the emotion and environments of the game. This is a game that I will pick my controller up and play again and again. I recommend this game to anyone who love puzzle platformers.. I appreciate the art direction, but only at first. There's simply not enough content in this game. The slow pacing drags the already seemingly uninspired direction into a lethargic territory. I would not recommend it (it's short, too).. Almost prefect, no other developer in history had simple but big ideas to invent an masterpiece. limbo's puzzles are incredible, hours of discovering and exploring this world is the set piece. The atmosphere plays like no other game, you can even compare it to Dead Space, Fear or even the Silent Hill games, bone chilling experience. Black and White graphics make it original and incomparable to all the games.. The story sets up its intriguing mystique perfectly, but never really delivers on or even tries to make sense of the plot - nevertheless, the game comes through with awesomely clever physics-based puzzle design, great sound design and a load of super-unique visual and aural atmosphere! Definitely worth replaying, too.. I really wanted to love this game. The art direction is fantastic, the atmosphere is consuming, and the spider is scary as hell. Unfortunately, the game's puzzles and platforming bits are almost entirely guess-and-check (the black and white coloring does not help). Which means enjoy dying countless deaths due to poor game design.. Horror at it's best. The game is so cliqued yet so beautifully executed that you just ignore the clique's. Oh, and did I mention the game was as subtle and scary as **** Yeah, have fun pissing your pant's. However it's hard to distuinguishe a trap untill your amputated head is rolling into a pit.. No way is this game ""media hype"". This is a brilliant puzzle platformer with an amazing art style. Play with the lights off, it will draw you in to is German expressionist, brilliant minimal style. It's gory and exciting. The only complaint I have is the ending. I wanted more and more closure. But this is an awesome game.. Limbo is probably my ""game of the year"" for Xbox Live. The game is so unique, so original and really captivating. The puzzles and challenges are memorable and not soon forgotten. My only gripe is that I can only manage to get 190 GS, the last 10 require you to play through the game in one sitting, dying less than 5 times! There is no way I will ever be able to do that. Seriously people, if you are looking for a game that breaks rules and stands on it's own - no big time brand behind it, no big marketing - check out Limbo. I can't wait for the next game from these developers.. A beautifully directed and constructed game, which is as much a work of art as it is a game. Haunting music and stark, simple graphics, make it utterly absorbing. It's tough to complete, but still shockingly short, though I'd have tired if it had been longer, so there's no real way for it to win other than to retail for less than it is. Well worth your time though - more games should be inspired by Limbo's simple ambitions.. LIMBO is a game that reminds you that simplicity can be the best characteristic of a video game. The art scheme takes LIMBO to a level that, to me, has become a cult following; a cult following I have been happily pulled in to. The game is short, but sweet, and can be difficult at parts. It takes a lot of deep thinking, and that's what makes LIMBO a blast. The physics are spot on, the ambience is creepy, and I never died once because of the games design. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of XBLA's best offerings. You shouldn't miss it. If you are at all into platformers or indy games LIMBO is a true gem of this generation. It proves that you can create incredible atmospheres without fancy 3D graphics, just by good design and careful attention to detail. Towards the end of the game some puzzles get unfair and tough, but that doesn't detract from the overall amazing experience. Highly recommended, although you will die a lot.. LIMBO is an instant classic. The only negative thing I could say about the game is that it isn't all that long, but as an XBLA title it really doesn't need to be a 20 hour epic. It has terrific art direction, mind-bending puzzles, and terrificly gruesome deaths. Many platformers where you die often cause extreme frustration, but each death in LIMBO is a learning experience. The game features a sparse, yet haunting soundtrack. There really isn't much music to speak of, but when the music starts you know that something wicked this way comes. This is THE best XBLA title released this year and one of the best games of 2010 period. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game yesterday!. Very well-made game. Simple and effective. A bit short for the price though, but the brevity makes multiple playthroughs a little easier to manage. The game is very dark, a bit creepy, and has a bit of a sick sense of humor in the ways you can die. A very enjoyable experience though. If you have the money and want something new, get this game.. Beautiful. Just beautiful. If you're a fan of anything dark, twisted, puzzling, creative, and actually scary at times (something rare in today's games) then this is not one to pass up. A second play through probably won't give you that initial thrill that you should feel the first time, and the entire game can be completed in just a few hours, but those are the only things that you can even consider flaws. As far as downloadable games go, it's nearly impossible to top.. I believe this game is nothing more than hype with its users liking it because of the media induced hype. I completed the game and it wasn't anything special, very repetitive nothing more than 200 gamer-score. Although this game is unique I just haven't bought into the genre. Although this review is very negative this is just my opinion, try the demo, it shows the game for everything it is. Taking into account the price i believe this game is mediocre.. It has already been stated that this game blurs the line between art and games. I echo this thought. After reading the interview with the creator of this game I am stuck wondering what it could have been. It's a shame when corporate types and faceless higher-ups can have a say so or in some way hinder the artistic process. Still, LIMBO succeeds and surpasses on all levels. Sound, graphics, game play, and best of all tone. If you don't feel a slight stir whilst playing check your pulse. To play this through as a simple ""run right and jump"" is missing the point I think.. If it weren't for the art direction, this game would have gained little attention. The general vibe is interestingly depressed and monotone, but the implication of the title: that the game somehow explores the concept of being in 'Liumbo' falls apart quickly. It is barely explored in the game itself, and at the halfway mark, the initial interest of being in a real / organic place replete with beats and animals preying on those trapped between worlds falls apart and the game descends into a generic clockwork maze. Filled with turning gears designed to expand the gameplay possibilities, they do not serve the theme or even truly expand the mechanics and show a distinct lack of inspiration and imagination for a game that only last a few hours. Worse, the base mechanics are floaty and imprecise, meaning the character is difficult and annoying to control: problems that were solved in the 90s on the SNES.. Hands down t","creates a moody and dark atmosphere, but the effect loses steam over time . despite its simple graphics, the gameplay is meditative and some puzzles are quite tough . despite its simple graphics, it's still gorgeous ."
332.Silent Hunter III,"This is the first and only SH game I ever played. Back then game wa outstanding, with gorgeous graphics and sound design. Management of submarine ship makes you feel the realities of WWII.. One of the best sub games around. It's not as good graphically as the newest sub games but is a better experience overall. You play on the side of the Germans which may not float your boat, but i def recommend this game to any sub gaming cravings.. Still a great game that holds up all these years later. There are still tons of fun and interesting mods to play. No game is without problems, and this game's issues stem from the clunky crew management system, and issues with video options (can't set your own resolutions without downloading a tweak).. Still the God among subsims.. played it a LOT when it was new.. then came the evil version of starforce.. and I threw away my dvd and used a crack. Now it were cheap at steam, so bought it again.. and the modding community have made it even better! Really great mods, ans 1920x1080 support.. and ..well just two mods to choose from when using that ATM.. but still! The dynamic.. or rather random campaign is great. I hardly want to accelerate time when cruising around (I miss my old really expensive pipe at those times) Seeing a huge battle ship with escorts all around, and trying to set up an attack and calculating torpedoes at the same time is really heart pounding! This one will never leave my memory or my heart!. I got a glimpse of the game through the academy tutorial, which looked interesting. After that, couldn't see much more. I launched the career and started in Kiel. First assignment was to get to some area in North Sea. Alright, so I leave the doc filled with people waving us goodbye. Bye bye! After some time sailing out the harbour, then toward the Nord-Ostsee canal, I I tried to increase the time compression. Not that I don't appreciate the landscapes, but I was eager to get into the real thing. Unfortunately, It wouldn't let me get above 4. I suspect because I was close to the shore. At one point, we passed another ship, for which time I could get to 32x. Once it was too far, back to 4x (not really logical, but well...). So I don't know how long it took in real time to cross the canal, but at least it was a game which let me practice my guitar. After about 30 minutes, and 1/3 way in the canal, i had other things to do, so I saved and quit. I should have known better. Next time, trying to load my save... Loading screen.. and crash. Damned. Try again, same thing. 30 minutes sailing gone to waste. Ok, I try to load the start save in the harbour... Same crash. Try to start the career over ? Same. Delete it and create a new one ? Just crash. Sailing the forums for solutions, at least one thing appeared, crashes are a quite common thing with this game. Especially, I read you mustn't save while a boat is in sight, or the game will crash on next load. Wha-- ?? Wait a minute, you can't save if there's a boat in sight ? In a friggin submarine game ? No wonder it wouldn't load my harbour save! How could Ubisoft quality control let this kind of problem out?? If I was playing a game about guiding camels in the desert, I could be ok with a such a rare circumstance. But this is a naval battle game goddamnit. 1 because the few I saw of the game was interesting. Still, it was 6 wasted dollars.. Silent Hunter 3 is one of the best sub simulators out there. For a game made in 2005? It does an amazing job at everything. The game is really easy to play and if you say that the game can't run? Well don't put the installation in Program Files(x86) Put it in your C: Drive instead. Overall I have no complaints about this game. Better than any sub Sim right now!. Well, if you are expecting some arcade style WW2 submarine game, you better stay away from SH3. Otherwise you'll get bored, you'll come here and start writing reviews saying how boring this game is, etc. This is a WW2 U-boat simulator, this means that you'll spend most of the time sailing the huge empty ocean waiting for a ship or a convoy to get within your reach. If you are fine with this, then keep reading, if you're not, then forget about the Silent Hunter saga. I'm using the GWX 3.0 supermod in combination with other minor mods, and I think this is the best ww2 Uboat game ever made. You start your career as an officer of the kriegsmarine (you can start anytime between 1939 and 1944) you are given the command of one of the most advanced ""submarines"" in the world, your mission is simple: patrol your ocean sector and sink as many enemy ships as you can. Depending on the realism settings you decide to activate, you will need to use trigonometric formulas in order to calculate the target's course, angle of the bow and speed...thus enabling you to launch your torpedoes in the exact time and course to sink the target ship (just like in WW2). Only for this, SH3 should be a game to be respected. Of course you can also use some instruments and members of your crew to help you find out the ""torpedo solution"", so don't worry, you can sink enemy ships even if you are not fond of trigonometry! SH3 has other virtues too, the graphics engine isn't bad at all (is still acceptable even for today's standards), perhaps the main issue you'll find is that the game doesn't have widescreen support (though you can use mods to make it so). I'd recommend to use the GWX supermod and the SH3Commander app to play SH3, as they bring the game to a whole new level. They give SH3 a lot of the quality it lacked at first. Another virtue of SH3 is that you can upgrade your u-boat's engine,batteries,electronic systems (radar, sonar,hydrophone),torpedoes,conning tower, guns, etc. You will receive promotions and medals and your crew members aswell. You can also change your ""old"" u-boat for a newer one (like the uboat type XXI). You can manage your crew all the time, deciding to rest or deploy them in order to get the maximum efficiency from your men. The AI in this game isn't bad, so if you're not careful you'll be sunk. By 1943 you'd better be like a ghost in the ocean, otherwise you'll be sunk before you can even launch the first torpedo against a convoy. Another aspect to point out is the HUGENESS of the ****'ll literally spend months in the sea unless you use the time compression setting (using SH3Commander you'll be able to reach a time compression of 8192x...provided your computer can take it). Don't be surprised, the uboats used to sail at speeds around 10knots (20km/h, roughly), so yes, you'll need a lot of time compression in order to finish a patrol of several months in just some **** uboats were slow and the oceans are HUGE. As a result, finding a convoy in the ocean is like finding a needle in a haystack. You could spend most of your fuel reserves by looking for convoys at sea without finding **** may be frustrating, but it's realistic: 90% of the time spent in uboats was pure boredom, just sailing the ocean for months without any enemy contact. Some people may think this is an issue, but it's not, it's just realistic. Don't worry, in my experience, I've never returned to port empty-handed. I've always sunk 20000 tons of shipping at least. You only need to check the shipping routes map and deploy your uboat in a ""hot spot"" like northern Ireland... there you'll find some ship sooner or later. Still, the game has some issues. For instance, you can't save your game while you have another ship WITHIN YOUR **** you do so, your savegame will crash to desktop the next time you try to load it. There's another issue concerning the change of weather conditions (they don't seem to change), you can solve this by applying some mod or editing some game files, but still, this shouldn't be happening. Anyway, I think SH3 is the best and most complete WW2 uboat game ever. Using GWX, SH3Commander and other mods you'll greatly increase its quality. Enjoy the hunt!. This game is pretty good and by far the best of the whole SH series but with mods it gets to be one of the best and most complex simulators ever! One of my personal favs!. Without its severe flaws, this game would be a 9/10. Worth looking at if you are a mature, very patient gamer willing to put in some serious time. Still worth picking up 2012+ as there has been no really good sub-sim game since. I played it in 2011 with the GWX 3.0 mega-mod (there are newer mods but GWX is still one of the best or most polished). Setup can be difficult. I played a single career for 100 odd hours till 1943 before giving up due to the many bugs (permanent storm weather bug did it for me), but in that time I had some great and intense moments.. I don't get it! Whatever these reviewers are smoking to give this an average score of 90- I want some! Mind numbingly boring is the only way to describe this.","management of submarine ship makes you feel the realities of WWII . it's not as good graphically as the newest sub games, but is a better experience overall . it's a great game that holds up all these years later ."
333.Mark of the Ninja,"Mark of the Ninja gives you lot of different options to tackle a problem however you want, but always gives primary focus to stealth. It hits all the right marks to make it a great stealth game, and even the few flaws that it has can't come close to ruining that. It's a stealth game that's worth playing and that's really the only selling point it needs.. a stealth game that didn't cause me to wanna rip all my hair out, well done klei!. Mark of the Ninja shines brightly in the Xbox marketplace. Its enchanting cartoony artistry, immersive storytelling, and stealthy gameplay seamlessly blend to create an extraordinary gaming journey. From its high-quality visuals to its captivating gameplay, stellar voice acting, and overall brilliance, it's an absolute masterpiece.. I so love this Ninja game, its perfect for any Ninja fan and i love Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Blade, Tenchu etc. One of the best games I've played recently. Great atmosphere and controls, nice scenario so far, and improvements are really good for the game's longevity. This makes me reconsider playing Shanks which I bought during a promo but never really played.. This game is great. The stealth is tense, but it moves quickly. Pulling of a difficult kill or knockout is gratifying, and the checkpoints are close enough together to allow you to be creative in your approach without risking losing a ton of progress. When it was over, I wanted more.. Let's get to the point right away. The most important thing Mark of the Ninja gets right, is that stealth is actually FUN in this game. Not unfair, not frustrating. Just fun. Using your equipment in creative ways, and successfully executing your plans to take out multiple enemies has rarely been this satisfying. And it has to be, of course, since you're basically helpless against enemy firepower. This is not an beat em' up, by any means. Controls are tight, game mechanics are easy to adopt, and the feeling of ""one more time!"" is almost always there if you happen to screw up (and you will). Checkpoints are plentiful enough too, which also makes testing all kinds of approaches much more enjoyable. The game also makes a good job of telling you what you did right or wrong, visual indicators are easy to understand, and they become your best friend in Mark of the Ninja. Speaking of the visuals; this game is absolutely b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l to look at. It has a distinct personality of its own. Cut scenes reminded me a bit of Samurai Jack. The music is also good, creating atmosphere and excitement when it needs to. Tl;dr: this is a game that every stealth-loving Xbox-gamer should definitely own.. Mark of the NInja does 3 things : 1. Defines what a sneak side scroller should be 2. Defines what a ninja game should be 3. Defines what an ANIMATED side scroller should be 1 To start, if you're not a fan of sneak, hide in the shadows games, than you're better off ignoring this game all together rather than giving it a bad review because it doesn't suit your ""tastes"". Simple as that. However, if you love or favor sneak games, you will love this game. I've never played a more fluid, fun, well rounded hide-in-the-shadows side scroller in... well ever. The people at Klei Entertainment have perfected this somewhat obscure genre. Stealth kills? Yep. Sneak past guards and hide in the shadows? (Like a true ninja) Absolutely. Utilize various tools and gadgets to gain tactical advantage? Yes. Everything you'd except from a 10 out of 10 game. 2. Getting onto the ninja aspect of the game, I would dare to wager that this experience exceeds that of any ninja based side scroller, ever. And even the majority of 3D ninja games. Why? It, again, perfects everything that a ninja game should be. Stealth kills, dodging guards, traps, pitfalls, hiding in the shadows... it has it all. I've never felt more like a bad ass ninja than in this game. The fluidity of the gameplay is unparalleled, and seamlessly ties together action, stealth, and skill. The controls are easy to pick up, due to it's relatively easy button scheme and helpful on screen tips and indicators. The most fun I had was being able to unlock costumes and upgrade your arsenal, which enhances the gameplay incredibly. The levels are well thought out and built for maximum re-playability. Going for achievements is fun, and trying to complete every objective is a well rewarded goal. One con I have about this game is the story is not outstanding, although still decent. It had some welcome twist and turns, but the overall story is just not that memorable. 3. Lastly, the animation is gorgeous. It's smooth, fluid, and paints the whole game together in a beautiful art style that sadly is not used very often. The cut scenes are a welcome animated experience, and some scenes use some pretty obscure artistic styles that pop to the eye, and give the game a more artistic feel (mainly the end of the game). More games need this kind of animated style. The sound effects and music are utilized well, and create a ninja game you can really immerse yourself into. Seriously, there's a lot to love about this game, especially if ninjas or sneak based games are up your alley. And if not, give this game a try anyway and you might just become a convert. This is side scrolling gameplay and animation at it's best.. This was the best ninja stealth game since Tenchu! The 2d art style is so clean... the guys at Klei have it down to a science. The stealth gameplay is so tight. The use of light, shadow and sound work really well in the side-scrolling setting because you can observe everything around you. Strike hard and fade away... there is something so very satisfying about killing a guy, stringing him up for others to see and then watching them run around and shoot each other out of fear! If you're a fan of stealth... this is an excellent game.. ""Mark of the Ninja"" is an outstanding game from the developers of ""Shank"" and ""Don't Starve"", and one of the best stealth games released in the past couple of years.. Aside from some issues with the context sensitive controls, it's a fantastic blend of quick reactions and great gameplay. The graphics are great and the art style is easy on the eyes. The gameplay is so incredibly strong as well. Aside from one or two hitches this game is a surprisingly fantastic stealth game. 2D stealth is an unusual medium, but Mark of the Ninja makes it work phenomenally well. 9.75. Usually, I don't like 2D Games, but this one is great exception. It has everything you need to be entertained and challenged plus excellent setting and sound, good controls once you get used to them.. I think this is a pretty dull game. Mainly because I found it really hard to try beating this game, and I'm not talking about difficulty. It was fun for the first few levels, but after that it was quite repetitive. Crawl into a vent, kill some guard, repeat. This games really doesn't have much of a plot either, so nothing else could really redeem it. It isn't really something that you need to play or that you should really want to play.. Feels fun and fresh, but you've got to be creative on your way to kill. It can get repetitive after a while. Worth a try though, i enjoyed it a lot, and stealth seems to be a genre dying for the lack of quality put by devs on the genre. But this is a game that does stealth right. It's 2D so it might not be your cup of tea. But for me, this game was a blast. And for 15$, it's a bargain.. A really great stealth game. While the story starts off pretty slowly, it picks up quickly and all the pieces fall together in the end. The game play is simple trial and error stealth with numerous ways to take on every level. Once you obtain enough medals and progress through the game further you can unlock even more ways to play with different costumes and equipment. While the best gear is unlocked pretty early on, the difficulty is pretty consistent through out. The game is good looking and the cutscenes are well made. I'll enjoy scaring guards to death before killing them for a long while.. Tom Clancy move over this is the new stealth! and the graphics are dope!!! and the music... best marketplace game ever! i couldn't say GOTY but maybe for DLC games... overall seriously you should get it. it's cheap and it's freaking AMAZING. An excellent experience all around. Well polished with a clearly well laid out plan for its design and presentation. Replay value is impressive as well. For the price you just can't beat this. If you have any interest in stealth based gameplay dont miss this one. If you have a distaste for stealth based gameplay it might just not be your cup of tea.. Easily the best XBLA game I've played in my life. The way in which enemies come onto the stage is like an old school arcade game except the whole narrative is laid out like an action/RPG. The story is epic, the graphics are unbelievable, and the voice acting is incredible. HIGHLY recommend it. Very affordable as well.. A remarkable and refreshingly original title. As much as I enjoy stealth/action games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell and of course Metal Gear sometimes I get the urge to play, you know, a stealth/STEALTH game. To be a ghostly assassin or, in this case, a ninja. Allowing me to do that in an expressive and brilliantly designed 2D side scrolling field is a revelation because it works so well yet has been so underused by video games in general outside of cult classics like Flashback and Out of this World. In a year full of high profile disappointments (Mass Effect 3, Assassin's Creed 3) it's nice to be greeted with a genuine surprise. In my book this is the sleeper hit of the year and a worthy contender for GOTY.. • Mark of the Ninja is a 2D side-scrolling stealth game where you play a ninja grappling from lamp posts and hiding behind plant pots in an effort to either avoid people completely of sneak up behind them for a silent kill. • Early on the game presents some wonderful anime style cut scenes but does not deliver on their potential, being reduced to tiny bites as the game progresses. • An interesting art style that combines with some well thought out user interface effects to convey exactly when you are hidden or visible and generally what will reveal your position to the enemy. • While I struggle to find much wrong with the game mechanically, the entire package just feels un-exciting.. Amazing game. Shows that 2D still has plenty of juice left in it. I can't imagine what this game would be like in 3D. Probably a pile of **** The main reason being controls. No worries about camera issues or wonky 3D navigation. You hit left and jump, you jump to the left. Simple. I usually avoid stealth games. Too much waiting, just to be screwed over by sloppy controls. But his isn't an issue with Mark of the Ninja. Like I already said, the controls are spot on. There's some waiting required, but it isn't as much of an issue. I know that when the guard turns around and walks away, I'll be able to sneak up on him and take him out. No worries about the tip of my shoe crossing their line of sight and setting of a thousand alarms. Unlike most 2D games and even plenty of 3D ""sandbox"" games, there's plenty of ways to make your way through a level. Kill everyone who gets in your way? Distract them and sneak by? Or maybe kill everyone and string their bodies up on lampposts? It's up to you. Several different outfits and equipment are available for you to take on a level however you choose. Most levels (maybe all) can be beaten without ever being seen by the enemy. The graphics are well executed. This however is the main area that I have a problem with. The graphics are fine, but the style doesn't sit well with me. It's got one of those generic Saturday morning cartoon looks to it. Same style as the companies previous work, Shank. If this game had had a more serious look (anime, ninja scroll style?) , it may have gotten a perfect score. Could also use a few more execution animations as well. Lots of voice work in this and it's all good. A Japanese voiced, english sub-titled audio track would've been nice and made the whole thing feel more authentic. For the price, this is a must download title. Even at double the price, this would be a game worth checking out. Great game with plenty to do even after you've beaten the mission. New game + , all the different equipment/outfit combos, and three unique and inventive challenges per level. Probably the best downloadable title of the year.. This game is very fun and let you play the levels in different ways and styles. A good stealthy game where you can go through a level killing every one you meet or pass like a shadow. Best game of xbox live i bought. Ignore the people who gave this game a bad score and didn't explain themselves as those scores are probably fraudulent. If you like stealth games or like ninjas you will thoroughly enjoy this game. This game does not reward those who just rush into the room blindly; in fact it will severely punish you. At first your abilities are limited but with time you can add new skills and weapons. This game is a ton of fun because you can get through each level in a multitude of ways. Replay value is huge as you can try different paths, explore the levels (which is must to get skill ups) and you can either try to kill no one (extremely hard) or try to kill everyone (also extremely hard if you want to do it without alerting anyone).. A highly enjoyable game, that refreshes the stealth action genre through an amazing presentation and flawless gameplay. This awesome game left in shame the summer of arcade selection of this year. Good job Klei!. Mark of the Ninja is simply put an amazing game. Klei Entertainment has merged together some great mechanics and art style into a near perfect game. The environment sensitive movement is done quite well. When you want to climb a wall jump onto it and climb if you want to transition to handing from the ceiling just hit A and you are there its all very easy and flow nicely. Mark of the Ninja has a good amount of upgrades which you earn by getting honor points that you can collect during missions by doing certain objectives, that might include get through an area without being detected. You also earn honor by getting enough points, which you get by doing anything during a mission, you kill a guard you get some points, hide that guards body get some more points, you hide behind a planter more points for you but be careful not to get detected because you lose points too. With the mixture of great game play and awesome art Mark of the Ninja is definitely a great game to pick up.. I'm so glad that there is finally a game, since Shadow Complex, that finally is worth the money on Xbox live. I always seemed disappointed to spend $15 or more on these games that get hyped up for no reason. This game is incredible in every way. Splinter Cell, ninjas, and side scrollers just had a baby... and it's damn sexy.. I had no idea this game existed until about a week ago when I checked Metacritic. I downloaded the XBLA demo and, after playing the first level, was impressed enough to buy it. There is no doubt in my mind that this game deserves the approx. $15 price tag you'll pay for it. An instant stealth action 2D classic, in my opinion, Mark of the Ninja makes you play as a ninja in a quest of revenge, with a few twists. The story and cutscenes are good enough, although they could have skipped it and it wouldn't change my opinion about the game. The level design is very well-done. There are multiple paths available, some obvious, some less. But even for the less obvious paths, navigating around the levels is still well-paced and doesn't bore you. After each level, you get to upgrade your gear using Honor points, awarded for avoiding detection, stylish kills or going through the level without killing anyone. Speaking of stylish skills, a lot of upgrades are available to allow you to kill in different fashions, from hanging down a pole to killing some poor guard through a door. Not killing anyone is also a great challenge, made easier with the use of upgradable and unlockable ninja tools, such as firecrackers and flares. Aggression tools are also available, such as traps and ravenous insects that devour enemies alive, scaring the crap out of everybody witnessing it. One thing that is very enjoyable is actually to terrorize guards by committing gratuitous violent actions and having them witness it. You can hang bodies to poles, throw dead bodies at a guard, use poison, etc. to terrorize guards. Scared guards will become trigger happy and shoot at everything that makes a sound or appears through the darkness, be it rats, or even their fellow guards. A very fun and challenging way to play levels is to terrorize guards and lead them to clear a building filled with their colleagues, using quick appearances through lights or the use of firecrackers to fuel their fear, only to have them throw themselves off a ledge when they're done. Other upgrades include different suits that give advantages such as, per example, silent running to the detriment of carrying weapons. The game is long enough and the replay value is huge considering the upgrades, multiple ways to dispatch enemies and the New Game Plus mode, which adds a restricted line of sight and overall make the lurking in the shadows experience a lot more stressful and realistic. The checkpoint system is also great: getting detected and killed will not affect your end score and will just reload you at the previous checkpoint, allowing you to try different things and aim for a perfect score without having to restart the level countless times. I have only two complaints about this game. While the controls are great, the Action button is used for too many things, such as dragging bodies, hiding in doorways, pickpocketting, etc. It is usually not a problem unless when in a room with many options. It's a little shameful considering the LB button is not used for anything, so they could have used it for some of these actions and spare us the previously mentionned troubles. The other complaint I have is that there is no way to play specific levels or even restart a game once you completed the story once. You can only have a single save per storage device and you can't start over without deleting it entirely. The very enjoyable game experience do make up for these two issues however, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes stealth action and platformers.. Wow! Just wonderful! Am rarely tempted by anything on XBLA beyond the usual big titles DLC bolt-ons, but this is a lot of game for a small price. Just blown away by how beautifully realised it all is. And it's that rare thing these days, truly challenging. Bravo!. A fresh take on the 2d side scroller, an excellent stealth game and a very fun play. For what you're paying it's well worth it! The story is good yet I wish more was explained at the end, it could've lead to a better twist in my opinion! But seriously, there's a surprising amount of game styles to play the game with which increase the replayability too! Definitely check this one out!. This is a fantastic game that flawlessly puts you in the shoes of an elite assassin. This is stealth done right. There were very little moments were I didn't feel at the mercy of controls or poor design. Whatever I wanted to do I could execute with finesse. Although there is plenty of content for the price, I only wish that there was more! I would gladly buy any DLC for this game!. This game is a lot of fun ! I must say i didnt thought it will be a good game and now i am surpised to say that! The game has a lot of stuff to do even if u beat the game there are deferent modes or try to not kill anyone and its a lot of fun!You can upgrade stuff or learn new stuff unlock items and many many other stuff! The only bad thing is it doesnt have coop! That is all!. An spetacular game! You really feel lika a ninja. Stealth is back, for fans of this genre this game is a must buy. The graphics are cool, the gameplay is solid and fun. Go buy now!. Coming from a person who really enjoys their stealth and ninja games (Ninja, Tenchu, MGS, Splinter Cell, etc.) ""Mark of the NInja"" absolutely destroys the genre, in a very, very, very good way. The art style is fantastic. Very reminiscent to ""Shank"", which makes sense, as their both made by the same company. I played through Shank and Shank 2, and I prefer the ""Mark of The Ninja"" over them both. The stealth elements are incredible. Moving the joystick makes your character move at a slow sneaking pace. Running is very seldom throughout this game, as it garners too much attention. It's more so used for backtracking, or running away. From what I've played so far, the controls are great. No button miss-presses or clunky game mechanics that have accidentally gotten me killed. Every time I died, it was my own fault. Speaking of dying in this game, I love how harsh the creators were when it comes to being spotted. From the first level, the majority of enemies have guns. If you're seen at all, and you try to engage them by running in blindly, you're probably going to die. A few shots to your ninja and he's toast. This unforgiving element of the game only adds to how important the stealth element of this game really is. If this game were sold as a hard copy for $60, I would still pay for it. Please, do yourself a favor. If you're into platforming/stealth/ninja gaming at all, this is a must buy. Even if you're not, it's at least worth a download of the trial.. Bar none, Mark of the Ninja is the golden standard of stealth gaming. It seamlessly integrates its concepts onto a 2D plane, creating an incredibly absorbing and tactical experience. Don't miss it.. Klei Entertainment and I seem to have a long and understanding relationship. When I feel the need to murder something they provide a compelling, addictive and ingenious little downloadable title for me to munch on. Mark of the Ninja is another hallmark in our simple, but beautiful, relationship. Hitting all the right notes for a stealth and precision freak like myself and having enough left over for me to share. The visual style, not breaking from the brilliant Shank franchise, is fluid and overall Mark of the Ninja was constantly testing my decision to name The Walking Dead my favourite downloadable title of the year. It cannot be missed, so go buy it. Now.. Klei Entertainment's latest is a slice of genius, not only due to the sublimely intense gameplay, but also thanks to the brilliance of the implementation throughout. A lot of thought has clearly gone into the gameplay, and the concept is never sold-short - everything, and I mean everything, is geared towards the stealth action, from the controls, to the graphics and sound. As some sort of comparison (because I'm afraid I'm going to spoil the surprise for you, when you lay your hands on this game) I will say this: Klei Entertainment's previous games, the Shank series, were beautifully presented, but were let down by the fact, that eventually when all the gloss and goodwill has been used up, they didn't have much else to them really. Mark of the Ninja has so much more to it than both of the Shank titles, and the fact its so good can only mean that even if you fail to try the demo (which is free by the way, so why not?). A splendid revival for Stealth and Ninja antics indeed!! As a UK gamer, who's lost a lot of this weekend to this beauty, I can confirm that the £10 price is a steal!!. There is only one game you should get right now and that is this game! If you miss all the good stealth action from earlier days like tenchu then you need to get this game! It has everything you would expect real a ninja game to have and more. The 2d scrolling fits the game great and the game never feels liner due to the multiple pathways you can take. You can either decide to kill everyone on the map or you can decide to just sneak past them all. The game will reward you depending on witch style you want to use so you never feel obligated to do just one **** will be doing yourself a favor getting this and also help show love for this so they can make a sequel because after playing it i want MOAR! I honestly could go on and on how great this game is how beautiful the animations is how satisfying the stealth kills are but it won be enough, you need to get this game! So stop reading this right now and get online and buy this game.I promise you that it`s something you will not regret buying What the hell?! Are you still reading this?! GO BUY IT NAO GOD DAMN IT!. One of the finest games out there on the Xbox marketplace, the cartoony art style mixed with the great story and stealth game play creates one of the coolest games i have played in quite a while. Mark of the ninja hits the ball out of the park with its graphical style, gameplay, voice acting and overall excellence. Mark of the ninja is totally worth getting at its 14.99 price tag.. After the disappointment of Deadlight (which admittedly is a good, if ludicrously short, game), and DUST: Elysian Tale (uuurgh those awful awful anime characters) this is what we have been waiting for. As good as, if not better in some respects, than Shadow Complex! A 2d Platformer with great graphics, very similar in style to Shank, atmospheric sound and above all excellent gameplay. It's like a 2d tenchu game mixed with the visual sight line enemies from the 'commandos' games. Stealth plays a huge part in the game, with you able to go through levels without killing anyone (very difficult though) and this is where the replayability comes in as each stage is rated and you will constantly come back to them to try and better your score, or just try the level in different ways. there are minor alternative routes but it is still fairly linear, though even finding a seperate corridor or tunnel that leads to a ladder that takes you onto a rooftop is a joy. The enemies are numerous and can be avoided using cover and shadows, or killed in a stealthy fashion (points are graded on kill style and additional things such as using equipment and hiding the bodies successfully. It's a great score attack game and, with no time limit pressuring you, you are free to take your time. You can also follow different paths, such as a silent assassin which is self-explanatory, or the horror path where you can freak out guards by stringing up bodies around. You can freeze action mid air and fire darts to destroy lights and fuse boxes, you can dump guards bodies into skips, into vents or off ledges etc. You can use spike mines, smoke bombs, and caltrops to aid you, and you can buy loads of abilities and upgrades for your moves list and equipment. there is a lot here for your money. It's a great game and it's absolutely worth the 1200 points, in fact it's a steal at that price. It has online leaderboards as usual so you can compare your score to your friends / the world.. In my humble opinion this game is the best entertainment value for the money you can currently spend on X box live. It is a giant leap in game quality, compared to its predecessor Shank. It seems that Klei Entertainment have come into their own, and have earned my loyalty for what i hope are many more games to come.. Mark of the Ninja, by Klei Entertainment, is one of the best XBLA games I have ever played. A similar (but superior) visual style to Klei's previous games Shank and Shank 2 definitely helps, as does the great story, but the real winner here is the gameplay. The fact that this is a 2D sidescroller and has some of the best stealth gameplay I've ever encountered says something truly impressive about the game. If you have an Xbox, you should definitely consider buying this right now.","mark of the Ninja hits all the right marks to make it a great stealth game . it's a stealth game that's worth playing and that's the only selling point it needs . it's enchanting cartoony artistry, immersive storytelling, and stealthy gameplay seamlessly blend ."
334.Thank Goodness You're Here!,"This is a cute little point-and-click Adventure game where instead of clicking on things you slap things and that causes New Paths to unlock and new bits of story to progress. Short and sweet but I enjoyed my entire playthrough. Didn't need gimmicks or mini games to progress and was held up by its art and its humor. Really enjoyed this game. Immediately enjoyed the quirky British humor. Game started with a montage of goofy commercials about a fake town in the UK and I knew I was in for a wild ride as soon as I saw it. The Game definitely lines up with my sense of humor and found myself giggling to myself while playing. The whole section with Bessie the cow was super weird, it's probably the one section where the humor lost me.. Flawless. A gosh dang masterpiece!!!!!! This is a very good video ️️️️. Thank Goodness You’re Here is a whimsical and surreal adventure game that takes players through the quirky town of Barnsworth, where oddball characters and bizarre situations create a delightful, humorous experience. the game is filled with absurd yet charming moments, blending exploration, light puzzle-solving, and a hefty dose of British humor. Pros: Unique and Humorous Visual Style: The game features hand-drawn, cartoonish visuals that feel like they’ve been plucked straight from a comic book. Every character and setting is packed with personality, giving the game a distinct, memorable look that enhances its playful tone. Absurd Humor and Dialogue: The dialogue is full of witty, dry humor that makes every interaction entertaining. Whether you’re talking to the oddball residents or completing a strange task, the writing keeps you smiling with its unexpected twists and laugh-out-loud moments. Bizarre but Engaging World: The town of Barnsworth is a joy to explore. Every corner hides something peculiar, whether it’s an eccentric character or an odd event. The game encourages players to slow down, poke around, and enjoy its quirky world, rewarding curiosity with funny and surprising encounters. Cons: Short Playtime: While the world is delightful to explore, the overall game is quite short. Players may find themselves wishing for more content or deeper exploration after finishing it in just a few hours. It's more of a bite-sized experience than a full meal. Simple Puzzles: The puzzles, while fun, are on the easier side and may not satisfy players looking for a challenge. Most solutions are straightforward and rely more on comedic outcomes than critical thinking, which can be a downside for those craving more depth. Lack of Replay Value: Once you’ve completed the game, there’s little incentive to replay it. The humor and story are delightful the first time through, but without multiple paths or significant changes in a second playthrough, the experience may feel like a one-and-done adventure. Final Verdict:Thank Goodness You’re Here is a delightful, whimsical adventure that thrives on its quirky humor, distinctive art, and engaging world. While the short length and simple gameplay may leave some wanting more, it’s a perfect game for those looking to enjoy a light-hearted, funny experience. It’s a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that’s part of its charm.I give it 9/10 odd jobs well done!. Busy work is fun? Or it's miserable? Maybe it's about the people we met and then forgot about along the way? I don't get it.... Is it funny? Yes. Is it worth $20? Absolutely not. At $10 an hour there just isn't enough here to justify the price. The game will make you laugh out loud and feel as if you're playing an obscure Adult Swim show from 2010 though.. You need to go in this one blind. I laughed from start to finish! You will never EVER play a game quite like this one. I‘m just sad it wasn’t longer because it was amazing. If you’ve got a sense of humor, you need to play this game. I really hope the developers make more of these types of games. One-of-a-kind!. Played for a few hours hoping it'd get funnier or more entertaining ... Started off kooky.. and stayed kooky.. but not particularly funny IMO. Ended up feeling like a grind after an hour or two so I quit.. (MY SCORE : 8.5 /10) A unique and absurd cartoon-style Slapstick-Platformer Comedy Adventure Game! We will be made to laugh throughout the game, if we are able to understand the sentences uttered by each NPC after being ""Slapped"" by our character. We become a Salesman whose unique appearance is mini and yellow, who takes the time to help the residents of Barnsworth Town who give him a very strange task. One of them was when he helped a resident who was sick, by helping guide his extended arms to shop! The absence of ""Directions"" in this game will certainly make Gamers often feel confused, requiring exploration and having to pass through one area several times to trigger the mission implied in this Game.. My goty contender for 2024. An hilarious short game. You never know what to expect. The animations are great and the banters hilarious.. Very funny, full of fun and cute easter eggs. Gameplay is occasionally a bit of a slog, I wish the world opened up a bit more. Only a few hours, but the price reflects that.. An impressive, super creative playable cartoon, with some extraordinary artwork, sound design and music. However, as a game, it’s kind of boring. It’s pretty much an interactive movie, with little gameplay. There are “puzzles”, but most of them are solved by slapping everything in sight. It’s gets repetitive quickly, but you keep on playing to see all the weird scenarios - and let me tell you, in that regard, the game doesn’t disappointed. It’s truly one of the weirdest games I’ve ever played, but in a good way. What it all comes down to though, is the humor, which will be hit or miss with many people. It’s British, yes, but that doesn’t make it inherently funny. For me, it’s a bit too superficially “random”; it’s basically a never ending series of parodies on British stereotypes and culture, with very little context, and a few strong zingers here and there. It’s bold though, I’ll give it that, and sometime there’s some clever comedy, but other times the game resorts to childish humor, like slapping butt cheeks or even slapstick. Personally, it didn’t make me laugh, but it did make me chuckle occasionally. Maybe you’ll like it more than I did. No matter what, it deserves praise for trying something different; just don’t go in expecting a good “game”, but rather just a good experience.",short and sweet but I enjoyed my entire playthrough . didn't need gimmicks or mini games to progress and was held up by its art and its humor .
335.Chained Echoes,"The crystals system was atrocious. The complaints stop there. This game is truly amazing. Some of the best (maybe the best) combat I’ve ever experienced in an old-school style rpg. it would be between this game and Octopath traveler 2 for that title. Great story, good music, good story. If you like old school JRPG’s, or JRPG’s in general, this is a must play.. Everything is great: scenario, art design, gameplay. To 10 lacked a well thought out system of crystals, a lot of garbage.. I played chained echoes on Nintendo switch and it was an amazing experience. I could say easily one of the best RPG I ever played. Everything looks perfect in there.. Don't be fooled by the old-school graphics. This is a bold, sophisticated, and tasteful ride of a story with what I believe to be a hell of an ending. The game and world design are also so exceedingly well done, you almost feel like you're stealing from the game with how much it gives you. Chained Echoes is so good at what it does that it transcends the retro-homage approach and is something original, unique, and enjoyable for just about anyone.. I enjoyed the beginning of the game, but after a while I couldn't wait for it to end. Positives: Music: The music sounds great and is evocative of SNES-era music. Movement: The character moves around the overworld very nicely and it only gets better as the game goes on. Collectibles: There's a ton of collectibles basically everywhere and it's relatively fun to track them down as you go. Neutrals: Combat: The combat system is the game is really fun at times, but at other times is kind of frustrating. The overdrive mechanic is decent but I was pretty bored of it by the end. I'm sure lots of builds are viable but I went a defensive build and by the end none of the enemies did any damage so it ended up quite boring. Crystals: The crystal system is kind of cool, but IMO overcomplicated and ultimately pretty unnecessary. I'd have liked to have seen augments beyond just X% more damage, or Y% less damage, etc. Negatives: Sky Armor Combat: Roughly halfway through the game, you gain the ability to use another form of combat in a sky armor. I hated this combat so much that I would usually stop playing and take a break whenever it came up. There are a lot of fights when you simply have to use it. I never really understood the sky armor upgrades and they were often counterintuitive to me (I got a better piece of gear, but now my moves got swapped, and it doesn't really explain this, etc.). The sky armor battles were all really easy so it doesn't make the game unbeatable or anything just not a good system. The one benefit is that it's fun to fly around the overworld in your sky armor. Story: The story of this game was a huge mess. How many people got stabbed in the back at various points? Feels like the creator of the game animated one knife animation and decided to use it for every single twist. Maybe it's just me but I hated it.. Great story, really great pixel graphics, amazing music, very interesting battle system… and all of that was ruined for me by the weirdest difficulty system I've ever seen. I've played a bunch of JRPGs in my day. I've never been particularly good at them, but I can’t call myself completely helpless either. But this game… Maybe I’m missing something, but in its default settings, it’s just way too hard for me, unpleasantly hard even. Tuning down the aggressiveness didn’t do much for me. And tuning down enemy stats completely eliminates any challenge. So, in its default form, the game is too hard, and when I tried to adjust the difficulty a little bit, it became ridiculously easy. Too bad. I really like it, but I won't enjoy it. Probably, it’s just me **** at the game and not the game itself, but that doesn’t make much difference, to be honest.. Chained Echoes is an RPG that busts all the cliches of indie retro games by being as good if not better than the ‘90s material that inspired it. A tale of gods, monsters, kings and magic, it deftly weaves together an epic overarching plot with a grounded bunch of characters who have a sense of humour and real personality. The overdrive meter in combat makes fights way more fun, and the lack of random battles and focus on collection/exploration is wise. Oh and all the quality of life improvements you’d want are here (characters move at a rapid clip, there are multiple ways to fast travel, very little grinding). There are a few issues— some of the exploration can feel like walking through the same sparse territory, and the narrative gets a little over complicated at times. But the bottom line is that this is a game that could have wiped the floor with top titles back in ‘the day’, and needs to be experienced. The fact that a one-man team did all this is the cherry on top— pray that he has the energy left to develop a sequel.. 9/10, GOTY, critical acclaim, Chained Echoes (CE) gets all the accolades. But I think we need to have an intervention, fam. 9/10 should mean one of the best games ever. Is this really at the top of your lists? How do I think this game stacks up? Let's start with the music? It's actually quite good, but sometimes feels derivative. The hideout sounds kinda like the Rito village track, and there's this quirky song that plays for comedic effect that sounds a lot like FF4's Mysidia track. Still, I thought the music was quite good, not top tier, but good. 8/10. What about the graphics? I'd give it a solid 7/10. It doesn't look bad, but there are definitely better looking pixel art games. Oh, you want me to name them? Sure. Just in the past few years: Eastward; Sea of Stars; Celeste; Owlboy. Does CE come close to any of these games in the looks department? Please be honest with yourselves. What about the gameplay? Is this one of the best playing JRPG-style games ever? Is it more innovative than the Chrono games, Xenogears, Undertale? Is it extremely polished and balanced? IS IT REALLY EXCEPTIONAL? Naw, bruh. I think its action is closest to Battle Chasers (BC), with the Overdrive mechanic put on top, but I honestly think BC has the better system. Even as slow as that game moves, CE's battles feel longer, mostly because enemies have tooooons of HP. In BC, I consider how much HP and MP/TP I'm willing to spend at any point in a battle. Here, I just go all out all the time. Starting with full health and skill points mostly takes some of the strategy out of the game. Why should I not just spam my strongest skills all the time? Battles end up repetitive because tactics aren't necessary, saving HP and TP is not the main concern, instead it's finishing fights as fast as possible. I often wondered if I should let some of my characters die to make certain battles go faster, because there's no real downside to that. Apart from the action, a lot of stuff seems directly lifted from classic JRPGs, but done worse. A character eats enemies to gain skills, but you can't use that skill until you use a skill point- oops, sorry - use a gRiMoIrE sHaRd to be able to use that skill in battle. Your party splits into three groups, and the thief has to steal clothes to sneak by unnoticed - except this is done in a cut scene instead of through the gameplay. The team has an underground base that is eerily similar to the Returner's hideout, and the main character has an existential dilemma about their stance on war - but it mostly gets resolved quickly. You can recruit people to join your hideout (BoF 2), the three wise men are referenced (CT), there's a dude who says stuff like ""goodly good"" (CC), a boss that has 4 crystals floating behind it (SMRPG), a trio of bad guys that are large monsters surrounding a small floating platform (Zable Fahr from SD3), the main character has a skill called Whrilwind Slash (CT again), and some bad guy is carrying around the spear of Longinus from Evangelion... I dunno, man, at some point it kinda felt like bad fanfic. I should have taken notes during my playthrough, because I'm sure I'm forgetting tons of bits like this. Again, being derivative isn't all that problematic, it's just that every derivative thing is worse than the original. But how about that story, yeah? Is it a sprawling affair or betrayal and coups, shocking us and surprising us at every turn? No, not really. There are some ""twists"", but they mostly made me groan rather than surprise me. One main antagonist has a plan so devious, so obtuse, so inscrutable, so improbable to actually work, that when it ""came to fruition"" I could not physically prevent my eyes from rolling back into my brain. The ending is entirely unsatisfying, not in the unsatisfying but interestingly open-ended ending of a Murakami novel. A bunch of secondary characters are completely unnecessary to the plot, some ""important"" ones are immediately forgotten once their minor act ends. The game also has some other minor mechanical issues: some sprites kinda jitter on screen (PC version); menus are janky; store interfaces are bad; buying materials for crafting is a huge drag because it involves going to like 5 different stores; using a DualSense, many button prompts are incorrect. None of these minor gripes really matter, but on top of all the other unfulfilling stuff, but it does add to the overall irritation this game cooks up.. I loved this game from start to finish, I really would prefer to conclude some lose ends, but that's left for the sequel, this game is amazing and I loved the experience of playing this JRPG.. I cannot express how much I love this game. With all its little JRPG throw backs done right. It was a joy. The music, the gameplay, sidequests, all of it was well done and amazing. Mattias Linda is a legend for bringing this game to life. Without spoiling anything, if you go on to play NG+ make sure to understand the mechanics and have the best gear you can get, otherwise it can be pretty tough. I hope you enjoy the 'turtle race"" as much as I did.. This really brought me back. Its in a league of its own. Not perfect but one of the best jrpgs I ever played. It really like stuck me back 30 years ago in my families home and triggered feelings I haven’t felt in so long I didn’t remember them. Its just such a breath of fresh air and so refreshing. I havent played a jrpg in a decade or more or let alone liked it. This was a real treat. I dont really believe just one or two people did it by themselves.. A must play for any serious JRPG fan, particuarly those who enjoyed key titles from the SNES era like Final Fantasy VI. This game has the whole package, lovable characters, an engaging plot, a varied and interesting world, combat that's challenging but not frustrating, a progression system that isn't dependent on grinding, in fact almost every system in this game respects the player's time. I really, REALLY enjoyed my time with this game, and I hope you will too.. An amalgamation of references to old RPGs that doesn't mesh or come together in any way. Overdrive system ruins the game and feels like a straightjacket. Every battle is long and drawn out for no reason. Either make Overdrive unique to boss fights, or make it a bonus *only* and not a penalty. Finally, too many characters are blatant plagiarism.. Gorgeous game. Takes inspiration from all the greats of JRPGs, like Chrono Trigger and even Suikoden. Memorable soundtrack, luscious environments. Only docking a point for lack of diversity in character design that makes the game less functional. The main party consists of all blondes, brunettes and redheads in a way that makes them hard to tell apart. Other than that, I enjoyed every minute. A stunning achievement.. Unlike many modern 2D JRPGs, this is not merely a game that seeks to cash in on nostalgia for the golden age of JRPGs (Chrono Trigger, FF6, etc). It feels instead like it could have *been* one of those genre-defining games, not merely capturing their spirit but building upon it with impeccable taste.. Like the game Sea of Stars this is a must play game. I hope they keep releasing games like these every year. Its a nostalgic adventure that reminds me of Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG. 10 OUT OF 10.. I desperately tried to enjoy myself but oof, the writing was just so bad. The combat just felt too on rails too. I bought into the hype and good reviews but feel like I fell into the trap of something over rated. It's clearly not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Maybe the lack of exposure to what actual good writing is leading to people thinking this is good or I'm just spoiled. I'm a huge book nerd, I've read and reviewed hundreds of books just within the last few years, so I'd like to think I'm a pretty good judge of what good writing is like. This was not it, it felt cringey, dry, overly reliant on exposition dumps and poor pacing. You get overwhelmed with nouns of people, places and things that just arnt introduced in a way that allows a person to get attached to the world or being able to recognize what's in it. Story is important for this game because in the first 10 hours for example, 7-8 of those felt like it was reading dialog or running to the next place to get to the next piece of dialog. Lots of mini cut scenes, so it's very obviously story driven but unfortunately nothing about it felt original. The characters fall into tropes and so does the plot structures and foreshadowing. It just is so predictable that i feel like an AI wrote it and plugged in just as much stuff that we've already seen done before. I may be spoiled as I've played so many great story games and read so many books that my standard might be a little skewed but even without all that I think if anyone stepped back and looked at this objectively it really is just not good. The gameplay pacing is also sorta bad. I just didn't like the combat system. It sorta played itself in a way with very clear choreographed moves and timing made super obvious. Some of the moves were also ridiculous and didn't make sense leading to be taken out of the immersion. For example why is an ultimate move a guy stabbing the ground and a mountain size sword comes out of the ground at the enemy? It just feels so poorly thought out because it doesn't make sense, why is he doing that? Why's the sword grow? Why after all that is the damage barely double-triple that of an average attack? It's giving characters powers for the sake of it with no explanation. Worse part of the combat that made it all feel sorta automated was the heavy reliance on overdrive. Moves pretty much picked themselves depending on how it impacted the meter. There are some things you can do to play around with it but it felt like the game was telling me how to play exactly how it wanted me to instead of letting me experiment and try and figure things out on my own. The upgrade system is also very typical. It boils down to just numbers. It was more of a chore to sort through loot that was just chasing a higher number as the equipment barely made much of a difference other then making sure the numbers are higher at the first opportunity you get to increase it. I hate when games do this. I like when games make upgrading change a whole play style or make nigh and day differences so i feel more in control. This definitely does not do that, you're very much stuck with certain roles and have a lot of limitations, turns upgrading into a boring chore. Exploration wasn't very good either, again felt like a chore as it rarely wad rewarding enough to go off the beaten path. I just did not enjoy the tedium of it all as it always felt like the game was on rails with what exactly it wanted you to do and go to. It gave the illusion of being open when in fact it's very much on rails. Only thing that got me going was the art was really pretty as well as the good music. The gameplay and writing though just isn't good. I can see some opportunity in there for something potentially good but the author relied too heavily on exposition dumps and didn't really finesse the dialog or plot structure to something more original.. Could be a fantastic rpg, but completely ruined by the Overdrive mechanic. All it is is fake difficulty as it pigeonholes you to play exactly the way the game wants you to. Battles end up being is a tug of war with this mechanic. Then the game arbitrarily decides to put you in Overheat for no apparent reason; where you take more damage and skills cost more to use. Getting out of Overheat completely derails the flow of the battles, and it makes no sense. There are either turns, or situations hardcoded, or it’s designed to be a pain. For example: a skill is highlighted yellow-orange (arbitrarily mind you) that will significantly lower the overdrive bar, often times forcing the player to use a skill that’s not beneficial. Sienna’s Pilfer when there’s nothing to steal, or you need to heal but some random skill lowers the Overdrive gauge, which allows you to temporarily play the game until it randomly throws you back into overheat. Give me an option to disable this stupid mechanic and I’d likely change my review score.. + The game as a whole is a spirited love letter to the JRPGs of yesteryear + Battle system is innovative while still retaining traditional turn-based mechanics + Art style and design of the world and enemies are delightful + OST is of a magical god-tier standard that puts AAA titles to shame + Story and character arcs are enthralling from beginning to end - Sky armour battles were underwhelming and frustratingly imbalanced. One of the most ambitious indie games I've played in a long while. The gameplay is balanced and fun. It's never too punishing with a learning curve that is understandable. You need to try and experiment to win battles rather than just grind and level up to beat a boss or a challenge. The story is rather fantastic. I think it might be a little rough around the edges but this isn't a huge production so bonus points for having so many fleshed out characters. Once the world opens up I spent hours upon hours just exploring the world. So many things to discover. So many fun additions that make this title special. I couldn't recommend this enough to RPG fans. This is obviously a love letter to the genre.. The game is a solid 7.5. At the beginning, and for the first few hours of the game, it was a 10/10. However, during the last 25% of the game, it became a mess with more of the same. The narrator couldn't handle it well, and the plot twists and character conclusions were lacking. The pros of the game include the battle system, overall quality of art and sound, unique monsters, characters, and the experience of using the sky armors to discover the map is a 10/10. The cons of the game include the fact that the story started off well but became confusing towards the end. Additionally, the combat became much easier towards the end, and some characters were introduced too late to be used effectively. Overall, I really enjoyed the game, and it was a fun experience. For the price, it's a must-have if you enjoy JRPGs, despite some flaws towards the end.. This is the perfect game. Great story great battle system a lot of interesting puzzles I wish it was longer and hoping for a sequel.. Its a nice throw back to the 90's JRPG's with a very interesting twist on turn based combat using the overdrive system where you do more damage or take more damage and spend less TP depending on where you are on the overdrive bar. You can freely swap out teammates without losing a turn using the link system and to lower your overdrive bar if it gets close to overheat and the combat in general is just a lot of fun. The combat and overworld in general are very well done and enjoyable. With all that said, while I didn't hate the general premise of the story. The way its played out leaves a lot to be desired. Its not bad per say, but its a bit of a mess.. The game definitely deserves a 10/10 recommendation to every RPG enjoyer! Very well written great story and intriguing worldbuilding. I personally think it is impressive that none of the characters story feels bland or cliche. You can tell that the game has really been putting effort into each character’s growth Combat system is a lot of fun and easy to follow. Quality of life is good when there’s no random encounters, no need for hard grinding. every aspect of the game just feels smooth. Had so much fun playing it!. Every aspect of this game shows that a lot of love was put into it. Absolutely recommendable.. A phenomenal love letter to SNES JRPGs. Everything great about them, with modern convenience at every level; such as very little rng, full heals for your team after every battle, free Flees and battle Retries. Perfect balance between story, battle, and strategy, and so much content that never drags. Beating the main game is easily 60 hours, and side quests + secret final boss add another 10 hrs for sure; Amazing value. A fresh battle system that is easily understood and a fun way to encourage flexibility in your attacks (instead of spam). You only 'level up' from bosses (although you could grind to slightly improve your moves but its never required); Its about learning, and retrying with a different team setup and strategy. Personally I don't like excessive dialogue (which this game does not have), but even I wished I payed more attention by the end. Nothing to really complain about. Best JRPG of 2022. If you like JRPGs from the SNES / PS1 era, this game is for you. I can tell this game was made with love and care. A mix between FF6, Chrono Trigger, Xenogears with some modern updates and mechanics. I haven't felt this excited to play a game since BotW and a JRPG since FFX (20 years ago...). Can't recommend this game enough.. A huge surprise, probably one of my top game 2022. I highly recommend this game for JRPG lovers. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great JRPG. Amazing story, made me remember the good old days. If you liked Chrono Trigger, you are going to love this.. ""Chained Echoes"" does everything perfectly for fans of the genre and newcomers. You get an exciting story with many interesting characters and great dialogues. The gameplay is also enjoyable, as are the other options in the gameplay. The graphics have their charm and the sound always does everything right. If you would like to have another good role-playing game with a certain look, you should take a closer look at ""Chained Echoes"".. Perfect RPG games i'm looking so for. The combat not boring as other RPG game.. Best surprise of 2022. Love it! Miss another languages, but every detail of this game is a love letter to the classic JRPGs that we loved in our childhood ️. This game is so well crafted. Your decisions when leveling and outfitting your characters actually matter. Everything about the game design is so well considered and tightly integrated. You'll actually want to explore each zone to make sure you maximize small gains to your loot. The story is really good and perfectly paced. What in God's name do people even see in a game like Xenoblade 1/2/3 when an actual masterpiece like this comes from a single developer? The battles are just challenging enough to make you rethink your loadout and actually engage with the systems. I love all the little details that make the simple zones feel alive. I'm so impressed.. The perfect JRPG If you like RPG games from the 16 bit era then i promise you that this is a dream come true. Chained echoes is a an homage to especially Chrono trigger and FF6. It takes the best of these games and even manages to build upon their greatness. The story and writing are absolutely excellent. The music is fantastic, some of the best that you've heard in a RPG in quite a while. The battle system is a mix of familiar and new mechanics. I absolutely loved how you need to be managing the overdrive meter and switching out characters on the fly made things more dynamic. The sky armors are a total blast in battle and to control because of the verticality and versatility they bring. Movement overall is a joy with your party members literally flying over the map. Everything controls so fluidly and you're constantly rewarded for exploring the map through the awesome reward board. The game starts off linear and story focused but seriously opens up halfway, bringing you tons of opportunity to explore, do side quests or recruit new character. The game can be a little challenging sometimes but it's fair and each fight can be fought all in because your HP and TP are restored after each fight. You can always see your enemies on the map and you can always flee from every battle. If things get too heated, you can also lower the enemy stats and aggression. Honestly, square enix should be embarrassed. Bandai Namco should be embarrassed. Falcom should be embarrassed. They have all been beaten by this indie game created by only one man. Mattias Linda is a simply genius. He has made a masterpiece that outclasses anything that has come out in the last decade.. Gorgeous pixel graphics, fun and thought-provoking turn-based battles, and amazing sound/music!. Good combat, sprite and story. Giant robots, good characters and 10 hours in an engaging story, I am stoked on this game. Might be a bit old school for the kids, but classic jrpg fans will definitely enjoys","chained echoes is a bold, sophisticated, and tasteful ride of a story with what I believe to be a hell of an ending . the game and world design are also so exceedingly well done, you almost feel like you're stealing from the game with how much it gives you . the combat system is the game is really fun at times, but at other times is kind of frustrating ."
336.Super Meat Boy,"Did you know you can't delete a review on metacritic? awesome isn't it? hahaha. I wrote a review on this game for PC. ever since i played this in 2015 it's been my favorite game of all time to the fun levels to the characters from other games it's so perfect. Difficulty done right. You are given such fine control over meatboy that it's always clear what you couldhave done better or differently. And the super fast restart means there is no time to mourn your last run... You just need to go again.. I found the game to be incredibly tedious and irritating. The constant repetition of trying to save Bandage Girl, only to have her taken away each time, quickly became frustrating. The difficulty level also seemed unnecessarily high, leading to many moments of frustration and anger. Despite these negative aspects, I will say that the game does have a certain addictive quality to it. The fast-paced gameplay and colorful graphics kept me coming back for more, even when I felt like throwing my controller across the room. Overall, my review of ""Super Meat Boy"" is mixed. While it does have its entertaining moments, the overall experience left me feeling more annoyed than satisfied. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy a challenge, but be prepared for some *frustrating moments along the way.. Super meat boy is a great game with lots of variety and interesting levels. Although I do find a few levels frustrating and too hard, most of them are still fun to play. I love how this game goes for a bit of a retro aspect with its warp zones and amazing retro music. Another selling point for me is the inclusion of characters from other games and their unique abilities.Each one of their abilities makes some levels a walk in the park while some characters make levels near impossible.There is also a huge variety of obstacles, spikes, lasers, breakable blocks and conveyor belts are all challenges you must overcome and obstacles you must master. I think this game manages to balance difficulty with fun pretty well, and if you’re skilled enough can prove to be a good time. Overall super meat boy is a good game that is for sure worth the money.. i have never in my life played a platformer where i and the characters intentions felt so misaligned, the momentum in this game feels so random and arbitrary. go play celeste. SUUPER MEAT BOYY! This game is definitely one of the best-of on the xbox store. Its story is beautiful, the gameplay is hard the way the game wants to be, and this makes it one of the best 2d parkour platformer that is available. The OST is very powerful and perfect for the contest. Edmund McMillen did a spectacular job, and his passion can be seen anywhere into the game. 10/10. This game was average as hell. It’s not because it was hard. It’s just because it was so tedious.. I understand entirely why people like this game, but it just doesn't resonate with me in comparison. The challenges are hard, but not to an absurd degree, and it feels like such an accomplishment to beat any given level and see how many deaths it took you. The controls are very tight, even while using keyboard controls, and while deaths are plenty, it never feels like a penalty with how fast you respawn. Even the death's have a sort of meaning, in the fact it helps warn you about certain threats or helps with spacing. All in all Super Meat Boy is a wonderful challenge and fantastic platform, but just not one that appeals to me. The cutscenes are often super fun and cute tho!. Xbox 360 version had the best music, guess devs lost the rights when ported to PS4? As far as performance, it’s near the top of best platformers. The difficulty will turn off a lot of gamers but I think it’s more about repetition than skill. I have beat most of the worlds without dying but those last few worlds? Impossible for me. You’re a Gaming God if you have this Platinum.. a tough 2d platformer that is rewarding in its own way, definitely worth playing. rubbish graphics mise well throw your console away get an amiga 1984 if u like budget graphics like this i got it free on xbox gold owell id never buy rubbish looking game with 1984 graphics ever we in 2022 not 1984. Super Meat Boy Is So Hard That It Looks Like That Dark Souls Tooken A Big Ass **** That It Was So **** Big That It Became Diarrhea And After That Threw Up Ate The Vomit And Then Dumped There Ass Into The **** Water And Then Made It Into Discs Super Meat Boy Is Made Super Duper 99% BULL****!!!. Amazing platformer! Controls and the filling of character are so precise and well designed! Really worth playing.. Super Meat Boy is a hardcore platformer, in which your objective is to save your girlfriend ""Bandage Girl"", from the evil ""Dr. Fetus"" (whom is... a fetus, inside a mech-like suit). The game starts off easy at first, but wow, does it get difficult in the later levels. I'd say this game is comparable to the likes of N++, albeit way more fast paced and precision based. Almost on an annoying scale (at least to me). Some levels just feel unfair with the difficulty spikes, while some are at just the right difficulty for how far you progressed. It feels unbalanced overall to me (but that's my opinion). Overall its a great game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes platformers!. If you are still looking through reviews deciding whether or not to get this game, you are wasting your time. Buy this game already.. The most f****** difficult game I ever played. It was a good challenge, 10/10.. Super Meat Boy is a uniquely challenging and well rounded platformer. Rating - 78%. Super Meat Boy Super Frustrating Super Meatboy is an insta death platformer wit hpuzzle elements where you play as meat boy trying to get through this games 7 different chapters and save bandage girl from the evil dr fetus This game can be beaten in about 6 hours despite each level beign designed to be beaten in less than 20 seconds.. The hook of this game is its frustratingly addictive difficulty The mechanics of Super Meat Boy is simple, which makes it so easy to pick up and in turn so easy to forgive as youre dying over and over.. You jump, run jump, or wall jump… Nothing else… Its up to you to use these mechanics to maneuver through the games many obstacle courses of blades, lava, and salt.. and you only have one life to do this… The difficulty of levels is really up and down.. And this is thanks to the game constantly adding new obstacles and enemies to deal with as the game goes on… When a new mechanic is introduced it will slow down a bit.. This in turn creates a great pacing.. the levels aren’t constantly smacking you over the head with difficulty.. Youll at times get a nice breather… But when levels are hard theyre hard… and despite them making you want to pull your hair out, its just as hard to put down the controller and walk away.. at least for a little while… For me the Charm of super meat boy started to wear off by chapter 3.. I was over the hook of dying and retrying, but that’s mostly because of the kind of gamer I am… Im not into punishment for more than a little while.. But if you are one of those sick freaks that likes getting to the point of wanting to break your controller, Super Meat Boy is a great platformer full of collectables to unlock new characters, hidden levels, charm, great characters, and surprisingly engaging boss battles that only feel cheap the first 100 times you die… I give Super Meat Boy an 8/10. Until playing Super Meat Boy I thought Super Mario World had the best 2d platformer physics. Super Meat Boy has now taken that crown. The game is all about its movement mechanics and continually impresses you in how it finds new ways to use them.. This game wasn't too bad in the early levels. The controls aren't super tight, but it didn't really matter much as most of the game is just sprinting forward and jumping at the right time. However, later in the game, very specifically, the warp Zone to unlock the kid, you have to use pixel perfect and frame perfect jumps multiple times through the same level. It's stupid, and for me, it's a deal breaker. I looked up the stats on this game and saw that over 95% of buyers never beat the light world. I began to realize that this is another one of those extremely **** games that just wants to be hard and not good. **** SMB. Is it Hard? Yeah, it's hard. Is it good? **** no, it's not good because it lacks consistency. The jumping, fans and repulsers are all incredibly inconsistent in this game. Next time, Try making a game that's GOOD and also hard, not one that you don't expect anyone to beat. Phil Fish is lucky as **** that you can't return a digital download. This game is not worth the money. Thank god I got it for Free on PSN, just like all the other **** Games that don't Sell.. Game play is tight and precise, story is cute and enjoyable to watch. The problem with the game is that it's boring. The little cut scenes are the only interesting thing about the game, the rest of it is bland. Game is very repetitive, which is the main culprit of the game being boring.. I give this game a 10 but take this review with a grain of salt. I have ALOT of time in this game, I think its the best single player experience I've had in gaming but I can't recommend it for everybody. The game is for a specific kind of gamer. Let me just say before you start, you WILL die and you will die over and over again. So why is it so good? The controls are ridiculously tight, aside from lag issues you will never die without knowing it was you who screwed up :D There are no unfair jump scare style obstacles, no control issues, no R.N.G. based jumps or unfair enemies, everything is about you and your ability to play. The game comprises over 300 levels mostly short, about 10-30 second for the average player though most can be done in under 10 depending on character choice and skill. There are 15 playable characters and most have their own appeal though some are just kinda gimmicky or useless. The introduction to the game is gradual, most gamers will put away forest (chapter 1) and wonder what the hype is about for this game but you will find a challenge in the game and even more should you choose to speedrun, which aside from the tiny RNG element brought in by Larry and GG, (you'll know what I mean if you speedrun,) is a great game for speedruning. I have praised the level design already but there are a few levels in the 300+ which I wont reveal the names of but that are just annoying, nothing more too it. Many allow for inventive routing and some still have character debates (who's fastest, who's safest etc.) 5 years after release which should show how well constructed the game is. The speedrun's are still evolving be it IL, or 106. So in summary, if you want a hard platformer, are patient and dont mind repition, this is completely worth a **** you hate repetition, forget it. and if you want a speedrun game go for it.. This is my favorite game in all of Xbox 360 arcade library. The gameplay is hard as nails, but the controls never make it unfair. Simply because the controls are so crisp. You're always in control, you make a small mistake, you're gonna feel it. Gamers that look for a challenge, this is it. It's the one game I'm truly proud of having 100% completed. It's gonna take time and tears, but stick with it and you're gonna have a blast.. this game ****. This game doesn't deserve any attention from you. First, the game is terribly ugly with the blood of meat boy makes graphics very bad taste, In addition, if you like to do 100 000 times the same level this game is for you, because to succeed in this game you must know almost all levels by heart. The handling is also horrible and give you cramps in hands. Another overrated indie game. I give two points for the music which is very good and 8-bit style levels.. Literally took me just over a year to beat. Not because it has that much content, but because it's so challenging that I kept having to take extended breaks from it in fear of returning to the glory days of gaming where I snapped controllers in half or threw them at my TV because the game did not give a **** about my skill level, I either achieved what it was demanding of me or I did not see the next level. When I finally got 200/200 achievement points, I took a screenshot and put it in a super-important section of my email, as a permanent trophy of the frustration I endured in order to get a useless trophy. It's a video-game pride thing. I do kind of wish we had more of these games, because it reminds me a lot of the early days of gaming, but I also realize why we don't have a lot of them. It's just too punishing to be a sustainable business model, but damn, did I ever love this game while it was making fun of me for being unable to eat bricks. Only real issue was playing with that crummy 360 dpad. If this were playable with a SNES or PS controller, it'd be a sublimely infuriating 10/10.. The game is plainly incredible. The humor and annoyingly hard gameplay is enough to keep you hooked for hours. While some people dislike the game for being too difficult and having hard, short levels, this works for and not against Meat Boy. This game is mean to you, but this makes you want to fight back. After completing the game, getting A+'s and finding all the bandages, the dark world, cotton alley, and then doing speedruns, I still wanted to play more. That's a great testament to why this game is incredible.. Heard about this game from watching a drunken let's play done by Clementj642 on Youtube. The game looked pretty fun and such and I decided to check out the demo. I enjoyed the demo enough to buy myself the game. After having a fun time through the first 2 worlds I got stuck on the 3rd one, lol. I quit the game for a few months until one of my best friends sent me a copy of the game on pc (always a sweetheart). I played the game on the pc and I found the same enjoyment as before and much much more. The more I played the game the more I loved it. The gameplay is very nice and all the characters move very fluently. Most of all in the game I believe I love the sense of accomplishment whenever I finish a very tough level for the first time. The game is very difficult but with enough practice anyone can beat any of the levels in it. The game brings a wonderful enjoyment to the player when it comes to completing a level and the soundtrack adds more enjoyment in my book. It's a game I can recommend to anyone looking for a challenge or a fun platformer.. Just An Amazing platformer that really pushes you to use your mind and think about how to stop the pointy objects hitting you in the face and spewing all your meaty goodness around the room, 10/10 would bang. Oh My GOD! This game is probably the hardest and most addicting game ever. I said next death over and over for 3 hours until I was able to pull myself away! This Game is both clever and difficult. When I say difficult, I mean reserved for true gamers only. If you think you can rise up to the challenge and not get addicted, (Well you are wrong) buy this game now.. Great mini game it has a lot of levels and you can find your self spending endless amount of time playing this game it is great and its only 1600 Microsoft points I would recommend this game to anyone its a different type of game that you may find yourself enjoying. If you like enduring lots of suffering and pain then this is your game. The controls are simple, but with out practice you'll never really feel in control. The game has short levels that only take like 10 to 20 seconds if you don't die in the first 3. The levels are insane and I never beat the game, but I know it only get's harder and That isn't the kind of game I want to play.. Not that anyone follows my reviews, but if you did you may know that I am on a campaign against games that purposely, and endlessly, frustrate the player. And, people, this is the epicenter (this and The Witcher 2, and the fact that this is worse than that terrible game speaks volumes). The developers had a cool and original idea, and that took up the first 15% of the meeting. Than they said ""lets make the player sooo mad that they have to like this game"". You know what? There's karma for this typer of thing. Bye-Bye.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I can only see a 5-year-old getting some fun out of this game. You can't really control your character fluently. The cheap level design doesn't help it at all. The reason why I give it an extra point is that all of the levels were unique, by design and placement I mean. Buzz saws are everywhere in this game, and it was disappointing to see that feature in most of the levels. You can also get extra characters, which consist of one extra move each. The extra move isn't very effective, seeing that you can finish a level by running and jumping. The boss battles are equally cheap. My brothers get so much fun out of it. I decided to game in a separate room, where I discovered that, if you go to your friends list while they are playing Super Meat Boy, there was the title of the game and below it: How many times they died on the level they were playing. This made me wonder if the true fun of this game was to die. I'd like to play a game that was solely meant to be FINISHED, not played a thousand times on the same stage.. Looking for an old school challenge with decent humor and tons of unlockables? SMB is tough, and requires strategy, skill, and patience, but pays off when you see all of your attempts assault the level at once upon completion. I can promise you, there is no luck or chance in this game. It is skill based, and the controls are tight, responding directly to input. Aside from numerous easter eggs, and the level ending reward, there is nothing else new to platformers. The difficulty will frustrate everyone, especially towards the end, but Super Meat Boy is a pleasant and surprisingly difficult challenge you can relish in.. There's only 1 word that perfectly describes this game. SICK. The level design is sick, the difficulty is sick, the art is sick. It's absolutely awesome! There is so much to unlock and find in this game, it's truly unbelievable. Hundreds of levels and hours and hours of fun. Yes, there are times where you're tearing your hair out because it's so difficult.. BUT THAT'S THE FUN OF IT! If you're not good at platformers or prefer hand holding, this game is NOT for you. It requires practice and patience, skills which a lot of people these days don't have. The rest of you, enjoy! 10 out of 10!. I decided to give the game 1 in score since it had ""okay"" controls and a few funny moments. Those two factors however, are microscopic compared to the awful level design, cheap difficulty and short playtime. It seams like we have come to a time were being unfairly difficult, suddenly means good. If the game has so terrible physics and controls that it becomes a puzzle just using a fan to jump to a platform, the game is apparently good. You do have unlimited lives however, sso that you can play the same thing 50+ times until you finally get it. FUN. Also, the controls are slightly off. Meatboy doesn't jump when you jump, which can get pretty annoying when your walljumping from small platforms and need to be quick. The story is pretty much Mario, but with a fetus. Charming. Also, the final boss to this game, has to be the absolute stupidest, most unfair thing I've ever fought in a videogame. This game is just pure trial and error, but emphasised on the error part. Also, if you're going to pick on my grammar, I'm Norwegian. Compared to the rest of Norway, I talk and write perfect English.. This game made me want to cry at one point... I can say nothing but tight controls, great music, and great replay ability. Although this is lacking in a review sense, there is really nothing to say about the game other than it is fantastic, but it can be too hard at some points. I would give the game a 9.5, but since i can only give whole numbers, I'll give team meat the benefit on this one, great job guys.. If you seek a feeling of accomplishment in your life, finishing this game will certainly do that for you. Super Meat Boy is an excellent platformer that really punishes you for making a mistake but rewards perfection. Most levels in Super Meat Boy are less than 30 seconds long, but some of them will take you hours and will have you crying out in anger. Once you've done a level you get to sit back and watch the replay of all your miserable attempts at once. The main game it's self is fairly big as it is, and the last boss is a real killer, but once you manage to finish it you'll still have the dark world levels (which is just as big, but a little harder), plenty of bandages to get and also a few warp zones which send you into early adaptations of Super Meat Boy like 8 bit, which are great little throw backs for any retro game lovers. Easily the best title on XBLA.. it is a really hard but addictive and simple platforming game. very old school in graphics and presentation. charming enough and with plenty of meat in the campaign =p . Ive got a good amount of playtime out of it and i'm still not done with it yet. it is a very punishing game and you will likely be repeating levels hundreds of times to either get good enough to beat them, or because theres a really tricky bandage you need in them. i can recommend it to anybody who has the patience for these hard as nails games, like trails HD and geometry wars etc. For what it is and what it attempts to be, this game is perfect. Never will you complain about it being too short or too easy, which are common issues with recent games. If you are looking for a highly challenging plat-former, here it is. I personally haven't completed this game and doubt I ever will, but I'm not going to be childish and lower my score because of that. Games should be difficult, otherwise there would be no learning curve.. Truly a fantastic 2D platformer and a great game. Whoever says that the controls in this game are bad have no idea what they are talking about. These are some of the best controls I have ever seen. The fact that you can maneuver Meat Boy with such ease shows that, when you die, it's not the game's fault, it's the players. The music in this game is also stupendous. It sets the hardcore mood really nicely and the stunning visuals help as well. The only drawback in this game is that it gets a little repetitive and that it is mostly due to it's insane difficulty. I'm all for hard games, but the end stages of this game in Dark World are almost impossible and sometimes you just feel like giving up.. Super Meat Boy is a brilliant collective of nostalgia and a this-gen, independent, superclass. Whilst the simile idea of frustration may throw people off, it is still a game that I recommend everyone plays, even if that is simply playing the previous version on Newgrounds, it is still worth it. Obviously though there are huge differences between the two versions, for one, the Xbox version is ten times better. evidently realism lacks because it is simply a cube of meat fighting a fetus for pink **** so donâ. If you ever played Mario, Sonic, Mega man or any of the sega/nintendo machine classic platformers, you will love this game. It's a throw back to those retro classics, with multiple nods to the past games that obviously inspired it. The cut scenes are charmingly funny with a little bit of an edge. Possibly the best platform game this gen. Difficulty level really raises in later levels and presents a difficult challenge for hardcore gamers. A Great Game on XBLA, Highly recommended to any platformer fan.. I'll keep it short and sweet. This game is a solid 10. I originally played the demo and thought no thanks on the purchase. I waited about a year and was feening for some old school 2D games... SMB I tried. This game has the best controls... some reviews say otherwise. I find that funny... because if you happen to beat this game and get good enough to pass some of the challenging levels you'll notice first and foremost how incredibly detailed the play mechanics are... as the moves needed are precise. I don't claim to be an elite gamer... I did beat the game... and when I got to play as BandAid Girl I never completed her world because it was too hard. I also was unable to beat the dark world for the final level. The only character that I gave up on trying to get was The Kid... I think ""The Kid"" levels, only playing the first level are beyond impossible.... and if you've gotten past this, you are a savant. I thought I was getting old because I lost interest in games... after discovery Team Meat and McMillen I have the same feeling I got when I played old school consoles. The unlockables are fanastic, and the old school throwbacks (i.e. Gameboy levels) are top notch. This game opened me up to a bunch of Indie Games I never heard of and I thank you SMB for doing so.. Incredibility hard to master and absolutely fun to play. I recommend this game to everyone to at least trial if not buy! 9/10 is a high score but it's one of the rare games that i couldn't put down and i kept coming back to months after i had finished it. After a 2D old school fun game then give it a go!. Cheap price, genius level design, and loads upon loads of content. This is the most fun I have had with any current gen game, including every triple a title to date. It is fairly challenging yet you never feel like you are being cheated when you fail since the controls are so incredibly precise. This is the ultimate platform gamers game and would have without a doubt been considered a classic were it released in the 16 bit era. There will not be another so don't wait around for the sequel. This game is a masterpiece and Team Meat has decided that there is nothing they could think of changing. They also said that if any new meat boy game content is released, it will come in the form of DLC and be absolutely free!. Frustrated , but super fun, the persistence is the first word that come in mind. Super Meat Boy is the new Mario , but macabre and stylish , every level makes a challenging work to rescue your girlfriend. And the sloppy , and uncontrollable controls will make you die dozens of time, but be patience and tolerable.. Super Meat Boy is a rare gem. Its a huge blissfully creative, perfectly made, incredibly tight game. Not only that, but its cheep and constantly has updates coming out making it even greater. Its a game that could have only come in this time and place in gaming history, seeing at it was made by only two people and was made to only be sold online. At first the controls seem overly simple, other than the control stick, theres only a run and jump button. However, you find all sorts of moves that are possible with experimentation and this is what makes the game great. It evolves along with you. This along with the crazy difficulty and super quick level designs creates a unique and interesting platformer experience the likes of which us gamers having seen in years.. Super Meat Boy is an infuriatingly addictive platformer that has buckets of charm. Team Meat did a great job in making the game difficult but also encouraging players to keep going to finish just one more level or two. Controls are simplistic but perfect. The sheer volume of levels and characters give this game plenty of replay value.. Super Meat Boy is a great continuation of the two game flash series that I thoroughly enjoyed. Brutal levels are quickly made less frustrating due to fast load times, and soon opens itself into a fun and zany game. Featuring leader-boards, collectible items, ingenious level design, awesome music, and a wide array of characters, Meat Boy is an amazing game that can only be hated for it' blistering difficulty.. This game intrigued me due to its difficulty. I thought I should test this games difficulty since many fail at balancing it. But after several hundred deaths, I still felt like I could make that seemingly impossible jump. This game ramps up difficulty at an alarming pace and doesn't stop there, as it gives you a additional chapter, and a chapter full of user-created hard levels that are constantly updated, and the upcoming Super Meat World chapter, they just don't stop giving us levels. Despite the abnormally high amount of tough-as-bones levels (over 300!!!), it still gives us that pushing feeling that we have enough lives (unlimited) to perfect that impossible jump, run, wall jump, or missile dodge that keeps resetting us back to the start with no pause or loading. This game is for those who are looking for a challenge in their game, and not for gamers who like to enjoy a game peacefully, because you will attempt to break the remote at trying to make that !@#$ jump! That stupid jump! ARGGGGG!!!!!!! Anyways, you should check out the game if you look for a challenge.. A wholly charming, clever, and humorous labor of love that has more than its fair share of nods to retro gaming such as the Game Boy and Atari inspired warp zone levels and parodies of classic gaming intros like Castlevania (even the title's abbreviations, SMB, match those of Super Mario Bros.'). The level design, music, art aesthetics and amount of levels (300+) are true crowd pleasers as is the near perfect controls and number of bonus items, such as hidden bandages, characters, warp zones and Dark World stages that you unlock from besting the ""par time"" on each level. Simply put, this game has enough to keep you busy for awhile. Furthermore, for a game that's so silly in style the last few levels feel completely epic and upon completion leave you with a sense of accomplishment that few games on the market provide. Speaking of accomplishment, yes this game is incredibly difficult, but the stages are short enough and creatively designed that you'll nail even the more daunting encounters given some patience and practice, something that couldn't be said about the similarly styled N+ (side bar: I died around 4,000 times by the time I finished the dark world and still love this title). The only things that keep this from being a 10/10 are a few, minor nitpicky things. Notably, it would be nice to have a button that cancels your wall slide and another that stops your horizontal movement through the air as fidgeting the control pad left-to-right in order to land perfectly can be infuriatingly awkward. Additionally, while the level design is mostly spot-on a handful of levels are simply way too difficult and demand absolute perfection with literally zero margin for error, such as The Kid warp zone. Though, like I said those are only VERY minor complaints and overall this is easily one of the best titles on the Xbox 360, not just XBLA. If you love platforming games, retro-style entertainment and welcome a change-of-pace punishing difficulty then this is a definitive must-buy title.. [MILD SPOILERS] Okay... so you play as a raw, bleeding cube of meat that is trying to rescue a female cube of bandages that was kidnapped by a fetus in a jar wearing a tuxedo... You can see how serious this game is. The levels are short, which is good because you will be consistantly spilling your juices all over the place and having to start over. The game manages to be retro 80s challenging whithout being rediculously impossible. And besides the standard challenges, there are cool bosses, hidden minigames (warp zones) unlockable characters (I love you Gish!) and an entire ""dark world"" which is the same game you just played only modified to be even more challenging. The game is also filled with hilarious cutscenes (don't you DARE skip them!) and contains other elements of humor. Also, let me say that this game is nothing like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"". In games like IWBTG, memorization is the key to winning. But in Super Meat Boy, the key to winning is straightforward skill. If you can't win, it's YOUR fault. (like the game N+) Simple as t","""super meat boy"" is a great game with lots of variety and interesting levels . the difficulty level also seemed unnecessarily high, leading to many moments of frustration and anger . overall, my review of ""super meat boy"" is mixed ."
337.Dead Space 2,"Even more anxiety-inducing than the original, if possible. Incredible levels and set-pieces, scary as hell monsters, paced to perfection. A remarkable experience.. Dead Space 2 takes survival horror and injects more action. It opens players up to its universe, and will leave you in awe during some of its set pieces. While it is not an improvement from the original, it expands ideas from the first to make a highly enjoyable experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Oh, this game, why did I play you so late? It's great, I played it without getting bored, I'm so angry at myself, this game is a masterpiece, and they compare it to Mass Effect, it's like a joke.. I, Jesus Christ, do not condone Unitology. To participate in the church of Unitology is blasphemy and heresy.. The perfect sequel to a really **** game. I love how they prioritise fast paced action over the lacklustre horror aspect of the original. Perfect game all around. Dead Space 2 is that rare kind of sequel that not only embodies what made the first game an impactful horror but refines for a faster, smoother experience. Every area has been tastefully expanded with already great gameplay being strengthened and old tactics freshened to keep the player on their toes. Even then, just as the player settles into a rhythm, sound design will creep up behind you to remind you that you're never, ever, safe. Dead Space perfected what a survival horror game should be, but Dead Space 2 inscribed the series in gaming history. It showed the world a winning formula that I've rarely seen since and its absence is sorely missed.. Such an amazing game that adds on from the first from weapon mechanics and the zero gravity sections. Replay this game so many times and plan to more in the future. Dead Space 2 is an overall solid sequel, though it somewhat misses the mark of what made its predecessor so special. Dead Space 2 still features the same strong gameplay loop as Dead Space, but it also has more of a focus on Uncharted-like cinematic set-pieces, which feel a bit out of place. Furthermore, EA made the unwise decision to attempt to flesh out silent protagonist Issac by giving him dialogue. The result is a protagonist who now feels even more bland and forgettable than when he was a literal blank slate.. This may very well be one of the best survival horror game to exist, maybe even more so than Resident Evil 4 (possibly both) and Silent Hill 2 (maybe). The original Dead Space was something special and its remake was top-notch (which I also gave a 10/10 to), but Dead Space 2 took it to a whole new level in every way. (We won’t talk about the massive disappointment that is Dead Space 3). Probably the best survival horror game to ever exist. Hopefully we get a remake. It improves apon the first Dead Space(2008) in almost every single way with Isaac talking allowing you to connect with him and the overall story. It also features much more big set pieces then the original did this includes better animations for deaths. The multiplayer PvP was fun also.. I really loved the game one of my favorites,a perfect game to get some good scares. Simply the Best of series. Deservs a remake.. Dead Space 2 is a sequel while it is not as good as the first one, the fact that Visceral Games has understand that they can make some fantastic games, even if the sequel isn’t as good as DS1. Great gameplay, Isaac now has a voice, an intriguing story, fun mechanics, and overall, it’s a nice game that improves upon the original in a lot of ways. I’m giving it a 9.5 out of 10.. Sequel to Resident Evil: The Next Generation with a larger play area, more elaborate missions, optional side missions and some cool new weapons and upgrades. On occasion combat can be a little frustratingly tricky, but otherwise a beautifully designed, atmospheric and creepy survival horror in space.. Final Thoughts: Dead Space 2 is that rare kind of sequel that not only embodies what made the first game an impactful horror but refines for a faster, smoother experience. Every area has been tastefully expanded, strengthening already great gameplay and providing new and returning players with an insanely intense horror experience. Dead Space perfected what a survival horror game should be, but Dead Space 2 inscribed it in gaming history. It showed the world a winning formula that I’ve rarely seen since and its absence is sorely missed (Dead Space: Remake provides some hope). For the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: ****. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I actually didn't play this game on release. The Dead Space remake was the first Dead Space game I've played, and I liked it so much that I went back and bought Dead Space 2.... And I have to say... Dead Space 2 is phenomenal! One of the best games I've ever played. I didn't expect to like it as much as the remake (just because it's an old game), but honestly I might like it even more than the remake. I finished the campaign multiple times and enjoyed it every single time. Isaac is so freaking likable in this game, and Ellie too! I really hope they remake this one too!. I’m mentally scarred for life. 10/10, would give myself more nightmares again.. A LOVELY SPACEWALK AMONG NECROMORPHS BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game has been completed multiple times and in all difficulty levels present, as well, the platinum trophy has been achieved. It has also been tested at both 30 fps and 60 fps. EXTRACTION: Unlike its predecessor, Dead Space 2 throws the player immediately into the middle of the action. In the first few minutes of the game, the story of the original is briefly hinted at with a nice cutscene following that brings up the beautiful necromorphs that clearly begin to slaughter anyone breathing inside the facility. Clearly, as is the first chapter, a chasing sequence will begin from which the player must escape unharmed, or nearly so, and then learn the game's first basic mechanics useful for mere survival. These are brilliantly placed in rapid sequence, making their learning and combined use, much more intuitive. FLYING THROUGH THE SPACE: The gameplay of the game, as an excellent sequel to an already established still excellent game should do, brings back all those mechanics already present in the original, adding, as one would expect, new weapons, enemies and puzzles. The fluidity of movement has been greatly improved, making both dodging enemies, and catching them, from enemies, faster and smoother (Small note to Xbox Game Pass and PC, which make with 60 fps gameplay borderline to modern gaming). One of the big differences is the improvement of the Zero-G system, now adjusted for smoother and less restricted free movement, and consequently the addition of combat sequences and puzzles appropriate to the new mechanics. The presence of new weapons of course is not to be ruled out, including the Javelin, a powerful spear-shooter capable of piercing enemies and then detonating them; the Seeker rifle, a high-caliber sniper rifle; the force gun, useful for throwing enemies against walls and keeping them well away and the Detonator, a simple grenade launcher. The game then has several difficulty levels as in its predecessor, including the infamous Hardcore Mode, which, however, will now be tied to a maximum of 3 possible saves for the player, making it a great challenge for any player. The reward for this feat will be the world-famous Pew Pew gun, also known as Devil's Horns or Hand Cannon, a baseball cheer mitt capable of one-shotting virtually any creature in the Dead Space world. The new enemies are many, and they go to highlight everything that might have been missing on Dead Space. THE SUN NEVER SHINES: Visually Dead Space 2 also comes across as more arrogant than the original. By not being tied to a single spaceship design, the designers had much more field in which to express their talents, creating huge space cities, moon bases, deep space flight sections, and even a few goodies for those who played the original. The graphics turn out great for the year of release, and because of that it has managed not to age. Let alone the wonderful designs of the new weapons, characters, and enemies, which always look impeccable. SUFFOCATING SILENCE: Everything that is already present in Dead Space 1 applies here. To make a long story short, the audio is always perfectly dedicated to what it's supposed to achieve, whether it's the suffocating silence of space, or the swarming noises of necromorphs in the ducts, or the heartbreaking screams of dying commoners, Dead Space 2 always gets it right, setting the atmosphere that every horror game should have. BUT WHY 9? PROS: Dead Space 2 is the sequel in every way to its predecessor. Valueting the original an 8, cannot help but getting the sequel a 9, improving on or maintaining virtually all of the merits and eliminating most of the flaws. The gameplay is still fun even after multiple runs, even just dismembering necromorph bodies is highly addictive. The story is a continuation of the first, and it is much more extensive, explaining facts unknown in the first and giving the basis for the third. Objectively Dead Space 2 is a great game in the Horror genre and an expansion of the already established first Dead Space. CONS: The path toward Action. This is what you feel when playing Dead Space 2, that middle ground between a true horror and a third-person action shooter. Obviously for those who have played the third chapter it will be clear why, it bridges the two genres. This is obviously a flaw that , however extreme, led to the downfall of the third chapter, and the subsequent closure of the development team, Visceral Games. Also, a second flaw, the game turns out, because of its size and setting, to be much more alive. This might be a pro for some, but in a horror game where the loneliness of the space is the focal point it goes to take away that side of eeriness that the first one had. RATING Gameplay: 10 Music:8 Story: 9 Horror: 8.5 _. Score: 9.5/10 As a sequel, Dead Space 2 expands on the gameplay that came before it. The Zero-G sections are a lot better and the gameplay feels as smooth as butter. The game is filled with iconic moments and set pieces. Although I like these, I felt that the game focused a little too much on action. It still retained its horror feel, but it had a less horror theme than the first game did. Other than that, it's still an amazing game.. Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke, Isaac Clarcke,. Dead Space 2 is a very good game that lacks one thing that its predecessor had. The thing that is missing is the feeling of atmosphere and horror that the first game did so well. In the very beginning of the game they actually do a very good job of making you feel vulnerable and have tension, this however is quickly ruined by rooms being too dark to actually look at the terrifying things around you and the lack of sound actually being used to scare the player or make them feel tense. The gameplay has been improved to make the controls less clunky which makes the combat and weapons feel very fun. The crafting system is pretty much the same and is just as fun and cool as the first game. The characters and story are great and flow really well from beginning to end. The choice to make Isaac talk in the second game didn't hurt the game much but did subtract from the horror atmosphere aspect. Overall, this game is great and feels like an awesome action sci-fi shooter that's fun to play but mostly lacks that horror atmosphere that the original did so perfectly.. While not as good as the first game it's still an amazing experience and a must play i love how this game expands the story and world of Dead Space. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 9 Gameplay : 8 Graphics : 9 Fun Factor : 10 Environment interaction : 6 Sound effects : 10 Overall Immersion : 8. Sci Fi horror classic, reignited horror gaming in a novel setting with a nice twist, good weapon crafting system and awesome armour suits, Resident Evil meets Alien, must play title.. One of the best sequels ever made. It ups the ante while keeping the tone of the original. The story and characters are so well-done. I was skeptical about Visceral giving Isaac a voice, but it feels so justified because of how likable his character is. The gameplay has way more options than the original and the zero gravity is such an improvement. This is one of the best horror games in recent memory.. 2/6/21-2/7/21 100% Story This game absolutely blew me away! I was sold pretty well on the first game, but the sequel really delivers and makes everything better. We still have Isaac Clarke who, after his adventures in the first game, finds himself being tested and observed in the Medical wing of a city called The Sprawl. Stuff hits the fan pretty quickly and pretty soon he's dealing with Necromorphs of all shapes and sizes. The Sprawl is an even better setting than the Ishimura. It makes it even creepier to me when it seems like the whole place was alive just a few days before. There are shop windows and churches all set up in such a way that you want to look everywhere for the upgrades and ammunition you might find. The zero gravity sections are also vastly improved from the original. No longer do you have to aim at a specific spot to jump to it. Now you have this cool animation where your suit gets Iron Man style jet boots and you can glide around. There are still some irritating enemies, for sure, but it doesn't take away too much of the fun from exploring and uncovering the story. This one is definitely worth trying for any horror game fan.. Visceral Games in 2011 set the bar high for all future survival horror games, because Dead Space 2 is an almost perfect sequel. Tension, stress and the accompanying ubiquitous fear begin in the first minute of the game, and with an intense finale they last until the very end of the game. Emotions, emotions and more emotions. This noun describes how you feel while playing Dead Space 2. At the same time, this dose of emotions is a truly destructive mixture. Anxiety, fear, hate, stress, a sense of hopelessness, constant struggle and harassment are just a few epithets among the whole lot. Chapter by chapter through the eyes of Isaac Clarke, we watch the Titan Space Station plunging into ever greater chaos. And it becomes a feast for the senses and a challenge for our adrenal glands. The audio-visual setting once again stands on a high level, exemplary for all horror movies. It is brutal, bloody, detailed and ghastly. The enemy models are terrifying. One of the most disgusting, hideous creatures in the history of video games. Almost everyone attacks our protagonist with a piercing roar. Playing on a high level of difficulty is not a challenge, it is well-balanced, but each encounter with a series of opponents requires a large percentage of your focus and reflexes to get out of the fight unscathed. The plot is a direct continuation of the first part and is divided into 15 different chapters that will not let the player get bored. Thanks to the audio files scattered here and there, we get to know the macabre history of the station members by delving into more and more turmoil. In Dead Space 2, we get more of everything. And the symbolic return to the decontaminated USG vessel Ishimura - to the place where it all began - is an additional plus for the game. It is difficult for me to say whether I can recommend this title, because it is not a production for everyone. What more sensitive people will not be able to get through the real cosmic horrendum. However, for people with strong nerves and a strong psyche, the game will be an iconic work. A nightmarish revelation. 9/10. Dead Space 1 is a fantastic game and while I think this follow up falls a little short of the original its still a great game. The gun play is still great and there are more weapons to try out. I really like some of the new enemy types the ones that peek around corners I feel are a highlight. And visually the game still looks appealing to this day. I think that the narrative is a little week the twist early on just feels like a rehash of the first game. Later on Isaac and Shelly grow a strong attachment which felt kind of forced. And the final boss of the game while being narratively fitting for the end boss it just isn't very fun to fight I felt. And finally a common complaint about dead space 2 is that its a lot less scary than the fist. And I do agree on that a little bit but I think that the real issue stems from the difficulty. Where normal mode is just to easy while hard is just a little to stingy with the supplies. Now that could be me but when I played in hard mode the game felt a lot more scary than it would of been other wise. But its hard to recommend that you first play on hard mode because the later parts of the game can get real difficult with what feels like no supplies at points. While the normal mode just gives you way to much ammo and health. I think over all the game is still great it defiantly deserves the must play status and if you've played it yet then you should fix that.. A worthy successor to the first game. Sure, Isaac handles like a truck and there's something just not quite right with his movement controls, but the horror is there in spades and the BEST weapon in video game history (my beloved plasma cutter). The monsters are more of the same from the first game and it would have been nice to see some innovations, but if you liked the first game and just wanted more, Dead Space 2 is right here for you. A quick word about difficulty. I played it on easy mode and regrettably, I think that was a big mistake. Much of the first game's horror is there in abundance but (on easy mode), the stakes were not that high because failure was pretty much only down to some of the short, confusing environmental cut scenes.. Just played this game for the first time and I loved it! Haven't played the first or third one but remember the hype it had back when it came out in 2011. **** can hold it's own 8 years later the way this one did, I couldn't imagine what it was like when it first released.. The best of game-horror, that I played in my life! I have finished the game three times. A fantastic survival horror game. It follows the rule of sequels perfectly by offering small but needed improvements while not altering the fundamental game play significantly.. How could you make an almost perfect game better, well ask Visceral because they did it, this game does not let you down, turn the lights off, put on some headphones, and lets kill some necros.. Simply put, this game was amazing. It was by no means a perfect game, but it surely came close. This review may be incredibly late, but only because this has been the game I have come back to for the past 8 years. The story in the first Dead Space was great, but it wasn't interesting, there was no meaning. The developers clearly focused on the scare factor and the survival aspect of the game. This time around, the developers knew they could not get us with the same scares, so they ramped up the story. They made far more interesting characters this time around as well. Isaac Clarke had a voice, and I actually cared what happened to him. I wanted Nolan Stross to overcome his dementia. I wanted Ellie to survive. I even started to empathize with Hans Tiedemann, the games secondary antagonist. Isaac's Dementia, though not very scary, showed us that he was broken man, deep inside his killer instincts of survival. The game was extremely linear, but we rarely saw the same exact areas twice, unlike the first game, which no one seems to criticize for revisiting 3 of the Ishimura's decks twice. Speaking of the U.S.G Ishimura, what a fantastic section of the game. Though I was not in any way terrified like the first game, I had an inexplicable feeling of tension through the chapter. Although it has swayed towards an action-shooter and away from survival horror, I believe it only makes the game stronger as reusing the same tactics from the first game would have made this game stale. Games need to evolve, to grow, to succeed the installment before it, to match the quality of the first and surpass it. What a great game.. An perfect sequel of an amazing game. Longer than the first game and way more scary. Whats not to love in shooting, monster-zombie-demon like babies in space ?? sound ridiculous I know, but it woks, it works so well. play this game!. I played it in 2018 (thanks XOne backwards compatibility) and it's still a masterpiece in mood, weapon design and pacing, even though the controls now feel a bit unresponsive. I can totally see why it was such a huge deal at the time. Maybe it's time for EA to revisit the franchise?. This game is like playing Resident evil 4 on space which is great great graphic, improved gameplay, great story, great atmosphere, heart-beating moments and many more. every one should play this once in there live time. Dead Space 2, while not as good as its previous entry, is still a great game worth playing today. While the horror is no longer there and more action oriented, the game's combat and mechanics improve and are tweaked that overshadows the original and delivers far more thrilling situations. Isaac melees much faster with swings and stomps and his stasis is nerfed from the first game with a rechargeable batter to prevent overuse that the first game had. Kinesis is hugely improved on with enemies being able to stick to walls and use sharp objects to impale them. It was a great idea and it still works really well compared to most games. The atmosphere is still great but perhaps not as well designed as the Ishimura (which they also bring in this and still nails it). Don't get me wrong, Titan Sprawl is still a great location with a civilian space metropolis, but the concise and mundane of the ship just sat better for me. The story is far different than the first, but it has a few issues that start to incorporate the lore and mystery of the game and take it directions that im unsure of. The Church of Unitology is flaunted far more in this than the first and seeing the lore become more of the plot is very odd to me. There is an idea that Isaac is trying to just escape like before, but also it deals with the death of his girlfriend and fighting the insanity that plaques him when he touches the Marker in the first game. The mind games and scenes with Nicole I really like and her boss confrontation is well done considering enemies are around to supply players with ammo that the Leviathan and Hive Mind couldn't. The new enemies, death scenes, weapons and environmental effects range from good to fantastic. While the enemy variety wasn't lacking in the first game, the mix around and new enemies in 2 spice up the formula without being to out of its comfort zone. It makes sense too because it's in a civilian area rather than a scientist one, so the pack being children and stalkers being dogs and animals makes sense and change up tactics. the death scenes, like the elevator ride up fighting tripods under a oxygen tank is outstanding, and the challenge to it is a rare moment of the game being intense and adrenaline based more than any other time in the series for me. The decompression windows are visually great, watching Necromorphs claw and hold onto something as they are flung into the vacuum of space while forcing Isaac to shoot the emergency core to bring down the safety lock is satisfying and able to compromise with the player. Isaac getting a voice was good I would say. His personality is likable and he doesn't talk too much that makes him overbearing. I'd say Gunner Wright's voice work was solid and Isaac was just fine for me to hear. The zero-g movement is vastly improved from the first game and Isaac controls his entire movement. It can be a bit disorienting though, so its a tradeoff that im more conflicted with but overall still works well. The DLC Severed and multiplayer is what brings this entire experience down. Had the time of those two things were spent on the single player (which itself is equally as good as the first for what it gains and loses). Severed is a terribly short campaign of a forgettable protagonist that ends before it even builds any tension or character development. I believe it's suppose to be link to a Wii game of Dead Space, but it was a rail shooter that wasn't well received. Considering Dead Space is a cult game series, so having even greater moments and money spent on the inner main game can really go a long way. The multiplayer was cool concept, but completely screwed and unbalanced on a multitude of problems. A Left 4 Dead style of 4v4 with human and necromorph players fighting in objective modes can be asinine when the host leaves and voids all experience for players that were winning. Weapons are incredibly imbalanced, and certain Necromorph abilities can be abused to no end. It's no wonder the sequel didn't do one. Despite that though, I often found it to be a guilty pleasure, because carving through teams on either side with friends was really fun and great, even if it was at the expense of someone's frustration. Dead Space 2 is still great for its campaign. Despite the changes to its formula and poor inclusions to try to be more of a target for the mainstream, the game excels above alot of sci-fi games, but not to the standards its previous set. Play it's story and have a blast, trust me it really is worth it.. This game severely lacks items to be found and money to purchase new items, im on chapter 4 and have found and achieved nearly nothing so far. struggling to find items and credits to buy different guns and health to stay alive room to room is hard enough on normal difficulty, dead space 1 was great in the sense you always had a full inventory and most the time you had to sell items. Dead space 2 requires 10,000 credits to purchase the rail gun but theres not even that amount of credits in the game so far up to chapter 4. Hopefully dead space 3 is better. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A reliable sequel that builds on the first success while adding new elements to make it an immersive and charitable entry in the series. The new creatures and characters are a welcome addition.. I fell in love with the 1st game and couldn't wait for #2. The demo blew me away and the game? Played it at least a dozen times and never got bored with it... The Dead Space series is as good as gaming gets... 2 was my fav but loved them all... More EA... Give us more... Well done!. Dead Space 2 is not as scary as Dead Space 1 is, IMHO. Though it has its own merits: Isaac can now speak (not only just scream, as in Dead Space 1), and his nightmares about Nicole are just wonderful! Also, the speed flights through the vacuum are nice, too. Needless to say, the zero-gravity and vacuum features are still there, which is cool. Bottom line: it's a very good game (with less horror and more action, than in Dead Space 1), and I suggest you to buy it, if you love the first game.. It was a really nice game the first time I played it, the scares were absolutely on the spot, I have a turtle beach head set so it was totally terrifying. The story was a bit cheesy, but it was well done also. The first story was the best out of the 3, the 2nd story was a bit...... well a let down to what it was before. The first game he was just trying to survive or get help. This one he didn't even want to live, at the end he just wanted to die. I thought the story was a bit of a let down, but still the story was better than I thought it would be. Another thing is online, my gosh that **** so bad that I thought it was a black hole. The game play totally stunk on online, I mean if I was an alien, I would just get my head shot off in the first 5 seconds that I spawned. The humans was also unfair, because there are boosters EVERYWHERE. I mean seriously they would spawn kill every time, I couldn't even get out of the spawn point. Would I recommend this? Yes, defiantly it is a good game to continue the dead space series. Yes, sometimes online is fun if people play FAIR.. With incredible scares and action sequences Dead Space 2 is recommendable for almost anyone. For those looking for more than just that Dead Space 2 has a great story, good plot and great zero gravity puzzles.. Here is my pro/con review of Dead Space 2: Pros: - Really nice graphics - Great controls (most of the time) - Great story - Isaac is a really good character, so are the side characters. - The dementia aspect is really cool and creepy - A few good scares... Cons: - ...But not enough scares to be a horror game, the game is creepy through and through, though - Necromorph pathfinding bugs. (Such as one where i entered a room filled with stalkers, and had them chase me to the other side of the room, they just gave up the chase for no apparent reason.) - Rare instances where the story didn't pull me in But those were just minor annoyances compared to everything else i absolutely loved about the game, I wholeheartedly recommend it. Especially if you can find it for cheap. If not I still recommend it.. The Dead Space series is nothing to write home about, its chunky controls, lacklustre graphics and boring campaign virtually leaves you with nothing bare creepy deformed enemies or the odd jump scare. So much potential wasted on what could of been an amazing survival horror game. Another disappointment, would not recommended.. They have done it again, this game much like dead space one is an excellent atmospheric, frightening, anxiety ridden romp. The game plays pretty much the same as the first, with some of your old favourite enemies featuring so if you were looking for innovation from the first you may be disappointed, I however was not having loved the first game I love this too, hard to the core though??? not gonna happen.. It's pretty hard to capture lightening in a bottle twice. I'd say they gave it their best shot, and it was an all around very enjoyable game. They had a winning recipe and didn't deviate. The story progression was good and some of the achievements were incredibly stressful difficult (play on hardcore and you only get to use 3 saves for the entire game) which I enjoy.. Dead Space 2 follows up from Isaac Clarke's last outing with a thrilling, terrifying, and gory survival-horror game. The overall story is fairly interesting but the game play is what really stands out as you have a dozen weapons at your disposal each with it's own grotesque way to slaughter those nasty necromorphs. Stasis and kinesis also add terrifically to game play strategy. Isaac inner struggle is gripping to watch over the course of the game as he experiences betrayals. hallucinations, and being stalked by a necromorph who seemingly can't die! The campaign is a good 14 hours depending on your difficulty and yes the game can be quite difficult, even on the easier difficulties. New game plus adds re-playability with your weapons and upgrades staying with you even after starting a new campaign. The only real flaw is the multiplayer which gets dull very quickly and isn't very fun. Overall, fantastic gameplay, campaign, weapons etc. but not very good multiplayer.. Compared to the first game, Dead Space 2 was somewhat disappointing. It plays more like an action game, relying more on jump scares than atmospheric creepy-ness. They just send horde after horde at you. I much preferr the slow-paced but thrilling game that Dead Space was. Overall though, Dead Space 2 is still an above-average action game.. the first dead space was great, good placed jumpscares, creative level design but overall something refreshing even though it had some problems i really liked it, dead space 2 ramps up the horror and improves the gameplay, i ","Dead Space 2 is an overall solid sequel, though it somewhat misses the mark of what made its predecessor so special . it's not an improvement from the original, but it expands ideas from the first to make a highly enjoyable experience . it's a perfect game that embodies what made the first game an impactful horror but refines for a faster, smoother experience ."
338.Pikmin 2,"Has everything the original has, and improved every single aspect and added so much more, an example of a well-made sequel that should, just not a 10 because the game is too harsh sometimes and can be too heartbreaking and stressful. good, but the caves drag it down to being just kinda worse than the other pikmin games. the best game in the seires - a roguelite with pikmin - only complaint is that you need to play badly for it to be fun - yet once it clicks it becomes way too easy. Bruv Pikmin 2 takes down the whole series. Hey Pikmin practically killed itself in this case.. Takes pikmin 2 to a whole new level. You can wobble them, you can own a small plant creature. Louie is mentally unstable.. I can’t decide if this or Pikmin 4 are better. Either way, legendary game! Must play.. One of my favourite game, challenging, relaxing, with many details, this was my childhood. The Good • The Pikmin AI has been vastly improved from Pikmin 1. • The quality of life added to throwing is really nice. Should be noted that it was added to Pikmin 1 as well in its ports. The Bad • Pikmin 2’s balance is bad. It gets way too difficult once you get past the 10000 Poko objective and a lot of the game's faults are related to that • The Doomsday Apparatus single-handedly makes Purple Pikmin a nightmare to deal with, as you need 100 Purple Pikmin to carry the Doomsday Apparatus. This means both wanting to reset upon a loss of a Purple Pikmin, and having to grind for them. • The game is mostly caves which is a problem because they aren’t really good. They’re randomly generated and are way too hard by the end. Overall Pikmin 2 is I can't imagine myself coming back to, at least not often. The poor balancing ends up spreading to the entire game and horribly messing things up.. It's very difficult which makes it very fun. You are always concerned with your Pikmin and whether they will live to the next day. Treasures are interesting and you feel so small and insignificant in a large world with tough enemies. Luckily at the same time, a power fantasy is achieved with 100 Pikmin of many various types. If you like depth and difficulty in your games, this will likely be your favorite Pikmin game.. this is peak pikmin right here. challenge, horror, evil. if you found the other games too easy, this is for you.. The controls of the pikmins are better than its predecessor. Personally I think it’ll be better to put more treasures above ground.. Best game in the series, there is a ton of replayability with randomised caves and treasures. Weakest game in the series. I just wasn’t a big fan of the caves. At first they were fun but quickly became tedious and a little boring at times. That said the game overall is still excellent. Takes everything great about the original and adds more pikmin types, new enemies, new characters, dungeon crawling, multiplayer, bigger and more challenging boss fights. Its everything a sequel should be.. Pikmin 2 provides a lot of challenge and exploration that gives players a fun experience when playing the game and it still makes you feel guilty when you lose a pikmin.. Just like Pikmin 2, this game follows up on the same mechanics while adding in a new mechanic, Dungeons, they are randomly generated, but that isn't a bad thing.. PIKMIN 2 had the making to be the ultimate sequel to PIKMIN but feels bloated and perhaps could have been better with less content and greater focus on polish. I would highly recommend Pikmin 2.. This is amazing game. (possible spoilers ahead) if your wondering it gets hard around the area called ""perplexing pool"" and it has amazing bosses I havent completed the game yet but I can tell its gonna be fun! (also good soundtrack). Always been enjoying this game every time I come back to it. Although I never finished the game, I wanna go and give it a shot and complete it! The games wonderful. This is my second favorite game of all time, and for a good reason. It's a mix of exploration in an open world, and puzzle solving in caves. Some people don't like the caves, but I honestly love them. All 3 pikmin games are amazing, but this is my favorite of them. With 2 new pikmin types which are both incredibly useful, it's my favorite in the series.. For me one of the best games that Ive played in my chlildhood. The dungeons are so cool and randomized, so it isnt the same everytime. Played it like 10 times and will do another walkthrough. My personal rating for ""Pikmin 2"" (GC): 7,4/10 - Good Gameplay: 8,5 Video: 7,5 Audio: 7 Scope: 4,5 Balance: 6,5 Story: 7. One of the better dungeon crawlers of this generation. Not what you were expecting? Likewise. Pikmin 1 surprised my 12 year old self as being a beautiful, cleverly-designed, and fairly challenging and sometimes emotionally endearing tale. It was one of the best of the system, as you go through sprawling maps that seem to open up and get more unique and varied each time, with difficult bosses and a tough time limit that requires precise efficiency. But this isn't a Pikmin 1 review. Pikmin 2 we have now, which actually trades the improvement from a level and landscape perspective, and puts the meat of the game inside of caves. Now, this sequel maintains most of the Pikmin diversity and the elemental challenges, but it ditches the time limit, which really reduces your pressure, but not in a good way. You can make mistakes, waste time, and it doesn't really matter. The levels are fairly large, but by the end of the game they feel underwhelming. Playing through the main game will give you decent satisfaction. It would be a perfect rental back in the day. However, there are probably twice as many treasures needed to complete it 100%. And along the way of playing the game, the majority of treasures are inside of caves. These caves have tons of challenges, usually a boss fight or two, occasionally excruciating and unfair punishments and game mechanics. In fact, some caves are so hard that it seems like the developers made it so that finding ways to manipulate your way around the challenges are the only way to survive. The caves are certainly a grind near the end, but they're pretty fun at first. This game offers a crazy amount of diversity and even a coop mode if you're into that. Pikmin 2 is great. It's NOT for the weak at heart or for pure-casual fans, as it may frustrate you beyond belief at times. But it's a solid follow-up and a satisfying 100% over 35 hours.. Oh my god, this gem ****. Pikmin 2 manages to draw me in every time I even think of replaying it. It is easily the best entry of the franchise. There is so much content to enjoy, and even a huge chunk of content after the supposed ""ending"" of the story mode. If that's not your style, then there's the Piklopedia and Treasure Hoard to just sit back and relax to for hours on end. But say you've completed the story mode and filled out everything. Well, BAM! There's also an awesome Two-Player Battle Mode to rage at your friends with. On top of that, there's also a very accurately named Challenge Mode to either go it alone or take a friend with you. The graphics for this game strike a perfect balance of cute and environmental. A surprising amount of strategy is involved to lead your Pikmin army to victory in any mode you play. Pikmin 2 is the game that keeps on giving, with loads of replayability to get the best scores possible. It is a masterpiece of the Gamecube, and I would even buy an HD remaster if it ever came out on the Switch.. More of Pikmin 1. Same game but in greater content quantity. Critic goes to the off-putting difficulty of the game. Another 8.. I remember playing this game for the first time when my brothers would travel and my parents had work, it was around the summer time so I had a ton of freetime. I would play this game quite a bit and I really felt connected with the story. I wasn't at the age where I beat many games but I still remember beating this game and reaching that final boss and finally feeling like I did something like beat a game that wasn't that easy. It was fun. Time went by and made those times where I was alone go by so fast. Not many games can do this but this was definitely one of them. I never had a wiiu so I never actually got the chance to play the story in the new Pikmin 3 but if it is anything like the one in this game, it would be worth it. I'm glad to see that they are still making pikmin games.. I have only played the Wii Version of this but that's not the main point so... I am technically biased to the Wii Version... THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME! Pikmin 2, has every aspect a good game should have, different, difficult but fun challenges, a lot more to do, and completely different aspect changes that don't even feel like Pikmin! There is a challenge mode for you to play with your friends and even a 2P battle mode! albeit, there is SOME missed potential because you can't play 2 Player in the normal game. Pikmin 2 does everything a sequel should do and is worthy of a 10.6/10 - CoronzinReviews. Pikmin series just never gets old and I don't know why. This game is just a masterpiece and the best game in the pikmin series and for good reasons. It is not flawed or repetitive.. Used to play this allot as a kid, it's got a great sense of charm, atmosphere, and strategy, and is especially difficult if you are a child. But, it's great fun, has some of the best graphics I've ever seen on GameCube. It even added ""dungeons"", which are the best addition to the game. One of my all-time favorite games!. I love this game so much. It has some of the best graphics iv'e seen on the gamecube. The enemies are very creative. The randomly generated dungeons make the game fun even when going through multiple times. The music is perfect. The pikmin are some of the cutest video game creatures ever and I have spent hours on the multiplayer modes. It is challenging but nowhere near dark souls. I don't have much else to say. I love this game.. Another masterpiece from Miyamoto. Gorgeous and detailed above ground areas followed by unique under ground caves. The double captain mechanic works really well by adding a stronger sense of strategy and multitasking. This game also has one of the most underrated OSTs in gaming history. Rather than being all ""up in your face"" like the Geno's Maze or Planet Wisp themes, the songs in this game are very subtle and atmospheric, and they fit the area or cave they play over perfectly. The Pikmin AI is completely improved from the first game, and the camera works perfectly, allowing multiple viewing angles ranging from bird's eye view to behind the shoulder. The adventure mode is much longer than that of the first Pikmin game, and there are also Challenge and Multiplayer modes for more content, so you definitely get your money's worth. The only viable complaint I can see for this game is that the purple pikmin break the combat in this game. However, while this is true, the game's various hazards, gimmicks, and bosses still bring the pain in terms of difficulty, and it's VERY easy to lose your pikmin if you aren't careful. I've only had this game for four years now, so it's not even a game from my childhood that I only like for nostalgia purposes. This game is one of my all time favorites. If you ever have the opportunity to pick up a copy, I highly recommend you do.. A very good strategy game for the Gamecube era, Which gets more difficult as the story progresses. The overall game feels very high quality, and rarely to never do you find anything to scrutinize it for. Loads of content and game play to enjoy. A must have for the Gamecube.. The treasure collection aspect and the art in this game are unparalleled. The introduction of caves was one of the best ideas ever. This game is one of the most perfectly constructed games on the planet.. This game is AMAZING! I just really love the story line, and I love the set up. I also love how there are 2 new Pikmin, making 5 Pikmin now! I just really love this game, it builds suspense, and it also builds anger on the REAL final boss. I just love this game, and I suggest you get it. Its amazing.. One of, if not, one of my favorite Nintendo games. The game builds on its predecessor making excellent additions such as treasure pieces, new Pikmin and a cave feature which extends the game ten **** to mention the lazy but love-able Louie who rejoins everyone's favourite Hocotatian Captain Olimar. The mixture of a childlike innocence with a darker Darwinian survival feel make this game a rare find which for some reason is immeasurably addictive. The quality of this game is also faultless, graphics are appealing, text is funny yet immersed in the lore and zoology of the series. But at the end of the day, this game gets a perfect score for me because it is a joy to play, and always will be.. Pikmin 2 is a classic game from my childhood that still holds up today better then most games I played from that age and funny to think this was the first Real-Time strategy games I ever played. Pikmin 2 is a very imaginative game which lets you go beyond your imagination with these life forms called Pikmin. This game kicks off the Pikmin series with these little creatures that won't stop at anything to help you on your adventure. The graphics are very well designed, though sometimes i think that Pikmin get hung up on walls too often. The controls never have seemed to bother when i was playing through. The game really got gamers into the series and the world of Pikmin. Doing one day in this game was good enough for one day for me because it gets repetitive after too much of playing it. I think this game is outstanding and imaginative with the help of these little creatures along with you.. This is pretty much the best game for the gamecube. I love almost everything about it! Graphics- The graphics are absolutely fantastic, especially for a decently old game. The scenery is beautiful, with strange trees plants, and remains of a mysterious previous civilization. Their are all sorts of creatures with various appearances, ranging from cute ones to creepy ones to ugly ones. Everything, even the plants are just bursting with personality. However, the pikmin are by far the cutest creatures in the game. Every time one dies, I feel saddened by their little rising ghost. Music/ Sounds- The music and sounds are, again, fantastic. Um....... Next category. Puzzles- This games puzzles can be quite imaginative, but they're never very tricky. Most of the puzzles can be solved in a few seconds. However, actually getting your pikmin to follow your orders can be tricky. The puzzles aren't great, but there not the main features of the game, so that's alright. Combat- The strategical combat of this game is fantastic. You can use the C-stick to arrange your pikmin, or just toss them at your enemy. Different enemies are introduced frequently, making you have to adapt your battle strategy. Some enemies can easily be defeated by a large group of pikmin, for some your better off with a small force. I suppose that's all. Hope the sequel's as good!. Best game for the Gamecube EVER! This game is a must have for anyone that has every touched a gamecube or hash't, Pikmin 2 is a masterpiece, the gameplay and graphics are revolutionary, even for a game that came out nearly 10 years ago, much better than the first, (Another awesome game!) It has everything a sequal should have, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is better than the third, which comes out very soon, FINALLY! Talking about it makes me want to drop everything and go play it! It is much easier than the first, as you had a time limit to beat the game, which I disliked and made it much harder. There's just so much to do before and after the game, it's just an amazing game that I remember getting when I was only 7, my favorite childhood game by far, the new pikmin are awesome and of coarse adorable, but some of the underground levels are brutally tough, but not impossible! GET THIS GAME NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!. The first Pikmin was an original title that mixed elements of a real time strategy game with Nintendo's unique playful charm. Simple intuitive controls and an overall sense of fun made what at first may have seemed a slightly overwhelming experience into something that could be enjoyed by gamers of all backgrounds. This sequel retains that charm by playing in fundamentally the same way. Players take charge of captain Olimar and his friend Louie and command up to 100 Pikmin at a time in order to complete tasks and collect valuable items located within each 'level'. This being a Nintendo title it of course improves upon almost every aspect of the original. Most importantly the '30 day system' that required players to rush to complete their goals has been completely removed. This means that the game can be played at your own pace and exploring the environment is now truly encouraged. Two new Pikmin varieties have also been added to the mix to compliment the three from the first game. White Pikmin are poisonous and as a result can traverse toxic areas (they can also be sacrificed by feeding them to an enemy) whilst the large purple Pikmin can lift heavier objects and do far more damage in battles. The intelligent level design compliments these new Pikmin brilliantly creating some fiendish puzzles to solve. With the introduction of Louie players are now also able to switch between two groups of Pikmin in order to complete some of these puzzles or to gang up on more difficult enemies. Just be aware that leaving a group unattended and out in the open can end in disaster. All this being said a couple of minor grips from the original still remain. It is still easy to grab the wrong type of Pikmin from your group which can result in their untimely demise and on rare occasions Pikmin will get trapped on scenery without you noticing and therefore get left behind. These **** are in no way enough to spoil the game however and I would highly recommend adding both Pikmin titles to your collection.. (SORRY FOR BAD LANGUAGE) The best GameCube game ever. Just because it was very complete, beautiful level desing, awesome enemies, with detailed graphics, and a very strong gameplay, no many games have that characteristic, that its gameplay is the strongest part. While it hasn't an amazing story and we can't call it ""memorable"", the game doesn't demand it. It has the classic Mario point, if you're looking for cool stories, this game it's not for Wii U. The game focuses on collecting treasures around the Pikmin world (perhaps the Earth) using these creatures to carry them. Pikmin 2 also has the cave system, similar to the first Zelda for NES, where you can choose the first dungeon to go with liberty. In these caves there are lot of treasures but also enemies. In caves, perhaps you're going to play around 15 hours. Technically, I've never noticed a bug and it always run on a decent framerate, very cool. The sound it's relaxing and memorable, you're going to have some melodies for your whole life.. This Game is a masterpiece its not to short or to long the controls are great and the game play is just amazing i can't get over how good this game really is. It is really amazing, as a child I played so many hours of it. It was very fun and enjoyable. The humour is great and the enemies you defeat are so eccentric and interesting. The world is alien yet familiar, there are many interesting places to discover and new pikmins to find. The caves are challenging but in a good way, it makes it difficult but fun. The game lasted for so long and consumed a lot of my childhood. It made me laugh, made me smile even made me cry. Its packed full with adventures and tasks and the bosses are simply amazing. The pikmins are so adorable and I love it how you feel as if your dictating them. The game also comes with an interesting ""Piklopedia"" and many bonus games that are great fun when playing with others The only downside is its on the Gamecube, don't get me wrong its not a problem its just I doubt many people today have them. One of the best games i've played in my childhood.. This game is just brilliant! this game is my favourite game of all time and so much better then the first! The Pikmin differ from each other but a lot you also need a plan before entering a cave or your Pikmin will die very easily. The music is fantastic but maybe not as good as the first one. Now if you will excuse me I'm going to play some Pikmin 2. A Masterpiece. The Graphics are beautiful, the humor brilliant, the concept original, the boss battles epic. The Multiplayer and Challenge Modes will give you a whole lot of additional content after the initial quest is over. The cuteness of the Pikmin themselves will draw you in to the point where it truly pains you to let one of the little buggers die. The addition of caves and berries, the new types of Pikmin, and more really add to the strategy. If Miyamoto could continue to make new IPs as great as this, Nintendo will be set for a very long time, not that they aren't already. This is the greatest game I have ever played.. I Haven't played the first Pikmin game, but if it is anything like this incredible masterpiece, than i'd buy it. This is one of the greatest games ever made to me. A fun story, great music, good graphics, great gameplay, and awesome concept. For my 1st playthrough, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I like the unique concept uses of Pikmin and the various (and silly naming) of the treasures you collect in your journey. Plot is given to you straightforward (and solid at that) and leaves you more focused to the gameplay and environment that we call Pikmin. Very lovable game for me. I wish you could have campaigned with a partner in this game. In broader terms, the multiplayer could have used more work.. If you loved the first game, then you'll fall even deeper in love with Pikmin 2, one of the best sequels on the GCN. Pros: It practically improves every aspect of the first game; rich, colorful visuals; additional multiplayer; no time limit; hilariously quirky. Cons: Pikmin often get left behind; no widescreen mode; annoying camera.. Pikmin 2 is the sequel to one of Nintendo's most original new series, and it beat the first hand-down. True, it is no strategy game, nor does it fit any category at all; but it is simply a graphical and musical masterpiece of the Gamecube-perhaps the greatest. The versus mode, I never got into, but the co-op levels are really good. And the 1-p mode is a fleshed-out, cute science fair of creatures. Please get it.. Strategy games may be plentiful on PCs but when it comes to quality RTS experiences on consoles, they are few and far between. Even when they do come along, they're often watered down or inferior ports. Thankfully, Pikmin 2 is the gleaming exception. Its not often that a reviewer uses the word ""perfect"" but this just happens to be one of those cases. First off, the game improves on the original in just about every way. The controls have been tweaked, more Pikmin have been added to increase your strategy options and new randomized dungeons have been added to vastly increase the games replayability. The game is also charming, with characters and enemies that are bursting with personality. The entire experience feels light hearted yet RTS junkies can expect a decent challenge, especially in the latter half of the game when the difficulty ramps up. A pure joy to play and a must buy for anyone who needs proof that not only can an RTS work on consoles, it can be one of the most memorable gaming experiences you've ever had.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is amazing, and much better than the previous game. There is nothing I would change in this game, It's just that perfect. This game has amazing replay value too. Just like the first Pikmin game you want to get a better score, so you create new files.","Bruv pikmin 2 takes down the whole series . takes pikmin 2 to a whole new level. You can wobble them, you can own a small plant creature. Louie is mentally unstable ."
339.DAVE THE DIVER,"I like it. The swim sessions are cool, with all the unique exploration and progression. But the cooking parts are just boring.. Cute, cozy, charming. A delightfully light deep diving / sushi management game with an excellent story and endearing characters from Dave on down!. A fine game let down by the early and late game. It was slow to start but then went on for a few hours too long. The core fishing loop was fun once you got into it but quickly became boring & repetitive which they did make strides to change but just replaced with more repetitive busy work. Also far too much hand holding, no matter how obvious your next step would be, Dave would chime in essentially telling you what to do.. A very superficial game. The story is overly simple, and the dialogues feel childish. The part where you hunt in the water is stimulating at first but becomes repetitive quickly. I don't recommend it unless you enjoy straightforward indie games aimed at a younger audience.. It's the best game I've played in recent years. It is a perfect and very enjoyable game in every aspect. Congratulations to the producers.. Great casual game, good for killing time. Simple story, but straight to the point, and great characters.. Score: 8.4 Such a fun and refreshing game to play after hundreds of hours on AAA Open World RPGs. I loved the gameplay loop, the several stories, the minigames, just soo much fun!. Doesn't work on small screens because you can't see what buttons to press. this is a persistent switch issue with many games that just weren't made for the platform being sold regardless.. Great game for folks looking to enjoy exploration and upgrading at their own pace.. ""Dave the Diver"" is a unique blend of underwater exploration and management simulation that offers both a fun and relaxing experience. The underwater world is colorful and intriguing, filled with mysteries to uncover. The thrill of catching fish and interacting with various marine creatures is genuinely **** restaurant management aspect is surprisingly engaging and deeper than expected. Catching fresh fish and serving them in your restaurant, crafting menus, and keeping customers happy keep the gameplay dynamic and interesting. The combination of these two different gameplay styles ensures the game stays fresh and enjoyable.That said, the game does run the risk of becoming repetitive at times. Some of the tasks feel a bit too similar, and the progression can slow down occasionally. However, overall, it offers a creative and entertaining **** pixel art style and music wonderfully complement the game’s atmosphere. The visuals, paired with soothing underwater-themed music, give the game a relaxing and nostalgic vibe.Overall, ""Dave the Diver"" successfully merges different genres, offering a relaxing and fun game. While it can become repetitive in certain areas, it's definitely worth a try.. My favourite comfort game, it's so damn cozy it's insane and it's a game I never delete, I can't help but adore the simple gameplay, the great cast, I would gladly recommend it although it may not be for everyone. It was a really fun game, lots of things to do, and whole world of mechanics and management to do, but all that was also my enemy, too much things that took my attention. It is still a really good, game. Really good design and execution, great mixed gameplay and good art direction. I was hopping less from this game, so I was greatly surprised. Recommended.. I am a ARPG gamer , this is the best game i ever played in the recent 5-6 years. My last favorite non-action game is **** valley. Fun design and I wish there will be more DLC coming out!. Saw the game on CallmeKevin's channel. An amazing game that includes the best parts of different genres and executes this mix amazingly. If you're a fan of diving/exploration games, or fishing games, or restaurant management games, or upgrades games... Well, I think you understand my point. This game does everything perfectly. And Dave is a really good fella.. really relaxing game. really good for after-work. but that's all. In the beginning, it was fascinating to arrange the fishing time and opening time. but when the time went on it became boring and exhausting.. Dave the Diver - Review by DigiDynamo Graphics: Dave the Diver boasts beautiful art direction with vibrant colors and detailed environments that truly bring the underwater world and your restaurant to life. The cutscenes are fantastic, adding a charming, animated flair that enhances the storytelling. On the Steam Deck, the game runs flawlessly, and the OLED panel makes the visuals pop, adding to the immersive experience. Gameplay: The gameplay loop of diving, collecting fish, running a restaurant, and unraveling mysteries is incredibly satisfying. Even though the tutorial feels a bit long-winded with its dialogue-heavy approach, the game opens up fairly quickly. Once you start exploring the Blue Hole, you’ll find new treasures and intriguing game mechanics that keep the experience fresh. The difficulty ramps up once all the mechanics are established, making dives more lethal and restaurant management more demanding—keeping you on your toes. Surprisingly, Dave the Diver managed to make me love a fishing mini-game, which I usually hate in other games.Story:The narrative cleverly ties in with the gameplay, using character backstories and side quests to push you deeper into the mysteries of the ever-changing Blue Hole. I loved how the game doesn’t take itself too seriously; it’s filled with humor and memorable moments, like a hilarious sequence involving one of my favorite characters who builds weapons for you. The inclusion of these narratives adds layers to the gameplay, giving you more reasons to dive deeper and explore. Upgrades: Upgrading is a significant part of the game and is well-executed. You can enhance your equipment, including weapons, diving suits, cargo boxes, and oxygen tanks, allowing you to tackle more challenging dives and manage your business more efficiently. This progression feels rewarding and is vital to succeeding as the game increases in difficulty. Overall: The hype from the positive reviews is real. Dave the Diver is an awesome cozy game where you can lose yourself in the cycle of fishing, managing a bustling restaurant, and uncovering the secrets of the Blue Hole. Despite a slightly clunky start due to the tutorial delivery, the game’s charm, engaging mechanics, and beautiful presentation make it a must-play. If you’re looking for a game where you can get lost in the routine of running a business with the thrill of exploring an ever-changing ocean, Dave the Diver is a delightful catch. I love it, and I highly recommend giving it a try!. I really wanted to enjoy this, given all the hype surrounding it. However, the game ultimately feels quite simplistic. It’s overloaded with cynically designed, dopamine-triggering mini-features that, in the past, would have been criticized for feeling too “mobile,” yet here they’re being passed off as solid mechanics. It is definitely not awful, don't get me wrong but it feels like I’m constantly grinding, and the goals or story elements just aren’t engaging or deep enough.. Mediocre at best. The first part of the game is great but then it throws itself into a pile of **** while doing a backflip. the rest of the game is so bad it has 92729119 Mechanics that just ruin the game.. Genre isn't my typical type, and I loved this game. Was surprised by the amount of depth to it and how it ties in together. I will absolutely play any game that this studio makes in the future.. Game strengths: Captivating story, charismatic characters, beautiful graphics, varied mechanics, large amount of content. Game weaknesses: Extremely easy difficulty, simple mechanics, intrusive narrative. Summary: It delivers what it promises, a fun and completely non-standard indie game, but it relies heavily on the graphic beauty and diversity of the content. while lacking in mechanics and offering no challenge to the player. Rating: 7 Congratulations to Mint rocket.. Dave the diver is the most fun game if you want to sit back and relax. I sincerely enjoyed this games one in a lifetime opportunity fun.. I really enjoyed playing this game. I loved how you have to manage your sushi shop, the farm, the fish farm... The fishing is also great; I spent a lot of time in the water. I didn't give it a 10 for several reasons. The main quest is very annoying. It's really predictable, and the characters are not interesting. Also, one thing that genuinely pissed me off is the boss fights. We are so slow! I had to retry every boss at least three times. I think there are too many gameplay elements; it's fun, but the card guy, the local paper guy, etc., are annoying. Overall, I spent 26 hours on this game, and I really liked it. The credits were very cool too ;). Very interesting game with good mechanics for fishing, combats, economy and the management of your business. It's heavy downside comes with it's story, such an uninteresting and bloated storyline with boring writing, characters that are just annoying and all.. Dave the Diver is half good. For the first half of the game it's brilliant. Amazing music, fun mechanics, nice variety between it's areas, just amazingtogo diving in. The second half of the game (I'm saying half as the game has stalled at chapter 6 and is going nowhere fast) is a tedious **** of too many ideas and mechanics vying for attention. I now have two sushi restaurants, a vegetable farm, a fish farm and a seaweed farm all requiring attention (but you can only pick certain elements duringthe time slots during the day thereby locking off the other elements). All progress has stalled completely as every single its a minimumof 10,000+ to get. From the fish farm expansion, to your staff training, to your diving gear upgrades. On top of that weapons upgrades are linked to RNG nonsense meaning you'll never get the top tier guns. Coupled with this boss fights that highligh how slow and defenseless your character really is, makes this a complete waste of my time now. Mint rocket if your listening reduce the cost of everything 1000-2000g, give Dave a speed boost, and fix the drops from the fish for weapon upgrades.. Super enjoyable game, lots of stuff going on and you'll just realise that you have been playing it for 40 plus hours and more. Thats how goods this game was.. I absolutely love the underwater scenery in this game! Time just flies by when I'm playing it. It's so much fun. Simply the best.. A lovely game with a cute mood (well, besides when you are fighting a boss battle...). The build up of things you can do is very good, so you don't feel overwhelmed. And if you decide to just take it easy for a day, the game will not prevent you from doing that.. Great game, one of the best I ever played! Its very funny, entertaining, smart and addicting. You just can't quit, and only wanna go for that one last dive or just night in the sushi place! 10/10. This is, by far, the most ambitious indie game I have ever played. The game never stops surprising you with additional content, sometimes in wholesome, sometimes in silly yet funny ways. The story is reasonably long, and sufficiently elaborate to make room for character development, while keeping it sufficiently simple to maintain the casual atmosphere the game brings up since the first dive. The menus, combinations, upgrades, apps, locations, variations of fish, characters, guns, harpoon types, challenges, mini-games and vast content will truly captur your attention and imagination, and bring you joy as you dive into this world. Go ahead, give it a try.. Eventful and well paced, Dave the Diver will hold your attention and keep you entertained. Simple but engaging gameplay and very relaxing. Beautiful environments, music and animations.. I bloody love this game it is an absolute master piece. this game has descended from heaven to grace us melancholy sushi fish loving mortals. everyone should play this game because it has the best game play loop ever and is unendingly fun. I have over 433 hours on this game I failed my ACT so that I could play this game more.. For the most part, this game is great. It’s addictive and deceptively simple with a lot of depth. The core gameplay loop keeps throwing new stuff at you which is great, and there’s a surprising number of side activities that are all executed very well… But! This game far overstays it’s welcome, and become increasingly repetitive and boring as it goes on. The length doesn’t feel artificial though; there’s new stuff all the way through; but eventually, you’ll be like “okay, it would be nice if this could end soon”, and then it goes on for another 10 hours. This is of course a pretty common trend in todays market, because games wants an hour of gameplay per dollar spent, but still, they game would’ve left me with a much better impression if it had ended waaaaay before. All that being said, when it’s good, it’s REALLY good.. Absolutely amazing. I was surprised how deep the game loop goes and how many activities are in game.. It would have been very boring if you just kept diving and running the restaurant. But the story, the boss, the various events, etc. keep the game interesting.. a great, relaxing game with a surprising amount of detail and humor, as well as some fun collectathons, minigames, and managing a restaurant. there are even some fun little miniboss/boss fights. 1 point taken off because of a few small UI issues, and another because the game has an annoying habit of sending the player obstacles that they can't face yet. while this often makes for a sort of zelda-like exploration to the game, it also frequently feels like i end up at dead ends where the event isn't even supposed to activate for a few days. the gameplay loop is still fun, and the roadblocks are obviously designed to encourage a longer playtime and more exploration/experimentation with the food, as well as giving us time for side quests and minigames.. super charming game with an incredible amount of different content (which is not imposed by the developers) I had great pleasure immersing myself in this lovely world, however there are a little stuffy collectibles, although they are optional and the lack **** map is also a small minus, but it’s great of course. This game is super good and funny game. It does provide you a lot of hours of content for the price, indeed.. This game provides you a lot of hours of content for the price, super good and funny game.. The most boring game I’ve ever played. I can't imagine for whom this game is created. I highly don't recommend it, even if I wanted to waste my time, I would still choose a different game.. Pretty fun combat and mini games. Great Pixel art too. Got a little old after about 10 hours.. the dev definitely putted too much effort in the under water city. overall gameplay is chilling underwater, and when you are in the restaurant it became fast pace because you have serve food quickly to your customer. loving the dlc with dredge, the Godzilla dlc will be interesting. holy **** these **** boss fights ruin otherwise decent game. **** this ****. Objectively, Dave the Diver is great for someone who likes relaxed gameplay akin to The Sims or **** valley, but for me, it's a bit too boring. The half fishing half restaurant-sim aspect is pretty unique, so if you're down for simulation gameplay, this will be right up your alley.. It's a nice, cosy game. Special kudos for the cutscenes, they are incredible!. The game is very cute and fun, but it is way more grindy than it should be for a casual indie game. After a while it becomes quite repetitive, but the new features that the game gives you over time keep the game fresh.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Totally adicted, must try. You don't know how you end up playing the first chapter straight.. One of the greatest indie games of all time. Love the different weapons and upgrades and the game always manages to stay fresh by adding content, even in the late game. All the boss are pretty unique as well. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a game with a beautiful art style and chill gameplay.. This game is fantastic, for everyone saying that it is repetitive, yes it is, kinda selling sushi and operating the restaurant but there is also more. If you like a chilling game but also have action, I will highly recommend Dave The Diver. Wildly overrated garbage. It's just a restaurant serving game mixed with a fish/ingredient collection game where you dive. Both parts are painfully boring and painfully unoriginal.. Cool diving game, there is a lot of things to do and stuff to progress to, they know how to make the game **** diving and fishing combines well with the sushi restaurant. But maybe they stuffed a bit too much in it, like the farming didn't really do anything for **** the gameplay is not that special that I continued fishing after the main story was over.. Art is good if you like pixel art. Gameplay is not very creative more like a mix of a lot of successful tycoon types of games. A bit repetitive and boring especially for the food serving part.. it is a perfect game. it is very addictive and all of it's aspects is well done. you can do whatever you want, there are plenty of activities and every dive into the deep sea will be satisfying till the very end. This game is super cute, and surprisingly meaningful! Maybe even too much content! I thought, 10-20 hours, I'll solve it in a few days before Christmas, but no, this game never wants to end, even after 30-40-50 hours it opens up new story and game mechanics parts. Maybe that's the only downside, it wants too much at once, but it's still a great game made with heart and soul, and totally bug free!. I've found this game to be a really fun example of a ""Skinner box"" type, where the main draw is the addictive increase in numbers and progress, a concept often humorously referred to as ""number go beeg."" What sets it apart for me is its unique personality, which really makes it stand out, even when compared to big names like **** Valley. The game introduces a lot of mechanics, but I feel like about half of them could have been better thought out. However, when it comes to fishing games, this one is definitely among the most enjoyable I've played.. TLDR: One of the best indie games of all time. And therefore one of the very best games ever - and usually I don't like pixel art. Dave is just a great guy. He loves diving and very soon also fishing. So he answers his old friend's call and starts a job in a beach sushi bar. What follows should you experience for yourselves. Because anything else would be a spoiler. As soon as you feel that you have experienced the gameplay loop sufficiently, the game surprises you with completely new elements, a story and character development for all the supporting characters. Great! Game of the year 2023!. The game was fun. Gameplay was awesome, story was interesting. Unfortunately I have one problem with this game. After like 15 hours fishing seems to be senseless. (Great game but not fun to max). Art is good if you like pixel art. Gameplay is not very creative more like a mix of a lot of successful tycoon types of games. A bit repetitive and boring especially for the food serving part.. Its a fun game, but the fun doesn't sustain for long. The gameplay loop is interesting because it has a lot of variety, but I feel that this is also the game's weak area. If any of the gameplay elements would be isolated, this game would be extremely forgettable because none of them are really deep. So what you get is multiple gameplay elements that were taken out of the oven too soon. Luckily the saving grace is that they weave the separate gameplay elements into a really neat and cohesive package that flows decently well. Another issue I had with the game was the overarching pacing - the speed at which new gameplay elements are incorporated in the mix feels off. That combined with the story which is so drawn out made for an experience that I was not enthusiastic about in my play through. The game also feels rather linear, yet it has all of the elements that could create an interesting game that you do at your own speed (like **** Valley, Terraria, etc). But despite all of my criticisms, I had fun with the game. I got 8 hours out of it and I am content with my experience, and I don't think I'll ever have an itch to return to this game. Where the game shines the most is the charm. The character's have really distinct and memorable personalities, the overall presentation and concept just has a charming allure to the whole experience. The graphics are really nice as well. The music on the other hand, highly forgettable and overly repetitive. Its not a bad game by any means. Its just very average. It has some great things about it, it has some bad things about it, but most of all, it has many things that are just not fully baked and feel really shallow.. A fantastic game that immediately captivated me. It offers a lot of variety, good bosses, puzzles, farming, a good level of difficulty and a good soundtrack, as well as excellent 2D graphics.. Indie of the year! There are so many things to do in this beautiful game. I had a lot of fun.. Great game with absolutely terrible pacing. Instead of just giving you the game at a study pace, they drag it out and what ends up happening is you'll grow bored and tired of the same run over and over yet you'll still be unlocking features you wish you woulda had earlier.. Very fun in the beginning to mid-game. Started to get somewhat bored near the end. had fun but wouldn't play again.. By far one of my favorite games of 2023.. An excellent game with very good graphics, smooth animations, very good story and characters, very interesting gameplay and various mini-games, this game is full of content and when you think that the game has no more content, it suddenly surprises you. and immerses you in its underwater world. The only problem with the game is that when you pass the game, the story of the game slows down a bit and this may be boring for some. Other than that, it's a magical game that disconnects you from the real world for 20 hours. Definitely worth the experience. Diversity, animations, fluidity, story, art design, music, sweet cutscenes, interface, characters... I don't remember seeing another indie that is so flawless and perfectionist. It is a game that can be understood from afar as having been prepared with passion and effort by competent people. You should definitely try it. 9.5/10. best indie this year! love the music and the pixel art style. the battles are not hard but fun the rhythm game is impressive!!. This is such a great game. First game that I get 100% of achievements. The gameplay is awesome. The repetitiveness, for me, was meditative in a way. You just go around and fish and then run the sushi place and then upgrade your gear etc. The story is good. The humour is on point. The game unfold everytime you play during the whole story. The music is gucci good. GOTY 2k23 in the indie categorie for sure. Get the damn game.. Very long and very repetitive. The game is a fun 8/10 at first, but it quickly becomes very repetitive and dull with the story proceeding at a glacial pace. This game could have been great with 70% of the weaker content cut, but as it is, it is not worth buying at all.. Spyan Jul 4, 2023 5 Reminds me a lot of Dredge : a grindy, merely semi-ok phone game with repetive game loops that will keep you enternained for 3 days before you give up and uninstal. Not much incentive to finish the game. A mish mash of popular mechanics from ten other games that gets old pretty fast. Just like dredge : nothing to write home about and will be forgotten in about a monthg after its release. First hours feel great but the gameplay is too simple to made the experience intersteting in the long run. Most of the characters have little to no evolution during the story, it feels kinda empty. However a great mix between 3d et pixel art, really fiiting the ""dive"" atmosphere and some cool fish design.. I played near yo 50h and ended the history and all the quest. I enjoyed a lot this Game. It has a good balance between be consistent with the game style and add new features to avoid feel boring. The story is not very deep bus has some funny moments. I played it on SteamDeck and was a perfect experience.. Dave the Diver is cute and a game that is definitely worth playing. Very charming. It gives me hope that in a time where AAA games are on the decline that there will once again be the rise of the Indie game. The characters are endearing. The music is relaxing. Fishing is a genuine joy. I will pay close attention to what this studio does in the future, BUT. Dave the Diver doesn't know what it wants to be. It couldn't decide so it picked to be everything. It would be much better game if it picked a couple things and fleshed them out instead of just being mediocre at most things. I wish they had just focused on the fishing / running a sushi restaurant. We could even keep the vegetable and fish farm. Perfect that gameplay loop. I think that could have been a 10/10 game. But instead it tried to do too much and forgot what it's main purpose was. Definitely worth playing, but falls a little short in the end.. Very fun and relaxing. Nice characters, nice soundtrack. Love the pixel graphics.. Dave the Diver ultimately landed as a game I wish I had loved. The setting, style, and tone were all spot on for me. I loved the characters and vibe they had set up. the restaurant sim was light and fun, the upgrade system clear and rewarding. I just did not enjoy the actual main gameplay diving sequences enough, which became stale for me rather quick.. if you like the 2D pixel game is a realy nice game but some meccanic it's not really good, but at over is good i give 8. Zelda + Metroid + Eco the Dolphin = Dave the Diver = GOTY 2023 ! Super fun game with A LOT of new ideas. A wonderful gameplay loop and beautiful pixel art graphics. One of the best games of 2023 for sure.. Its a nice summer-game with a nice story. After 14 hours i had enough because of the mermaids.. Dave The Diver is an underwater gem of game design. Players are treated to a harmonious blend of exploration, collection, side quests, and a restaurant simulator. Each element not only complements the others but also contributes to an infinitely satisfying and addictive gameplay loop. What's even more remarkable is the constant influx of new mechanics and content, ensuring the game feels fresh, invigorating, and rewarding from the first splash to the very last dive. It's more than just great; it's a marine masterpiece.. A very fun indie game that mixes a side-view ocean exploring to gather resources, and a sushi restaurant manager/server experience. As you go deeper into the game, new mechanics are presented to the player that keeps the game feeling fresh. The pixel art of the game is amazing, and the ""cinemas"" are over the top and hilarious.. It is a very interesting game, with many mechanics, it could be better with time to make the sushi and give it more importance but otherwise it is an excellent fun game that even my grandmother would like. Game starts off very fun, but theres not much progression after getting staff. Wish there was more mechanics in the game, and more things to do while working in the restaurant. I feel like just a little bit more complexity would add a lot to this game, because how it is now it becomes very repetitive.. The game revolves around two main gameplay parts: 1. exploring, collecting, and fighting in the sea, and 2. managing and working in a sushi restaurant. The total gameplay loop is 3 parts: morning sea session, afternoon sea session, and sushi restaurant session at night. You collect as many things in your pack (weight limited, but can be upgraded as you progress) as you can in each sea session, then head back up to the boat to supply your sushi restaurant, or to sell if its non-fish. You can also end the session whenever you want, or if you start to run out of air without a way to replenish it, but for the sake of making money it makes more sense to fill your pack each session. hunting regular fish is pretty basic as you aim your harpoon gun manually, and reel them in automatically. some tougher fish require quicktime events that are randomized so you can't memorize if its the QTE based on the right joystick, or series of buttons on the controller. The tougher/bigger fish are more interesting encounters. They will attack you and it requires careful ammo management with a gun, as the harpoon isn't enough, as well as dodgin their lunges at you. There are bosses in the game that vary in difficulty, but overall are pretty good/fun. Then there is the sushi restaurant. You try to upgrade your sushi meals based on the fish you catch each day, rarer or bigger fish bring better sale prices, as well as enhancing dishes with salt, oil, etc. that you can find in the sea. You can research new sushi meals as you collect a type of currency based on good performance at the restaurant. Then, you set your menu for the evening and open the restaurant. you run around the sushi bar filling glasses and running plates to customers. As you progress and your restaurant gets more popular, you need to hire waiters and cooks to meet the demand. Overall, the sea portions of the game are more relaxing than exciting. I think the most fun part of the game personally is trying to fill the compendium of fish and unlocking all the sushi dishes for your restaurant, as the fighting portion under the sea gets kinda boring after the first few hours. The sushi restaurant is pretty interesting at first, especially as you hire staff and start to make aesthetic changes to your restaurant. However, once you have a full staff they do most of the work for you and the things that you are left to do get very repetitive. The sushi restaurant gameplay loop overall is like a 5 out of 10. The sea portion is probably 7 out of 10 That would leave the game with an average of 6 out of 10, but the extra point I gave in my score goes to the charm and humor of the characters and story of the game. The game has the same sort of charm going for it that reminded me of **** Valley with its characters, and it definitely makes the game more enjoyable to play. I also commend indie games that make charming experiences and tight gameplay type games, even if the gameplay is rather basic or repetitive. In summary, its worth your time to play for like an hour a day/night to wind down after playing your ranked try-hard multiplayer games that are more stressful than fun.. In Dave the Diver you play as Dave – the Diver – who flies out to a deserted Island, meets a restaurant owner and a business man and become the diver for said restaurant. You get a diving suit, a harpoon and its your job to provide fish for the restaurant so the chef can make sushi. You also serve at that restaurant. The gamepaly loop itself is super fun: You have 3 segments in the day, 2 for diving, 1 for working at the restaurant. While diving you have your harpoon and different weapons, to catch fish and also fight dangerous fish, like multiple kinds of sharks. In the evening, you assist in the restaurant, you set up the menu, hire co-workers and serve the sushi to the customers. Both these aspects are by far the best in the game, the ocean is fun to explore, the restaurant section is also a fun mini game. You can upgrade several things, like the diving suit to dive deeper, or the harpoon to make more damage. You have a weapon shop to upgrade weapons, a pokemon like fish card collection game, a achievement log where you get several smaller tasks you can exchange for points and items. The game also has one main story, which offers a nice and interesting ","""Dave the Diver"" is a light deep diving / sushi management game . the story is overly simple, and the dialogues feel childish . it's the best game i've played in recent years ."
