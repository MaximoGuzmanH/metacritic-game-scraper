582.Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition,"Realy good game from realy good studio that realy try to make good game not copy others like almost 70% of other studios. Original Sin is a classic turn-based RPG with deep customization, challenging combat, and a fascinating story. It's a must-play for fans of the genre.. Great game. If you like lengthy tactical combat and deep story, this is the game for you. It can be annoyingly currency driven but its quite funny and worth every penny plot-wise. Puzzles are annoying af. Suddenly you interact with something and all of your party dies with no previous warning. You need specific spells and/or skills that are mandatory to complete the game, such as levitate. Which you dont get by the main quest. There is a puzzle that you need to read a book on a bookshelf that is titled ""book"". I dont like the need of playing the game with my cellphone on google 24/7. Game also dont have autosave, so you need to save from minute to minute, otherwise your entire party will die and youll need to play 1 hour of game again.. D:OS is a great turn-based isometric RPG on the PS4. It was crowd funded and a couple of years later a sequel was released which s lauded as one of the greatest RPGs of all time. I've personally put around 80 hours into the campaign and I really enjoyed it. Full disclosure, I haven't completed it, but I am in the last stages of the game. D:OS is really well written, its smart, the characters are unique and have personality. The actual story is a bit naff, I've played better, I've played worse. The reason I haven't finished it is that the gameplay is too slow for the world to be as big as it is, also, there are well documented issues with the quest system. Gameplay-wise, combat is pretty difficult, I've played 79 of my 80 hours on ""Normal"" and have just lowered it to ""Explorer"" to hopefully help me finish the it. Now, normal wasn't too hard, it was just too slow, the turn-based combat just took far, far too long. The quest system, it doesn't hold your hand, the game leaves it up to the player to read the quest notes and figure out what to do next. This still works, but you'll find yourself frequently scrolling through the quest list, reading and re-reading notes to try and figure out where to go or what to do. Its not very intuitive and doesn't really benefit the player at all. D:OS is great, it is, its just massive, slow and complex, I want to finish it, I want to see the story's outcome, but man its a big ask, especially because I want to play the sequel.. This game got me through the pandemic playing online with my friends. Had so much fun with it. Great co-op game.. Definitely a must own game. Beware tho this is an addictive time waster. It is basically turn based skyrim. The premise and generation of the game make it must own but unfortunately I must also point out that there are frustrations; however they are quite easily forgiven considering the gameplay value presented. Beware this game does not hold your hand and on top of that I've stumbled across at least 3 types of software bugs which at times have ruined my gameplay requiring reloading earlier saves (that means also loosing future loot past the save) creating some disgruntled monents. As bad as that can be this game is humongous with excellent variety, loot and strategies given how you can build your party and explore the world openly as to whatever adventure tastes you come up with. Not only is it highly adventurous it's also deeply strategic at a top level. An area the game needs improvement on is npc ai. Way too many quests end by moronic actions of quest npcs ignoring pretty much obvious traps and elemental areas which will cause their demise. Their lack of choosing important targets is also a noticeable problem. Still, with so much available in way of gameplay choices you can deal with this game is beyond outstanding and a must own nonetheless. Patience and building upon your mistakes are key in this game as is intelligence and foresight.. Definitely one if not the best RPG I’ve ever played hands down makes me pumped for Boulders gate 3. After two playthroughs I would encourage everyone to try this game out. Maybe together with a friend (couch co-op or both with separate PS4 is possible). The fight system is interesting and there are so many ways to beat the game. Also the humor in this game is fantastic. For skilled players there is a permadeath mode, which really added some spice to the game.. I played this one after the 2nd game, it's still a good game but definitely worse. The story was interesting at first but after awhile I kinda just wanted to get through it and stopped caring. The gameplay isn't as well done as the 2nd but it's still fun, it gets stale faster though. And I dislike the way the systems for things like skill customization work compared to the 2nd.. I have played this game with my sister and my god was it awesome. I think it took us 90 ish hours to complete it, and we haven't even done everything in this game. Though i think many people might find this game way too long and i can understand them, it is a big game, and is not for everyone. The storyline can be better, at times it was just boring, many quests that i have completed did not count as completed and therefore i got no exp from it, which ****. Game lags a few times here and there, but that did not spoil the experience from it. amazing game, unique characters ( not the main ones), amazing music and very entertaining gameplay makes this game a must for all people who likes RPG. Oh yeah, one more thing, this is not an easy game to play, like not easy at all, you have to read all the bloody letter, and dialogs and be very careful throughout the story line to understand what to do, this game will give you no hints or tell you what you have to do next, so if you are up for a challenge you should definitely try it out.. Given all the rave reviews, I really tried to like it. The combat system is good, the graphics remaster is decent, the music is good, and the back story was interesting. Unfortunately the interface is really clunky, having to click through too many things/menus that make it seem like it wasn't really meant for console. I bailed after 30 minutes or so. I might give it another try on PC at some point.. This is the game that introduced me to the Divinity Series. The game is humongous and there are tonnes of quests to do. I love the part, where you can choose/decide whatever you want, you are free to go anywhere and do whatever quest you want in any order. The fight system is turn base RPG and i just fell in love with it along with the skill system, The music is just fabulous and you can spend huge amount of time just listening to the music while doing these quests. A must play game for me... I would say I am a casual fan of the turn based party CRPG genre. So something like the accessible Wasteland 2 and Shadow Run series is more my thing. I heard great things about this DOS series. So I decided to pick up both DOS1 and DOS2 enhanced editions. The game looks, sounds and plays ok. After several hours of adventuring I kind of drifted off. I just felt like I was in another generic fantasy land that I didn't care or even give a crap about. Not saying games need a great story or great characters. Spent way to much time in Skyrim/Fallout 3/4 to prove that statement true. The exploration factor and loot hooks was enough with those games. Nothing really pulled me in with DOS. Not the story, characters, loot, exploration, combat. I really wanted to like this one and still have DOS2 to try. Pandemic retry and the PS4 version has a annoying audio bug with missing combats sounds. Changing the one of the three audio options in the PS4 dashboard does nothing. Restarting the game was supposed to be the next fix and that is a totally RNG outcome, wtf!? The lack of audio really breaks the gameplay experience. Maybe 6/10 if they ever fix the audio.. Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition( i will call it just DOS: EA) is first from the wave of ""modern CRPGs"". And it was quite revolutionary for it's time, i must say. Is brings interesting story, quest and characters. As RPG it is very good: you can be an altruistic hero or a veeery bad guy. The main disadvantage of the is, as for me, it's tactics. The thing is that it is based on random stunning effect, and you easily complete the game if you are lucky( or ruin if you are unlucky). The second disadvantage is that it becomes quite boring in the end. I thing it is mainly caused by tactics system. Fortunately, DOS Enhanced Edition has fixed most of game's problems, but as it sad, you can't fix what the problem is the game is based on it, so the random stuns during battle is the only think that annoy, So, DOS: EA is a 9/10 game. I can recommend it to everyone, who likes CRPGs, fantasy and all, who love good games.. This RPG has the best battle system I have ever played, an interesting world with tons of exploration and good characters. It starts with the character creation. You can create and build your character as you want without class restrictions. Then there is the awesome battle system. It is so deep and organized. For example: You can use a rain spell to put water on the surface of the ground. Then you can freeze the water to create a slippery ground (Everyone who moves over that ground can fall down. If they fall their turn ends) or you can electrify it, creating a damaging shock field or you can use a fire spell to remove it / created steam that blocks the enemies vision (Steam can also be electrified if I remember correctly). Another example is that you can put oil on the ground (Movement is decreased) that you can set on fire with everyone in it receiving damage and the burn status (Additional damage over time). I want to say that I find the decreased movement more useful than the additional damage for most of the time. It also taught me to look behind damage in spells and abilities. The debuffs and status effects spells / abilities are a useful tool which can change the tide of battle. And this only scratches the surface. You will like the experimentation with combos and different set ups. The crafting system is well done and totally integrated in the game. For example: You read that part above with the slippery iced ground? You can use nails to improve your boots to avoid slipping (I think a similar system is used in real life). You can still just improve only stats. It should be mentioned that you wont learn all abilities or skills in a branch. I advise to read some FAQs or ability guides to plan ahead. The world building and lore in this game is pretty well done. I liked getting more knowledge about the world, side characters etc. The main story is O.K. It is a bit stereotypical but delivers. The main characters are also a bit on the blank slate for you to develop side. However the side quests and side characters are well done. I find their motives, stories believable and interesting. I often got into moral dilemmas. This is also a good point to mention that you can give your 2 main characters a personality at the beginning of the game. This means that they will discuss and question the others decision at many points in the game. They will decide their approach in a mini game (Give small ability boosts to both in different directions) and can prevent you from some solutions / actions (But can be used to boost many abilities in a small but very useful amount). I want also mentioned the tactical game mode which gives you a new challenge in a unique way. In many games this means that the enemies have higher stats and more abilities. Here many battles are rearrange. Example with !!! Minor Spoilers!!! I started the tutorial battle and saw no changes. Then after my turn ended I realized that an additional enemy was placed behind me just outside my view (Had I slightly changed the camera I would have seen the enemy and started differently). Another example is a battle outside the first town. Lightning hits the ground and reawakened electrified Zombies are added to the battle. Attack them in melee combat and you get shocked / paralyzed. !!! End of spoilers!!! Overall this is purely game of the year material. Bonus: Divinity Original Sin 2 is even better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Well, this game is really really bad. I'll start with the good things though. The battle system is crazy good. The amount of things you can do and ways that you can approach a quest or a fight is incredible. Also, the graphics look sharp. As for the bad things, there are a lot. There are plenty of game breaking bugs throughout the game. The story is toothless. The game is aimless and focus TOO MUCH on TOO MANY useless boring puzzles. The difficult spikes are unbalanced and terribly unfair. Sometimes, if you want to do something specific to progess on a quest, you'll need to have a certain skill or an item. They won't warn you about that and if you don't have it, you won't get through. Oh, and if you don't have a mage, you basically won't beat the game. This game won't help you at all and objectives are never clear enough. This game had everything to be the next Baldur's Gate, but has too many wrongs to do right. I don't recommend this game at all.. Awesome game! Incredible experience, one of the best rpg game that I ever played!. When Shang Tsung beat this game for the first time he said ""flawless victory"". Okay so it's not ""flawless"", but no game is. I wish the game were more difficult, but it is actually very difficult until you get to mid game, at which point it becomes only slightly difficult. That's about all I can say bad about it. The game sure is a unique experience and playing this game co op with my brother was probably the most fun and engaging co op experience either of us has ever had; we played the game through twice. Do yourself a big favor and don't read a gamefaqs while playing it. The game is full of a lot of fun and challenging surprises.. This is a great example of a deep, complex, strategic game with longevity than actually makes you think rather than just run around hitting or shooting stuff. The combat system is really fun, and so variable as to how you take each battle on and the how you develop your characters. Heaps of customisation in the way you do things and where you go in the game. The only criticism I have is sometimes the game is a bit too difficult in trying to follow or figure out what to do next. You can really get lost without a guide to bring you back as if you miss one line or one character, you can be running around the map clueless. Some of the puzzles are really challenging too.. If you're a hardcore player then this could be one of the best games you'll ever play. I am not, so take this review as subjective as all reviews are. What I didn't like about this game was the unbalanced difficulty, especially in the early hours of playing, where enemies range from easy to impossible much too quickly, and reviving fainted characters was far too cumbersome. Also, a selling point of this game is its lack of hand-holding when it comes to figuring out quests and where to go etc., and whilst this may please some, it massively irritated me as they have taken this a bit too far and it can cause you to waste a lot of time wandering around aimlessly. I also wonder if this gameplay element is responsible for people buying the strategy guide or going online, in which case it makes the concept irrelevant if people are just going to look up guides anyway. Having said that, there are some fantastic game mechanics in here. The characters are interesting and the combat is intriguing, like all good RPGs. If you've got the time and energy, I'd fully recommend it. If you're more casual and prefer to breeze through games, then avoid.. This is my first time playing DOS. I played on Tactical mode because I have been playing many turn-based games including XCOM so I think I could take up the challenge. The combat mechanic is brilliant designed. I felt in love fast once I set foot out of city. The Tactical difficulty is merciless and sometimes felt nasty but I still managed. However, once I passed the first area, it became easier and easier. On last area, I mostly won the battle flawlessly in 2-3 turns so it disappointed me a bit. (Except for the final battle though, it was good) The story only interested me at first area but then it kinda got boring in area 2-3. Compared with other rpg games I have played, the story in DOS:EE is average at best. If it is not because of awesome combat, I would have quit half way. On the bad parts though, I think Devs added too many traps. Some puzzles also annoying and take too much time to solve. It slows the game down. I like combat, but not puzzle and traps. One wrong step, your whole team dies, not fun in my opinion. Inventory management is also sluggish. The way you run in the town take too much time. I hope we could run faster outside combat. Voice acting is great though, but most of dialogs are very long, so I usually just read, rather than listen. In sum, I would give 8/10 as a solid score for DOS:EE. I think spent 80-100 hrs to the game , sometimes love, sometimes feel annoyed due to traps. This is clearly not a game for everyone but RPG hardcore turn-based gamers. I will look forward to DOS2 when it comes to console.. DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN ENHANCED EDITION one of the best ps4 rpg and one of the best of all time. Unique, pretentious and fun battle system. Great RPG!. Reminiscent of Dragon Age Origins, but with very well crafted turn-based mechanics. I would like more RPG elements, like a competent story and more character development. Despite being a sprawling RPG, there is so much attention to detail that it's easy to get lost in this world.. This is a very good game that thankfully doesn't hold your hand at all. It is filled with player choice and the game requires you to use your brain and not your reflexes which is how almost every other RPG is. It is filled with exploration, wonder and a great combat system.. I really was excited about this game. The world is interesting, the gameplay fun, the story enjoyable. I started my first game and made it into town despite not knowing what I was doing, but I couldn't move on with the main quest because despite doing everything I found in the walkthrough, I never got the option to make the arrest required for the story. Ok, fine. I'll start over, maybe I did something wrong, even though I looked up every guide I could find... This time I'll start with the right skills and it will be awesome!! Fast forward to the big orc battle outside town, I win and... wait, what? I can't even get inside the town this time?!? Ok, forget this game.. I feel bad but score must be low, this game is really boring at most of point. I wanted to play it all before review here but i can't. But i played long enough to have an opinion (got into second location, luculla forest or something like that), plot is awful, most of the game is turn based fight and moving through the city (and hunting for good spells), bosses are a challenge but nothing interesting at all (and sometimes they are hard enough to be frustrating so a lot of players use ""terrain cheat"" like blocking enemy with barrels. IMO game is overhyped but i'll increase my note because of some pearl quests and amazing idea name for ""pontius pirate"" (it's so great name for paper RPG character), if u are new in this type of games, better try planescape torment baldur's gate both EE or tyranny/pillars of eternity expedition vikings if prefer newer games.. Oh such a sweet couch Co-Op game, with a fun playful story that doesn't take itself too seriously but begs to be completed. A game bursting with fun little details that shows the attention to detail and love of a thoroughly competent team; no shortage of easter eggs here. Never been a fan of turn-based combat, but they done pulled it off quite well. A throwback to isometric RPGs but with a Diablo 3-like graphics and a refined combat system. For RPG fans hankering for loot and level-ups, and a wonderful quirkiness you'll fall in love with; grab a remote and a buddy and get ready to sink 100 hours into this gem, you'll be glad you did.. I enjoyed this game, but I am actually kind of surprised by the rave reviews that professional game critics and users are giving the game. Yes, it's pretty good, but I personally can't give it more than an 8. The characters and story were very bland in my opinion. I wasn't a fan of the cartoony graphics either. The game can be EXTREMELY difficult at times (I played on the hardest setting, Tactician mode, and I died a LOT), but I appreciate a challenging RPG! So this was a good thing! I would never DARE play Honour Mode (where your entire save game is over if you dies once). What I DID like about the game is two things: 1.) there is a good amount of humor in the game, which I found funny at times and appreciated, and 2.) most importantly, the turn based combat is AWESOME!!!!! That is what kept me coming back for more. The story and characters didn't interest me, but I managed to push through the entire game on tactician mode (the hardest difficulty) because I loved the strategic, turn-based combat. It took me approximately 115 hours to beat the game and do almost everything (I used some guides I found online to make sure I didn't miss anything - the developers didn't make a strategy guide for the game). If you like very difficult, strategic, turn-based combat in your rpgs, you will enjoy this game. If you play rpgs mostly for the story, you will probably be bored.. Quite good crpg, combinations of magic elements and enviroments was awesome. Possibility of talking with every animal caused moral dilemmas. Not big fan of design level and atmosphere, too many jokes and references to our society. And typical problems with '""pc games""- total mess in inventory, hard to aim npc (especially while moving) if same button was responsible for interaction with other objects like buckets (steal) and technical problems including unloadable save files, disaster to play hardcore mode if ONLY ONE AVAIABLE SAVE SLOT can be corrupted.. Pros: couch coop (forced/optional split screen), character appearance and full class customization, fantasy + dark humor, entertaining dialogues and voice acting, multiple quest consequences, great story, great music, complex battle and game play design, long play time Cons: at normal/classic level (fights begin to be easy mid-game - if you've immersed early on and understand the game mechanics), helmets can't be hidden. The saving system is an embarrassment and a disgrace. The autosave feature is pathetic. It will only save in certain locations. You could go hours without an autosave kicking in. The first time I died I lost an hour of gameplay because the autosave was that far back. That was really annoying. The second time was just now, where I lost 2 hours of gameplay. I accidentally shot my party with a fireball and Madora got angry and left the party. Expect things like that on a regular basis too, all these weird situations coming up that leave you wondering what kind of drugs the game designers were on when making this game. The autosave is inexcusable though. In modern days you can set autosave on a timer that goes off according to what you set it at - 5 mins, 10, 15, 30, whatever you like. Is there some drugged up expectation on the part of the game designers for players to lose hours of progress, then have to repeat what they just did as if it'd be fun the second time, simply because the autosave system is utterly useless? I don't feel like running the same dungeon I just ran for 2 hours just to get back to where I was. Is that unreasonable of me? No. Its boring and a waste of time. Tip to game developers. Don't waste peoples' time please. I don't think I'm going to play this game again. I don't think this game deserves anything other than a 0 for botching something so basic - effective autosaving.. This game went completely under the radar for me. I wish I played it earlier. If you're at all a strategy RPG fan, I think this game is definitely worth checking out. One thing that surprised me about this game was the level of detail. The voice acting is superb. The detail of the world is awesome; I spent most of the game in the max-zoomed out camera view but would zoom in to absorb some of the stylized details. A lot of the previous reviews are correct about how it can feel slow-paced at times and seem like you're not getting anywhere. To anyone that feels that way, I highly recommend sticking through it (especially the beginning missions). To any newcomers -- Be patient with the inventory system (you'll eventually get the hang of it), read the Log, DONT SPREAD YOUR STATS TOO THIN, SAVE A LOT -- You'll have to LOAD A LOT, remember that you can trade with almost every NPC in the game, and from there, I think you'll see why it's a great game. As stated already, the game IS challenging. This is what re-loading games is for. You'll be swarmed by status effects early. If you're a casual gamer, this is definitely not for you. I look forward to seeing how Divinity OS 2 turns out and am crossing my fingers that PS4 port is in the works!. This game is a real headache. Complex, loads of reading and really deep systems involved. I got it on the back of absolutely loving Wasteland 2 and Xcom 2 and was hungry for more strategy RPG type games. This one is nowhere near as accessible as the afore-mentioned games and has driven me a bit mad. Takes hours of reading unless you want to get destroyed or end up with the wrong builds and skills. It's still a good RPG but a bridge too far for me- I played ten hours and then had had enough. I will get back into it someday as it looks good in a lot of ways- locations, exploration looting etc but be warned- its not for the casual.. my god this game is terrible. There is a good kind of ""hard"" and this is not it. This has got to be the most hyper specific, nit picky, obnoxious game I have ever played. Micro management is annoying as hell, game is linear to the point of boredom. Very little actual choice making, terrible story. Impossible to level grind and incredibly easy to get stuck, even perma-stuck. I'm a huge fan of RPGS and hard games but I would not reccommend this to anyone besides those who love old school hyper difficult and cryptic games. Truly one of the most aggravating games Iv'e ever played. Dark souls veterans, Tactics fans and old Diablo heads will find themselves in hell playing this game. If you enjoy this game, you are a sick person, and I'm shocked it has such good reviews.. MY KINDGOM FOR A DRY SHIRT! Definitely the best underrated game of 2015. Pros 1) Great game play with some in depth physics engine. 2) Branching skills which you can develop. 3) Great characters 4) Intense game play Cons 1) I have to admit that the reading thing can be boring despite the voice over. 2) Subpar animations 3) Poor console port. The PC UI was better. Overall it's a great game. I will definitely buy Divinity 2 without a second thought.. Games supposed to be fun. Maybe in 1980-90 from when i think this game from it supposed to be some other way, but it is 2016 now. I was a fan of Baldur's Gate yada yada yada, That was primarily the reason i waste my money on this one. The problem is not in that Divinity isn't like old times, the problem is that it is exactly like the old times - in one word: UNFORGIVING, even on moderate level of difficulty + it has some unique rules. Trust me, if you liked Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and so on when you were younger 20 years ago it is questionable at best that you will like it now. I can force myself not to notice computer cheating in dialog challenges (same choice of 1 answer 5 times in a row have actually 0.03125 probability and it happened multiple times). I dont understand why characters moving like they are in slow mo, but ok. I can face unlimited number of explosive mines placed and other traps that are put in this game everywhere for god knows what reason. But when after hard fight and 30 seconds after the win the stage erupted and killed everyone in party.... NO WAY! I quit and not because i cant continue, but because i literally dont want to give another second of my life to this stupid torment (also it wasn't the first time it happened ether). It really was my worst experience on PS4, hell - one of the worst and frustrating experience ever and i played games from age of 7 - for 31 year. From the book ""1001 game you must play before you die"", i played about 850 of those on ZX Spectrum, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Game Boy Advance, PC, PS 1 2 3 and 4, Sega Genesis, PSP, Vita and so on.. Great rpg game with plenty of challenge. Well balance and great story line. Everything anyone could ask for in an isometric rpg game. Highly recommended.. It's a totally fun game, especially with a friend. The only things that are lacking are a clear sense of direction, a pretty ruthless difficulty (which I did find fun, however), and a cumbersome interface. I can see causal gamers HATING this game, because it doesn't tell you where to go with a marker; you have to figure it out for yourself by actually listening to the dialogue or reading short, in-game books or scrolls for information. For those willing to invest some time, though, this is all about quality and value.. Been playing SRPG, RPG, and CRPG for more years than I'd like to admit, but I dare say, if you have a similar taste, then this game is a must for yee console-gamers (or PC)! There's a lot of exploring that is well worth your time, and the dev. certainly have a profound sense of humor! And I'm happy to say that Divinity Original Sin will have a follow up (thanks to another turn via a successful Kickstarter) which just make me even more happy! Larian Studios, I vouch for thee, and long to see what you'll hand me in the follow up!. Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition New School RPG with an Old School Feel Divinity Original Sin tells the story of 2 source hunters that you get to customize at the beginning of the game, customization is pretty basic so you’ll be lucky to get a character to match your likeness even a tiny bit These source hunters are out to solve a town murder, but while solving this murder they’re sent down a path and realize they need to solve something much larger than this. Before you play this game, you need to be self-aware with the kind of gamer you, because while this game is fairly new, the way it’s delivered isn’t. Don’t expect a top down Skyrim… I was reminded many times of Pokémon, in the sense that every city you go to has its own story that still connects to the main story.., you set out on a journey and that’s it, you’re on your own, see you later or never, the game doesn’t care. It will not hold your hand, other than marking the occasional few important places on your map for you to go check out This is a 60 hour journey that you’ll need to figure your way through. And the only way to do this is to listen to the conversations… At first this doesn’t seem like too much to ask, but every character you run into talks longer than your mom does when she bumps into somebody she knows at a grocery store, I’m almost certain 15 of the 60 hours was spent sitting through dialog.. You can skip through any and all, but this isn’t advised as again, it’s the only way you’re going to figure out where to go to next, you have to literally immerse yourself into the game world to beat it... you have become your character… That being said, if you don’t have the time or patience to literally almost live another life you’re not going to like this game…. Sure you can follow a guide, but who wants to do that for 60 hours? Otherwise, you’ll find this game to be quite the masterpiece You’re solving mysteries and puzzles, there are side quests that can he","original sin is a classic turn-based RPG with deep customization, challenging combat, and a fascinating story . it's a must-play for fans of the genre. if you like lengthy tactical combat and deep story, this is the game for you . the actual story is a bit naff, I've played better, I've played worse ."
583.Injustice 2: Legendary Edition,"Definitely an improvement on the original injustice game. I don't care for either, I hate that there's no real way to block, and THAT DAMN BRANIAC BOSS FIGHT ****! But it's still a good game for DC fans.. A big improvement over the original ""Injustice"" and even better than ""Mortal Kombat X"". The fighting engine was overhauled, the graphics are superb and the lineup is strong. This sequel builds upon the formula of the first in impressive ways. There are more combos, levels, strategies and special moves. The story mode is quite entertaining. If you're a DC Comics and MK fan, then you'll love it. Overall, I would rate this with a 9 out of 10.. entertaining game, wish there was a marvel version, but well done from the MK makers. This game is great, plenty of characters to choose from, decent story, awesome gameplay and some interesting challenges. The downside, is the customization system, it is so slow that you end giving it up before getting any character to level 30, missing the augment upgrade entirely.. I **** HATE THIS GAME! To the developers there is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either.

A modern and well done fighting game next to mortal kombat. huge improvements in both storytelling and combat. characters are far better than the first one. hopeful for the third one.. the game looked good felt good to play this game has some amazing Ai but the controls felt realy bad the imputs are easy but usually didn't register but they worked in other fighting games and it is terrible. A very well made game with good character design - fighting wise - and a nice story - for a fighting game. It also has TMNT! The Clash thing is still a nuisance though, one that i hope does not exist in the next game.. Could have been much better but ruined by microtransactions and a Mediocre story that did not need to exist.. This is the premier fighting game for ps4. It’s pick up and play friendly but hard to master. The story is also fun but short. It only takes 5-6 hours to complete, but there’s endless play opportunities in other modes and multiplayer. The game is incredible, has a lot of single player content and is very fun in offline multiplayer with options to match the levels and make everything more competitive. On the issue of the battle arenas there are actually more options then we see but how it is necessary to make the transition move and in the middle of the pressing buttons this is difficult to perform. So they need to improve this system or by taking away the option and thus separating the various places or facilitating this transition to make it simpler. Maybe with a hook like in the Mortal Kombat or at the end of a pre made combo. The system for equipment are tedious, they need to change it.. One of the best DC games of course after Arkham Knight Trilgoy. netherrealm is very good at making fighting games. The story is extremely unique. All the characters have an excellent background. The dialogues and voices are great and varied. I really love the legendary version. Technically improves on everything from the first game - much better graphics, the fighting feels tighter and more fluid, more gameplay options and the addition of gear, while allowing MT's, works due to the way it allows you to personalise your favorite characters. Unfortunately it ends up delivering a far weaker story than its predecessor, which ultimately nulls a major chunk of the improvements. A great DC fighting game, but a fairly poor continuation of the Injustice universe.. Awesome for dc fans and the customization makes this game to be honest, online could have been a little bit better but not bad. This game is great all around. Mechanics, overall graphics, and control is great. I just needed a place to vent about how much I hate playing the green lantern. The absolute worse player in the series to play. Moves are absolutely terrible, have no force and relay no damage to opponent. On top of that, he has a slow reaction time. I dislike him very much but i love the game overall. Finished injustice 1 so i could get to this one right away. You’ll want to in order for the storyline to make sense. Well designed combat, an interesting roster of 38 characters, and a variety of unique modes make this game a joy to play at times.. Great game with great graphics, the story is great, awesome 38 characters, online is very good, best shades that one game can has, beautiful epic gears and legendary gears for all characters in the game and great multiverse.. Worst fighting game ever made. Game **** balls. The story ****. The postgame ****. The AI gets to cheat. It is a cheesy piece of crap game. Do not waste money even on sale. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I get it on a promotional pack and what i say is... the game full of garbage... LUCKY BOX ? yes... they forgot de real fight and at the end the game become a garbage of full boxes that you put IA to play for you... because the armor system **** a lock... very sad, i love the injustice 1 but the second game is not good... i`m still stucked trying get one catwoman hability.... man.... these guys ruined MK11 and Injustice 2.... I enjoy the game play. I love the one on one battles. The story in the game is good enough. Ultimately, I enjoy the mortal combat style of the one on one battles. I don't think Batman is done well, he is overpowered (wait...remind me, what is Batman's superpower?). I like fighting as the Flash, GL, Grodd. I did purchase after the main release, it was $20 by the time I purchased it...thus, at that price, it was 100% worth it!. Loved this game, cannot wait to see what they have in store for 3. DLC characters were alright. Injustice 2 is a great fighting **** only need a better ranked mode and guest characters like The Mask, Power Rangers, Goku and Spider-man......... This is a great game with lots of content and replay-ability. Controls are great but very heavily focused on specials. I also play the MK series and there is more ability to soar and mix up your fight styles in the MK series. Great characters and voice acting, enjoyable story and visuals are excellent. I prefer the MK series fight controls but this is a great game in its i I am right.. So this game looks amazing. My big problem is the microtransactions.. The amount you have to grind to get cool gear is just bs. They want you to pay for them... Im never buying another Injustice game again.. This needs to stop... bought this in a combo with MK11. they are basically the same game, right? both kinda boring. at least there are less microtransactions in this one. and the story mode feels a little longer and more cared for. not terrible, not awesome either. Injustice 2 The legendary edition, I must say I love this game, although I have been pretty critical about the purchase of characters, finally got this full version with all fighters and all downloadable content, fantastic. The battles are dynamic and astonishing, what I would wish Is that the characters had a couple of different superpowers, anyway I love it. The story mode 10/10 The soundtrack 10/10 The character design 10/10 The superpowers 10/10 The scenario interaction 10/10 I will take just one point for the long wait we pass to finally get this amazing game. Thanks Warner Studios.. Injustice 2 is an excellent figthing game, with a great roster, fun, easy to get into but difficult to master combat mechanics, and an absolute ton of value. From a deep and fun story mode, to a ton of modes and content from customization, extras, and fun tidbits, the game really has value for your money and would be an easy recommendation.... BUT.... it really loses points for its dumb microtransactions and loot boxes, and I don't care if IT'S JUST COSMETIC excuse, it really annoys, because everything is tied to the loot boxes and makes you want to keep playing because you can't get the pieces or colors you want for the characters you like, and it takes a very long time to unlock through gameplay unless of course you fork some sweet sweet cash... To be honest, 8 is high for something like that, but the Legendary edition with all the DLC at a sale price gets it a point or so. So can't really recommend, but it really is a good game, just... ugh... hate loot boxes.. The best fighting game to play with your friends. Hollywood worthy visuals, predictable, silly, yet enjoyable story mode and huge variety of distinct characters. The only downside is that fighting online means items vs skill. That's not how it supposed to be. It should only be cosmetic.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. There is a ton of content for people interested in the singleplayer side of things. That is unquestionable. What is a little more questionable is if the core experience is something worth spending a ton of time on. The ebb and flow of combat feels very rigid. The gear mechanic does a lot of damage to the online experience. The graphics are a mixed bag. On one hand, the faces are incredible, and the models look great; however, the attack animations are still an absolute disaster. You have to hand it to NRS, they have given you a lot of bang for your buck, but they are still botching the simple stuff. Also, the DLC characters have been pretty weak sauce (other than the TMNT). Ultimately, you have to ask yourself if tons of content really help justify a game that doesn't feel great to play. NRS is still behind literally every other fighting game developer when it comes to making a game that feels (and in motion, looks) good. I wish I could give this a 7.5, as I think that is what it deserves, but it is definitely more of a 7 than an 8, so my score will have to stand as is.. I normally do not buy fighting games but i did an exception for Injustice 2. i've got to say that i love it so **** is so much fun to play injustice 2. All characters are awesome. I just wish Lobo was in the game instead of Raiden. I do not understand why they chose to add mortal combat character to this game. but this is minor negative and the game is just awesome. I even enjoyed single player campaign, online game is great but many players are tough lol. The game is reasonably easy to learn, this is just a great title. pick it up !. Probably the best DC superhero fighting game in history. - Story is great, superv character modelling, interesting story and performance. - Huge roster, 38 characters with unique styles and awesome guest characters. - Multiverse is the big deal here, always changing with new loot. - Gear system works with good looking items. In general if you like DC, fighting games and loot, there is a high change you like this.. Oh how I long waited for this legendary edition As a whole I liked Some upset that took the game currency by exchanging for coins I do not, I opened the boxes and everything is fine Still I like and I play 10/10","a big improvement over the original ""injustice"" and even better than ""Mortal Kombat X"" the fighting engine was overhauled, the graphics are superb and the lineup is strong . overall, i would rate this game with a 9 out of 10."
584.Fire Emblem Fates: Special Edition,"For comedy's sake, you should see some of the negative opinions of this game, they are so exaggerated and stupid that it is crazy. Fire Emblem Fates may not be perfect, it have its problems regarding some characters, some story bits, and the map design in routes like Revelations (which is definitely the weakest route). But with the several good aspects that it has, it is light years away from being a ""bad game"". The gameplay of this particular game is generally pretty good (and that's saying a lot because the Fire Emblem games have excellent gameplay), the Revelations route undoubtedly has the weakest gameplay of the three with several maps having unnecessary gimmicks.which makes them unenjoyable, but Birthright does an excellent job of having easy but fun gameplay to introduce any beginner to the franchise and Conquest has several excellent maps anda challenging but mostly fair difficulty. As for the story, I will summarize it in a few words, the story of Birthright is actually very decently good,it doesn't risk much but its simplicity makes it work and in this route the vast majority of characters(including Corrin) are likable... The story of the other two routes Conquest and Revelations are much worse, but I even think that those are very over-hated and some of their positive points are unfairly ignored, such as several interesting and likable characters. In conclusion, Fire Emblem Fates may be one of the weakest Fire Emblem game, but it is still a very great game in general, with the enormous quality that most games in the franchise have, this undoubtedly falls short, but by the standards of JRPGs and video games in general, this is not a bad game at all. Pretty recommendable in my opinion.. For comedy's sake I want to split this review into several parts and make people pay for each part, only to reveal literally none of the parts were worth the price of admission and make a complete story in isolation or when combined, but that would take more effort than this deserves.. An installment that mechanically is flawless, surpassing Awakening but is weighed down by a nonsensical story that includes many of the worst characters in the series and excessive fan-service.. Just play Awakening this game is kinda doodoo. Story is lame, characters aren't too interesting, please Just play Awakening. Easily my favourite of the three 3DS Fire Emblem titles. A massive cast of fun characters, map design that ranges from decent to excellent, with only a few outright “bad” maps, and a massive amount of character customization and replayability. Want Odin to go absolutely insane? Reclass him to a Samurai, promote him to a Swordmaster, reforge a Killing Edge, and give it a long name. Now Odin is landing crits for days! With three different routes, no two playthroughs are identical! However, despite the incredibly fun gameplay, Fire Emblem Fates has a poor story, which isn’t good for an RPG. However, from a purely gameplay standpoint, Fire Emblem Fates is a great game that should be tried out by anyone looking to get into the series. Sadly, it can no longer be obtained legitimately, and the DLC is no longer obtainable.. An installment that mechanically is flawless, surpassing Awakening but is weighed down by a nonsensical story that includes many of the worst characters in the series and excessive fan-service. It tries to replicate many of the things that elevated Awakening but fails miserably because there is no back-story to go with it.. placeholder for now. fe fates has many new concepts which are used in fe echo and fe3h. I was amazed by the portrait improvements intitially. New weapon classes, a ""zoom in"" look, a ""nexus"" to idle between fights rather than just being a spite on a map or a menu. Also, the idea of expanding on the typical fe plot to date - X is special because (nobility). Evil people come and do evil things - i need to stop them. I stop them. They were manipulated behind the door by inhumans (insert dragon or other thing). Beat thing. Title card. Don't get me wrong - best s*** ever, but damn was it repetitive. This game went out and was like, there are two houses! Fight gogoogo. I think the idea was special and was built upon in fe3h. Cons: The bizzare and repeating sounds for every textbox was very infuriating. I thought the class system was inferior to prior games. The difficulty was not, imo, fine tuned in fe standards. the grinding by doing non main story quests was pretty weird imo.. The best version of Fire Emblem Fates; compared to the other 3 (Conquest, Birthright, Revelation). The special edition is the only 3ds cartridge that has all 3 plot lines physically. And instead of having to buy them separately. So you're adventure will actually give you a choice of 3 options. Zero complaints about this game; perfect 10.. Play Conquest and Birthright before playing Revelations and it's a fundamentally good game. The first two paths set the foundation and develop the characters, and then Revelations builds on that and ties everything together. emotionally compelling, semi voice acted, well-written games, finally bundled together as they should have been.. the story is complete trash and the biggest twist was finding out they allowed incest in a first party nintendo game. the levels are pretty good, but because of the abysmal story, bland characters and the most irritatingly generic protagonist it was hard to continue caring at all. i ended up getting bored after the first route and sped through the game with phoenix mode. And lets be honest, we only played conquest because of camilla's giant honkers. which i suppose makes it worth it. otherwise nah.. This is a perfect example of how a game can be ruined by inept idiocy of a localization studio, who thinks they know better than original creators, so they rewrite entire script to make it ""funnier""... in turn making all characters into complete meme-spouting morons. Only reason it's not getting a 0 is because gameplay is still fine. Nonetheless, definitely the worst Fire Emblem to be ever released.. Great graphics and story, especially for a 3ds game. I would highly reccommend.. Amazing, very amazing, the best Fire Emblem game in my hearts. I played all three games. The best game of the three is revelations cause its the only version that offers a complete story with almost no plotholes. The gameplay is what i expect from a fire emblem game and the maps are diverse and interesting. birthright is bland and easy but does not overstay its welcome. Conquest is better on the story but gameplay needed big adjustments cause phoenix mode is just a giant band aid for its inherent bigger gameplay problems. The only game that felt truly complete was revelation but that was dlc. Fates biggest problem is that it feels like it should have been one game and there were tell tale signs it was like the fact YOU GO THROUGH THE SAME 6 CHAPTERS IN ALL THREE GAMES BEFORE MAKING A DECISION ON YOUR CHOICE. literally this should have been one game from the beginning that becomes so much clearer when you beat it. Honestly this is the messiest fire emblem game ive ever played and ive beaten raidant dawn which is a pretty messy game but still holds up. I think that this is the worst set of modern Fe games that has come out. Its not bubsy 3d bad no not many games can come close to but its disappointing in how bad they were. Birthright: way to easy but at least way not that hard to complete so it never stayed longer than it had to but pretty basic story but had big plotholes. Conquest: decent story but too many big plotholes and gameplay was a catastrophe where it needed more work instead of using phoenix mode as a quick fix. (this game will burn you out hard) Revelations: best of the three decent map design, balanced units and a decent story but too many units but is the one i had most fun with because it was the most balanced. Overall: Play revelations cause its the real story and the one your are going to enjoy the most. birthright is too easy and conquest is too difficult but there are inherent problems that needed to be fixed for it to have been good. (The special edition also shows that yeah this could have been all one game but they chose not to which shows why certain parts of the games are so unbalanced.) its a 6.5 out of 10 its mediocre. 9.1/10, it succeeds. It's not as good as Awakening, however it's still great.. For a while i thought Fire Emblem Awakening was the best fire emblem game, even during my playthrough of Fire Emblem Fates, But going back to awakening I realise how good Fates was. I've played every Fire Emblem game that got a western release, and even a couple of the japanese ones with patch translations, over the last 5 years, and this one is hands down my favourite. First of all, its massive, with 3 different branches to play through. Other Fire Emblem games have had a branch split, but not as many as this one. I prefer the unbreakable weapons, that have positive and negatives, to other fire emblem games breakable weapons, although I think they're both good in their own right. The story in Fates is easily the best one too, most are pretty forgettable, I did enjoy Awakenings time travel story line, but Fates is a much more emotional investment, which honestly is what Fire Emblem is all about, you want to care about the characters, because then it leave you in more of a predicament when they die near the end of a really tough level, do you take the hit or do you restart the level and hope you can do a better job. The most important aspect though, that makes this the best game in the series, is the level design. The level design is so much better than any other game in series, and because there are so many levels this is even more impressive. The rest of the games seem pretty linear in comparison, sure there's the odd memorable level, but the ones in fates are just so well done, your not just having to strategise against the AI, but you're also battling against the changing in environments around you. This isn't just my favourite Fire Emblem game, this is my all time favourite game. I'm not rating this game a 10 to counter balance the negative reviews, this game is 10, period.. Having played fates, I gotta say the game itself is legitimately very, very good, a worthy successor to Awakening. Only complaint I have is unrelated to the game itself: this whole multiple versions thing was an interesting take but I don't think it fits the FE series and overcomplicates it so I hope the next installments are single versions again.. This game was very disapointing to me. It's like Awakening, but worse characters (Peri and Camilla), music, not as fun to make an Overpowered team. It's not bad however, It's a great game (Conquest has some of the best gameplay in the series) But it's just Kinda disapointing. Also the story and writing is just hilariously bad at times.. A great fire emblem game that you should try if you are at all interested in the series, it has great characters, great gameplay and is overall just a good time. I had mixed feelings about Revelations because when I played Birthright and Conquest, I had an idea that the last game would eventually tie up all loose ends for the series of game but what eventually happened fell flat because of its ambitions. Story did not live up to its potential and it even requires a DLC to make sense of why the villian is actually a villian. Gameplay was still amazing though. Not as good as Conquest because of how gimmicky the traps from the dungeons felt like.. I have, at the moment, no time to give a full review on all aspects, or explain why I dislike this game. regardless- Fire Emblem Fates is a disgraceful steaming lump of **** and the most deplorable cesspool of lazy, shamelessly and shoddily slapped together writing with characters more forgettable than a night of heavy drinking. Awakening set up the pinnacle of the art that is Fire Emblem, and Fates is nothing more than the equivalent of a rom hack tailor-made for weebs and to falsely advertise 'player choice'. Any true Fire Emblem fan can say with absolute truth, that this game fails on every level as a Fire Emblem game. seriously- **** this game.. Now i love the Fire emblem series and this installment is no exception but i do have the odd gripe here and there. first off is the new pair up system at first i had everyone separate and was struggling to get people to love each other without dying, at which point i decided that i would do like i did in awakening and just pair up the ones who i wanted to marry and just forget about dual strikes and this made me enjoy the game a lot more as the partnering aspect is a huge part of fire emblem for me. My only other problem was with the story. There are quite a lot of plot holes in all the story lines and the odd deus ex machina which really is Frustrating and whilst I'm moaning if I'm honest Corrin is a little **** and contradicts His/her self all the time. But enough with the bad here is the good. The new battle system is amazing like a said before hated it at first but once you know what you are doing it is quite amazing trying to tactically save a guard to take a big **** with some of the new abilities it makes some of the previously less favourable classes, archers, and allows them access abilities that can make them useful, some even frighteningly overpowered. What the story may do wrong the characters are such a redeeming factor with so many quirky personalities and with such a large character base I'm was truly impressed that they made each and every character seem unique to me. Only kind of problem was in revelations when you are flooded with characters and its impossible to chose all your favorite character but that's just my fault for being to clingy :P The music score is wonderful and when the remixed version of Asura's song comes on during the final battles it really does get you kind of pumped The graphics are very pleasing in the game although there are a few areas which look like they should give you a bonus in def&avoid but is actually in a square beside it. The 3D looks fantastic and the battle animations are great to watch, especially when you hit about 4 different ability triggers! all in all i think this game is fantastic with a few flaws here and there but nothing to make this game not worth picking up 8/10. I feel lucky I could get the special edition with the 3 games inside. First of all, I think this is how the game should've been from the beginning, the two (and then 3) editions stuff doesn't make sense to me. Now I've completed the Hoshido and Nohr paths (and I'm halfway Revelations) I think I can review this game properly. The gameplay is improved from Awakening, which I think it was pretty good, there is some fixes (weapons and abilities that were too broken, like Galeforce) and the fact weapons don't wear out is a great improvement in my opinion (it makes you use more weapons than the ""cheapest"" ones, because there is no fear of losing them, and that is a good thing). The maps are WAY better designed than in Awakening, with more objectives than just ""kill all enemies"" or ""kill the boss"". Anyway, Birthright still abuses of those objectives, but Conquest and, from what I've seen Revelations, do a better job at this. Story-wise, the game is a little step down from Awakening, even when that game didn't have a stellar writing. Child units made sense in Awakening and were an epic thing (children going back to the past to save their parents). In this game it doesn't make sense: they have a child and put it in the Dragon Ball Z training room, and then they come out all grown up. However, I find characters are lovable (design and personality-wise). The worst thing about the game is in fact the localisation. The game is heavily censored and it shows even if you didn't know about the fiasco. I've even made a test by showing conversations to people who don't know about this game, and they felt they were ""off"". English only audio would not be a problem if the dub wasn't so, SO BAD. Seriously, it's soul-less and even seems made in spite. I've listened to the Japanese dialogue and man, it's like day and night. It's a good and fun game, but censoship does it a weak favor. Even with that I'm enjoying it. Fire Emblem Fates special edition is in fact special. Its amazing that at one time Nintendo had considered shelving the series in NA if Awakening failed to sell 1 million copies. To get 3 Fire Emblem games at the same time and getting a special edition no less is special indeed. The box itself is well designed with the artwork you would expect. If you preordered through Gamestop; you even get a set of three keychains. Inside the special edition is single cartridge with all 3 games already on it. There is also a FE:Fates 3DS pouch. The main draw of the special edition is the art book however. The pages have a premium finish to them and come in a gorgeous hardcover. The only criticism I have of the special edition is that fans who weren't lucky enough to preorder don't get the convenience of having all 3 games on one cart. I think I would rather have every copy come with all three games even if it meant paying a slightly higher price up front. On the plus side? Not everyone might be able to afford that so with the split release people can buy the version they want to start with. In the end it all comes out to about the same price. Buying one makes the others a lot cheaper.. (I do not own Fire Emblem Fates: Special Edition. Instead, I have Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright along with the other 2 versions as DLC, I'm posting my review here so I can speak about all three as one game.) SHORT VERSION: It's an awesome strategy game that improves upon its predecessor. My first entry in the Fire Emblem series, as well as a lot of peoples first entry, was Awakening. It was a really fun strategy game with an interesting enough story to keep me playing. Awakening was intended to be the last in the series due to low sales of previous entries, but it's popularity singlehandedly saved the series and ensured the development of a sequel. GAME PLAY: Battles take place on a grid where you control your units individually to face an enemy, heal an allied unit, or wait in place. Due to the strategic nature of these battles, taking on an enemy might often take less than 1 or 2 hits to defeat them depending on how strong your units are. The real challenge comes from HOW MANY enemies and reinforcements you face as well as the obstacles presented on the map. This is where the game's strategy comes in as you decide which units are strong in enough to fight which enemies and how best to deal with obstacles. When you aren't battling, you're given a customizable area called ""MyCastle"". In this mode, you're allowed to create buildings, with dragon points earned after battles, that sell useful items such as weapons and accessories for units. A lot of time can be spent on this mode even after you complete the story. It's worth noting that each version of Fates, along with featuring a different story depending on your choice, has a different difficulty style for different types of players. Birthright is easier and recommended for newcomers, Conquest is harder and recommended for series veterans, and Revelation is a middle ground that's challenging but not impossible. Overall, I'd consider Revelation to be the best of the Fates trio in terms of game-play since it concentrates more on the obstacles on the map so that you can strategize on how to work with them. While the other two versions are still fun, Birthright can sometimes feel to easy and Conquest can feel to brutal. STORY: Your Avatar has been raised their whole life by the royal family of Nohr, having strong relationships with each of their siblings. Later on, they discover that at a young age they were kidnapped by Nohr's mad king Garon from their birth nation Hoshido. At this point, they must choose to side with either their birth family in Hoshido (Birthright), their adopted family in Nohr (Conquest), or refuse to join either side (Revelation). Each side offers an interesting perspective with differing consequences depending on your choice. The story as a whole is a lot more complex then Awakening's plot since it deals the Avatar's feelings on fighting against his family members. However, without spoiling anything, I personally consider Revelation to be the weakest of the three in terms of story (even though I ironically find it to be the strongest in game-play). I feel it doesn't really go in to enough detail about certain things related to the setting and the main antagonist. FINAL THOUGHTS: In my opinion, Fates made a lot of improvements over Awakening. The story is more complex and MyCastle is a lot of fun to customize. For newcomers, I'd recommend starting with Birthright to get a feel for the game play and to see if you'd be interested enough to purchase the other 2 versions.. + Great difficulty level with some amazing level design, its always fair and rewards tactical thinking, and turning off perma death is great for new players + watching your units relationships with eachother develop is rewarding and fun + Replay value, you can play through any of the campaigns again and have a new experience by favouring different units, trying out different romance paths or upgrading units to different classes + 3 campaigns in one package + Emotional story with believable characters... - ...Even if the dialogue is stilted at times. If I did not know I would give the Japanese version of the game 7, but seeing how much remove and change (unfortunately for the worse), I can not give enough. Instead of doing 3 separate medium-quality game, the whole effort could translate properly to make only one track.. Fire Emblem Fates as a whole seems like an interesting experiment from Nintendo and has certainly paid off. The special edition is hard to come by, but you are getting 3 incredible games in one. I still have my issues with each individual version but as a whole, it contains something for everyone, whether it be in Birthright's accessibility, Conquest's challenge, or Revelation's balance between the two.. As a long time Fire Emblem fan, I was really looking forward to this title, especially after Awakening. However, the game feels flat. For one, they nerfed the heck out of Nosferatu, which, I'll admit needed to be toned down a little. But there are other nerfs too, and it feels like the fun has been nerfed out of the game. The whole ""garrison"" thing is unnecessary, time-consuming, and unrewarding. And the romance stuff is just silly. Not to mention, why add same-sex romance if you've only got ONE option for a partner? For the first time in any Fire Emblem game ever, I just stopped playing and didn't go back.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fire Emblem Fates is a great game and a worthy successor to Fire Emblem Awakening in a lot of ways. It improves on some things over Awakening, but there are things that it does worse. The characters, while good, are not as good or memorable as the characters in Awakening were and sometimes they are memorable for all the wrong reasons. They are still very good characters, but they pale in comparison to Awakening. The story is very good and an improvement over Awakening's, tackling subjects like trust, racism, morale and having to decide between bloodline or loyalty, but there is one thing in the story that prevents it from being truly great and i think you'll know what it is when you see it. Then there's the ****'s not great. It's definitely not the worst, but it could have been much better. Though people are taking this way too seriously and saying the game is bad because of it. It doesn't affect the overall quality of the gameplay itself. Fire Emblem Fates does everything else greatly: One of the best soundtracks in Fire Emblem, beautiful visuals (the cutscenes look absolutely stunning, it's incredible how they look), great gameplay and level structure and a well told story. My Castle was a really cool feature and is very accessible to new players to train, get to know their characters and more. It has something for everyone which very few games can say about themselves nowadays. It's one of the better games on the 3DS and of the year and is well worth the price of admission. Just don't listen to those who hate game because of the localization because they have no idea what they are talking about.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Well imma gonna get smashed for this but fire emblem fates is by far the one game I've seen so much hate for such a little thing. Fire emblem fates is one of the best fire emblem games to play right now should you have obtained a Special Edition(Bloody scalpers...) this is the best game to play for replayability. That's the key word here. How much of the game do you really enjoy? It's personal preference mind you, you're entitled to your own opinion but when you give reasons such as the gameplay was good but localization was **** and then 0/10 it defies logic. You did enjoy the game did you? No game in its right deserves a zero because of how its localised it only deserves it if it's a bloody mess **** that doesn't even deserve the right to be played for example bubsy 3D. But I digress fire emblem fates gameplay is the best of awakenings and the past games combined into one and as a long time fan of the series I would actually say play revelation and ignore the rest... But you'd be missing out on 2/3 of gameplay that you didn't play but (Mild Spoiler) I can't stand the plot miguffin they use for Azuras reason for not telling anyone about the kingdom, curse? Really? But that's really the only time I think it went off the path otherwise the game is a solid 8/10 for me and you should try it out if you're new and enjoy tactical rpg gameplay. You never know you might find yourself a new series that you enjoy.. Normally, I would've given this game a nine, but due to the way people are ""bashing"" and giving it low scores, I may as well do what I can to help raise that score. I've been a Fire Emblem fan for quite a while now and can honestly say that it's still as enjoyable as ever and the ""censorship"" in this game has very little impact and is still worth your money. In fact, there are some changes that I really liked. I pre-ordered the special edition knowing that my 3DS was out of room, but I really feel that splitting the game up in three was in a way, hurtful to the experience. The three games do link up from the records hall and even give out some special bonuses, but it's that huge support log (even though you could download the other two to have the same experience). It honestly feels like FE: Fates should be on a single cartridge, but each path is a full fledged game...though I'd say it's a bit smaller than awakening (like 2 or 3 maps smaller per path). I'd rather it have been a 60 or 80 dollar game than three different games. I've completed the Birthright Path and the story is solid, despite the occasional bad voice acting moment. Though it is nothing compared to Path of Radiance bad. The maps are way better than awakening, but I felt that the lack of units with good defense combined with the blown out maps/very few enemy reinforcements over a long period of time, just added up to be a tiny bit tedious. There are a lot of fun maps though so I'd recommend giving this path a shot before turning your back on it. As for conquest, I'm up to chapter 15 and can I just say that these maps are amazing. I've heard the story goes downhill from here, but it's not that bad from where I am now. The maps though. Holy cow! People who played older games will really enjoy this as the multiple objectives and the pressure to always keep moving. The maps feel the right size and the units work well with it. Even on hard-classic, I never felt overwhelmed by the difficulty so far. If you could only pick one path to pick, this is the path to go as the maps are worth it. I haven't played Revelations so I can't judge it, but it seems like it'd be the perfect medium of the two. Anyways, I feel they improved on the Fire Emblem combat in general. Yeah, it feels like that same of fighting system except the position of your characters is much more important due to the pair up system. Adjacent characters can attack together with the partner doing only half a normal attack, or they can be ""rescued"" or combined with another character to have a gauge that blocks attacks when full as well as blocking a partner attack as well. What's more important is that enemies can do this as well which is where strategy comes into play. (If you play the game, this'll make more sense). Weapons are also much better in this game. They are pricier to make up for the lack of durability, but speed is a key factor into which weapon to use. Steel and dual ranged weapons like Javelins have speed reductions while Silver weapons lower your stats. So you won't simply be buying and using just a single weapon for each character which again, I feel is better than the durability system. As for the story and localization, I feel they're just fine. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have taken notice in any of the changes they did if it weren't for all the comments on it. I've played through one story branch completely and done plenty of supports, all of which were pretty well done. There's only been one support that I agree was done poorly, but hopefully a patch will change that one (yes, I'm talking about ""...""). I can also say I feel like this game took a more mature route in doing characters than awakening...which might be hard to believe. Sure there's the lol moments such as Nile's ""secret lair"" but this definitely feels much deeper than awakening. (WARNING! THIS PART OF THE REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS): I will says that Fire Emblem Fates does have its faults. I mentioned before that the branches do hurt it a bit. I like the idea, but I'd rather them consider making a much longer game and possibly more of a Radiant Dawn design if they attempt this again. What they do have works, but each path has it's own faults such as Birthright's lack of engaging maps at points. My biggest gripe is actually the children units. It worked in Awakening and was cool, but...they're reasoning in fates reaches almost idiotic. Apparently you can have a baby that grows into a **** to a time paradox. The maps themselves are cool, but I'd rather of just had paralogues or gaiden chapters unlocked by meeting certain requirements **** paradox children. [Spoilers End here] I suppose I'll end on the DLC. The gold and exp ones are a bit of a disappointment compared to how simple and easy awakening's were, but they work better for conquest (Birthright has scouting to solve this problem...which is better than the DLC). They aren't bad but not worth your money as of right now.. Oh, quit your whining, users. Nothing's definitely wrong with this game. I thought maybe it needs some sort of improvement, but you think you're able to get away with negative ratings? Nope, not at all.. This 0 is for Nintendo allowing scalpers to hijack the Special Edition copies and reselling it for 300% of the retail price. Congrats if you got a copy of the special edition. If you didn't, don't give these scalpers a penny.. Just amazing. So emotional, and well done that I had a really hard time choosing sides.... This game, and Awakenings, stand at the top with the very best, in any console in any generation.. This game gets alot of flack for the low distribution of the SE and all that, but this game is amazing. As someone who didnt listen to the japanese voice acting, or cared to much about the censorship i can safely say that i loved the story and the fun it brought. All 3 campaigns were long enough to warrant replaying, and its challenging enough to definatly give even the hardcore fans somethin","fire emblem fates is one of the weakest Fire emblem games . it is still a very great game in general, with the enormous quality that most games in the franchise have . by the standards of JRPGs and video games, this is not a bad game at all ."
585.Pinball FX 2,"There are much more tables than the original i got all packs so i can play infinetely!!. Granted the physics are off a bit, but it's still allot of fun. Tables are hit and miss, but for the most part, most of them are really fun. While PC/console pinball will never compare to playing on a real machine, from an entertainment point of view Pinball FX2 is a close as it gets. Overall: A great Pinball game and a welcome addition to my XBLA library. Side Note: My favorite tables are Sorcerer's Lair, Mars, Secrets of the Deep, Agents, Nightmare Mansion & Wolverine (heck, almost all the tables are great.). As a fan of pinball, I knew what to expect from a game called Pinball FX 2. Dozens of pinball tables, all original creations by Zen Studios, offer something completely different on every table. Every table has different layouts, different scoring systems, different bonuses and different achievements. There are even tables based on Marvel, Star Wars, Plants vs. Zombies and others. You can also compare your scores to friends and other players, and even participate in tournaments. Not every table is a winner, however. But with such a large variety of tables to buy, pinball fanatics of every stripe should download this game and see what it has to offer.. This ain't your grandma's pinball. The game is very addicting for the ancient pastime of pinball. It blends in the old age pinball with new stuff. While it does have more bells and whistles, the new effects add more functionality which make this game such a joy to play. It can get a little expensive, but is worth it. Everything feels fluid and polished. You are guaranteed to have a great time with friends. The graphics are much improved from the predecessor and the themed boards are really interesting. Who would of thought that Ms. Splosion Man would have her own? I think everyone should at least get the base game for 800 pts which will get you 4 really good tables. They are wildly different even for pinball to keep things less repetitive. To make things even more addictive, they have awards once you obtain an achievement once obtained in the in-game stories as well as a Wizard score that sums up your total from all of your tables.. Well... Pinball, why should I give that a try; its some old archaic arcade remnant right? Wrong, Pinball is a fantastic gameform thats been innovationg for over 100 years. Pinball FX2 by Zen Studios has captured the feel of arcade pinball for your 360. Zen has gotten the physics right where so many vdeo pinball games got it wrong. Not only are the newer tables gorgeous on a big HDTV but PBFX2 has lots of game modes including: local hotseat (where you can play with up to 4 people locally) local hiscore leaderboard, online worldwide leaderboards for all-time and weekly leaderboards for all tables. Split-screen local where you and a player compete to reach a user definable goal. For example, first player to reach 50 million points with a 10% loss of score for any ball you lose; or it could be play for 10 minutes with no penalty. These game setups are available locally or online with up to 4 players. Any friends who also have the game can send challenges in the form of a higher score on a table and you have to see if you can beat it. Your friends score will show up on screen while you play as you get closer to it, creating even more suspense as you try to beat it. There is also a Superscore which is all your scores and all your friends scores combined on a leaderboard. On each table you can choose between 7 or 8 different ""views"" to allow you to see the table just the way you like it. For example, a stationary overhead view of the whole table or you could choose a low angle that follows the ball up and down the table etc. This customization also extends to settings in the ""Operators Menu"" that allow numerous changes such as: changing flipper power, changing the color of the DMD (Dot Matrix Display), adjusting the features on the table making it harder or easier etc. There are 19 tables available with a new table every 6 weeks approximately. Later this year another 4 Marvel tables will be available. Each table can be downloaded and played for a few minutes so you can try before you buy. The main PBFX2 interface is FREE to download (322mb) and each table is around 50mb. If you are just starting out, I would recommend the Pinball FX 2 Core Pack (Rome, Secrets of the Deep, Pasha and Biolab) and also the newer tables like Sorceror's Lair, Mars, Ms. Spolsion Man or Paranormal. The Marvel Pack (Wolverine, Spider-Man, Blade and Iron Man) are also excellent, with Captain America and Fantastic Four available as individual downloads. The original Pinball FX tables (Agents, Exteme, Speed Machine and Buccaneer) have updated graphics but do not generally have as high regard in the FX community compared to the newest tables. Finally, imho PBFX2 is not only one of the best games on XBLA it is one of ther best games on the 360. Highly Recommended.. Some Tables/Sets are great, others are lacking. The Marvel set is pretty much the cream of the crop. I was disappointed in the Street Fighter table. VERY VERY Lacking in Pinball Action. I am now more hesitant to purchase more.. This is the first game I have written a review for, so go easy on me! Pinball FX 2 is a game that has a lot to offer for what I believe is a small price compared to other games on Xbox Live. For starters, there are a ton of tables, they look great, they play great - and there is this really cool in game notification system that tells you when you are close to beating an old score, or a friends high score (I am yet to beat any of them!). Also, this is a game that got my wife playing, which is hard to do. She considers me a lazy guy who should read books instead of play games, but when she saw Pinball FX 2, she wanted to play! Overall, I think PInball FX 2 is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Going to check out the Marvel Pinball tables next.. Let me get right to the point: The physics of this game feel all wrong. If you're looking for the feel of a pinball machine, look towards the outstanding Williams Collection title. Not downloadable, alas, but between having real tables and a much better feel to the game, it's far more bang for a somewhat increased amount of buck. I'm not one who often writes a lot of game reviews, as my tastes and those of a lot of modern gamers have diverged significantly over the passing years. Pinball, on the other hand, is a great love, and it saddens me to see pinball tables all but disappeared outside of conventions or the occasional movie theatre arcade. Pinball FX 2 is inexpensive and easy to get a hold of. It has all the modern whizbangery you'd expect of an Xbox title - tight integration with Live so you can have your bragging rights with your friends. The artwork is superb, the music is well-composed but lacks the life of the pinball machines of yore. The voices are pretty terrible, but who can expect Raul Julia to voice for every table? Still, I can't get past the feel of the game. The ball feels heavy and dead, and the tables are generally far too busy, and the design, again, lacks the natural flow of the games of old. The Williams greats (and their virtual equivalents) were made by people with a love of the art, and it showed. Pinball FX 2 was made by people who clearly had skill, but the love wasn't there, and the end result is a tease of what could have been.. I bought Pinball FX 1 and could never get into it. The physics seemed a little off, the sound effects and graphics were pretty bland, and the whole affair was just a bit off-putting for whatever reason. Pinball FX 2 completely changes that; it's weirdly compelling, and it's got updated versions of the tables I've already paid for from the first game. The ability to trial extra tables is a great idea, and the social aspects are well put-together (and help me realize how horrible my scores actually are). The physics, sounds, and graphics feel more reflective of actual pinball tables, and the whole thing just ends up being more fun. // It's disappointing that single-console multiplayer only works on the new tables, the table sounds still aren't terrific, and the tables don't have as much personality as decent (real) pinball tables, but it's still a great package.. The moderately enjoyable, if a little bland, Pinball FX has been given the makeover treatment and now returns as the flashier, more immersive and more enjoyable Pinball FX 2. Zen has done many things right by addressing the shortcomings of the original Pinball FX while also adding a number of new features, that it's hard to find a reason to not recommend this to fans of the original as well as players who may be new to the video pinball genre. In addition to newly-added multi-player features (local and online play), there is the much-advertised ability to import your existing Pinball FX games into the PFX 2 interface for free, with new achievements to unlock for all the original tables - all the more reason to play them again! PFX 2 gives you an easily accessible and at-a-glance view of all the tables (locked and unlocked) that you have across both versions and is a breeze to navigate through. The only downside of PFX 2 I'd have to say is that even though the tables are graphically better than PFX 1, they are visually darker. This is especially noticable on the imported tables (like Rocky and Bullwinkle) where the areas of the table that only light up once you activate them are now shrouded in shadows instead of being just ""off"". It makes a great effect once the whole table lights up, but until they do, you can't help but feel like you're playing on a table with a couple of fuses blown. But overall, Pinball FX 2 is great upgrade and a worthy addition to the panthenon of video pinball games -- and if you have PFX1 then getting this is a no-brainer.. While I still prefer The Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection due to its perfect execution of real tables, this is still a fantastic collection of tables. It still seems like the ball jumps off the flipper a little too quickly in a non-realistic manner, which is the only thing that is keeping this game from a perfect 10 score. Download it and enjoy!. Pinball FX 2 is not so much a game its a platform. You can download it for free and play trials of any table you want up to a specific point limit. The thing is the game is so addictive you'll need to get hold of as many tables as possible. Anybody who owned Pinball FX can download the original tables for free (and those who purchased the individual dlc for Pinball FX will get those tables free too). It when playing these tables that the differences between the original and this game become apparent. On top of the impressively overhauled and improved graphics, the physics of the gravity on the ball is much more realistic. The four brand spanking new tables are also a few steps up from the original offerings. They're more complicated tables, with more minigames and special fx that you cold ever expect to be on a pinball table, but they never lose realism. On top of the tables there is an nice added social aspect to the game. Get a number of friends who also play pinball fx 2 and you'll get on screen notifications when you're nearing and surpass their high-score. You also have local split scene multiplayer and xbox live multiplayer. All in all Pinball FX2 is a package you can't fault.. If you have any interest in pinball games this is the one to buy. The original Pinball FX was a little disappointing since its graphics and table design were a little lacking. If you compare the old tables to the new ones there is no comparison. Colors and table layout are much better and allow for a much better experience. The game allows you to play those old tables as well so a very good deal. New tables are 200 points each. Try it out you won't be disappointed....",pinball fanatics of every stripe should download this game and see what it has to offer . the game is very addicting for the ancient pastime of pinball . graphics are much improved from the predecessor and the themed boards are really interesting .
586.Final Fantasy Tactics,"The biggest change to the formula is a number of graphical updates to the entire system.. Overall, War of the Lions is definitely a fun play through for anyone that has yet to try the game. It is, quite possibly, the most popular strategy RPG of all time and with very good reason.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this spin off game in the series.. An amazing game that improves on an already incredible game. The cutscenes and voice acting really take the game up another notch and the additional jobs and content are great as well.. It will keep you busy for months to come and is easily one of the most enjoyable games on the system.. This is one of the most in-depth strategy games and touching RPGs ever made.. There are some programming errors on the game that some veterans find game breaking. Any simple moves such as throwing a stone during battle, causes this relatively long slow down.. Althought wrapped in a mediocre package, Final Fantasy Tactics is a stellar game. If Square Enix had spent just a bit more time on the in-game graphics, writing, and user interface, this could have been one of the top titles for the PSP.. With this many ways to organise your team and develop abilities, everyone will find something to suit their style. [Nov 2007, p.123]. The improved version of the best Final Fantasy spin off if not even Final Fantasy game. It was overhauled and improved. There are new characters, 2 new jobs and an expanded the rooster of 24 characters (very welcome for me) a top of more changes I wont summarize here. Of cause it has the same strengths as before the remarkable deep and engaging story full of plots, opposing factions, twists, betrayals and character development. Machiavelli would see them as good students. Atop of that the turn based RPG gameplay works really well. The story actually starts far in the future and is told by historian Arazlam Durai. Your hero Ramza is actually viewed by history as a failure as the last disgraceful member of a high respected noble family while the antagonist Delita the best friend of him is one of the greatest heroes of this age. However the historian has uncovered the truth and you will see how things really happened. The story takes place shortly after the end of the 50 years war where the country of Ivalice has repelled an invasion in a hard and costly war. Now there is the problem that there are more soldier than needed for peace times and it is bad to have this many people who are just good at fighting. Later the event which will be called “The War of the Lions” starts (Both factions leaders have a lion in their crest). This is unfold when the king of Ivalice dies and his heir is just a child (4 years old if I remember correctly). So a Regent has to be picked and this draws a lot of attention by the nobles as who ever becomes regent can rule like a King without interference for a long time. Two factions start to gain momentum and each is supported by many nobles and their armies. This is the start of the story and it works magnificent as our protagonist is drawn into this. There are a lot of schemes, groups and organizations involved and twists. It has a lot of depth, lovable characters, growth and progression. For me and many others it is a masterpiece and often on the list of best plots in RPGs. The characters were also excellent. Ramza is a true hero in a world which eats heroes. He will struggle a lot as his worldviews will be ****. Delita is one of the most interesting characters I have encountered in games. It ends not there as Orlandu, Melladoul, Argath and others all have interesting stories and character development. All the antagonist work well and some are intimidating. So the characters and story are truly good but it would not matter that much if the gameplay was awful. Luckily the gameplay works even better than before but I should warn you that the game is a bit difficult at the begining. It uses the job system that was introduced in Final Fantasy 5 but with adaptations. Each character has a job class (that can be changed). These have abilities you can unlock with job points. Each action rewards you with some job points and you level up the job level too. This unlocks other jobs if you meet the conditions. There are the usual Knight, Black Mage, Priest and Summoner but also Arithmetic, Samurai, Ninja and more. Some characters have unique jobs that cant be learned. Abilities are divided into categories. You have 2 slots for usable abilities, a move ability, a support ability and a reaction ability. A lot of fun comes from combinations of different abilities and some combos are impressively efficient. I give some advice: Squires JP up ability is immensely useful. You get more job points for each action. Monks have some great abilities. Critical Restore HP heals you when in critical condition and this can be annoying for your enemies and there is a preemptive counter. It worked well for me but I read that others evaluated those as barley working. Possibly because for physical abilities you need a high brave value and for magic high faith (Beware too high faith and characters leave). Back to the advice. Ninjas have an ability to use 2 weapons and Dragons can ignore heights. I end this here. Of cause there are more like heights, terrain, speed, brave, faith, class restrictions and more. It has a lot of depth as you have to learn a lot of the mechanics but it is rewarding. I recommend a guide as some things are hard to figure out. Of cause there are side quests, hidden characters, hidden items, secret abilities, recruitable monsters and poaching. While I view it as 10/10 game it has a few weaknesses. Firstly there is a battle which is nearly unwinnable if you do not know it is coming at Riovanes Castle. Many used 1 save file and their playthrough ended there. With the right abilities it is really easy but you will not have those and cant leave. Not all jobs are equally good. Like I said the beginning is a bit hard. The presentation is excellent and I would buy an artbook. The soundtrack is one of the best I encountered in gaming. Overall this is an improved masterpiece and should belong to the library of each RPG lover. A classic made even better.. This game is amazing. Every negative review is garbage, I've read every single one of them and those reviews are trash. Do yourself a favor and play this game now.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has no value in the modern SRPG field. Issues include: 1) The worst thing about this game is the AI. You often have guests - friendly AI controlled characters - on your team that screw up everything. For instance, one of them ran into a doorway, behind which was almost the entire enemy army. He was a strong fighter, so I positioned my White Mage behind him to heal why he fought. I healed him, it came to his **** he used a potion on himself (to restore about 15 of his 78 hit points) and ran away, leaving the enemy army against my White Mage. Horrendous. 2) You place your characters on grey square tiles before you even get to see the map. Random enemy placement often results in team members being in less than ideal positions. 3) The camera is horrible. It works off the four angles of the board, so if an enemy is in between walls in the middle of the map you usually can't see them. Worse, you generally have to exit the command menu to actually control the camera. 4) There's no easy way to check the turn list or AOE on enemies attacks. You have to exit the command menu, bring up another menu, find the character you want and click on them. This really slows games down, as enemies will often charge a spell within two seconds, so you're checking every move to see where you can and can't move and wondering whether they've locked the attack to the unit or tile. The enemy always knows what you've done, but there's no way for you to know. 5) It's impossible to keep your team alive. Phoenix Downs restore a random amount of health, which is always less than a single hit from an enemy. Trying to restore an ally to health usually results in the death of your healer. 6) Enemies rank off your highest level character. The game's tutorial suggests you keep a balanced team, but it's impossible when in one mission your entire army dies. You go to town, hire new warriors, find a random battle, and then die instantly because the enemies are 8 levels higher than you. I honestly have no idea how this was ever considered any good when it was released, but it certainly isn't any good now. All the Fire Emblem games are basically the same gameplay wise, but they are infinitely better than this. The same goes for Jeanne D'Arc, the Disgaea games and Tactics Ogre. I would never recommend this game to anyone. My biggest regret is assuming it would be good and buying it off the PSN, since I can't return it.. This stuff aged poorly. Clunky menus, terrible (truly terrible) AI, confusing class system (they did SO WELL in FFTA) and the story is indeed old by now. I was searching for another fft games aside from ffta and ffta2, but this one got me bored in like maybe 2 or 3 hours. Terrible.",war of the lions is an improved version of the best Final Fantasy spin off if not even Final Fantasy game . cutscenes and voice acting really take the game up another notch and the additional jobs and content are great as well . there are some programming errors that some veterans find game breaking .
587.NHL 11,"Decent hockey game. I do enjoy the promise of this era of EA hockey titles. It was before I found out they were good with just dragging their feet on putting out good products.. I'm very surprised by how many positive reviews I've read on this site already. It's not that I haven't seen any negative user reviews, but didn't see any from the actual critics who usually go much further with their critiquing. This game just feels sluggish and slow compared to last years game. It's not that there aren't any improvements at all to the gameplay. Hip checks are a nice, realistic addition to the game that had been missing for many years, but even better than that I noticed was the improved puck physics. I don't know if anyone else noticed, but it was practically impossible to lift the puck any higher than the goalie glove even while he was in the butterfly in last year's NHL 10. That can significantly diminish your chances of scoring on certain breakaways, penalty shots and shootout attempts depending on where the goalie slides and/or which side you commit to first. Anyway, these improvements just aren't enough to outweigh or counter how much different the speed of NHL 11 is compared to last year's 10. Also, the addition of the pressure sensitive passing is also somewhat realistic and gives you control over how hard/fast you can pass the puck to a teammate, but it just doesn't feel right with how the skating flows. Your players move slow enough that it's just all too easy to get drilled before you can get the pass off, and this is extremely frustrating when you have an obvious player to pass to for a huge scoring chance but is denied and is all for not despite his perfect positioning for the nearly developed play. I also like to note that there is finally a an advanced faceoff feature that involves bodily position as well as timing a quick pass off the bat with the right thumbstick which we've already been accustomed to in previous titles. Despite these key four additions to the series, It's arguably just as much of a step backward than it is forward, and for someone like me who doesn't buy the games year after year, this is one of the reasons why.. The physics and gameplay I'd put in the B to B+ range, same with the in game commentary and music. However, that all gets dragged down by an economy size F grade regarding an extremely glaring bug, along with EA's refusal to fix it: How can you have two decades of licensing to make video games for the NHL, and be completely incapable of getting the points right for the standings in Be a Pro mode? How can your playtesters miss the fact that the game fails to record the single point earned for an overtime loss? And how can your company then refuse to fix that bug despite making two patches that fix other aspects of the game? One point for an OTL, EA. --- It's in the game.. NHL 11 is EA's greatest son. The graphics are flawless and as I say every year 'How can the graphics get better?' but they can. Gameplay is brilliant and gets more realistic every year. with the new game engine. Alongside FIFA and Madden you would think this would be hard to compete, but to say this is the best hockey game ever is an understatement. This is the best sports game ever is more like it!! Excellent 10/10.. Hockey represented as well as I would want it to be. It feels real, looks real, sounds real, plays real. I love hockey video games more than the sport itself. Would be a 10, but I reserve that score only for a ground breaking revolutionary game. The improvements from the last EA NHL are minor, but, you have to move with the herd if you want to challenge the online community. There is a ""10"" worth of fun to be had here though. The multiplayer servers seem be randomly out of comission for online team play sometimes (probably the true minor irritation that keeps me from scoring it a 10). More long term appeal than possibly anything else out there. Bottom **** you like video game hockey (who doesn't!), this is the crown jewel to date.. EA has gone and done it again. Every year I say to myself ""You are not buying another NHL game"" and I now own NHL 2003 straight through to 2011. I played it at a friends house before buying, and the addition of the faceoff engine, more realistic body checking, better shooting engine, goal reviews, broken sticks (and the list continues) left me needing to buy this game. Now in my third season, I still love picking it up and playing a few games before goin' to bed.. Honestly NHL 11 didn't bring anything new to the table besides ultimate team. Graphix are the same as 09 and 10. How ever don't get me wrong i probably play it every day but the only reason i bought it is because every one abandoned EASHL in nhl 10 because they wanted nhl 11. So the game didn't blow my mind or anything but it is fun. Overall: worth getting. Since the release of NHL09 the EASPORTS hockey franchise has seen very little in game-play updates and lingering bugs from the previous titles are still present. The new feature for this year is Ultimate Team mode and is basically the only new game mode addition to the game. Similar to FIFA and Madden in years past you use playing cards to build an NHL team, salary cap compliant of course, and then take this team online/offline to complete in games/tournaments. You even need training cards and coaching cards to keep your team competitive. You must sign players with contract cards. You earn EA pucks by playing games and can spend them on all these necessities. This all sounds good in theory however there are a few issues. For one you must be connected to EA servers to play even offline against the CPU. This is a problem considering the state of affairs the EA servers are currently in. It's virtually impossible to play for a few hours and NOT got disconnected. The EASPORTS official forums are littered with similar complaints. Here's the issue: When you get disconnected, you receive a loss. Many people report 1/4 games they will lose connection. This very much so ruins the competitive nature of the game. Second to consider is that when you usually lose, you get 300 EA pucks or so instead of the usual 500 pucks for winning. When you lose connection... you get 0 pucks. Consider that every player has a contract length and you can see why this becomes a problem, especially for the people who have this happen in 1 of 4 games. The second issue with HUT (and this applies to all forms of versus mode too) is that the team who deserves to win does not often enough. There are 3-4 ""go-to"" plays in the game that if you setup, all game, you will likely win. However if you attempt to play normally, like real hockey, trying all sorts of plays to simulate the sport... you will find yourself many times with twice as many shots and twice as much time on attack as your opponent, yet losing 2-1. In hockey this can happen, however in NHL11 this happens far too often. It takes away from the competitive nature of the game knowing that no matter what you do, if you don't setup the same 3-4 plays you know work almost every time, you might as well just toss up a coin for who's the winner. Moving past HUT let's take a look how the AI. Once again little to no improvement. The good is that they challenge you a lot more defensively. The bad is that they still setup almost nothing offensively, only to match your goals with the 2-3 times they actually do something right. I've tried making the game the most difficult it can be. They are still not competitive. You'll be in their zone all game, 28 shots, 3 goals for... 5 minutes left in the game, they'll get 9 shots on your net, double their time on attack in a matter of minutes and match those 3 goals. That is the game's idea of increased difficulty; having the AI cheat with puck control and score goals at will, after not being competitive all game, just to keep the score clean. If you are new to the franchise you might be able to enjoy the offline play on lower difficulties, however if you are an experienced hockey gamer you will find yourself dominating the AI on all difficulties only to have them randomly tie up games with 2 minutes, over and over again, out of no where. Let's move on to the final part of this review: The game-play This is what the game is renown for, the main reason it's won dozens of sports game of the year awards. I am sad to say it's not really fixed from last year. Improved however, to some degree. There is a new physics engine for hits that truly makes playing online fun again. The hitting engine is not realistic but it is entertaining at that. Also, no more bouncing off people, not often anyways. They've also fixed the stick lift so it's more realistic. They've added in a manual one-timer which is useless but neat. Finally the new passing system involves you having to charge your passes and aim them properly now. Good in theory but could use some tweaks. Overall the gameplay is improved and rather entertaining. The game truly shines playing casual games offline with your friends. However taking this online, into the online team play mode that the game is renown for, is more hit and miss. Over the course of your first 150 games you will unlock various player cards, boosts and equipment that will increase the attributes of your online character. However once a user has reached their max unlocks, they can build their player up in a manner that gives them an advantage over most other users. Stats such as puck control, agility, balance and hand-eye can be put to 99, making it overly difficult to pull simple, properly timed defensive maneuvers against them. This can combated with other stats, yes, but that requires you to also have your player maxed out with unlocks. Much like MW2 was, OTP and EASHL is only truly enjoyable as a veteran of the game.... Many won't give it a shot simply due to the lack of major hockey following in the US, but please do yourself and at least give it a try. It is one of the tightest and most polished sports games I've ever played, and truly embodies the cliche ""easy to learn, tough to master."" I've been playing this game almost every day since it came out, and I'm still uncovering new tricks and strategies to employ. That being said, someone who's never played a hockey game before will have no problem picking up all of the basics after just a game or two.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. NHL 11 is easily the best hockey game ever made, continuting the tradition of improving on what has been a solid franchise by EA Sports for the past few years. The variety of game modes gives you plenty of ways to play, and the on-ice gameplay itself is unrivaled in both realism and enjoyability. That said, there are small glitches here and there that are really all that keep this game from being called perfect. The occasional glitch or awkward (and sometimes outright bizzare) action taken by your player when you're attempting to do something else can leave you pretty frustrated, and the passing mechanic could stand to be improved, but this is clearly as close as anybody has come to replicating the wonderful sport of hockey.. This is the best NHL yet. Great graphics, unreal hits, and awesome physics. Every time I play, I am thoroughly entertained from when I pick up the control to when I put it down.. I thought the game was excellent. I'm not really a big fan of the HUT mode, though I do see it's appeal. While in 2010 I was strictly a versus player (and I got pretty damn good at it), after playing the EASHL alot more, I rarely play anything else. It is very addictive. To those that say they can't score or pass properly; that's ridiculous. Ultimately, if you want a game that has no learning curve and will satisfy your gaming needs, go play pinball.. This is simulation not arcade. Without a doubt the best NHL / Ice Hockey Game ever created. The real time physics engine is awesome as well as teh new faceoff system. This is the closest any game has come to the real thing. Don't expect to pick up the controls and score easily, you need to work for your goals especially on All Star and higher levels. Well done EA.. As an on and off player of this franchise since the mid 90s, I was disappointed with most aspects of the game outside of the graphics. The opening sequence adds 5-10 minutes of work when all our group wanted to do was play head to head. The controls and game play were more troubling. The stating is slow, the passes are hard to control, and scoring touch very hard to find (we played 4 games and score 5 goals combined). Remember delivering exciting bone crushing checks - gone (unless it the computer lays the hit), Remember exciting one-timers - gone. All these are aspects my friends and I loved in NHL 07, can we please go back in time? looks like they made a game to thrill programmers and industry folk, not end users like us.. It's the best Hockey game to day, and it may be the best sports game to date. The graphics are outstanding and the new game engine is amazingly real. Ulitimate team is the best new mode since they started Be A Pro mode, and the new Be a GM is deeper than ever. The only down fall of this game is the AI of the goalies that still let in ""curve"" shots and are really easy to beat short side on a deke. Other than that this is a must get for any hockey or sports fan.. I'm Kaber-gasted! See what I did there? It was like a Leafs/NHL reference. But mixed in with the word â. NHL 11 has improved in terms of the hitting physics and the new face off system has provided with more meaningful game-play whether its in your end or the other team's end. The Hockey Ultimate Team is a neat edition but I game up on it when I got disconnected from the servers and it counted my game as a loss. Overall NHL 11 is just a roster update with new music, but at least EA Canada is still making great NHL games and hopefully it continues in the future.. I am not sure what to give this game. On one hand, the visual aspect of the game is incredible. The fans all stand out and eat popcorn and the ice looks amazing, the players are all pretty good as well. The music sounds good, but most of it is pretty lame, I guess that is debatable. The announcers are pretty bland, there is no humor in what they say, and they repeat a lot of the things they say quite a bit. There are a ton of modes, and online seems to work ok. But I did have trouble navigating and trying to find things I could edit easily. The huge problem I have is the complexity of the controls... and that I personally could not customize them. Clearly sports games are not for your girlfriend, or your parents, not anymore anyways, but it would be nice to change your control scheme. I am sure I am noobing up and that there is a way, I sure couldn't find it though. The controls are sluggish at best, and honestly ruin the whole game for me. The whole gameplay mechanic seems to be buggy, I have had my player get stuck in multiple places on the ice, and even skated into the score keepers box and couldn't get out. The fan reaction doesn't ever seem to change, and the home crowd boo's the 3 stars on the home team. How does that make sense? For me, I like sports games where you pick up, learn the new control scheme, then play a season, make a player and giver, the rest of the stuff I have litttle use for, and I don't really think most people get into all the new modes as much as EA would have you believe. Again, controls controls controls, every time I stick handle, the player shoots the puck and/ or stops moving, regardless of how the left stick is orientated. The passing mechanic is brutal. I figure they were looking to add some depth for epic loser players who sit and geek out on hockey, but can't skate. However, its makes little sense that the puck doesn't go where you want it to. Even the AI makes brutal passes 99% of the time. Call for a pass, and its behind you, or way ahead of you, or hits a guy. Maybe its my controller that is broken, or low on batteries, but I doubt it, even in the tutorial I couldn't score. Ive played every NHL since the original, and 94 is still the best. Its so good they give you the control scheme from it. (sort of) but that makes things worse as you can't do anything other than pass, shoot, and poke check. Bottom line, NHL 11 is not very fun. I plan on giving it some time, mainly to get over the controls and sit from the penalty box in be a pro to watch the action (which is beautiful). Hopefully I didn't waste 70 bucks. I should just sit in my basement and play Nintendo and super Nintendo, and throw out my 360, ps3, and wii. Ill give it a three, 3 points for looking and sounding fairly nice, and no points for boring me, and making me go play blades of steel.. I've played hockey games for years, even when 2K was killing years back. EA had managed to create the best hockey game ever. I was surprised at the MS Xbox World review. I read it and was AMAZED at how harsh they were. Disregard that low score, the reviewer has obviously never played a hockey game. And i'm also amazed at how many reviewers haven't comment on the many gameplay improvements. Anybody who has a history of playing NHL games would love this game!. EA's done it again. Just got the game a few days ago and I'm itching to come home from work and play Ultimate Team. Love the interaction, love the progression, love it period. Best version yet.. All I can say is WOW!!!! Watching this game grow from the old days of NHL 94 is just astounding!! The game feels better than years before and the Real time Physics Engine is **** feels real! The only thing that concerns me is the **** that could be more me than the **** NHL Fan needs to get this game!!!!!","despite these key additions to the series, it's arguably just as much of a step backward than it is forward . the game just feels sluggish and slow compared to last years game . despite these key additions, it's arguably just as much of a step forward than it is forward ."
588.Wario Land 4,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon gets 79 Wario Points from I, The Wario Enthusiast. This is a Wario Worthy game, and Wario's in it!. I have very fond memories of playing Wario Land 3 on the Gameboy Color. It really perfected the game loop of progression through the reward of power-ups from defeating wacky bosses nestles inside charming levels. Wario Land 4 however drops all of these fantastic traits bar some catchy music. In its place are bland empty levels that feel disconnected. While the timer mechanic is interested, it ultimately serves to ensure this game is extremely short, and there is little motivation to 100% it.. This game is incredible. Impeccable level design. Impeccable music. Impeccable controls. Impeccable… Wario. But this game if you have a GBA, or emulate it if you don’t. You need to play this game now. It will change your outlook on games forever.. Mario meets Metroid in this quirky, fun platformer containing trademark Wario mini-games.. Best Wario Game! No competition! It's so well composed and fun to play! Especially fast paced. I haven't played Wario Land Shake it though so.. The graphics in Wario land 4 are gorgeous, and everything is fun and fast-paced. It is on the shorter side of things, but that doesn't make it any worse.. i shirt me pants and canot stop pleace god help me bum hurts owwie owwie owwie. This is one of humanity and gaming biggest achievements, the OST is the best on the Gameboy Advanced, Wario really crushed it during the GBA era, and this is better that any Mario 2D platformer, my only complaint is that I wish it was more laid back and treasure-hunty like Wario Land 2 and 3. Wario delivers a fast-paced, action-packed puzzle platformer with so much variety that Mario could only dream to have something even close to as purely awesome and imaginative this game is.. look guys look, it's one of my greatest achievements, wario land 4 on the gameboy advanced!. A slightly flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless. The obligatory ""If you must buy one PlayStation 69 Pro game this year, than this would be it"" comment here…. In my opinion the best wario that has come out to date. A beastly evolution from its predecessors. Lots of secrets on this 2D platforms. The best of game boy.. Wario Land 4 boasts one of the strongest art-directions on the GBA. With its highly stylised graphics, fluent and colourful animations, eclectic soundtrack and captivating level atmospheres, it still stands out to me as one of the most unique and stylistic games Nintendo has ever put out. The gameplay is simple, but effective. Wario has an intricate set of movements options that are utilised throughout the entire game. Levels are diverse in settings and gimmicks, enemies are plentiful in variety, there are side mini-games to spice up the experience, hidden collectables to find and multiple difficulty settings that change the location of items to make it even more repayable than it already is. The games speed is extremely fast, even by today's standards. It feels like a Sonic game if Sonic were able to charge through his enemies and obstacles without being knocked back every five seconds. This allows for so much room to improve at the game, and complete levels faster, which is played into by the game with the count down at the end of each level, a great way of diversifying your simple side-scroller formula. I can't recommend this gem enough, it is one of the best games Nintendo has ever put out, and easily one of the best GBA games ever.. The perfect evolution of the Wario formula, it takes the gorgeous art direction of Virtual Boy Wario Land, the exploration of Wario Land 3, and puts it all together to create the perfect 2D game. Wario Land 4 is a game built on mysteries, which drive the player to explore and fall further down the rabbit hole. New to this game is the dash move which is one of the most seamless and perfect additions to any game. It acts as an extension to Wario's shoulder bash, and a helpful tool for the Hurry Up segments. The flow between using the shoulder bash and dash almost reminds me of the modern Rayman games. I love it. The transformations from Wario Lands 2 and 3 are back, but this time they are mostly used to help you progress or find secrets in the level. In Wario Land 3 because Wario was invincible the transformations usually just wasted his time or set him back in the level, which wasn't kind of annoying, but now most transformations are really easy to get in and out of. It is a bit of a downer that there aren't any new ones, but the ones taken from 3 look really great and function well. Wario Land 4 is a weird game, but the weirdness is really enjoyable and adds to the mysterious nature of the pyramid. I love how you can buy a smile for free at the shop, or how there is this weird photorealistic person moving between 2 frames when you play a CD. Another great aspect of the game is the music, it's one of my favorite soundtracks of all time, it really adds to the atmosphere of each stage, I especially like the title theme, credits theme, hurry up, and Hall of Hieroglyphics. It was really ambitious putting lyrics into some of the songs, but it really adds to the strangeness in a way a admire, the GBAs sound chip makes it so you can barely tell what they're saying, but it doesn't even matter because the songs with lyrics have so much energy that they're allready complete boops. The bosses are pretty fun, but can sometimes be annoying, I love their designs and most of the fights are fun, but some like the Teddy Bear are annoying in higher difficulties. This is kind of a mishmash of thing on my mind about this game, but Wario Land 4 is truly a great work.. One of the best 2d platformers ever made, with perfect balance of difficulty and fun overall. Graphic design is awesome along with its music and level design. Another game that needs a sequel.. This actually one of the best games on GBA. Cool effects, cool graphics... maybe strange soundtrack... but i love this game. Actually - best in Wario Land series. In full - game is AWESOME!. The worst game on an amazing series (witch includes Shake It, on Wii). Wario Land 3 felt more open and clever. Wario Land 5 gave us amazing visuals and music. Still, you can't go wrong with Wario Rock'n'Roll!!. Wario Land 4 is a good game with great graphics. The graphics could honestly be passable for the Nintendo DS! The game had some well hidden secrets and much Wario Land style. It is a great platformer with interesting moves, enemies, and bosses. The levels were colorful and the power-ups made for a good time. I had two problems with it though. I missed one of the treasure chests on one of the bosses and I could never get it back. Also, completing the game 100% is difficult. Its length was short, but overall great platformer!. Fantastic game. I've never even heard of this game before, but it came free with the ambassador programme and I absolutely love it. The graphics for it are great for a GBA games, the levels are big and have a very old school platform feel to them. Wario's transformation forms remind me of the old Rolo to The Rescue style gameplay. It has some great music, and the has a pretty original gameplay style for a platform game. If this comes out on the virtual console it is a must have game.","the graphics are gorgeous, and everything is fun and fast-paced . i shirt me pants and canot stop pleace god help me bum hurts owwie owwie owwie . it's one of humanity and gaming's biggest achievements ."
589.The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Game of the Year Edition,"Morrowind is an essential component to a healthy childhood. From learning to boost your athletics and acrobatics by jumping everywhere so you can move faster than an inchworm to teaching you to just murder store owner and loot the supplies; Morrowind creates well adapted adults. Of course we also have to mention the improved abilities of early Morrowind players to scroll through their diaries to find the last update from that quest we forgot to finish. Amazing game. I will never play it again without modding.. One of the first games I got addicted to. Morrowind is wand was theGold standard for a generation of open world games and still today one of the greats. If you get over the polygons and slightly sticky control mechanisms you’ll jump into an immersive world full of adventures. And Yes there are people falling from the skies.. The only good TES game with very interesting storyline. Oblivion is a trash. Skyrim is mediocre at best.. An incredibly unique experience for every player. Enough depth to make the replay value satisfying and DLC content you can enjoy for higher level characters.. Morrowind is without a doubt Bethesda's crowning achievement. Morrowind is simply a master piece of fantasy and role playing game design. Modern gamers will probably hate it after being spoiled by the lack of depth modern and hand holding of RPG's (and even latter games in the series). But for those willing to try something new, Morrowind offers something that simply can not be recreated. Do yourself a favor and play this game. Morrowind gives you wings. I remember playing this back in 2003 and really struggling at first to get through the first 3 hours of the game. Back then the concept of grinding was a new one to me. Once I managed to level up my character a bit I was on my way to what turned out to be one of the best RPG's I've ever played.This is a good example of what Bathesda's capable of doing when not trying pander to the casuals and those seeking a short blockbuster of a main quest full of cash-in cliff hangers that most real gamers will burn through in 8-12 hours. The main quest alone will take an average of 45-50 hours to complete 80+ if you play through the Guilds side quest's and grind a bit in between sections. I played this thinking every Elder Scrolls after it would be an improvement but the newer games seem more rushed, their simpler,shorter and a lot less **** me Replay Value isn't just about how many fetch quest's you can cram into a game cause we all know Bathesda can do About 200+hours like they did in Skyrim. I'm not sure where they think player's priorities are. Spoilers Below Pros -A long but interesting story that kept me hooked the entire play through. As you progress along the main quest you start to gain an understanding and knowledge of the lore and mythology in the world of Tamriel through your meaningful interactions with NPC's and through all the Books you'll find in the game. -Great Map, small compared to newer open world RPG's of today but big for it's time. The story takes you through to different regions on the map, all with their own unique style of architecture. It really feels like a world that's been hand crafted and not a cut and past job like Bathesda's later games.I know ES:Oblivion and ES:Skyrim have better Graphics but I preferred the visuals in Morrowind a lot more. As a first time player there are a lot of wow moments when you come across an area that you hadn't discovered yet, later regions look nothing like what you encounter at the beginning of the game keeping things fresh throughout. -Exploration. This is a game without way-points or quest markers, your given directions by NPC's and they expect to find your own way. This seems frustrating at first but after awhile you learn to pay attention to your surroundings,open the map once in a while and to check your compass. It's very rewarding to find your destination using only your brain power and not your eyes glued to an arrow. Something I wish more open world RPG's did. -Great Soundtrack/Main Theme. -Lot's of Variety. loads of armor,weapons,loot,potions,magic spells,enemy types, and interesting characters. The level of customization is beyond what ES:Oblivion and ES:Skyrim offer you. -Character Builds and the way you level up is also a lot better in ES:Morrowind. you have so many option as far as what skills you want your character to learn. and this gives the game some replay value and comes in handy later on if you want to learn new skills for a different character build without starting a new game cause it's easy to gain the first few levels quickly and Attribute and Skill points never seem like they're wasted. -Did I mention you can fly? Cause you can. Either by use of potions,enchantments,or spell casting. It comes in very handy when you spot loot that's out of the way but is also used to progress through a few story sections.I don't know why they took out this feature from the ES:O and ES:S. Flying around,complex character builds and a long and engaging main story were some of the features that I really missed from the sequels. -Loads of fun and interesting Side **** run into some interesting characters along the way and solve their problems for them or you can join one of three Guilds and work your way to the top. Cons -Glitches/Bugs like any other Bathesda game but since this is a console port from a time before Update Patches they actually did a good job of polishing this one before release. My game only crashed a few times. I only wish the load times weren't so bad cause getting back in usually meant a good minute or two of loading from the main menu. -No voice acting but that was most games back then so I can't really complain. -Combat was the least imaginative part of this game with 3 basic slashes and automatic blocking but it's not terrible. -Lack of cut scenes throughout the game were annoying,There's only one before you start the game. Having played 60+ hours to finish the game I was a bit disappointed. This is something Bathesda has to change in future Elder Scrolls Titles. The ES games have little to no cut scenes which is a bit frustrating when you consider the fact that most RPG's today will include at least an hour or two of cut-scenes to fill in the gaps between Chapters/Missions.I'm not sure why Bathesda can't be bothered(maybe their staff is too busy making Horse Armor DLC and other useless things for $5-20 bucks a pop) -Even with all it's flaws it still a 10/10 game.. The greatest Xbox game, period. Beautiful for it's time and vastly ahead of the open-world concept craze, Morrowind was the first truly immersive game I played. All RPG's that dare to go full 3D open world are measured Morrowind's complexity, it's diversity, and it's massive environments. Add to this a Fighter guild, Mages guild, Thieves Guild, Morag Tong assassins Guild, Tribunal Temple, Imperial Cult, Imperial Legion, Blades main Guild, chance to join one of three ruling houses, East Empire Company, Ashlanders, and even a rare chance to join one of three Vampire clans. Add to this many non-faction miscellaneous quests and you have a near endless amount of missions to complete. What separates this game from current versions is that there is little to no enemy leveling system. There is also little to no item leveling occurring. This allows for a far more dangerous and potentially far more rewarding exploration experience. Vampire den at level 4? Your dead and it's your fault. Find a massive enchanted sword at level 6? Hope you built your character to use it, enjoy! Find something impressive at level 10 and sell it only to discover it was mission essential later at level 30? Your fault, start over. Another thing worth mentioning is a brilliant music score. It is not perfect, however. This game also taught me what it was to have a game you could not rely on to be stable, which has become Bethesda's calling card. The combat is quite weak, you just flail at your opponent while they flail back and you see who had the better odds at flailing. The graphics may have been great when this game was made, but they have not aged particularly well. Also Cliff Racers are the most annoying enemy in gaming history. Not a game for people looking to have hands held through a game, but unrivaled in it's time and still a great play today. Top 5 game on my all time list.. Quite simply the best and most immersive RPG to grace any console. If you own an original Xbox or 360 its worth your time seeking out this game. I have been playing this game for years. I get some time per week to indulge in my gaming and always go back to this one. Its amazing, OK the graphics might be a little dated compared to its sequels, Oblivion and Skyrim, but the shear size of the game is astounding and puts the other two to shame. Get out there and find a copy, you will not be sorry. GOTY copies are a little pricey though. If you own a half decent PC then seek out the main game and copies of the expansions as this is a cheaper option. Brilliant game, just brilliant.. One of my most favorite game of all time. I've played this game for over 8 years now & there are a lot of missions I haven't done & locations I haven't been to yet. This is one of those that I would be ok with if this was the only game I am allowed to play for the rest of my life. The only problem I have with this game is the horrible combat mechanics & hit box.. Morrowind changed the RPG game. It provides an immersive and gigantic world to get lost into. One of the few games where the content actually surpasses the cost.. Not bad at all, great compared to the PC version, has minor bugs when playing it on the original Xbox, but on the xbox 360 I have yet to see any bugs a pure RPG game, the combat is a little unbalanced, but its because the game adds into effect your attributes and your luck, and your skill with your current weapon.. This game is absolutely amazing. The storytelling is amazing, the depth is just astonishing, the NPC interactions make the NPCs feel alive, and you can do whatever you want to do. Your choices actually matter, the people recognise your good or bad deeds, the DLC is great. I could go on and on about this game, but play it for yourself and experience the full beauty of a real RPG.. Great game, large world, beautiful landscape. While quests get boring and some of the monsters you encounter may be dull, the game provides a thrilling time for all ages.. This is by far one my favorite games. The game will keep hooked for many hours at a time with it vast amount of quests and stories. Some of the guilds my lack a little bit in story, but overall the game is worth buying on the PC since load times on the Xbox are insane. The best Elder Scrolls game yet.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my top 10 favorite games of all time. Sure, it's a little buggy at times and you have to swing your first weapon about fifty times at a cliff racer to hit it, but this game isn't for the average gamer. It's for explorers--people who enjoy going wherever they want and doing whatever they want. It's for those who enjoy putting hours and hours into their character & leveling up skills so you can become the most powerful force in the game. It also allows you to progress with the main quest whenever you darn well feel like it while providing ample opportunities to advance with other organizations. This game is more ""real"" than any other I've played, including Oblivion & Skyrim. You can go into a house in the middle of nowhere, murder the occupants, steal them blind, and sell all their wares at a nearby village. The guards won't know a thing, as they shouldn't..they weren't there and you left no survivors. This is NOT the case in Oblivion or Skyrim, where every guard nearby seems to know the moment you stole that little silver cup. That's not real to me, but BS.. Morrowind is the first Elder Scrolls game I played. Simply put, it is incredible. In fact, I would venture to say that it is vastly superior to its predecessor, Oblivion. Morrowind is the first in the series to introduce a truly open and vast world that not only takes hours to see and explore, but manages also feel very much alive. It is filled to the brim with interesting scenery, characters, quests, monsters, lore, and so on. I honestly cannot place exactly why this game was more fun than Oblivion besides to say perhaps the overall all ""mood"" and design of the continent. Skyrim managed to return to the series' roots while still taking several steps forward, and it is superior to Morrowind, no doubt, but if you get the change to try out this amazing, epic game that paved the way for Skyrim, do not hesitate. I give this game an easy 10 out of 10.. Morrowind is easily one of the best games available on XBOX. The absolutely epic scale of the game, in and of itself, was enough to get me to shell out $50 for it many years ago, and recently repurchased a used copy ($4 on Amazon). Even after the countless hours I've already spent in this game when it was new, there are still many more unexplored avenues for adventure, untold stories of my exploits, and an unexplainable craving to leave no rock unturned, no cave unexplored. Infinite replay value aside, nearly every facet of this game made an impact on me as a gamer. The loading times are long, more bugs than I would normally tolerate, companion pathing is a pain, and the combat system is simplistic, however, for it's time, you cannot find a more involved, open ended RPG. Period. This game was developed for the PC, and runs much better on more powerful hardware than the XBOX has to offer, however, Bethesda did a wonderful job tailoring Morrowind so console gamers could enjoy this game. With everything it has to offer, any flaws in the game are completely blown away by the sheer amount of content. This game has a special place on my top 5 games of all time.. From the time you step off of the boat, Morrowind will sink its claws into you and never let go. The combat and graphics have not held up well over the years, but the incredible adventure filled land of Morrowind has.. This game will forever be in my top 10 favorite games off all time. If you are a big fan of open world games with complete freedom as to what you can do and where you can go this is the game for you. You want to to kill a key NPC and effectively end the game's main story? Sure! You want to enchant a ring that can make you fly? Why not! You want to become a vampire and feed on people? Go right ahead! Some people complain that the travel system is slow and it takes forever to walk places. I think this is a good thing. Walking from place to place makes the game feel more authentic and mystical. There is a mass transit system that can get you between the main settlements on the map. There is so much to do and see in this game it's unbelievable. This is the first Bethesda game I ever played and I have played every single one they've produced since. This game opened my eyes to a genre of games I didn't know I liked and now I play almost exclusively. Give it a shot even if though it's old now.. This is almost a perfect RPG. Morrowind is open-ended, offers hundreds of quests, plenty of story lines, and the main plot is possibly the best I have seen in any game. In true RPG fashion you start with nothing but your shirt, pants and a stolen dagger, and you might end up as a force to throttle the heavens. The world is beautiful and varied - especially for a game of its age - and there is never a shortage of places to go, dungeons to explore, items to find and people to interact with. Regardless of where you go, you will be filled with a sense of wonder, and anticipation of possible rewards. I would like to give Morrowind a perfect 10/10, but there are a few elements that needs to be improved upon for that (and fan-made mods have indeed been made). The most deterring aspect is combat, which severely lacks excitement, as you will find yourself chopping away with your sword or axe, smashing the same mouse button repeatedly until whatever is in your way is dead. There is no strategy to melee. Spell-casting would be fun as the spell book is far more varied than in the game's successor, Oblivion, but unfortunately you will find yourself lacking the mana pool to do prolonged combat with destructive spells and there is no mana regeneration. However the problems with the combat system barely deters from the overall enjoyment of the game, as the story will leave you hungering for more. Whenever you complete a quest you will want to continue unto the next one, and whenever you travel the world - which you will be doing a lot - you explore every canyon crevice hoping to find something new, which you often will. The expansions have equally impressive story-lines. Bloodmoon offers a new, enormous landmass to explore, but sacrifices story quality (although it is still fantastic and engaging), whereas Tribunal is confided to one large city and its sewers, but with a story rivaling that of the original. Further the difficulty of the expansions is high, making them great for characters that have already completed the main quest. Unlike Oblivion there is no scaling, and the game does not hold your hand. You can fail quests, and you can kill ANYONE, meaning a particularly malicious player can mess up his own progress, by slaughtering important NPC's. This is not a critique, but an applause, as the game lets you experience the consequences of your own actions in a believable way. The game is fantastic and once you start, you might never stop playing. Eight years after its release and I still enjoy it as much as any game I've tried since.. After all these years, TES III Morrowind is still my all-time favorite game. Far better than Oblivion, it's world is more arcane with many more Houses and Guilds to explore, not to mention a far more alien world with 2 stellar expansions (Bloodmoon and Tribunal). Most other open-world games pale in comparison. I still manage to play an 80-hour character about once a year. Oh, and don't forget the new mods! :). This game is bloody amazing. This game is huge, and anyone not playing it is REALLY missing out. This is not even a game anymore, it lives on it's own.. this is the best game I've ever played. I guess the modern gamers who complain about it don't want to spend so much time making their first character good.. This game made me buy the Xbox twice. I thought I had no use of the machine then I tried this game and just had to get another Xbox because I did not have a PC that could handle this game. I was introduce to this great franchise, a game that introduced me to what a real open world game looks like.",morrowind is a master piece of fantasy and role playing game design . the main quest alone will take an average of 8-12 hours to complete . the only good TES game with very interesting storyline .
59.Metroid Prime Remastered,"Very good remaster of a classic game. It has its flaws due to game mechanics dating from 20 years ago but overall an amazing FPS and adventure game. Music is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. This game was awesome…,but over two decades Ago! Now clunky and archaic controls almost killed that title! Imagine if you want make strafe,you must hold lock button,push jump button plus left or right on analog!!! Jumps and physics are bad,and feels like bag full of potatoes but not human body!Combat is decent,but bosses fights are difficult,because of antic control metod!Backtracking and no quick movement between regiony not help!Rest of game like adventure,story,puzzle,sounds and visuals are great - just Classic and pure fun for mind,eyes and ears!. Definitely one of my favourite games. The improvement are amazing, the atmosphere is one of highlights as well as the gameplay. I feel that this game was used as an example for the modern FPS. The only thing that could be considered negative is the backtracking, but its a metroid game. Really hoping that Retro Studios remakes the other two of the Prime series.. It's impressive how they managed to translate the Metroid 2D experience into a 3D game. Personally, I never had a GameCube, so I never would have imagined that such a hidden gem was overlooked by me during that generation.. Retailing $40 at launch is an insane value, also very generous to call this a remaster as it feels more so like a remake.. I wasn't into FPS but Metroid Prime had me hooked to the very end Bravo to this game.. The perfect comeback imo. The game style copes with the possibilities nintendo has to offer. I can't say anything people don't already know, a must-play without a doubt. Pretty good game but I think I like the 2nd one more. Had a fun time playing it but wouldn't go back to play it.. FPS Metroid just doesn't work for me. Too boring and repetitive to bother. Maybe it's GameCube legacy gameplay, or perhaps FPS genre doesn't suit Metroid series.. All though the game is fun and cool, sometimes it's not really fun. The mechanics and items are cool, the bosses and the map. But the fact it doesn't save normally is trash. Finding the way and the upgrades can be hard as well.. Metroid Prime – A Frustrating Dive into a Tedious LabyrinthMetroid Prime may have a strong reputation, but I found it to be an overhyped and, at times, painfully frustrating experience. For a game hailed as a “masterpiece,” it struggles with some glaring flaws that make it far from enjoyable.First, the pacing is incredibly slow. The backtracking is relentless—after making some progress, you’re often forced to revisit old areas, which feels more like padding than meaningful exploration. It breaks the flow of the game, making it feel tedious rather than immersive. The constant need to retrace your steps, scanning objects, unlocking doors, and navigating the same repetitive environments becomes an exhausting chore.Speaking of scanning, the scanning system is another letdown. While it’s meant to add depth to the world, having to scan nearly everything disrupts the gameplay flow. It feels like a lazy storytelling method, where instead of the world naturally unfolding, you’re bombarded with walls of text that are easy to ignore.Combat, too, is a disappointment. While the lock-on mechanic helps with aiming in a 3D space, it oversimplifies encounters, making fights feel repetitive and lacking any real challenge. Boss battles, which should be a highlight, are often prolonged and require more patience than strategy, dragging the game down even **** controls feel outdated, especially compared to more recent first-person titles. The clunky movement and awkward platforming make navigating the 3D environments frustrating. It lacks the smoothness and precision of modern games, which can be a dealbreaker for those used to more refined controls.Visually, while the art direction is commendable, the environments quickly become monotonous. There’s only so much alien landscape one can take before it all starts blending together. The minimalist soundtrack, while atmospheric at first, does little to alleviate the game’s repetitive **** conclusion, Metroid Prime may appeal to hardcore fans of the series, but for newcomers or those looking for a more modern, fast-paced experience, it falls short. The slow pacing, repetitive design, and frustrating controls make it a game that’s hard to recommend without significant caveats.. I haven’t played the original game, so I can’t compare the two. Overall, it’s a really good game. It has beautiful graphics, it’s easy to control, and the music is okay. I really liked the lock-on system when fighting the monsters. However, I can’t give it a top score because I think it has some flaws and shortcomings. You spend an incredible amount of time walking back and forth. I could probably live with that if it wasn’t for the monsters respawning in the different rooms all the time. It wasn’t always possible to just quickly pass through. Sometimes you had to fight the battles over and over again. I REALLY missed having some 'transport stations' that would allow you to quickly travel to and from places. I also didn’t find the map easy to navigate. Here, I missed the option to make markings on the map so you could remember what you needed to return to later. It was completely impossible to remember the places you needed to revisit later in the game.. One of the best remasters I've ever seen. The care and attention to detail is frankly the Gold standard for Remasters coming forward. The game itself is a great experience capable of holding its own against modern FPS games.. One of the most beautiful looking games you can find on the switch! Like holy moly this game looks good. Amazing remaster of an already amazing game. The only reason people complain about it is because it doesn’t play like your average first person shooter. I never played the original as I am not a fan of first-person shooters. I have to say it does a very good job of bringing the Super Metroid feel to 3D. It also looks incredible. The main drawback is there is a LOT of backtracking and no fast travel. If you got an hour free to play, it's very possible you'll travel back and forth looking for the next way to go only to accomplish exactly nothing. I ended up using guides pretty often just to save the hassle. Other than that, it's quite a good game. My other gripes stem from the virtue of it being in first person, but the lock on mechanic made it more manageable. Still, it would have been amazing in 3rd person. I wasn't impressed with the original, and I thought maybe after 17 years, things would be different. I picked this one up, the combat was clunky and tedious, the puzzles are boring and just involve a lot navigating and scanning the environment. The music is corny and just doesn't quite fit the world. The story is nonexistent, and the gameplay as a whole is just a chore in hopes of something fun, but that fun never actually shows up. I played halfway through before rage quitting, realizing that I had already completed it once and that doing it again was a waste of time. I would honestly say don't listen to the hype, overall its an average game at worst its a complete bore.. I have been playing games since Pong. My favorite games are adventures with puzzles like Legend of Zelda, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Super Metroid, Dark Souls, System Shock remake. I have finished hard games like Ninja Gaiden 1-2-3 on NES, All Contras, saved princes in Super Mario Bros 1-3 etc. I watched so many positive review, excited player opinions, and unanimous praise for Metroid Prime. I was so eager to play it. But I have never played so annoying and bad game like Metroid Prime. This game aim to annoy, frustrate, confuse, and punish you every time it has an opportunity. Level design is not suited for backtracking, it is a long long corridors with some rooms in between. As Metroid Prime does not provide goals, or direction in any way, you have to backtrack whole level again and again, After I spend 2 hours to find next goal, I got frustrated and had to use manual in order to proceed. Take a look at System Shock, it's levels are giant hub in the center, and corridors connected to it, exploring in System Shock takes long time, but you may backtrack the whole level in few minutes, visiting each room. In Metroid Prime backtracking is painful because enemies are always respawn. And there are no quick-travel between levels, no shortcuts. You need to walk the WHOLE game at least several times. Enemies just annoy you, they didn't try to kill you. Samus can't upgrade a weapon power, so the weapon is weak for the whole game. It takes up to thee concentrated shots to kill a pirate. Colorful enemies only take damage from corresponding color of Samus gun. They are invincible to another bullet color. This is so frustrating, because changing weapons take time, auto-aim connects to another enemy, you can't see enemy color with visors, while enemies bump you from all sides, which also slows weapon change. Just make colorful enemies take damage from all guns, but die instantly from the correct color. This is so easy. I don't get why this ""non FPS"" game rely on weak shooting mechanic SO much. This is not an ""adventure and exploration from First Person view"" this is weak FPS with lots of obstacles. Map is not convenient, it doesn't display scanned upgrades or points of interest, doesn't allow to add markers. Save spots are far away from each other. I lost few hours with this marvelous feature. Bosses, especially in late game, are so annoying and frustrating, that I don't even wan't to talk about it. You have to shoot more bullets in one boss than you shoot in the both Half-Life's. Puzzles are weak. There are only three puzzles in the game I liked. They are not even a puzzles mostly, just an excuse to use new-found abilities. Use a bomb here, use a ball there and this is a ""puzzle"" ? All abilities are under utilized, abilities are a simple trick for a specific place. There are some environment puzzles - ""Enemies push you to the pit, so you burn in lava"", ""Jump on several mushroom platform and grab movable grappling hook attachment which doesn't grab most of the time, fail, go back to do all over again"", ""Move as a ball on top of the room, and fail again and again, because there are rubble at the only place you may land, from which ball slides"" Metroid prime has it's positives - graphic, sound, animation, scanner and that's it. For me this is the WORST game in the world. I don't get all the Hype and High ratings. Beware of this game, this is pure trash in a beautiful wrap.. Metroid Prime Remastered is a must play for any action gamer or Sci-Fi fan. Prime has great gameplay, masterful and fitting music, great atmosphere, and solid in-game lore. This is a near perfect remaster of the original, keeping the same great gameplay while making the visuals absolutely beautiful and at a stable frame rate. Not only that, but there are many different control schemes to choose from, some nice bonus content, and even colorblind assist for extra accessibility. The game is so polished that there hasn’t been a single update since launch. I enjoyed my first Playthrough of Prime in Metroid Prime Trilogy, and it’s even better here. The only things preventing me from giving it a 10 are the fact that some original bonus content such as the fusion suit is absent, and the original Prime and Trilogy version developers aren’t properly credited. Other than that, this is how a remaster should always be done.. stunning display of how a remastered should be done and other games can learn from this. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is how a remaster should be, it takes the original game and vamps the graphics to the peek it can be, it also gives you a verity of control schemes, so it will be enjoyable whether this is your first time playing it or you played this on the GameCube or Wii. on top of this, Metroid Prime is one of the few switch games to run in 60fps nearly the ENTIRE time.. I played this once on GameCube and once again on Wii. This version has better graphics but worse controls than the Wii version. A real downgrade in controls. The visuals have been heavily updated, with new models, making it look mostly like a modern game, and really impressive on Switch, more impressive than the new game Metroid Dread. Occasionally you see old assets that look low poly compared to the new. Lighting effects are not as good as the Wii version in certain places, like missing reflections. Having played this twice before and the last time having it coming bundled with part 2 and 3 on Wii, I am less excited by this but for a first time player, it is one of the best games on Switch. If you have the option, play the Wii version for much better motion controls.. An excellent game, I enjoyed it a lot, had fun, and highly recommend it. I didn't play it on GameCube, and I took this opportunity to play it, and it feels like a current game in many aspects. The graphics and colors are well done and pleasing to the eye, the gameplay is decent and quite entertaining considering its age, the maps are enjoyable to explore, I loved the music as it fits the game very well, and the overall atmosphere is very good—you truly feel like you are on an unknown planet where everything is strange.. Slow boring gameplay, the maps are way oversized for little content that's within them. bugs are annoying unsatisfying enemies. soundtrack is very annoying. Gun play and sound effects have not been updated enough to justify selling this at a price close to a modern shooter. I regret my purchase and time investment. My first time playing through Metroid Prime was really positive. I enjoyed the atmosphere and exploration greatly. The sound design, music, and visuals are all really great. I did have some issues with the pacing and backtracking, and combat is slightly too basic, but other than that this is a seriously high quality title.. One of the catchiest Games I've played. I had a Gamecube, but never played Metroid Prime. Now, im so happy that I at least bought it for the Switch. To Explore the world, slowly find out about the Lore. It was just breathtaking. I created a meta critic account just to write this as I'm so unbelievably frustrated with this game. Firstly, I've been gaming for 25+ years, and loved Nintendo since the 90's, which was the main motivation for trying Metroid. Pros: -Good graphics, particularly for a remaster from the early 2000's, to the point where this game stands up well even 20+ years later -Some of the music is good, albeit quite repetitive after a point -Clearly a lot of thought has been put into the world and connecting it, which can create a good sense of atmosphere Cons: -I have never seen so much back tracking and repetition, and even though I was aware that Metroid had a reputation for this, I'm still in disbelief at the literal hours I've spent just going back through areas, and this feels like such an insane / arrogant over sight to just pad out game time, and really detracts from some of the positives above. This has also aged particularly badly -I have never felt actually strong against an enemy (currently 20 hrs in Phazon Mines, roughly 3/4 in) and I find enemies to just be a chore and more of a puzzle rather than an engaging fight. Bosses in particular just have a very specific, usually quite puzzle focused way of beating them, rather than it feeling like a more open fight with multiple options -Lack of clarity. Even with some minor QoL improvements and hints, I still found myself having no way of knowing what to do / where to go, with such a large map and no real sense of direction. This compounds very negatively with the back tracking, to the point I've repeatedly had to use guides, which significantly takes away from the game -The controls have not synced well as I never feel completely in control of what I'm doing, which in a platforming / puzzle focused game makes things even more frustrating I really wanted to like this game, and it does have some nice moments. However I think the reviews here are unbelievably kind, and can't help but feel there's a lot of nostalgia / fear of being honest as people want this to be good I can't justify any higher than a 5, however if these points were addressed I could see why someone would go to a high 7 / maybe even a low 8. I'm forcing myself to complete this game, and knowing what I know now unfortunately think I wouldn't have bothered, so I highly recommend taking the critical feedback here on board if you're also unsure. I never got to play the first one, so this was a great time for me while I wait for MP4. The graphics upgrade is great. My biggest complaint is the map controls are clunky. The control scheme in general is customizable now but not quite customizable enough.. As a remaster it might be the best and a standard setter for a game of this generation. It enhances what are my favorite features of this game which are its atmosphere and immersion. Everywhere you turn you see an artwork made by a designer who brilliantly nailed the aesthetic of a meld of ancient alien architectures, futuristic space technology, and foreign nature, all in claustrophobic environments. Every room looks unique and not just copy pasted textures. The 60fps just ads even more to the immersion. The remaster also brings in control options that are up to standard with modern console FPS games, but that only reveals more that Metroid Prime is weak an FPS and not comparable to games such as Halo or Time Splitters. The guns shoot and switch slow. Features such as autolock and projectile path corrections show it wasn't serious as an FPS. The puzzles are not challenging whatsoever for neither skill or brain teasers. The scanning visor points everything out to you and imo slows the game down. The challenging and rewarding elements of this game come in what the game is more criticized for by its critics (not me) : it's exploration. You unlock new abilities and you rack your brain to figure out where these new abilities could be put to use in places you've already been to unlock newer paths and more abilities. That is what this game, and almost all metroidvanias, are mostly all about. The map is not so big so as backtracking and having to remember things is a huge problem. The writing may be the worst thing about it. You acquire the lore by scanning things, which is annoying. It's full of contradictions and is not clear whether your acquired equipment was left to you by the Chozo or you're stealing from the Space Pirates. Attempts at giving texts spiritual and scientific lingo are terrible and just make everything more unclear and hard to read. Nevertheless I think this game's atmosphere, immersion, and metroidvania gameplay make it a superb game overall and this is a remarkable remaster.. Beautifull remake of a classic game that simply can't be not liked, everyone who plays games has to have played this, period.. I started as a newcomer in the Metroid franchise. My initial impression from the gameplay front wasn't so great. Checked out the gameplay aspect from YouTube and made my decision to avoid this one. Nothing actually intrigued me about this game. However later 2023, something actually cracked me up and I asked myself what is actually even special about this game. Why Nintendo fanboys are hyping things up ? Well that time I decided to give this one a fair shot. I started playing this game and my initial impression was still the same. However, more I get through various stages I started to feel that there is something unique that definitely hits hard. And boy I was so wrong. After some rough hours the game actually gets so good that it even let me forget about my initial playthrough. The mechanics, the gameplay, the combat was such a breath of fresh air. It wasn't like any other first person shooter. So different, so much engaging. The mechanics were so advance at that time that it even holds up today. Now it made me want to play the next installment asap. Nintendo should remaster next two b4 prime 4 takes place in the Metroidverse. 10/10 highly recommended.. This remastered game is a great way of exposing our modern world to an absolute classic. It felt amazing to play one of the greatest games of all time on my switch. The only negative side to it was that the controls weren't amazing and I feel like the graphics could have been a bit better.. It's a wonderful game and a great remake of the gamecube original. It would be a 10 if they sorted out the truly painful backtracking that goes on, especially towards the end of the game. Just give the people a fast travel option.. I love the atmosphere of this game, continually upgrading Samus is a nice gameplay loop, but I couldn't stand the constant backtracking and outdated ""puzzle gameplay"" where they just hide something in a giant room or dont tell you where in the giant map to go. I gave this game up but I can see why some love it.. this is another one of nintendo's half baked cop outs made from a game with a ton of potential that they just choose to not take advantage of. there was no reason to release this for the 5th time without any genuinely new features. do not let anyone tell you that this is a vast improvement on the original, because it's the same code. it's just a graphical upscaling of the game they have released on 5 different consoles now, with literally no significant updates. it STILL has bugs, the level design will feel completely outdated without at least an occasional autosave or a fast travel feature, and i honestly feel like playing it has frustrated me about 75% of the time vs 25% of it being enjoyable. it's simply not as good as games that came out as the same time as the original, either. maybe you could beat it for bragging rights in the 2000's and even enjoy it, but this release doesnt shake it in 2024. the controls are utterly convoluted. we have duplicate buttons for actions like shooting and missiles, yet we constantly use multiple button presses at once for something that could just use one button to switch between beams. the graphics are nice, the soundtrack is okay, but the game itself is just a frustratingly outdated mess. every time it gives me an upgrade, it just throws another enemy at me that's even more of an annoying, tedious bullet sponge of a fight. the platforming ****, it feels good *occasionally* but for the most part it will consist of a bunch of unnecessary falls which make you have to walk back up very long paths to get back up. i don't mind this in challenge areas where the reward is something useful, but it's too often the case in just basic travel from area to area. having to backtrack through literally every single area over and over and over again just makes all of these issues worse. inputs tend to be unresponsive during important combat segments, which is obviously worsened by the unnecessarily complicated controls. it's not that i can't get used to them, it's more that they are still unintuitive at the end of the day, and i literally feel like i have to re learn them every time i pick the controller up after a break. for a game that requires this much patience and effort out of the player, one would expect the game to have deeper lore or more complex combat, but it feels like nearly every tool is just an excuse for another annoying segment like the thermal goggles. they literally say they are about to test the goggles, and then a huge segment of the map is just pitch black for the rest of the game. where are those hacking skills now? moreover, how has this ancient, technologically advanced civilization not yet invented a flashlight, or a way to give any of these visors 1/10th as good of the visibity as humans have had for decades now? when a company remakes a game, they have a responsibility not just to create a carbon copy, but to preserve the experience we had with the initial release. in this case, they utterly failed to keep up with modern conventions, and i think i won't trust the metroid team another time. they seem unable to either release the new games they promise or to genuinely improve on the existing ones.. Nothing to say. This game was perfect when it came out on the GameCube and it was made even better now.. This game is a wonderful experience for anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch. It has stunning visuals, not only for a Switch game, but in general. The environments feels much more alive and interesting than the original and the lighting is great. The game runs a near perfect 60 fps, I never experienced frame drops through multiple play-throughs. The new control schemes allow this classic to feel much more modern and smooth without tainting the classic experience. The music was overall very well put together, a few exceptions exist but a massive majority of the music is great. The atmosphere is just great, it changes a lot throughout but it is almost always great. Overall this game is great and has some of the best visuals and performance of any Switch game. Weather or not you’ve played Metroid Prime on the GameCube or Wii (Metroid Prime Trilogy) versions, this game is worth a grab and is without a doubt the definitive way to play play Metroid Prime.. Still my favorite Metroid game! I freaking adore the visuals for this remaster and only pray that 4 somehow looks even better. Beautiful music that really sets the tone for each environment. I honestly hope the 4th game is just as impactful. It’s insane to think that all these years later, this game still runs laps around a lot of modern games in terms of design and atmosphere. Incredibly frustrating game even after all these years. I played this back on the GameCube being a fan of the 2D Metroid games, but could never get into it because of the controls. That old combat and movement is improved with the new controls, but Samus does not feel good to control in first person. My biggest problem though is the aimless running around and endless backtracking that make this game an intense slog unless you know the exact nook or cranny you are looking for. All off the boss fights are also incredibly lame and not fun in any capacity. I struggle to find what people like about this game, as the story is also a throw away and does nothing interesting. I thought this time I would be able to get into the Prime series and I would finally ""get it"", but it was not the case.. Rarely do I find myself in agreement with other users and the press. I won't dwell on the positives, as those are readily accessible to everyone, but I'll share why, from my subjective viewpoint, it merited only a 5-star rating. Had this been 15 years ago, it might well have earned a 9/10 from me, but standards have evolved. The world feels too sterile and linear, which is why I greatly preferred Dead over this game. The combat style was too slow and cumbersome, especially with weapon switching. The level recycling required passing through some areas up to six times, and although this is intrinsic to many Metroidvanias, it didn't bother me in Hollow Knight or Dead, but it did here. There's no point collection for upgrades, making it clear that defeating monsters is unnecessary. I also wasn't a fan of the dark areas in the game, but that's a matter of taste. The auto-aiming feature in the Switch version made some aspects overly trivial. As for the story, I'm at a loss, admittedly my fault for not reading more, but I've been spoiled by modern games. Nonetheless, I'm willing to give a chance to the sequel or remake.. Sometimes you get so lost and unsure of what you’re supposed to do next that not even a guide can get you back on track. But the Remastered HD graphics, uniquely designed areas and enemies, and thrilling combat make the frustrating backtracking all worth it in the end; that is, if you can also overlook the outrageous price tag.. The HD graphics are great, the control scheme is great, but this is still a game from 2002. Is this the best Nintendo could have given us 5 years after announcing Metroid Prime 4? I don't think so. If this had been Metroid Prime Trilogy Remastered, the price tag would have been acceptable. But for a single game, don't waste your money. Wait for it to go on sale.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. One of my first Metroid games, it is an amazing experience but the glaring issue is the lighting I can barely see anything in dark corridors.. One of my all time favorite games from my childhood! Still holds up today, and the updated visuals and control scheme make it a must have for anyone that owns a NintendoSwitch. I love this game. The visuals are amazing. It was the first metroid game I have ever played. It was a game I had never heard of until the Nintendo Direct in February 2023. The bosses are challenging but very fun.. As someone who never played the original game on either GCN or Wii, this was a game I'm a bit ashamed of sleeping on until now. This is a perfect transition from the usual 2D Metroids to the 3rd dimension and I was pleasantly surprised the entire run. Exploration was extremely fun, to the point that I never found backtracking the areas to be inherently boring whatsoever. The only part of the game whatsoever where I got a bit annoyed whatsoever was the artifact hunt at the very end, but even that was pretty fun overall. The bosses are fun, the combat in general is simplistic but enjoyable, and overall it's just a fun time. I cannot recommend this enough if you're a fan of either the Metroidvania or FPS genres.. I only played the first level, but my impression is that this is a high quality game that may not be for me. It just feels a bit to cold, dark, and sterile for my liking. For now, I feel like this would hower around a 7, but could definitely change once I play this longer at some point.. One of the best Metroid and FPS's of all time. As soon as you quadruple front flip onto the ship everything around you stops as you are drawn into the game. It then shows you some basic mechanics to acting as a tutorial leading to you entering the ship. THIS is when the game kicks in. You see the burnt remains of alien bodies and wreckedges scattered around the ship. You will then encounter your first boss-the parasite queen. As soon as she enters the music suddenly kicks in adding dread and a tint of fear. When you appear it goes from fear to terror. Alarms start blaring and lights start flashing. You have little time to escape. When you start to backtrack, bodies you thought where dead are actually up and ready to kill you. You then lose all powers you just had making you feel helpless and unequiped adding to the sence of dread. Then when you escape your are transported to the Planet Tarron. The only thing that bad is that you can easily get lost and not know where your suppposed to be. May need to use a walkthrough. This is where your adventure actually begins. An incredible remaster of the original game that has stuck truthfully to the sorce meterial as wel as being an exceptional game. Very good movement - responsive and fluid. Incredible gameplay all around as well as music. Overal an amazing game, definately recomend picking up.. I did not have a great experience with this game. Didn't end up finishing because I found the backtracking to be tedious. However, the art style, atmosphere, music, and graphics were great. It's a well designed game with smooth controls and interface. Just not my cup of tea as is the case with most games of this style. Is definetly worth a try though!. Really great i see why the original holds up so well. The backtracking and confusion on where to go is really the only thing holding this game back for me, else its a genuine triumph, with great bosses, gameplay and so much more. Its atmosphere is definitely spe",Metroid Prime is a remaster of a classic game from 20 years ago . it has its flaws due to game mechanics dating from 20 years ago . clunky and archaic controls almost killed that title .
590.WarioWare: Twisted!,"""WarioWare: Twisted!"" even keeps its fun from the first game that inspired a game like this. There's even 10 more microgames to chose from compared to its successful predecessor.. WarioWare Twisted is a spinning success! The gameplay works great with the motion censor cartridge and microgames have never been this fun. A true Gameboy classic.. WarioWare: Twisted! is a classic WarioWare game with an amazing feature. The gyro sensor made the game play feel advanced and new. Spinning my Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP for movement was a fresh idea that totally got pulled off by Nintendo. WarioWare: Twisted is still today a special game considering Nintendo hasn't made a handheld console with a gyro sensor.

591.It Takes Two,"Top tier co-op game, really well designed with lots of different gameplay during the levels. the plot will be pulled but if you wanna relax and laugh with your bro or gf (dont care) then this is just right main characters is very funny namely cody he is main reason why i love this game. This was a perfect game for me and my wife! Beautiful graphics, excellent gameplay and perfect imagination and story. It's a great game for couples.. It Takes Two is a great game, mechanically. The levels are very creative and Toy Story-esque, with great puzzles and use of co-op, though the later levels start to rapidly diminish in quality. As such, the game starts to drag, ultimately fizzling out. There is a lot of great gameplay to make up for this, though. The Nintendo Switch version of the game runs terribly, and I would never recommend it to anyone. I understand the limitations of the console, but this is an embarrassing port and should not have been released. The graphics are just terrible, with constant visual glitches and pop-in; sometimes textures simply not loading in at all. Performance wise, it rarely hits a solid 30 FPS and frequently chugs in the low 20s. There are a handful of moments where the framerate makes the game unplayable, and one or two moments where the game freezes up altogether. A poor show, altogether. Buyer beware.. It's an incredibly good game and a the perfect coop adventure to play through with somebody. Every chapter has its own twist to keep things fresh and fun. For the most part it always feels fresh, although sometimes some gameplay sections do feel repetitive. Regardless the game is still pure fun. The graphics and story are also of the highest quality. It's a very memorable experience for both you and whoever you play it with. The puzzles and general design of levels force cooperation in a mostly natural feeling manner. It's a really good game that is defiantly worth a play.. Story 9/10 , graphic 9,3/10, soundtrack 9,5/10 Everything was perfect my expectations were satisfied. Overall 9,3/10, And i played with my little brother Gilani , and just literally finished this game half hour again , and I as well played ""a way out"" so I wanna buy new game that gonna release in march that called ""Split Finction"" if I not mistaken.. A decent game for co-op. Needs everyone to complete, will suit couples primarily, but can be completed with friends.. The best game to play with a significant other. With extremely fun mini games and puzzles this game always was a blast. A fun story with some surprisingly serious tones to it.. A dreamy game. It has everything. My sister and myself LOVED every aspect! Wow wow wow.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game for partners! Beautiful animation, difficulty is manageable, but cooperation is almost always needed.. A real wonderment and joy, play this with a loved one for the true experience. I played with my ex and she realised our problems weren't worth fixing! Haha excellent -_-. A cute concept, with excellent graphics and a story that lands somewhere between Toy Story and The Brave Little Toaster. However, the relationship therapy not-so-in-disguise and the book who serves as the host are irritating.. It Takes Two excels at what it’s set out to do. I played with my partner, and it was like our relationship in the sofa was mirrored on screen. When frustrated, we needed to talk it out and be patient with each other to make it work, and it was just beautifully designed how the couple on screen mirrored our emotions. On top of this, the game flows with new exciting mechanics and levels at a great pace, and the voice acting and writing is on par with any Hollywood romcom movie. I’d say the game is best suited for grown up couples. It’ll work for friends too or parents with older kids, but the great connection between game mechanic and your real life relationship won’t hit you as hard. As it aims at being the perfect couples game, I’ll also say it could’ve used more of a tutorial mindset for players inexperienced with third person camera control. It’s so easy to forget how big of a threshold that once was for you, and it risks triggering the inexperienced player to give up. Then again, the magic lies in trying to coach your partner through it, and knowing when it’s time to back off. It’s a lot like learning how to play in the sandbox again.. Great coop-only game. Generally should be played by an adult couple, but it also makes fun with one of your kids.. Best couch coop game ever. But I have no idea why I need to rate this game on PS platform.. played the game with my sister definitly recommend only playing with best friend, family or couple. performance 10/10, visual 9/10, value 10/10, music 9/10, creativity 10/10, gameplay 10/10, content 10/10. Best duo games ever. BUT IT HAS ONE OF THE WORST SCENES EVER IN THE WHOLE GAME HISTORY.. Not a games for kids. The elephant scene is a pice of crap. And they made the man a coward and very stupid. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""It Takes Two"" for PS5 is a masterful ode to cooperative gameplay and emotional storytelling. This game is ideal for couples, or anyone looking to strengthen a bond with a gaming partner. Players take on the roles of two toys, Cody and May, who were once the living parents **** distressed by their impending divorce. The unique narrative premise is both touching and engaging, urging players to work together to navigate the complexities of their relationship through a variety of gameplay genres—from platforming and shooting to puzzles and fantasy elements. The game requires true cooperation to progress through ingeniously designed levels that blend multiple genres seamlessly. Each session with ""It Takes Two"" promises new challenges and laughter, making it far more than a casual one-time play. The emotional depth of the story adds significant weight to the gameplay, ensuring that each puzzle solved and level completed feels like a shared triumph. The sheer variety in gameplay ensures that no two sessions feel the same, making it an extensive game that can fill many evenings with joy and teamwork. Overall, ""It Takes Two"" lives up to its reputation as one of the best cooperative games on PS5. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deeply engaging and rewarding co-op experience.. The game gave both my wife and I a great time! My wife have not played much game before, but she enjoyed the game a lot. The game is a big playground and you can try all different kinds of things in it, full of surprise, and you can have fun like two kids :) :). played with my friend, to this day it is still the best coop we played together ( and we played portal 2 as well). Probably the best game for couch co-op. I like the mini-games, the fact that is not very repetitive and the addition of new mechanics. The story is kinda wack and the female doll is a bit annoying. I would say the first boss (the toolbox) is probably the hardest. It took us 10+ tries while the rest we beat from 1 try.. Beautiful game, beautiful story, very good to cooperate with a friend. Has some good puzzle solving moments, battles, chase scenes, and most cutscenes are skipabble.. Beautiful game that should be enjoyable by players of all levels. The game is expertly rendered with a sweet and compelling story. It's a game all couples should play and a game that you can play again and again and find enchanting every time.. One of the best co-op games of all time .. This game is so perfect... I'm playing with my 4yo boy and it was the first time that he was really connected to the gameplay, this game is a masterpiece. PS5 version is very good steam version have better graphics but on a later level fps can drop if using higher settings. anyway, Hazelight please, do more cooperative family games, this genre is very hungry for new games outside of nintendo and you made it.. This game is very wonderful in all respects, it has a story, wonderful drawings and a variety in the style of play, really impressive.. It Takes Two is Hazelight Studios second pure Coop-Game after A Way Out and they improved their formular in every aspect. With its unique setting, It Takes Two offers a charming story and masterfully crafted gameplay with some of the funniest levels I have seen in a Coop-Game. Unfortunately, the story can`t keep up with the gameplay all the way until the end, resulting in a fun to play, but disappointing finale. I really wish the last chapter would have been more fleshed out, sending the game off with the finale it deserves. The games second highlight besides the creative gameplay are the 2 main characters Cody and May, which are two of the most believable characters I have seen in any game in recent years. Also, the voice actors did an amazing job in bringing these characters to life and seeing their character development over the course of the game was a true joy. It took me 25 hours to see everything the game has to offer, which is okay, considering the 40€ price tag of the game at launch. Pros: Great gameplay, very well written characters and a lot of fun playing the game in couch-coop Cons: Disappointing finale, graphics are just average. Also, it would be nice to have a way to always look up the controls of your current equipment. Reviewed on PS5 in 2024.

A really good 2 player game, gameplay evolves so it doesn't get boring, universer is nice a beautiful. I really have had a good time on this game.. The best game we have played as a family. We have enjoyed every moment of it and it is a very well made game. It's hard to find anything negative to say about It Takes Two. The game really brings out the feelings you had when you first started playing games. The developers really bombard you with their ideas and different inputs. As the environment and mini-games change, you as a player have to adapt as much as the **** gameplay is really well paced and there were only a few times when we had to think about the next step and what to do. Most of the time we were surprised with clever ideas where to take the game next (the tree, the plane, Cody's garden). Honestly, I can't imagine the game getting much better, with the exception of the ending, which could use a better punch line. I would definitely recommend this game/experience to anyone.. I played this game with my brother, and we both enjoyed this game a massive amount. I won't spoil the story but it is very good and simple, it is about a couple (May and Cody) on the brink of divorce and they are transported into dolls and must work together to gain access to their real body's again. It is also one of the most creative games I've ever played. It's many different levels and settings are unbelievably creative and filled with wonderful ideas, in each different chapter of the game, May and Cody are given different abilities that are very fun and creative, and are optimised to work together. Something that I really appreciated is that the game is filled with little things you can interact with. From knocking down a trail of domino's which leads to a toy guard falling over to being able to grab fish and feed them to some nearby seals and much, MUCH more is just so fun. These don't affect the game in any way but reward creativity. Altogether the gameplay is fun, the entire game is filled with fun, creative details, and although it has a rather 'predictable' ending the story is fun to watch unwind and react to with a friend. Being able to play with a friend enhances the experience and creates some funny moments. Would definitely recommend.. An excellent atmospheric game for playing together, a wonderful storyline, I recommend it.. Perfect couch coop game Played with the wife, and we loved it so much that played the other games from the same developer. Best coop game available for PlayStation 5. My girlfriend and I loved playing through th story and unique game mechanics and varied gameplay!. This is the best game to play with your best friend.stories 9/10, gameplay 10/10. First time ever playing coop with girlfriend. We had an absolute blast. Been playing games for almost 40 years and this goes into my top 10 because i never thought id be able to bring my girl to play videogames and she'd enjoy the experience that much. Phenomenal game.. This game is truly phenomenal. I played this with my wife and as a married man,I can tell you this story is surprisingly real and relatable. The game constantly introduces new game mechanics so it never gets dull or repetitive.Like the name implies you cannot accomplish anything in this game without your co op partners help. I will say that if your co op partner is new to video games like my wife was at the time, they may struggle as it can get surprisingly challenging for novice players. Also, despite the kid friendly art style, this is NOT a game for kids. It goes to some very dark places and has some moments that are genuinely disturbing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""It Takes Two"" is a corporate project for two that not only promises to gift you several (or rather, a sufficient number of) evenings filled with interesting situations but offers a real adventure that introduces you to the touching story between Cody and **** simply won't have a chance to get bored in this game. Every few minutes, the game offers you all sorts of different techniques (and each location has its unique features); many of them are familiar from various other familiar places - there are chess, races on radio-controlled cars, ping-pong, volleyball, fights in the style of Mortal Kombat, and much more. There are so many that you literally want to smile every time you encounter something new and interesting! I liked it so much that I immediately want to give the game the highest score just for my nostalgic **** plot is engaging, andthe characters you meet along the way are interesting; Hakim alone is just fantastic! For this character, I'm ready to say - he's the best positive character in the history of games! Thanks to the developers for him! But even the secondary characters are charming enough to make you fall in love with them, despite the little time the game allows you to spend **** music - my respects - it includes a variety of tracks that are pleasant to listen to even outside of the **** for the graphics - it's evident that the game didn't have a very large budget - if we talk about human mimicry and animations. However, if you consider the toy world - it's top-notch! You just dissolve into the world of the game.Also, a key advantage for me was that this game is built on interacting with another player - so I highly recommend grabbing the game and going through it with your friends or your significant other!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What an amazing found was that game it is so cool that you can play with your significant over on the same screen and through the adventure of the characters. You can also reflect on your relationship with your loved one, so it’s much more meaningful that it would appear at first. I absolutely love that game and I recommend it to anyone who would like to have a good time... Annoying gameplay, horrible boss fights and stupid dialogues. Stopped gaming and deleted the game at a special storypoint…what a terrible story decision. Glad I didn’t have to pay and got it as a monthly goodie. Totally overrated imo.. Everchanging gameplay, it was the first game for my girlfriend and we enjoyed the game and the time together. The increasing level difficulty incerased her skills troughout thegame(she is so hot). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm not sure if I like the game or the time I have spent with my girlfriend. Fun coop game with a good story and some funny characters. The gameplay is very satisfying as well.. It Takes Two is not only a wonderful co-op experience, it’s a genuine masterpiece of platforming and interactive storytelling.. Just the BEST GAME I ever played, and I have a certain experience in gaming. If you have someone to play with, don't miss this 2player co-op gem. This game shows what games should be all about - having a good time! It is not about standard mechanics, side quests, something to grind for, game duration. It is plain and simple - having a great time. Waiting for the next Hazelight game and hoping it to be just near as good as this one. The bar was set high!. Might be one of the best games I've ever played. You can really feel the love the developers put into it. Thank you HazelightStudios, for giving me and my girlfriend many hours of fun. We really appreciated the time and effort that went into making the game a great experience.. Superb coop game that every has to **** of the smartest games of all time on the switch. not easy at all. Enjoyable, very fun and sweet video game. Co-Op Structure in this game is so well-made and Satisfying. Everything in this game is on point, Story, Characters and etc.... It Takes Two has an engaging, interesting story with incredible gaming mechanics. It offers a wide variety of gameplay changing in each area, from a platformer to a puzzle-solving game to a shooter. Each area is unique and fun with lots to explore.. Always loved coop story games because we started gaming with my brother on our PS2 and we looked for these kinds of games. This game reminds me of the good old days. So gave 9 to support and not lose these kinds of games in the future.. please, delete wrong platform. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played with gf was amazing expirience . Switch platform works ok. A perfect co-op game! I had so much funny with this game.. Perfect coop game, i had the best time with my fiance withIt.. My friend and I loved every moment ️. This game has brought back the good old feeling of playing two player games, play this with your spouse and 100% your love will be stronger as it takes two to do everything.. I'm shocked at how good this game is, and the fact that only one of two people needs to own the game. Clever and enjoyable puzzles, detailed and beautiful environments and a good story that is the perfect background to make this a fundamentally fun and cozy experience.. top. The best two player team and the best family game I played in while i had so much fun with my brother. A lengthy yet consistently entertaining and creative platformer with masterfully designed co-op gameplay. The detail and polish applied to every individual feature and minigame found throughout the journey of May and Cody is very impressive. No two areas are even remotely similar, and the wide variety of items and tools keeps things fresh. No matter who you play this game with, you will come out of it knowing you experienced something special.. One of the most special and unique co-operative gaming experiences i had the oportunity to play, along with my buddy! Platinumed and enjoyed every second of it, both of us! Totally worth the GOTY 2021 award!. It's very reminiscent of the games we played together for hours at the console when we were kids. It is one of the rare productions where you can still experience the side-by-side multiplayer experience. The sense of coordination and progress together is very strong. If you have someone you can play with, you should definitely try it. The only thing that can be said negatively is that some parts seemed a little too easy. But it certainly wasn't boring. Nice extras are that the interspersed mini-games are replayable after the game is over.. It takes all the fun of a mandatory co-op game and as a bonus, throws in your parents’ constant fighting and sniping at each other due to years of resentment!!! How could you lose? Seriously, though, the game is very fun. Any other storyline would have been a thousand times better, though. May and Cody are both intolerable and I found myself praying for their demise and Rose’s liberation. 7/10 - a story so bad you lost two points for it. So much ****, whining, and blaming each other going around it’s really hard to play with the volume up. At least you learn teamwork all the better by both of you needing to hold down a button to skip the painful cutscenes.. Wasn't sure about trying this game as I have not heard of it so wasn't expecting much. Hooked up with a friend to give it a go and I absolutely love it. Full of fun, puzzles, humour and excellent graphics and varied levels. I love that you have to work together as a team and communicate properly to get passed the puzzles. Highly recommend this game and its a blast. Excellent. 10 out of 10! This is the best game I played with my partner! I’d love to forget and replay it!. IT TAKES TWO is the best double-player game I have played. It reminds me about the original intention of playing game itself -- fun. The drawback might be getting too close relationship with your homie if you don't have a girlfriend.. the best story and the best coop game i ever played with my friend. i would pay full price for another game like that. We need more good old couch co-op games like this. Everything about it is simply fantastic! 10/10. This game can only be defined as the definitive couch co-op experience. It runs, feels, plays, and looks amazing.. Incredible, imaginative, creative game with lots of different gameplay. If you want to check your relationship with loved one, try playing this game :). Reviewing as a couple playing together on PS5 in couch co-op. Just having a good couch co-op mode gives massive points from me alone. But being this polished (at launch as we played day 1) and this fun was amazing to see. Especially when EA is the publisher... Lets not go there. As a long term couple, with 3 kids, the themes in the story were interesting and the gameplay forcing us to work together was ""interesting"" at times when either of us may have been frustrated by something (not pointing any fingers...). I definitely recommend this for people who love co-op and fun, not to difficult gameplay with friends. Thank you for reading. Enjoy Gaming.. Great game, amazing imagination of the game creators, story writers. I was truly amazed and mesmerized by everything about this game. We had one of the best times playing this game with my wife. Excitement, fun and dramatic scenes. I will be looking forward to the next game of this studio. Must buy 10/10.. This game has enough of everything. It contains shooter, 2d, platform, izometric etc etc.. A profoundly disappointing experience whose successes mostly lie in its accessibility, graphics and voice acting. I was not quite sold on the story, and found the overall gameplay frustratingly easy in a way that verged on being detestable. While the game is certainly pretty and runs quite smoothly, I found it lacking when it comes to what I see as true substance. For all the hype that had been generated around this game's quality, I found myself increasingly annoyed as I continued to play the game more and more. While the plot certainly could have been worse, it felt schmaltzy, somewhat unrealistic and oversimplified as it carried on - and considering that this game is quite dependent on its plot, I felt increasingly annoyed as this game carried on. As such, despite the greater opinion on It Takes Two, I would be lying if I said I enjoyed myself while playing it.. Gameplay (Combat/Movement/Level Design): 10 Narrative (Characters/Story/World): 7 Graphics/Visuals: 9 Sound/Music: 9 Technical (Completeness/Bug-Free): No issues A creative, engaging, fun co-op experience.. The most fun me and the wife have had since making our three children. The book of love, ain’t long and boring!. This game is great. I played it and beat it with my 10-year old and we had a blast. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a great couch co-op experience, especially with someone in the younger audience.. WHY! WHY DID THEY KILLE CUTIE! IT WAS so GOOD UNTIL THEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS WAY TO VIOLENT And SCARY!. I liked this game very much and fun experience which I would give 10 by myself but it was bit too difficult for my wife so.... Fun game! Great gameplay, good story, awesome music and visuals. For Completionists: Great/fun/easy trophy list. The “Game of the Year” effect is a real thing. A game wins GotY, you haven’t played it, and suddenly you want to try it out. Mix that with the “Hey it’s on Game Pass” effect, and before you know it I've through all of It Takes Two. Without a doubt this game deserves all of the praise it was given as the developer clearly made this game with a lot of love and passion and it really shows in this charming masterpiece. Exclusively a 2 player game, a husband and wife are turned into dolls and have to explore the world in a Toy Story like style fighting army squirrels and sentient toys along the way. The story can make you laugh and tear up so easily as you quickly become invested in its fantastic narrative. Different mini games or even just fun extra things to do are around every corner making the game just as fun to explore as it is to play. They find a way to mix so many genres into one including fighting, racing, and even dungeon crawling as a few of the many examples. This sense of adventure always brought me back with excitement to see what happens next, or what world I may explore. A garden? A toy castle? Even a snow globe?! I was always charmed and thrilled to see where this journey took me next. Honestly I cannot recommend this game enough. If you have a friend or loved one you can play alongside this game will give you hours upon hours of entertainment. And if you don’t have such a person, consider buying a copy for a friend and play it online with them. It’s a worthwhile investment and one I promise you won’t regret making. Once again, this game fully deserved its Game of the Year award, and I’m happy it won it.. It takes two is magnificent. I can clearly say that is the best coop game i’ve ever **** provides unique and friendly experience that fills two players with joy and happiness. Mostly the genre of the plot is **** whole plot and story is about a nearly divorced married couple, but at some point they are transformed into toys and they are forced to work together to transform to their real **** plot is simple, but i think thats not a problem because it works pretty well.Even in in-game interactions between May and Cody can show how deeply buried their relationship is, and how it transforms along the way of the **** in my opinion the last chapter is a bit slow and could be far more faster, but it is not a problem it all because of the **** sequence with Wasps and Squirrels is hilarious though. The gameplay provides huge variety of mechanics, each level of the game has different **** understand this variety i can male examples of my favorites - RPG, Time Control and Clone making, Hammer and Nail, Voice and Shield and far **** in total this game cant bore you, because of its variety in each level, even the puzzles are really interesting and requires impact from both players.Also there some fun mini games along the levels, and there also provides different mechanics. In conclusion i can say thats the perfect game to play with girlfriend, and amazing game to play with friends/siblings/even parents and provides unforgettable and joyful journey.This game gave me the most pleasant and relaxed experience since Stray.I recommend this game to literally everyone, it is one of the best games i’ve ever played, and i cant really imagine a player that wouldn’t like it. R.I.P Cutie 9.5/10. It's totally brilliant! Played it with my son (5) and he loved it. Excellent production quality.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just finished it yesterday. We loved it so much! The story, the variety and the gameplay are the best! Waiting for the next game from Josef Fares!. Fun enough game to play with child. My daughter was very happy to play that game. Me not that happy but ok :). Decent fun for two players. If you dont mind story on level of Hollywood movie (which is not a compliment), annoying woman behaving like a man and sissy man behaving like a woman. And terrible book. And logical mistakes that just make you roll your eyes (if you pay them any attention). On the bright side, my girlfriend had fun, liked the models (anything cute gets her).. One of the best co-op games, 10/10, I didn't get bored even for a minute while playing the game, Masterpiece. FULL DISCLOSURE: I did not finish this game. My co-op partner and I got bored by level 2 (of 7) and set the game down. TL;DR: It Takes Two is a competent game in a genre (co-op platformer) where it has virtually no competition. While not spectacular, the visuals and voice acting are better than your average videogame. It also does a good job of telling a story that is a little more grounded, relatable, and coherent than most games. However, people who play a lot of videogames may notice the sub-par level design, platforming, and puzzles. I think if you and your significant other / co-op partner are reasonably capable videogames players (e.g., grew up with games), but you aren't like, playing 15+ hours of videogames per week, It Takes Two may be one of the better videogames you'll play. Many people probably fall into this category, which I think is why it has so many favorable reviews and won PS game of the year. But from a design perspective, I think the level design and puzzles are weak, and there are GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 games from the early 2000s that have comparable or better platforming. In my experience, most of the levels played out exactly the same. First, the game gives both players a tool. These tools work together to enable the players to solve the puzzles. For example, one player gets a hammer and the other gets a nail gun. Simultaneously, the game takes away whatever tools the players received in the previous level. Then the players run down a hallway until they hit a puzzle. The players do the puzzle which lets them run down another hallway, where they do another puzzle. This repeats until the players hit some sort of autoscroller / ""run away from the collapsing stage"" section, which is followed by a boss. Its really obvious based on the puzzle design and the game's theme (e.g., two people learning to work together and repair their dysfunctional relationship) that the developers did not want players to get stuck on the puzzles and get frustrated with one another. To avoid this problem, they made the puzzles pretty easy, so much so that all the puzzles (that I played) were identical from a gameplay standpoint. First, the players are put into a room. One and only one of the players will be able to interact with something using the tool they received at the start of the level. That player presses R2 to interact with the thing. This will enable the other player to press R2 to interact with something else. This ""P1-P2-P1-P2"" or ""P2-P1-P2-P1"" pattern is repeated until the puzzle is solved. The actual ""tool"" you use to solve the puzzle is mechanically irrelevant. In one level, one player receives a hammer and the other receives a nail. The puzzles are solved by one player pressing R2 while looking at something, followed by the other player pressing R2 while looking at something. In the next level, they take away your hammer and nailgun and replace them with a sap (?) launcher and a match gun. The puzzles are solved by one player pressing R2 while looking at something, followed by the other player pressing R2 while looking at something. The platforming seems to have been designed by someone who knows what a platformer is, and is aware of platformer mechanics, but does","it takes two is a great game, mechanically . the graphics are just terrible, with constant visual glitches and pop-in . performance wise it rarely hits a solid 30 FPS and frequently chugs in the low 20s ."
592.Pokemon Y,"Great entry into 3D Pokemon games. Although it lacks features compared to the 2D entries, this has got to have been one of the best Pokemon generations ever. Had a blast playing this in high school.. The first Mainline Pokemon game to bring 3D to the series, and I'll happily hold my ground when I say its my favourite game in the entire series. Firstly, the visuals are astonishing for being the first 3D game, with beautiful lighting from the fields and dark forests, to the beaches and seas across the land. The Pokemon models and moves are really expressive with vibrant colours that really bring them to life. Pair this alongside the astonishing soundtrack, with motivational, sad, exiting and dramatic music at every turn. The story is quite normal for a Pokemon game but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the experience, with you and your new friend group exploring to achieve their dreams, whether it be Tierno wanting to become a famous dancer, to Trevor wanting to compete the Pokedex. There are various events in the story that bring you closer, from exploring the pokemon mansion, to going to a haunted house or simply having friendly battles every now and again. Pair that with the main villain Lysandre always thinking about going through with his plan of launching the ultimate weapon because of humankind ruining the beauty of the world, which leads to a moral dilemma. There are also different histories to explore, whether it be the great Pokemon war 1000 years ago, to AZ and his Floette, or the connection between Xerneas, Yveltal and Zygarde. In terms of gameplay the early access to the EXP. Share can allow you to choose the difficulty of your playthrough, with turning it off being challenging and keeping it on making it easier for more casual players to progress. There are also features like super training that make certain tasks such as EV training much easier. The game is generally happy to give you the experience you want, giving you features that allow you to fast-travel through the game, but not making them mandatory. The gimmick of this generation is Mega Evolution, and is honestly incredible, giving Pokemon that were previously unusable a chance in the spotlight, as well as just being really cool in general. While many argue the post-game is poor, I found it interesting. There are many different things you can try, whether it be the side-story with Looker and Anna, the Friend Safari or the battle château that give you different things to do. Overall, I've never had so much fun playing a Pokemon game and highly recommend it if you haven't played it already.. First of all, I'd like to point out that this is the first Pokemon game (in the main series) to be entirely in 3D. GAME FREAK has achieved this perfectly, offering us a rich and beautiful adventure (for the 3DS) in the country where I've lived since I was born, France. The villains are very good (not as good as in Black and White, but you can't do better than Team Plasma, and I'm not open to debate).. This is a masterpiece. Before the servers shut down, this was my jam, the anticipation of the wonder trade theme, the story. The trading. It was all so.... addicting but beautiful. The story mainly gets dogged on but heavily enjoyed it. Would 100% recommend no hesitation. This was the good old days. Damn I yap..... Pokemon Y marks the transition into 3d for the franchise. The 3d visuals feel very fresh and new with the Pokemon models being great. The issue of Pokemon Y are the bad battle designs and bad story. The story has a very flat development with some parts of it feeling unfinished. In terms of battle design, giving the elite 4 only 4 pokemon with no mega evolutions was very underwhelming with a 5 pokemon team for the champion making it worse. Pokemon Y does redeem itself very well in terms of its gameplay. Gameplay is very fun as with all Pokemon games with mega evolutions providing the best gimmick of any pokemon games. Online functions are also impeccable for its time in this game.. -5/10 story -5/10 gameplay -5/10 environments -5/10 characters -7/10 music. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Why are you even reading this review? GO PLAY POKEMON Y!!!. The transition to 3D was a big leap for Pokémon, but it cost them a lot in the process. The Kalos region is fine I guess, but the story is god awful and there really isn't a lot to do in general. The Pokémon themselves lost a lot of personality coming into 3D (Megas were cool at least).. Amazing musics, amazing atmosphere, great new pokemon (especially the lengendaries) and the adding of mega evolution, which makes this generation a great one for showdown battles. It has good gameplay and music but the rivals and uninteresting story is decent but nothing special and the evil organization is kind of meh. In the long run, Pokemon X and Y excels at being the closest we got to really living in a Pokemon World, but as a game it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. With the somewhat forced Team Flare, linear path given, and constant hand-holding throughout Pokemon X and Y; the game(s) overall just end on a more bitter note than a joyous one. The journey through Kalos is fun for a while, but when its over there is really nothing else to do aside from training a competitive team or collecting them all.. The main series of Pokemon games have never suffered from not being re-playable. It is part of why Pokemon games have a higher resale value than some others. The truly dedicated players out there keep every copy of Pokemon that they have obtained, which makes for slim pickings in the pre-owned Pokemon inventory of some stores. Perhaps the two biggest selling points of Pokemon X & Y are the over 60 new Kalos region Pokemon and the mega evolutions. The increased size of the Pokedex appeals to the collectors while the mega evolutions appeal to the competitive players. All in all, these games are worthy of a Pokemon player's attention.. Too easy even for pokemon. looks unpolished. A great game overshadowed by the lack of Pokémon available (especially megas) and easiness. Story is cool. Really solid and the best new gen Pokémon game. This game really gets dunked on, but it's better and more innovative than most new gen Pokémon games including ORAS. Fun world traversal, Mega-Evolution, great graphics and actually interesting villains for once in a franchise known for extremely subpar stories. Barely in 4th place, this entry is memorable and a testament to how these games can still be amazing if the effort is put in.. I formerly disliked this game along with the rest of Generation six when I first tried them, but once I got to actually appreciate the good parts I ended up really liking this game. Mega Evolution is my favorite generational gimmick, because it takes Pokemon I already liked and makes them even better! I do think this game is somewhat too easy and lacks postgame, but other than that I recommend this over the Switch games namely SwoShiCrap and ScatVomit. UPDATE: I accidentally put a 2/10 on this game, I did not intend to do so. I was writing the review from my mobile device and may have accidentally touched the wrong button. Sorry for the inconvenince, my actual score is 9/10.. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Despite welcoming Pokemon into the 3D world, Pokemon Y fails to take the challenge seriously. Unnoteworthy characters, a terrible bad guy team, muted ambiance, and a bare-bones narrative culminate in a title better left unplayed among plenty of others that came before and after it.. This game was ok it was easy but like the fun and bad kind of funny. But i didn’t like that every gym leader has 3 Pokémon and every E4 member has 4 Pokémon which makes sense but come on Nintendo that’s to easy we’re not 5 year olds. Pokémon x y is still the same title, and X & Y keep making the gameplay evolve little by little. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my favourite Pokémon game. This is the game that revived the series as it added many new features. This is the game that was universally adored at release to only be hated one day out of the blue. When asking why “Pokémon fans” suddenly hated this game they say it’s too easy and empty. Easy, yes. Pokémon games aren’t hard. Empty, no. It’s the same as every other Pokémon game. Gyms, Defeat bad team, Defeat E4, have mini side quest (looker), catch all Pokémon. So if the other Pokémon games aren’t empty, this one isn’t either. This is the game I had the most fun with. 10/10. It's a very mediocre game overall. Probably the most okay Pokémon game there is. There's nothing wrong about it, it just isn't all too special. The jump to 3D was appreciated and desperately needed.. 6/10. One of my favourite mainline Pokemon games. Mega evolution was a cool concept, the 3d felt really cool as a child. As a child, really conveyed the sense of adventure. However, does not hold up great today.. Pokémon XY are a severe downgrade from B2W2 in just about every way. The new Pokémon are fairly underwhelming and lame (Except Sylveon). Character designs are bland, 3D was interesting for a while, but i hate it now. Its taken away all the charm from sprites and i wish they would just go back to 2D. Music is alright i guess and Mega Evolution was a fantastic addition, much better than Z moves and those awful big Pokémon of gen 8. Its feels like they cut corners everywhere too. Next to no postgame either. The story is immensly lame and has been told better through the anime and Adventures manga. This generation marked the beginning of Pokémon's decline and has continued since. A bit bland, but definitely fun main campaign, yet a really lackluster post game. There was a lot of novelty in seeing all the pokemon in 3D for the first time, but after this game, pokemon games unfortunately lost their visual distinctiveness. 64/100 Compared to the previous one it's such a disappointment. It feels half finished sadly. This game is the first on the franchise to be fully modeled on 3D, and I think it looks really good. The gameplay is similar at other Pokémon games, but somehow it seems like it lacks some content, and the story isn't that much interesting. The region itself, apart from Lumiose City, is kinda bland and forgettable. But not everyhing is bad. The music is kinda good, the megas and the new Pokemon have great designs and online mode (at least on the time I played it) has some really cool features. Overall not the best Pokemon game but a decent one.. Broken balance. I have 7 overpowered pokemons (+10 lvl) after second gym. Despite the fact that I changed them all the time and went strictly according to the plot.. the best online infrastrufture the series ever had, and it's stuck on the goddamn 3ds.. The introduction of the beautiful main saga to 3D, and a glorious update of the foundations of Pokémon. The most user-friendly competitive was founded, and the way of combat became richer from now on.. I absolutely love this game! Even though I sadly lost the cartridge, I still have extremely fond memories of beating gym leaders, shoving coins under my circle pad overnight to do circles around the Prism Tower in Lumiose city to get poke miles, and catching Yveltal ! The memories of playing this game at my grandma's house on Christmas day of 2014 are some of the greatest memories that I still cherish to this day. I also like how you use roller skates for faster movement instead of the generic bike like most other pokemon games.. Great jump to 3D! But... Meh in almost every other aspect. Pokémon designs are great this time around, region is good and customization too but: Story is as bad as before, similar to Diamond and Pearl bad storytelling. The level curve of these games are on pair with Gold and Silver being the worst in the franchise but this time making the game awfully easy, postgame is almost inexistent just like in Sword and Shield.. very good game i love pokemon y and i have so much good stuff and i still play that game to this day very good game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No postgame,the game needed more story hence why they were making Pokemon Z version but they scrapped it. Good game especially compared to the Gen 8 abomination aka Sword and Shield. For the first 3D Pokemon game, it's a masterpiece. It's the kind of adventure i and, everyone expect from a Pokemon game. The story is excellent with some heavy emotion parts. The Kalos region is also really nice to travel through. But the thing i love the most about this game is the OST. All the themes are memorable and as a VG music lover, i can't do nothing else than listening to the whole album again and again. The musics are cleverly composed and convey such emotions that i can't stop crying while listening it. For me, it's a Must-Play in the Pokemon series which worth way more than the actual Sword and Shield games that feel rushed beside this true video game monument. I can't do anything than encourage you, even 7 years after, to play this game again. (Oh, yea, i almost forgot the Mega evolution which was a revolution in the pokemon series (where is my Mega Charizard in SwSh ;-c ) and the really fun mini games you could play with your pokemons). It’s probably just nostalgia but I’ve played this game at least 4 times and it’s quite fun. While I wish we got to see more Pokémon diversity in some of the parts still a great game.. Honestly I like Yveltal which is why I rated this game 6/10 instead of 5/10. I really don't like the difficulty its to easy I guess that this game is aimed at smaller kids who dont know anything about pokemon :/ The story is decent the graphics are fine but theres so much dialog and cutscenes I was lucky to get a shiny Froakie in 13 attempts if i did more I wouldve gave up as it takes 5 minutes per 1 attempt for hunting shiny starters anyway decent game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The sixth generation of pokemon manages to revitalize the franchise with the introduction of it's first truly 3D entry on a handheld device. All the new pokemon models, the beautiful landscapes, the elevated level of writing (compared to it's predecessors), and all new mechanisms like mega evolution simply made this game feel FRESH. It isn't iconic and revolutionary the way some of its predecessors are, it has it's issues, but it's still a must play for any pokemon fan.. First mainline pokemon game to go 3d. The pokemon models look great, compared to the character models which look like bobble heads. The new pokemons in this game look great and the new fairy typing is a cool addition.. Not bad for the first entry into 3ds, but the worst pokemon game, 'adjusted for inflation'. I mean if you take the quality-of-life features out of it, by inflation. The 'friend' group that you have is awful compared to all the others. (Not a high bar to reach, but there ya go.) The amount of pokemon included with the game is great. But why? Every, EVERY time they add another 150ish pokemon to a game, they nerf and rebalance the game. While this is understandable, it really shines in some games, more than others. PokemonXY has some great newer generation pokemon, and the rest is now hundreds, HUNDREDS of mediocre pokemon that lost THAT much more reason to use 'em. The story is awful, and the writing is worse. Did they try to create more of a bad guy? Yes. Which means a harder fail. It makes for pretty good memes about awful speeches, though. The french aspect to the game means plenty of bourgeoise nonsense, which is fine... until you play some of the better regions. Ulola (Hawaiian) region is AMAZING, compared to XY. I'm partial to New York / Unova, but whatevs. Now all of this is fine, but what really gets me is the pacing of XY. Pokemon games are notoriously bad at pacing, you might reach and get the first lvl20 badge while your party has level 25s... but then find yourself getting the lvl40 badge and you dont even have any lvl 30s in your party. HOW DOES THIS WORK?! Ahem, but anyway.. the story and the diffiulty progression arent just OFF, they are 'off' as in.. there are long stretches of road with few trainers or any story.. no great pokemon to catch.. just filler areas. There are story areas that slow the game to a halt while you go watch a fireworks show or investigate what team undeveloped is doing over in Paristown or Fleur De Lisville. And MEGA EVOLUTIONS OMFG they ****. Absolute garbage temporary evolutions that, at worst.. arent sufficiently explained via the story, and at worst turn great pokemon into barely powered-up versions of themselves that still dont address their typematching and weaknesses. I didnt like Z-power, either.. but at least it didnt try to replace proper evolution! Powering up a move type is far better. Weak region, weak story, weak balancing, 3d effect barely used on 3d systems, framerate issues, weak pacing, no post-endgame stuff. Whatever you guys enjoy this game will be replaced by the next game you play. Try Sun/moon and sword/shield.. you'll never go back to XY, again. (Hell, even ORAS or BW12 is more streamlined and accessible, outside of water regions or confusing cities). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not the worst, but meh. The game at the end is fun, but story is dull. It's better than Sword and Shield, but is not the best thing out there. If you're looking for a good Pokémon game this is not the case.. Honestly, this game was pretty good at best. It definitely has to be the worst main line Pokemon game I've played, but it wasn't garbage. The visuals were okay. I just hate the fact all the characters and Pokemon are so stiff. Like, the N64 and Wii had Pokemon move way more. Also, I'd rather imagine a realistic render of my character talking and wandering around than see a 3d model just... stare wirh no expression. The exp share for all Pokemon were nice. One thing I really didn't like was how easy it was. Due to the fact everyone was always around the same level as you, even without grinding, you never had to really train too much. You just kind of beat them. The gyms and elite 4 were a breeze. I beat them on the first try. Pokemon designs were good. World design was nice for a 3ds. Game freak definitely could've done better.. It is a good game with loads of new graphics, moves and mega evolution. The new Pokémon designs are very good. Only problem is that characters are plainer than usual and there is no post game at all.. Pokemon Y is quite the innovative piece of art. The overarching theme of the game, being a lush Paris lifestyle with lots of gardens and villages, follows you throughout the entire game, while still keeping slight contrast. Game Freak had a lot on their plate trying to nudge Pokemon towards the world of 3D, and they did a great job of keeping it tame. Changing up the art style and dimensions of an already successful franchise is tough business, but Game Freak knew what kind of work they had cut out for them. Music carried the heart and soul of Pokemon through the entire game, reminding you that when you enter a new city, or your Pokemon is sent out to battle, that this is still the Pokemon adventure you set off on long ago. The Mega Evolution idea was very interesting, and added a cool new power to play around with about half way through the game. It immediately made sense as part of the Pokemon world, even if you don't quite understand it at first. The story of the game follows suit with the rest of Pokemon games. It's not awfully original, but the developers clearly tried to draw a line in the story to make it stand out from the rest. In all honesty, it didn't feel like a whole new world, just a new region to explore and conquer, which I loved, though I'm not sure how new Pokemon players feel about the lack of hand holding. Pokemon designs are fresh, the region and story stand out from the crowd, and there are several new features to get accustomed with and enjoy. There isn't much wrong with this game at all other that it's seemingly careful approach to not diverge from the typical ideas of the Pokemon series. Even then though, they pulled it off well and made sure it didn't fall into forgetfulness. Being not an awfully hard game, it's worth the pickup for anybody with a 3DS looking for a new adventure to dive into.. Story **** (thanks god we had the great SM after this), difficulty is the worst by far in the series and the game feel unfinished. After all, those games are not as bad as people say, but are not the best entries.. This may be nostalgia from being my first Pokemon game, but Generation 6 was certainly one of the best main series games for Pokemon game with brilliant graphics for a 3DS game, Interesting new Pokemon and starters, and a brilliant entry point for new players to the series. I just wish that they had made the villain team more interesting, it seems like they were running out of ideas. Overall, one of the greatest 3DS games to date.. there are so many pokemon you can catch. why couldn't sword and shield be more like this?. Probably too late at this point to write a review for Pokemon Y after first playing it 6 years ago. It was the first time the series gets 3D-ed and to be fair, GameFreak did an overall good job in tweaking every core thing into the 3D environment. Even though the lackluster main story and lack of post-game content do hurt, this is still a good Pokemon game considering it to be the first-ever 3D pokemon game.. I loved Mega Evolutions, pokemon like Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Mega Metagross, etc ... the gameplay was awesome like always, and breeding is easier, good job. Generic Pokemon game but mega evolutions makes it way more enjoyable. Starters from kento also make it more fun. Once again, Game Freak hits the nail squarely on the head, making Pokémon X and Y an excellent new addition to the series' expansive library. Thanks to the simultaneous multi-region release date more players than ever before will be able to experience first-hand that indescribable sensation of unearthing brand new Pokémon that have nimbly avoided the dreaded internet leaks. A wonderful blend of excitement and nostalgia, Pokémon X and Y evolves the core series with its impressive polygonal 3D environments and magical camera angle mastery, adding a few technical adjustments along with a brand new Pokémon type to the original formula that we all know and love. It's not quite a revolution — and is hindered slightly by the meagre use of its host platform's glasses-free 3D capabilities — Pokémon X and Y is sure to steal the hearts of Pokémon fans new and old alike.. A very good jump to 3D for the main series, but, with a boring history and characters without charisma. The post-game is a disappointment.. Music: 4/5 Game Play: 4.5/5 Graphics: 4.5/5 Story: 4/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall: 4.0/5. Best pokemon game on 3ds. the end forever and ever and even after that.................................................... Pokémon Y is still a great game 5 years after its launch. The graphics hold up well and are supported by an appealing art style. Rather than pixelated models of the previous generations, models here are full 3d, which means the battles look like more like the anime then ever before. The gameplay is still solid- if a little easy- with a really deep and complex metagame. The soundtrack is pretty good. The overworld is very well crafted; I enjoy just getting on my bike and strolling through Kalos. But the game has some issues. The story isn't well executed, and the characters are flat and one-dimensional. While I see what they were trying to go for, most of the real interesting story elements are shoved in the back of the game. I wont go into details because of spoilers, but if you want to see the story the way it was intended, watch Pokémon XYZ. But back to now, even with its issues, I recommend you try and find a copy of Pokémon Y.. Okay. Pokémon Y. I just tought that might be a little hard to say something about pokémon without going back into the past and making comparisions... anyway here we go; My first and only experience with pokémon games until pokémon y was with my smartphone playing pokémon crystal. I knew the show back then, but never give much attention. The Game Pkm Y: SUper Training: IS awesome. If u like to have strong monsters with you. Sadly, your strenght will be test only online, because the story mode of this game is way too easy (and I Hated ((off) thinking of buying the Pkm Alpha Shappire that I've heard it is a challenging exxperience)). Im beating for the third time now ((off) i sort of regret to not have bought the X version... anyway), and somehow still having some joy. The graphics: well, Its not good. Not Ugly. But not pretty. ((off)Pkm Ultra M/S IS BEAUTIFUL) I think there is a big variety of monsters rather than others games: while some have what, 150? 200?, Pokémon Y has FOUR HUNDRED or so. I dont give the minimal **** the the story because is realy weak. And well. That is that.. For what it felt like an experiment on the part of Game Freak, Pokémon XY ended up being a pretty cool game. Spent over 500 hours playing this game when it first came out, even when the story felt short and the post-game is pretty much non-existent. Still, I felt that this generation was the first time since forever where the new Pokémon didn't feel like filler Pokémon. The Mega Evolution is one of the best parts of the game for sure.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Meh, not the worst, but easily not the best Pokemon game. Mega Evolutions were the new thing brought from XY, and, well, they're just ok. Pros: + Region: Not a perfect region, but I most certainly liked running around Kalos for a while. + Variety: I mean, a freaking sword? Probably my favorite design despite being just swords and a shield in it's final form. Cons: - Mega Evolution: Why is it that we need to go full-on Digimon? - Story: Team Flare ****. They're obnoxious and pointless filler (especially the admins), though not as bad as the next point. - ""Rivals"": BY FAR the worst of the franchise. They made an already unmemorable story even worse. - Soundtrack: Only song I like from the games is Lumiose City. Overall, Pokemon X and Y aren't bad, but they aren't that good either and warrant a 6/10 from me.. Really? 8.6. This is just the WORST Pokémon game by far. To play this, better play ""Sun and Moon"" or ""Black and White"". This is just easy, boring, and the worst story with Ruby and Sapphire. The worst.. Pokemon X/Y is in 3D and that the only selling point; a feature many old DS games had going. Everything else is bare bones and played as safe as possible. This game adds fewer additions than any other and constantly feels like fanservice with granting you the original starters and making charizard mega-evolve twice. Once the 3D thing wears off Pokemon Y is one of the most bare-bones games in the franchise with little going on, a laughable story that tries too hard to be serious and comes off even more silly than other games and even the music is forgettable at times. Now that the newer 3D installments have appeared there's no reason to come back to this generation for anything other than the completionists. At its core however it is still a pokemon game; but it plays everything so safe that's not a surprise. First 3ds game, pros include a very expansive, gigantic feeling region and pokedex, a whole new type, and adding much needed evolutions to the games like customization and 3d model battles.. This game brought pokemon into the 3D world and it did a good job of it. Unova region was awesome, especially the huge city in the middle which still remains my favorite city. It was such a fun and beautifully done game!. Pokemon X and Y is unprecedented in the history of Pokemon, akin to the likes of Stadium, X and Y turn the formula on its 3 dimensional head, but while the aesthetic will never be the same again, its game play was over all very easy and the post game was pitiful. This was honestly the first pokemon game I actually played for a while and the only one I felt like I ever enjoyed. Mostly because I got into the game because of my family and any game that we all play together I will actually invest time in because that makes it more competitive. This game had a lot to add that was later just copied over to other games which is why I feel this was the only one I thought deserved this high of a rating. Not much else other than that though. Story was pretty boring and I wasn't a huge fan of the 3d either. For old players: the good ol' pokemon adventure, a light-hearted pass-time that will make you feel better For returning players: New type and the first main series game to go full 3d models, with cell-shading For new players: perfect entry point, it's simple yet very traditional. Great Pokemon game, feel really fresh and addition of 3d battles, exp share and many more, really improves on old classic formula. I only wish that the Kalos had more personality and there's no real rival like you would expect from Ppkemon games. Plot is rather boring.. Disappointing compared to the originals and way to easy. In my opinion the Pokemon games get worse each game. It's not terrible and X and Y have a lot of good points such as the game looking great. However in my opinion the positives just don't outweigh the negatives enough for me to love this game. Again I enjoyed playing it but it was still incredibly disappointing.. this is a great game it has its problems like other games the game is to easy with an xp share when you reach the champion I was around levels above here pokemon what I like about the game is the graphics and seeing are favourite pokemon in 3d I also like how you communicate with other friends its good would be a higher score if it as somewhat challenging.. I really enoyed. this game,loved the mega evolutions.I am not a super mega pokemon fan that know every pokemon or a breeder for stats etc.I just play the game for fun and this game was really fun for me to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Megas are awesoe, new pokemon are awesome, 3D is awesome, music is awesome, Everything is Awesome, my fav starter is delphox because of fire psychic typing I LOVE IT. Its a Pokemon game you know what you're getting into A new story with basically the same mechanics i enjoyed until i beat the Elite 4. The great flaw of the game its the post game which left almost nothing to players to do.. Pokemon Why indeed. Where do I start... Positives: -The game is now in full 3d -The end credits music was really good -They fixed the type balance by adding the fairy type -You can change haircuts now, which was really needed in BW2 Okay, now the ""fun"" part, the negatives: -It's in 3d but it's really bad looking for a 3ds game, these graphics would have fit more on a DS -The musics were pure pop music crap and didn't felt like pokemon music at all -The customisation is very limited -Only 70 new pokemon, okay, this could be seen as good but their designs are still ridiculous. -The controls are awful, either it's too stiff with the D-Pad and too slippery with the analog stick because you can't take the rollers off -The rollers, they're slippery, they're very uncomfortable to use -Kalos is a very boring and generic pokemon region, and also really small compared to B2W2 (maybe the second smallest region after Kanto) -The bad guy is awful and wouldn't be accepted as a cheesy spy film villain (his plan being to kill everybody) -The ""Rivals""... They are so awful, they are all the same character, the happy go lucky kid that stalks you everywhere and are a real pain (also, got to share the glory by doing absolutely nothing to save the region) -The addition of mega-evolutions completely broke the solo game -No end game (I know ther",the visuals are astonishing for being the first 3D game . the story is quite normal for a Pokemon game but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the experience . the gimmick of this generation is Mega Evolution .
593.Deathloop,"Went in without any previous knowledge or expectation. Really solid, great game design & interesting story. Develops well throughout and plenty to explore. Gets a little repetitive near the end game - but with a loop mechanic at its core I would expect it to be more so than it is. Would recommend.. Probably the best shooter I’ve ever played. It’s so satisfying. Amazing maps with sooo much to find, so many tunnels and secrets that open up over time with the story. Amazing weapons and extras that are improved play by play. Amazing style. Progression and story are so well balanced. If you think it’s less than a 9, you have up just a little too early.. Deathloop has some really novel execution, and very fun stuff going on. Arkane honing their level design sensibilities with the express purpose of replaying, per the time loop, the same few levels again and again in slight variations was an inspired decision. Some of the plot writing, less so. The game is still fun to play, so long as one isn't handily outmatched by the asymmetrical PVP and prevented from playing at all by a better gamer. Oh well! There's always next loop.. A genius gameplay loop that never collapses under the weight of its own ambition. Nearly limitless possibilities with gameplay and customization. The story can't catch up, but this is worth playing just to mess around in the game's world with its strange rules.. A wonderful game with elaborate game design and increased motivation for challenge. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it was fun for a couple of hours. then it got boring. the concept is fine, the graphics and mechanics. but the game is just not fun. Other than repeating the same thing over and over, this game doesn't have much going for itself.. This game made me feel like a kid again. What an astonishing, revolutionary game. Start to finish absolutely masterful and breathtaking. What a game. Top 5 games of all time easily.. Arkane: synonymous with artistic direction of the highest **** game in terms of design presents several notable problems (such as the imbalance of perks which often lead the player to choose the three usual ones) but the direction and ingenuity that they also had at a script level to justify the bland opposing AI remains of absolute value. The invasions remain quite fragile as in some cases the structure of the game itself and are easily broken within the gameplay, but the experience still remains strangely exciting. Good new IP. Fresh game, very different. It was very confusing at the start but once you figure out how weapons and mods work, it becomes very enjoyable. Also, the story was very interesting and the ending was satisfying. Overall a must-play game.. One of the best games I have ever played. I played it two years ago but still remember the layout of all maps. Top notch art design and music. It's sort of rogue-like but each run carries some progress even if you get taken out. When you finally piece together all the puzzles and clues and break the loop it feels really satisfying.. At first you might have problem understanding the game, but after you realizing what's going on, deathloop will become one your best played games.. If you gave me this game and Prey to play, I would've bet money on this being the game made first. So much of it feels like a smaller, less thought out game that has mechanics that remind of Prey (and Dishonored), just done much worse. It's fun enough to play, for a while. But just like Prey you end up spending far too much time covering the same areas. Except here it's worse because the gameplay is far less varied and the areas are small and boring. It also doesn't help that the game is incredibly easy and the AI is some of the most braindead I've come across in gaming. As for the story, well, it might as well not be there. It has some nice potential, but that's about all it has. The characters are also nothing to write home about, though at least I thought Colt was entertaining enough as a protagonist. Frankly, I like this game a lot more in the first few hours, but after that it becomes clear you've discovered everything about the gameplay loop and there isn't enough there to justify all the hours you have to put in to reach the ending (that's also very unsatisfying). I can't even imagine replaying this game as the repetition has soured me on it so much. It's a shame but at least I can start playthrough 333 of Prey now and pretend Arkane might make another game like it.. Deathloop really is a quintessence of everything Arkane has been building over the last two decades or so. It blends gameplay elements from all of its recent games: stealth elements and powers akin to Dishonored, gunplay and turrets from Prey, roguelike repetition elements from Prey Mooncrash, and even the mighty kick from Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. Story-wise, in my opinion, it is an improvement over Arkane's previous titles, as it still features amazingly immersive lore and expertly designed environmental storytelling, and this time around adds plenty of dialogue and actually well-written characters. The game does have a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, as you are overwhelmed by the abundance of overlapping game mechanics, but the game does guide you quite well in the beginning hours until setting you free into the endless loop. The progression in Deathloop is very satisfying, as you meticulously piece together a plan to eliminate 8 targets in a single day, gain increasingly powerful equipment and abilities, and figure out the story on three levels of scale: about Colt, Julianna and the Visionaries; about Blackreef, its history and the Anomaly; and about the general world the game takes place in. I felt the ending was a bit underwhelming and posed more questions than answers, much like Arkane's previous games, but after reading more about it on Reddit, I was blown away and am very intrigued about what the studio is going to do next. I mean beyond Redfall which I heard to be a letdown, and Blade, which I fear may also steer away from the immersive sim genre that the studio excels at.. Final thoughts after completing deathloop entirely. This is a great game that focuses on a balanced combination between stealth, parkour and FPS. It is the best game of arcane studios for me just slightly above either prey or dishonored 2 and is also probably the best first person stealth game I played. So what keeps deathloop for being a masterpiece I think even though is a pretty great game is generally the variety in either environments, enemies or weapons and even though that's the intend of the game being a loop it still can be pretty repetitive mostly because blackreef is just so small. What the game makes best for me is keeping the story interesting without overwhelming you with cinematics, is a tale that keeps you engaged to what is finally going to happen,also Colt I believe is a pretty great protagonist, funny and down to earth. Also the shooting is very solid even though most times is not exactly necessary to use it at all. The different abilities even though they are not anything new for Arcane still are fun to use and they can make you feel like a real unstoppable assassin. The design of the game, graphically on PS5 is superb and the game overall is quite gorgeous.Certainly a very well crafted game just not exactly a masterpiece for me personally.. Good grapichs, good voice acting and plot, but the gameplay loop is too long and boring and doesnt push youcompleting the game. Deathloop is one of the most tedious games ever. There are just four small locations which you grind again and again, with very little things changing. Gameplay is the same all along. Its average at best and unbearable at worst. Enemies are never a danger until they swarm you in absurd numbers. The real danger are traps that are very hard to see and they can instakill you. After every successful mission you have to reconnect to a server which gives you a long loading screen. But if you fail a mission, too bad, you have to manually skip a full in game day in one of the worst menus ever in a video game. Opening the menu during a mission is a bad idea since its also very laggy and can crash the game, probably due to the terrible server of this game. The story is a confusing mess with an unsatisfying ending. Its so much random, irrelevant garbage you just stop caring. The immersive sim elements are arbitrary and often illogical. The puzzles are basically all ""click on every random prop until you get the code then enter it somewhere"" and the game does a super poor job at visually highlighting stuff. Its mind numbing. Deathloop has some of the worst puzzles I have ever seen (shoutout to Fias reactor). At last the online invasion mode is broken and barely works even with good connection. Overall there isnt anything good here besides the art style and the music. Deathloop is somewhat creative, but its not good. 3/10. Certainly one of the best games I've ever played, the way it makes you not only evolve in combat, but also in the knowledge you acquire by playing. Another really cool thing is the charisma of the characters, especially Collt and Juliana, it shows that they are the same people but with different opinions. A very creative, fun and funny game. Despite a slow start and some repetitive content, the immense creativity and truly revolutionary mechanics of Arkane's latest great game make it a must-play for all FPS fans. Starting with its technical achievements, it flawlessly takes advantage of the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller while looking great; the assets are shockingly high definition and each locale is beautifully rendered. The gunplay is phenomenal, with decent variety and great customizability. The powerful abilities allow for hilarious situations and plenty of ways to take advantage of the canonically idiotic NPCs. At the end of the day, Deathloop delivers a ridiculously immersive, addictive, and fun experience that should not be missed.. It honestly feels like we are taking crazy pills for not admiting this game was a miss and dissapointment. Let's admit it now, enough years have passed. It was a miss.. Fantastic story and solid mechanics. Learning something new each loop made for a fantastic progression system.. It was very fun and entertaining. Surprisingly it doesn't feel repetitive. Probably, because the gameplay is there, and it's all I can ask for.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After coming off of beating returnal I was excited for another time loop game but this wasn't anywhere close I dropped it about 7 hours in. Found the repetitive nature of this game very grindy and was not for me. 4/10. I love this game. Pure fun. My favourite FPS game after DOOM Eternal.. this is a good game. but the story structure is waayyy more linear than the marketing made it out to be which unfortunately hurts it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If You hate revisiting the same map with different layouts, you'll hate it. The plot is sometimes a bit confusing, but when You get a grasp of it - its just like other Arkane games -very satisfying to mix all different playstyles. Don't be afraid to have some fun and experiment!. played.. Voice acting and the setting is top notch.love the Julianna invading mechanic by other players.love the story.gunplay is solid.enemy ai bit of a letdown. worst optimized game ive seen in a while. even battlefield 3 looks better than this but still it runs like crap. if you actually think your pc could run this than yea, you should give it a try.. Deathloop starts out extremely fascinating. The first 5-7 play hours are fun and intriguing with new information and details. Unfortunately, the further we move, the more the game fades into repetitious loops, where in a full circle we learn only one new code combination or find only one new plot note. We hear only a couple of new dialogues that shed light on what is happening, and everything around us becomes increasingly more and more boring and tedious. If the game had been a quarter or even a third smaller, it would have benefited from it. In its current form, it really lacks story, dialogues, cutscenes, plot details and unique action to justify its size. The game ending itself is reminiscent of a mediocre mystery movie, the most interesting part of which was the trailer and the movie beginning, but all the good fall apart way before the credits roll.. It’s a really interesting game and I was impressed with it. its good is it a 10 HELL NO WTF WERE THEY THINKING WHEN IGN GAVE THIS A 10 don't get me wrong its a great game. game play solid art direction amazing story its alright but it's definitely not a 10. the multiplayer has the stability of a rubber band which is also what you spend most of the time doing, but once it works it slaps so hard.. Voice acting and the setting is top notch.love the Julianna invading mechanic by other players.love the story.gunplay is solid.enemy ai bit of a letdown. Colt awakens on a beach with very little memory as to why he is there and soon discovers that he is trapped repeating the same day over and over. The time loop concept undoubtedly had potential, but it’s largely squandered thanks dull stealth gameplay, the disappointingly straightforward objectives and the way the game seems intent on holding your hand all the way through. As someone that enjoyed the Dishonored games, this was a huge disappointment.. Eh. Game is fine. Gameplay loop is solid but that’s about all it has. Somewhat interesting setting and premise but not executed well. Visual design is good. Colt is a cool character. But everything is mediocre to just decent. Reviewers gassed it up too much. I really enjoyed this game a lot! The story is ok, and the NPC's can be kind of dumb. However the gameplay mechanics and ""loop"" brings so much. Perhaps not the very best from Bethesda Softworks, but a great experience nonetheless. This game lts no a shooter. Is a rouguelike with to bad in mechanics. There only 4 scenarios not pretty good and tiny. I know the game it's about a Bucle that you had to stop it, but it's annoying earing one and one again the same dialogs and killing the same bosses too repetitive. Grafics looks good with one or two bugs and the story is fine but this condition the game mechanics.. This might be my favorite Arkane Studios game to date. The gameplay, music, and the way you keep finding more clues to progress in the story really has me hooked. I loved that they implemented gyro controls for the dual sense. This is a 'must buy' if you are into Dishonored. No doubt looking forward to more stealth games by Arkane.. Deathloop has by far some of the most unique and deep level design i have ever seen. Events and accessible places change from morning, afternoon, noon and evening. One map feels like it contains several levels worth of content in it at times too. All of the visionaries are unique and the witty banter between colt and juliana is perfect. This game WOULD be a 10, the glitches do pull it back though. Nothing game breaking at all, just minor stuff but it's still a flawed product because of them. I'd say pick this up ASAP.. Imagine you take Dishonored, and combine it into one whole journey with really great time looping abilities and it is a masterpiece that was a former PS5 exclusive. Gameplay was on point, graphics was beautiful, the story is complicated but fun, and overall it is my favorite game of 2021, my favorite Arkane game next to Dishonored and 2017’s Prey and this is a game where I pretend that Redfall didn’t exist.. This game is very boring and confusing Unbalanced difficulty, enemies pressed to the wall, horrible weapon playability just a 0/10. I am not the type of guy who doesn't finish games but this one I just couldn't. After progressing long enough I had no energy to continue on. The combat is unbalanced AI is dumb and there is no risk factor other than the raid the antagonist does.. I am sorry to say this i was expecting more from this game. A very boring game You feel like you’re pushing yourself to play the game. This games amazing. Takes a minute to get used to the mechanics, but the gameplay and storyline work great together with all the guns and special abilities.. A very mediocre game and Arkane's laziest work in my opinion (and I love Dishonored). Very boring, repetitive, and forgettable. I do not recommend playing this one at all.. waste of time brain dead developer rubbish waste of time brain dead developer rubbish waste of time brain dead developer rubbish waste of time brain dead developer rubbish. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think the concept is cool but it's gets pretty old pretty fast and I feel in a genre as oversaturated as the FPS genre you have to do something unique in your gameplay and this just comes off as generic. I do like the main character and the way his story is presented.. The well known menu bug still exists even after the last patch. This bug makes the game unplayable, because you have to restart the game when it occurs and because there are no saves within a day you will lose all your progress on that day. If you‘re unlucky, several hours of effort are gone. It occured to me twice within 4 hours of total playtime. 4 Hours of wasted life.. Gameplay super basic get boring fast its like playing bioshock 1 with no powers dialog is trivial why would any want to here this man cry like a child to some random person trying to kill them is beyond stupid who want to hear the elementary conversations all day games **** yall overhyped this way too much. We finally have a winner... Most boring game ever is created and bring high standards of boringness!!!!. I havent finished it yet, it gets kinda hard at the end even with all the upgraded weapons. I like the visuals, gameplay, and characters. It's fun and immersive, just a bit repetitive, especially frustrating when you die. It's a slog to finish, but I'm enjoying it.. I faced a few times with menu hanging bugs and crashes, this is not what I expected from the game which was released about 1.5 years ago.. Horrible controls, terrible writing, a waste of my life, please avoid this atrocious game. Solid, SOLID game. Super fun and intriguing plot. Art direction and presentation are goated. The only gripe I have is that multiplayer is the default when I just wanna engage with the single-player experience. I'm glad the option was available to shut off the invading aspects. It's a cool concept, but not for me. This is seriously a must-play. Love this game, give it a try it's really. It's a 10/10 intelligent game. Unique gameplay, writing, visuals, and voice acting = all are top-notch! Bravo, Arkane!. This game is horrible and overhyped. Menu system is horrible and outdated, the game is a repetitive mess, the characters are not likeable (annoying sounding protagonist and antagonist), and the game has tons of freezing and crashes. Avoid this trash!. Great concept, horrible AI, decent gameplay but gets repetitive very fast, somewhat decent story.. I really love this game. If you liked Dishonored I feel you'll love this aswell. Slightly held back because I feel there's a lack of options towards the endgame and the buildup is very slow. Takes a lot of hours to get into it and the game spoonfeeds you a lot of stuff. Still a great game.. Literally one of the most over hyped game of the new generation. I just stopped playing due to boredom and the lack of meaningful engagement. The graphic are mediocre, the sound is mediocre, there's no story and it feels like it's missing something. I did not like Deathloop due to the following: 1. Dated Graphics, this game could have been made on PS3. The Dishonored series looks better than Deathloop. 2. Gameplay feels flat 3. There's nothing next generation about this game. The dishonored series has better sound effects, level design, and everything else. 4. if you played and loved Dishonored you will hate this game. 5. AI is beyond bad. 6. Sound effects are terrible I really felt I wasted my money on Deathloop.. This game gets boring very fast. Same repetitive gameplay. The story is uninteresting. I found myself rushing to finish the level just to see if the game would get better. I would try to play stealthily but the stealth mechanics are bad. I thought it was supposed to be like dishonored. Dishonored was awesome. Like hell is this a 10 out of 10 game.. Deathloop was actually pretty fun for me, but not a 10/10 masterpiece like IGN has so thoughtfully stated. The story is about unraveling the mystery of the time loop, and Colt's decent into breaking it in order to free the other people caught in it. The story was fun and interesting, with it's fitting tone and writing of goofiness, but not super emotionally investing. The gameplay is a bit repetitive. There are fun abilities you can use like the teleport and the havoc ability, which lets you throw enemies around, but in order to obtain and level up these abilities, you'll have to do some grinding. Another part of the gameplay is finding clues to discover how to take out all the visionaries in the same day by making efficient use of the 4 times of day completing objectives in the 4 levels, all of which require completion at a certain time of day. This was fun to do. Deathloop was a very decent experience, which took me around 18 hours to complete, but probably not an experience I'll play for a second or third time.. Gameplay was really fun at first, but started getting tedious after 10h or so - same weapons, same (stupid) enemies, same 4 relatively small maps, same powers. Story really hooked me at the start but the ending felt a bit underwhelming, the game left a lot of stuff unexplained. Cool art direction. Nice music and voice acting. The game had a lot of potential but ended up just solid.. One of the worst games I’ve played. Despite great looking animations and overall style of the game, it is a mess. Repetitive as hell, you will have to do same thing over and over, I know the concept, but when you need to run throw whole location to turn a switch to run second location and get a piece of paper to make this 4 more times. And if you get killed start again, it is just madness and waste of time. Whole story is consistent of UI mess and a tons of letter / notes and other staff that I have beed bored to read after 1st hours. Resurrection is special threat - if you die in crowded location, you will respawn in the same place, which leads to two more death and loop to reload. Please spare yourself and don’t play it. I got it with subscription and regret spent time.. Really enjoying gameplay. Good visuals. Amazing animations. Disapointing story. they were relly lazy in this point.. Could be better, some parts feel lazy. Some reload animations are not even in the game lol.. I had so many expectations! The concept was so intriguing. There were a time, when I thought it could be an interesting stealth aspect, however it works really clumsy. On the other side, going shooting all over the place works disappointing as well - you could die easily and loose all your progress. At some point an ability should appear, that could help you with saving all that weapons and abilities, you've previously found. However I got bored before i got to that one, so I just spent about 5-6 hours running circles. Literally, I had to start the game all over again 3 times, because I died))) That's how this concept works) Also, game feels really small scaled, cause there're only 4 locations, where you can go in the morning, evening etc. Obviously, dropped it, trying to find something else to accompany my current mood.. Good Bethesda style games, although the map itself is pretty repetitive (4 maps with 4 different time slots, so at most 16 combinations) but you will have new discovery every time via different mission and there are a lot of hidden spots for you to discover. I enjoy the atmosphere and humor too! I just want more choice of weapons, and maybe a bit of variables in each loop? A little bit more unexpected things other than Julianna will keep the game interesting after multiple loops.. Repeative, boring, it is just dishonored mod. Same elements, game engine, not decent storyline.. Great voice acting, dualsense implementation, great gameplay, music. Story towards the end is half baked and leaves many questions unanswered.. Very ambitious game. Most of my problems with the game come from me just not liking stealth-based games - especially FPS stealth games. But that aside, the game was just mostly very monotonous to me. Very cool conceptually, the best Arkane-style gameplay yet, but it just wore thin relatively quickly for me.. I read all these reviews praising this game, I dont get it. This game is so cheezy. I cant get into it. I keep trying but I dont know, I loose interest within a half hour. I keep giving this game an honest try but for some reason it just doesn't do it for me. You die and return back to retry everything. Kinda like returnal. This game i feel like is trying too hard or something. The characters are pretty lame and i just dont connect with it.. Nice design, great exploration content, interesting puzzles and good ideas packed in somehow poor execution.. The game is original and the art direction is amazing. People at Arkane Studio really deserve some respect and gratitude for delivering us such a refreshing experience and I hope they will keep making games that stimulate our mind and reward our creativity. With that said, after some amount of time playing it, I started to lose my interest and I couldn't even finish it. Some technical issues are still present, which is quite something when you consider they had one more year to fix bugs on the Xbox version. On the long run, the gameplay loop fails to keep the player engaged, it lacks something I can't put my finger on. Too bad, it's still a good game, but not a great game. Just great gameplay, nice soundtrack and great story. You can expand your experience just how much you would like. You can chase all the storylines, or you could explore. I found every loop more fun, because of my improved mechanics. The first couple of loops you are not so powerful, but later on with my improved slabs i could be invisible, transform myself to another place in no time. Everything is fun to do. Exploring is very much encouraged. So, you could really create your own adventure. It has been a long time that a game wanted me to keep playing and keep coming back for another run. I'm not sure why anyone would think this is a bad game, but if you want a nice straight forward shooter to play for couple of minutes or a game you can invest hours in. you can can do both with Deathloop.. Over rated snooze fest ****. Boring non engaging story with sub par game play. Soundtrack is pretty good though.. I honestly don't understand how this is a 10/10 for so many professional critics. For many games that get universal praise I can see what is so appealing as to why it may get that score even if it's not exactly ""for me"" or my kind of game. But Deathloop.. I played it for a little while and honestly the game just felt very last gen in terms of gameplay, the actual mechanics of the game like shooting and using abilities, controls etc. just felt off and it just didn't feel like an enjoyable game to continue playing so I stopped. I would never understand why this is 10/10 ""must buy"" etc. and all that because to be honest I think this game came out during a period of video game draught and it was one of the first action games to launch as exclusive to PS5 that most people were hyped over. 6/10 at best for me personally.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Edgy-wedgy dishonnored reskin with atrocious, annoying edgy dialogue (arkane think they're as cool as tarantino, when all they sound like is lame white boys trying to be as edgy as they can by constantly swearing and joking about how killing people is super fun), 4 levels you'll get sick of after replaying them for the 16th time in a row, uninspired, barely disociable and weak feeling **** to cap it off a ridiculous twist ending that's been overused and old since the empire strikes back first used it (SPOILER !! Nah, ain't nothing to spoil in this bland game, nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before). Technically it's beyond amateurish, crashes often, updates often render the game unplayable and destroys gamefiles, gamefiles don't update properly so you'll lose 10mn checking the game files's integrity on steam...overrated garbage !. This is the most boring game I’ve ever played. To be fair, I never even got past 3 hours but why bother pushing through if there are 100s of great games out there. The only reason I don’t give this a 0 is because I got it on sale for $30. Still not worth it. Edit: Forgot this is the same studio that hame me dishonored which I loved. Makes this game a 0. I don’t know what they were thinking, this game is just boring.. Fun gameplay with interesting mechanics. Story was engaging. Powers spice up the gameplay even more for extra strategy. Especially fun with (or rather against) a friend.. Awesome game! Great environment and art style. Excellent music soundtrack. Smooth gameplay. Really good story plot that does not overstay its welcome. Colt is an awesome protagonist bursting with personality. I loved the banter between him and the antagonist Julianna. Customization options are decent. The UI is good. Multiplayer is fun. I did experience some bugs that popped up in the inventory screen almost freezing the game. One mission in particular has a poor layout. It allows you to trigger an optional event but gives you no clear way to escape unless you die. Deathloop is the first Arkane game that I have ever finished so that says a lot. I tried getting into Dishonored but always got bored by the halfway point. I just could not get into Corvo or the plot. Deathloop was an entirely different story. From the beginning I was invested in Colt and helping him break the loop. One of the best AAA games I have played in a while and is a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend especially if you can pick it up on sale. Great job Arkane!. Deathloop was incredible. I just finished and I'm already planning to play through again. I loved the cause and effect mechanics in the game that would have a butterfly effect as you progressed. I also enjoyed trying. all of the weapons, gadgets, and unique abilities. My only (very minor) issue was the ending could have been a little better.. Kind of a mixed bag but a fun experience nonetheless...... Pros 1. Unique concept 2. The sarcastic exchange between Cole and Julianna is spot on 3. Shooting is fun 4. Freedom of choice of how you want to approach your target. 5. Invasions by other players if playing online are nail biting. Cons 1. Gets repetitive since there are only 4 maps and you run them over and over again. 2. Minor UI and graphical glitches. Game was just okay for me really. Love the mechanics but think Dishonored did everything a lot better. The art style is really cool as well.. Funny, exciting, Colt is great and I really like the story. I wish it had been longer: I would have liked to know more about the characters and more gadgets. But overall, it's great. It gave me a lot of Bioshock's vibes.. So boring. I was so excited for this game based on the trailers and showcases at cons. But this game is boring, not fun, uninteresting, and a ripoff. Wish I could get my money back. Brilliant! This is the essenz of gaming. I think its not a fully 10/10. But some Guys with no idea what the game is about gave 0/10. Thats unfair and this critics should be erased.. Avoid if you are planning on using a controller. The game feels awful to play if you have a bit of experience with first person shooters. The sensitivity seems to do almost no",great game design & interesting story. Develops well throughout and plenty to explore . gets a little repetitive near the end game - but with a loop mechanic at its core I would expect it to be more so than it is .
594.Ori and the Blind Forest,"Best Microsoft game, best game in the genre. It's become my personal favourite. This metroidvania platformer has a really good story and an amazing gameplay system to back that up. The journey you go through the forest with Ori is one that is hard to forget.. It's solid. Out of the many 2D platformers it stands out for it's visual storytelling. While I think it's visuals and storytelling is great, I dont feel the actual platforming is anything more than average. Still worth playing, still a great game, just pretty simple.. In more than 30 years of gaming this game for me is in the top5 of the best Metroidvania platform adventures I've ever played in my life. No matter if it's about the gameplay, the story, the characters or the painted graphics. A perfect game.. One of the best platform game. It has amazing story telling, outstanduhg soundtrack and sound effects. I suggest to play it in easy because you need to be swiftly. The game logic is well developed. I suggest you to finish this journey and get ready to play the second Ori game.. Tough platformer. Fluid controls and gorgeous setting. It's worth a try, even if platformers are not your thing.. My favourite game on xbox... it's just perfect, gameplay music and level design are top notch. The game is good but i can't fckn find where to go sometimes and this makes me so nervous.. More like 8.5/10. Loved the game. Recommend it to everyone. Very good game.. One of my favourite games! the game is very fun to play, love the music! the atmosphere is exceptional. Incredible game. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the story is amazing. The gameplay is addictive. It is also very challenging at points which is great. Everyone who can should play this game.. All I can say is wow. I decided to play this on a whim on Xbox Game Pass and was immediately captured within the first few minutes. Definitely a must play.. A tricky platformer that didn't make me want to obliterate my controller (unlike hollow knight) and instead made me want to push forward (kind of line celeste). The movement is extremly satisfying with interesting abilities you can unlock. What also surprised me was that this actually had a pretty decent story. It's not the best story ever by a long shot, even some other platformers (even if, sadly, very few) have better ones in my opinion. A great way to round off the year.. Great game. Pros.: - Metroidvania. - Possible to discover 100%. - Abilities. - Neat story. - Very touching. Cons.: - Those idiotic runaway sequences. Can't stand them. Died thousands of times.. Arguably one of the best Metroidvanias of all-time. This game captures everything that makes this genre so engrossing with an absolutely flawless tone, right and engaging gameplay and an emotional story.. Awesome game I like the story and it's a great side scrolling brawler big up to the creators. This game manages to touch me emotionally although there is not much talking. The music/ the world. Wonderful. This is a really beautiful and engaging Metroidvania! It's hard as hell at times - not in terms of combat but in terms of platforming - and has a really moving story and world. If you love platformers and exploring maps, this game is for you.. pretty and full of heart. just a little too difficult in some plataforming parts, i was playing with my nephew but i had to play most of it. One of the best jump n run Games out there. Incredible Movement and Graphics. So much Love in Details.. Beautiful visuals and art design, wonderful soundtrack. fluid, satisfying platforming mechanics. the only thing that brings it down, is that you start out without a move set, just none at all. by the time you unlock all the abilities, platforming becomes amazingly fun, but when you start, it feels quite barebones. apart from that, the game is amazing. A 7 year old game breaking bug still exists. Say what you want about cyberpunk but nothing stopped me playing that game. First hour is great but be very careful when pushing rocks or you might just encounter the bug and decide you can't restart. I'm disappointed I'll never get to see it all!. Whatever the graphic, soundtrack and gameplay, undoubtedly, ori and the blind forest does its best, and the energy cells which can save the game as you want is a genius design.. Its a very beautiful game. And its also a hard difficulty. Music makes the game immersive and makes it a great piece. If you like metroidvania you should play this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ori and the blind forest is a very good metroidvania, it is not as well as his second part but is amazing. A must play game that shows what 2d gaming is capable of. The artstyle is absolutely gorgeous, the gameplay is fast and creative, and the story is enjoyable. The environment is lovely to look at and explore. The game can be difficult at times but satisfying when you are able to move so freely and quickly throughout the stage. Truly one of, if not the best xbox game available to this day.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!! Graphics: 10/10 Gamplay: 10/10 Audio: 10/10 Story:10/10 Good price compare to playtime and experience. Very kind and beautiful game. Amazing soundtracks. Thanks creator's for this game.. Ori is a magnificent game - great entertainment, beautiful design and interesting story. The gameplay is very satisfying and not frustrating at all. The levels of the difficulty are accurate and let you enjoy the game as you like it. What I really appreciate, comparing to the sequel, is the lack of moments when you get stuck for long hours (i.e. boss combats). It all goes smoothly - it's challenging enough, but doesn't make you destroy your pad in the meantime. The only issue I have with this game is not being able to complete everything for 100% after the main plot is over. It would be great to just wander around and find all the hidden spots in this beautiful world.. This is the best game I have ever played. I love the art style, story, game play. My all time favorite game. Ori and the blind forest is a fst paced platform/metroidvania game that does every single part of the genre to an almost absolute perfection, movement is really snappy and world design is absolutely stunning.. Great art style and challenging gameplay =) Incredible soundtrack! I simply like it! Even played it on a plane during a flight on my laptop with a controller!. I can only say that it is unique. The game is so fascinating that time does not make sense.. Certainly beautiful lifestyle with lots of fun upgrades and a simple premise. A must play!. Such fluid animation and gameplay beautiful level design. One of the best metriodvania style games I have ever played.. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 8/10 Story : 7/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 7/10. Fix jumping mechanics u noobs. Stupid devs. Can't even double jump and this stupid game requires u to quad jump.. Great history, a beautiful scenarios and a perfect gameplays, makes a PERFECT GAME. Play Ori and you'll agree with me.. 2/5/21-6/4/21 100% Main Story 71% Total 819 Deaths and 9.5 Hours. Yeesh! Despite being very highly recommended. I really had to force myself through this game. The story centers around a small rabbit-looking creature who has to do something about a darkness in a forest. Honestly, it was a really artsy story that didn't make much sense to me. It's the type of story that you have to research on the internet to understand. The animation was pretty standout, particularly the big owl that tries to eat you all the time. They clearly put a lot of work in to it, but it's tough to get around the frustrations of the gameplay. Ori was an immensely difficult game for me to finish. It reminded me quite a bit of Limbo or Unravel as far as the gameplay was concerned. You move from screen to screen figuring out where the game wants you to go by dying over and over trying to do the wrong thing. Some sections are timed and seem impossible at first, but after many (many) attempts you eventually get through and soon there will be another section that seems even more frustrating than the last one. There are a few actions that cause checkpoints, but for the most part you have to create your own respawn points. Which sounds great-until you stumble into another impossible section, die, and have to trudge all the way back only to find you don't have enough energy to make a new save point. The controls also seemed very inconsistent for me. One attempt you could jump to a certain ledge, only for the next attempt to make the jump or glide a little too short. Or the irritating auto target would leave you floating in the air like Wile E Coyote instead of latching on to an enemy. The game is against you at every step of the way. All of this to say-This type of game wasn't for me. People love games that punish them (I.e Dark Souls) and this brings that style to the platforming genre. The only reason for the long winded explanation is to save people like me from the frustration of playing this game. If you're looking for a challenge to overcome and a story that is more artistic than traditionally entertaining and easy to follow, this would be the game for you.. I gave this title a second chance and.. its still a chore ****. If you forgot to create a checkpoint, you are screwed and you have to do sections all over again. And you have a high chance to be out of blue orbs for the checkpoints! You have learned a new ability? Then have fun to back track a big section of the level and see the same stuff and enemies again. If you can ignore that, the rest of the gameplay is still basic jump and run. Enemies are a chore. The only good thing on this game is the artstyle. But after a few hours, I am still waiting to see an epic boss encounter like in the trailers but none of that happened yet. I have no more pacience, I am out.. Pros: + solid all around metroidvania/platformer/ game + art-style So-So: - platforming and level design runs a fine line between git gud, and annoying/frustrating - combat is too basic, and is more annoying than challenging This being one of the first xbox games I've actually played from start to finished, and is supposedly one of their better ""exclusives"", overall it was an alright first xbox experience. I think I can sum up my experience in this game in one sentence, everything moon studios does in this game is good, however nothing they did is mind-blowing, and nothing they did was awful. It was just all around a good game, decent platformer and metroidvania. If there was one big drawback in this game, was that I've seen everything in this game.. done in other platformers and metroidvanias before. Solid game, just nothing blew me away.. Equally beautiful and frustrating. After almost 2/3 game behind me, i'm not sure where to go next, and can't even think about enduring even one unnecesarry minute in this game. What i hate about it, are theese trial and error parts, where you need to memorize game sequence, constantly dying.. I love the story line to this game, but i have to give it a solid 7 just because of how many times I died and retried each time which is an ongoing cycle. I’m sorry but if you’re going to have a difficulty level at easy, I EXPECT IT TO BE EASY!!!! I wanted to play this game with little challenge because of it’s story. I’m 75% done with this game and I’m at 682 deaths so far. Lol.. The visuals are amazing, the music is simply gorgeous, platforming sequences are often demanding but fair and rewarding, and its whole fairy-tale appeal is just stunning. It could use some improvements to the UI and the fighting system but other than that, it is a truly moving experience, and a real treat for metroidvania lovers.. was somewhat enjoyable for the first couple of hours, but the combat and platforming soon became an absolute task. I honestly hate this game so much. I only ever tried it so I could play Ori 2, which IMO is what this game should have been.. Truly one of the greatest games i have ever played. A beautiful story, incredible platforming and visually one of the most impressive games i have ever played. If you have not given this game a try, please do so, you will not be disappointed.. Visually stunning and stylish this 2D platform adventure. Studios have done an incredible job! Graphics: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Audio: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Fun: 9/10. Such a great and beautiful story/game you really should give it a solid attempt if you have a Xbox, I can't recommend it enough. Excellent aesthetics and general feeling of the game. Wonderful map designs.. This game is so freaking beautiful and gorgeous, the stages the music OST the characters and enemies design's wow just simple amazing. The story the ambient the controls everything is perfect 10/10 this game is a Masterpiece.. This game is great. The music and gameplay are good. The story and graphics are great.. Incredible adventure. Leaves a mark on the soul. Great drawing and gameplay.. Whilst a beautiful, evocative and extremely fluid playing, Ori ultimately falls short in its try-hard ambition to be videogaming's 'Bamby'.. Such a gorgeous game with a great soundtrack and story. For an indie game, this is a phenomenal metroidvania. I do feel that the combat was very basic though and I thought some parts of the game could’ve been improved on. Xbox one's last game so far.... xbox one really lacks on good games and this one shows everything that the players expect from a good 2D game.. Great game and great foundation to it's sequel. I loved this game. Recommended.. Great Game, Must Try. It's beautiful Journey. Great Gameplay And Visual and so.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredibly enjoyable to play: positive story, great graphics, interesting puzzles and abilities to solve them, and I never experienced any bugs or glitches that ruined the experience.. 1)too long levels 2)(not the best varitys of levels gameplay 3)boredom by the end of the game. Art style, gameplay, characters, narrative, sound, all is perfect on this, 10/10. Graphics 10 Art style 10 Music 10 Gameplay 10 Good exclusive for microsoft. Little valued by the press. There is a game of a cockroach to which they have deified and this one does not say wonders than the other. Why will it be?. Ori is a near perfect modern platformer that finds an engaging point between skillful and fun gameplay. The artwork animation, soundscape and soundtrack are of exception quality. It was a real joy to complete this title. And it's on gamepass **** onto the sequel!. Every aspect of this game was a stunning masterpiece. Game play was challenging, but rewarding. Had a lot of fun playing through this.. A beautiful game with a simple yet meaningful story. Stunning visuals and fun gameplay. Will definitely be picking up the Will of the Wisps on Xbox Gamepass. The game itself is a platform without more, quite fast, with the typical story of light VS darkness. Graphically it is beautiful, very colorful, with great contrasts in the same plane, but what gives a feeling of playing something that does not have all 2D platform games is the soundtrack, the perfect companion for the story, a soundtrack where Melodic wins the story itself that although it makes you want to know the end, you enjoy those moments of maximum difficulty while in the background sounds something that makes you feel good.. It is one of the masterpiece of this generation. Gameplay, music, art direction, everything in this game is excellent.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ori and the blind forest is my fav Metroidvania game ever (including Metroid). Its beautiful, has smooth gameplay, excellent progression and the game is difficult but doable. Honestly there isn't a thing I dont love about the game so I dont even know where to criticize it tbh. Just play it, its a generational game. Incredible.. I liked the art design, the way the game tells the story through its animations/artwork rather than long winded cutscenes, reminiscent of when games had to do storytelling like that like Super metroid back in the 90's. So it is sort of like a Metroidvania game, but I didn't care for the limited combat, arrow pointing jump mechanics, and I think the way exploration was done was more tedious than fun at times being too linear where it gives the illusion **** that is more open. I mean modern game that might be considered of the same genre with similar art design/storytelling, but nails gameplay and exploration way better, Hollow knight. So I would say ori is mediocre with some good presentation but lacking in more engaging gameplay and exploration for this type of game. What an AMAZING experience. Beautiful graphics, impeccable level design, fluid controls and a deep and pretty story. One of my favorite games of all time.. 6 years after the Xbox One's initial launch and to this day there isn't a better exclusive on the box. Ori and the blind forest is a pure, joy filled metroidvania which has addictive gameplay, magnificent story, amazing art design, love-able characters, and one of the best soundtracks you'll ever listen to. If you own an xbox one, there is no reason you shouldn't have this game. It's an enjoyable thrill-ride from beginning to end.. The best game i´ve ever played on this generation. Cute, funny,... Great feelings. solid gameplay, graphics, mechanics. sometimes backtracking is too tedious.. This game is simple a master piece. Amazing presentation (Visuals, Sounds etc.) Excellent gameplay and controls, genius level design, and a compelling story that it doesn't use it as an excuse to a mediocre uninteresting gameplay (Most AAA narrative games). If there is one thing that it can improve on for my personal taste that is the character customisation options (Something similar to Hollow-knight will be perfect for this game also).. Ori and the blind forest is a masterpiece. It has the graphics, gameplay and story. It is satisfiying to control ori. The level designs are top-notch.. enjoyable and fun little game. found it pretty beautiful. heard there'll be a sequel. Looking forward to it. What is there to say about Ori and the Blind Forest? Just, take a bow. This fantastic game combines some simple yet breath-taking visuals, solid game mechanics and a decent story that constantly pulls your heart strings, making you form a greater bond with Ori. Pros: Visuals are superb Solid game mechanics Enough level variation to keep you interested Good story and pacing Cons: Enemies are too similar Some clipping issues at times Handful of tough achievements/trophies As this game is a few years old, it’s well worth picking up as it is generally always on sale for a good price. Definitely value for money. Dave NPC on Youtube.. My most beloved sidecroller of all time (together with DK 2 on SNES) u will love this game once u are 2 minutes in... 10/10. Moon Studios is officially on the map. One of if not the best next gen titles out right now.. Amazing game. Fun, beautiful, with a touching story. My only gripe is with some minor gameplay issues, from the uneven difficulty to minor issues with the save system. Other than that, amazing game.. (I SPOIL THE NAMES OF SOME MECHANICS IN THIS REVIEW, BUT NOTHING STORY RELATED). Above all else, Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful game, with occasional moments that elevate it beyond most games out at this time. The visuals are beautiful and make the Metroidvania style world very gripping to explore. Not to mention, they also perfectly complement the surreal moments in the story and more outlandish things in the game itself. Nothing to me is more jarring than a gritty and realistic game attempting to sell a completely unrealistic mechanic or story moment. The only game I can think of which successfully uses a realistic artstyle while also managing to ground the ridiculous things in its world feel grounded and real is Horizon: Zero Dawn, however that is one game in thousands which does it correctly. Similarly, the soundtrack in this game can bring even the dullest moments to life. The strongest moments in this game, come at the beginning and at the end, but in the middle is really where the game started to fumble for me. In the very beginning it's simple and uncluttered, and allows the thematic beauty, quality platforming, and exploration to shine through. The Ginso Tree is a perfect example of this. The player starts the level with extremely simple mechanics and controls, but the 'bash' ability completely changes the dynamic of the level, and introduces an incredible new aspect to the combat and to the platforming. By the end of the game, on the other hand, the controls are more complex, but they are easier to handle because the player has been using them all game, and this allows for more complicated level layout and design that doesn't feel as chaotic as certain parts in the middle of the game. After the player learns a few new abilities, Ori begins to lose that simple and pure aspect that it used so well early on. The new moves learned throughout the game lose the impact that learning the earlier moves had because they are so plentiful, and there is barely enough time to learn Ori's current set of abilities. Each button does something unique as opposed to a more simple Metroidvania like Hollow Knight, with one button to attack and another to jump, and it forces the player to earn new moves slowly, instead of constantly throwing them at the player one after another like they mean nothing. Despite the hiccups caused by the cluttered controls and over-saturation of mechanics, by the end of the game, Ori and the Blind Forest regains its focused, tight feeling, and in the absence of trying to remember all of the controls, I once again found myself absorbed into the world and engrossed into the experience of this game. All in all Ori and the Blind Forest, despite feeling a bit messy at times, delivers an experience that I look forward to playing again. After playing this I am beyond excited for Will of the Wisps, and I’m going to give Ori and the Blind Forest a 7 out of 10.. What a fantastic plat former. This game almost brought me to tears in the opening minutes of the game. You get a very strong deep bond with the characters which is odd from a plat former. There are many new interesting ideas and that art design breathtaking.. After playing Ori I felt really into 2d platformers again. After playing others I realised this surpasses all of them and they are now all disappointing.. If you like to play Metroid or Castlevania Ori and the Blind Forest IS a game for you, if you like a nice and sometimes challenging Jump'N'Run Ori and the Blind Forest IS also a game for you, and even if not Ori and the Blind Forest is simply a great game with a great Story, great visuals, great music and great gameplay - just play it, it's very unlikely that you will regret playing this great game.. Surprising awesome game. Really good platforming and one of those games you just don't want to put down. It's a good difficulty as well, harder than it looks. Definitely recommend it. Ori is one of those games that you find and then you fall in love with it. It may not have a very complex story but is like a pixar movie, it is meant to have a message and be for everyone and the very first minutes will define the first great emotions you'll feel towards the characters of this game. The art style is incredible, it is full of fantastic colors, contrasts and so much more. The little Ori becomes lovely and you really want to help him succed in his mission. In gameplay terms it may feel a little bit simple but you as long as you progress in the story, you'll start unlocking different abilities to use during the game. It also has a very good platforming level design and every section of this big world has a unique charm. Try this game, I believe that if you like platformers and a nice story/art style then this game is for you ;) Pros: level design, art style, story, game mechanics, Cons: replay value, little bit simple. Quite possibly one of the most perfect platforming games I've played in recent memory. The controls are tight. The abilities system is wonderful. One of the best experiences I've had in a long time.. Ori And The Blind Forest is easily my favourite game in 2015. Moon studios should be proud the game the accomplished, a game has never left me with such a visceral feeling like this game did its fantastic and a game everyone who appreciates art will love. First of all the art and score of this game fit so well the director Thomas Mahler knew the visuals he wanted and the team executed them prefectly, also essential to the success of Ori is the music which is composed by Gareth Coker is etremely beautiful and masterly composed its fits so well with the visual of the environments Secondly the gameplay in this game is really tight and controlls really well which is needed because some the obstacles require you to be persice and without the tight controlls this would'nt work I think Ori is a must buy for anyone looking for a journey through an amazingly detailed world and be pulled in to the story of Ori and walk away with a sense of wonderment through it all Ori And The Blind forest is easily one of the best games of 2015. Anyone that gave this game less than a 8. Needs to play something else because obviously this genre not for them. But wow this platformer really blew me away with its story, gameplay, and the difficulty was just right. keepin it short. Its stellar design, eye-popping presentation, addictive gameplay and, of course, that very reasonable price tag, make it an easy purchasing decision for anyone looking for an endlessly engaging experience. You might find yourself playing Ori and the Blind Forest from start to finish in a single sitting, it's that amazing.. Best Platformer of 2015. Nice art, cute heroes. Wonderful music. Magic world. I'm reaaly wanna to next chapter. Shut Up and take my money, huh. Please.. This game is a wonderful echo of the original Metroid games. Beautiful scenescapes, wonderful animations, engaging play, and a goosebump-inducing original score. There's nothing more you could ask for.. Ori and The Blind Forest is the best game I have played this year. An absolutely gorgeous 2D puzzle platformer game with Metroidvania influence, it is THE must play game of 2015. This game hasn't given me the same feeling of joy and wonder since playing Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time back on the Nintendo 64. The fact that the Zelda Triforce symbol can be found etched into a tree in this game is a clear nod to the inspiration Zelda has had. First of all, the game is stunning, with a wonderful art style with vibrant colours and seamless animation, The Blind Forest feels alive. This is helped by a foreground teeming with moving shadows, a multi-layered background which sways and pulsates with gorgeous light, and reactive foliage and platforms which move when in contact with the playable character, Ori. The game is a joy to look at and is easily one of the best looking games this year. You play the character, Ori, a spirit guardian of the Spirit tree who are separated during a storm. Ori is then adopted by Naru, a loving, motherly figure who nurtures Ori back to health. The relationship is established during the games Prologue, which is a mix of cutscenes and scripted player moments which culminates in a fantastically woven story introduction with a real emotional impact. It really invests the player and ends up being a beautifully simple but surprisingly twisting storyline. The gorgeous graphics and wondrous story is aided by probably the best soudtrack to grace a game in years. Really. The soundtrack is perfect at every stage in the game, and evokes raw emotion alongside moments of awe and magic. The soundtrack is woven through the game's environment and story to set an atmosphere which surpasses even Inon Zur's soundtrack to Fallout 4. Truly amazing work by Gareth Coker and the Moon studios team. Gameplay wise, the controls really do feel ""pixel perfect"" and Ori is an absolute joy to control. In true Metroidvania fashion, the - huge - open world is free to explore however areas are locked to the player until the right skill is acquired, or dungeon is completed. Different skills encourages different ways to explore the world and the progression system really gives the player a feeling of improvement and momentum as you advance through the game. The game is challenging enough to give a real feeling of satisfaction upon completion but it never feels unfair. When you die - and you will, many many times - it is never down to poor level design, it's always your fault. Exploration is encouraged via collectible pick ups to increase your overall health, XP or energy. Energy affects the amount of times you can save or use powered attacks. The saving mechanic is interesting, as it forces you to think about what you are doing at all times, since energy is a resource. When I finished the game I had nearly nine hours of playtime clocked, for what I feel was a good amount. For it's £15.99 price I think this game packs a mighty punch. The massive map with lots of secrets and hidden areas to explore, the incredible visuals and soundtrack, the intriguing story and responsive and joyous gameplay all culminates into a package with immense value and replayability, it is simply that good. It is glaringly obvious how much love and care has been poured into this game by the people at Moon studios. Really a crafted game. The reason I bought this game was because I wanted something relaxing to pick up and play whenever I wanted, after heavy investment into games like Fallout 4, MGSV:TPP, Forza 5 and Halo:MCC, I was not disappointed at all and I truly believe if you are into games you won't be either. This game is an essential purchase to anyone who owns an Xbox One, and will be remembered for a long, long time.. Ori and the Blind Forest is nothing short of breathtaking. This game has a fantastic storyline with characters that you really care about. The game manages to make you care about the characters not through language but through beautiful animations, and back story. The game looks absolutely incredible with graphics that make it look like an outstanding animated movie. The game is tough, but it's fair because the controls are so precise, and smooth. The level design is also really great, and the soundtrack is just... I can't even begin to explain how fantastic the soundtrack is. Literally the only problem I have with the is that it's really short. If you just rush thought it without dying to much you can beat it in an about an hour. But with a fantastic storyline, beautiful graphics, a fantastic soundtrack, great level design, and great gameplay. This is one game that is very replayable.. Ori and the Blind Forest is a fantastic game! Pros: Beautiful artwork, relaxing music, well done gameplay, a fantastic yet simple story, and solid gameplay mechanics. Cons: The only con I could think of would be that there isn't more of the game there. Take Ori and the Blind Forests content and multiply it by 5 and that's what I want. Only reason it's a 9 out of 10.. This is without a doubt my game of the year so far. The game is a classic metroid vania style platformer. It has some of the most creative level design and abilities out of any platformer I have played. The gameplay is fluent and very responsive. The game is fun from beginning to end but still has some very difficult levels. Some levels (in particular the ginso tree level) are breathtaking. The art style is beautiful and every part of the map has a different style and they all have different level design which coincide with the different abilities you get. The score is beautiful and accompanies the levels and the set pieces beautifully. The game is filled with emotion and beauty and is one of the best games I have played in a while. 9.","the journey you go through the forest with ori is one that is hard to forget . out of the many 2D platformers it stands out for it's visual storytelling . it's worth playing, still a great game, just pretty simple ."
595.The Talos Principle 2,"Looks very nice, but after 1 hour of playing it crashed, said that my game profile is corrupted and needs to be removed. It deleted my profile so I had to start over.. Don't be fooled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The puzzles and philosophical arguments are a step down from those in its predecessor, and the endless walking between levels becomes grating very quickly, even though the landscape is beautiful to look at. Nonetheless, it's still a good if not a great game.. The best 2023 game for me. So much fun. Gteat puzzles. Good story. For a little price.. Absolute masterpiece. Some games are art, some games are entertainment. This one is both. The philosophical aspect of the game changed the way I think about some topics, so it's worth playing just for that.. Great puzzle game with some philosphical **** puzzles feature various interesting elements to solve **** DLC has some very hard puzzles.. This is such a masterpiece and an absolute gem ****. I can't stress enough how great this game is written. It's a puzzle game but intertwined with deep philosophical questions that make you think. You just need to let it - slow down, the game asks some big questions you should not answer in a hurry. I won't spoil the story but the main theme is very relevant today since it's (obviously) about artificial intelligence. This is a game that showed me so many competing viewpoints I haven't previously contemplated and in the end made me appreciate humanity as a whole. I mean it, I felt something deep (don't have the right words here), almost spiritual even. Some kind of connection to my ancestors and an appreciation of the world as is.. - Challenging, original puzzles - Beautiful environments (Brutalist architecture!) and music - Captivating story using historical texts to ask philosophical questions What is not to like?. Impressive in every aspect, this is how everyone should work. Better than certain games that can be bought at full price (70/80). It's a puzzle game, but I believe if it's made of action it will be impressive with the graphic detail it has. An authentic work of art, thank you to the entire team involved in this game.. One of the most commendable aspects of The Talos Principle 2 is its intricate puzzle design. Each puzzle is meticulously crafted to challenge players' logic, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills. From simple yet ingenious mechanics to mind-bending conundrums, every level presents a satisfying and rewarding experience. The gradual escalation in difficulty ensures that players are constantly engaged without feeling overwhelmed, making each solved puzzle a moment of genuine accomplishment.. This game is an absolute masterpiece of the **** writing is deep and engaging, characters have well defined and attaching personalities. The puzzles are smart but not excessively hard and the environment is gorgeous. The first game was already great, but this one takes it to another level entirely. Definitely recommend it!. Always the same puzzles. Just boring. Plus this monotonous background music.. This may be the best thing I played in my 40+ year’s career as a gamer. I savoured every moment of gameplay: the aesthetic, the challenge of the puzzles, the storytelling, the beauty of the places, the music, the thought-provoking philosophy. I loved it all and will dearly miss it.. I would say : We don't have Portal 3, but we have The Talos Principle 2 ! I loved the first one, but here we have a real number 2 that offers us a more developed story and lore that make exploring and solving puzzles particularly interesting and satisfying, all in environments that are very often beautiful to explore.. The Talos Principle 2 stands as a testament to puzzle game excellence, offering intricate challenges and thought-provoking narratives. Despite minor missteps in endgame design and technical issues, the game's philosophical depth and immersive puzzles make it a captivating experience. Whether pondering existential questions or conquering mind-bending puzzles, players will find The Talos Principle 2 a rewarding and intellectually stimulating journey.. just a great puzzle. the main problem of which is that it is drawn out, which also leads to anger at the game (especially at the end), but it is a great puzzle. I wanted to cut 1 point for some really stupid decisions in game design, but I haven’t - the game is definitely a masterpiece, and various unimportant things won’t change that. A worthy continuation of the first part, expanding its idea in all possible directions - scale, depth, quality and variety of riddles, storytelling. This is where the real game of the year is!! P.S. By the way, the game was a pleasant surprise for me - I didn’t know anything about the development.. I played the original talos principle on an iPad a good number of years ago. I Never managed to finish it but I always planned to come back to it someday. This sequel is far better in story, layout & puzzles. The difficult puzzles simmer away in your mind after you log off, often for you to realise the solutions while out exercising or at work! The story is very interesting & sticks with you. Overall this is definitely the best puzzle game since portal 2.. A very good puzzle game with decent story and great visuals. I did not play the first game, and didn't expect much from this game, but a few hours in I was totally surprised. The puzzles are well designed, with high production values I don't normally see in puzzle games. The world building is also breathtaking with some unique elements. Puzzle solving at its core is very engaging, I enjoyed playing it mostly, but with some frustrations, especially some Pandora stars. The puzzles are well thought and with good pacing. They are not too difficult maybe except some final gold puzzles. World is fun to see but some times explorations are a bit mindless. Story is interesting but still feels a bit detached to the puzzle solving, it presents some interesting ideas but I constantly see myself skipping dialogs, at the end it doesn't really change anything to puzzle solving or even add much context.. This is an amazing a game. Even if you have not played the first one, you will be immediately **** into this beautiful futuristic world that the team has created. I really enjoyed the first game. It had a very unique way of telling its story. It brought up many thought-provoking ideas about humanity and morality. It was beautiful, challenging and philosophical. But if you weren't prepared to read thousands of lines of computer terminal code, you would have probably completely missed the story and the game's overall meaning. This sequel fixes all of that! Not only is this games presentation OUTSTANDING, but it has a much better means of relaying the story to the player. Tonnes of new NPC's all with their own personalities and ideas you can talk with. This is my favorite Unreal Engine 5 game thats been released so far, my favorite game of 2023, and my favorite open world puzzle solving game since Portal 2. The only reason I would not say this game is a 10/10 in it's category is because of the performance issues on both PC and console. I have a fairly decent PC that matches the specs of current gen consoles, and my game averages in the ~45 FPS range with medium-high settings. The console versions do the same. It would be great to see the team optimize the game in the open world sections to bring a smoother experience! :). I've been waiting for this game for so long... Now I'm waiting for the DLC. A true masterpiece.... This game is a masterpiece and should be in game of the year nomination if it was released a little bit earlir. All the new mechanics, open world, new story, etc are absolutely magnificient.. What a game. Really enjoyed the 1st Talos Principle and this is a nice evolution. Clever people puzzles, stunning graphics and an interesting story/mysteries.. The Talos Principle 2 is the best puzzle game since The Talos Principle, and is likely the second best such game of all time, lagging behind only Portal 2.A direct sequel to the first game, this game looks at the society that the robots built after waking up at the end of the first Talos Principle. With humanity extinct, robots need to figure out what they want to do as a society – some of them want to limit their growth to only 1000 robots, while others want to expand and explore and make a better society, as the ones who set the process that led to their creation in motion wanted. After “Prometheus” shows up in town shortly after the creation of the 1,000th robot, you, number 1000, are sent on a mission along with several other robots to find the source of the “entity”. In the process, you discover a giant megastructure surrounded by a bunch of puzzles reminiscent of the first game, and are left to try and determine what exactly is going on – and this time, you interact with other robotic people and engage in roleplaying dialogue choices that end up determining how people perceive you and what the robots want to make their future into. Overall, the game is pretty great. The core of the game is puzzles – each world contains 13 puzzles, in the form of 10 standard stages, two “statues” that give you “sparks” if you solve their puzzles, and one “golden door” puzzle that is only unlocked when you complete every normal puzzle in the game. While the Talos Principle 1 felt like it ran out of ideas in the middle, and resorted to making really big/long puzzles, The Talos Principle 2’s central conceit is that each of the 12 major areas of the game (and eventually, a thirteenth “area” of sorts) contains a new gimmick. The game starts out with a tutorial area as well, meaning there are, in effect, about 14ish areas in the game, with well over 100 puzzles in total. The gimmicks in each area end up working pretty well – some of them are pretty basic, like having a drill that can put a hole through a certain kind of wall, while some of them are more wild, like being able to transfer into multiple robotic bodies or teleport around the map. Some of these puzzle elements show up again in later areas, allowing you to mix them together, while others are mostly confined to one **** end result of all this is a game that is constantly feeling fresh; every area feels like it has enough puzzles to explore the idea without belaboring the point, and when you run into some of these features again in later levels, they are combined with fresh twists to keep things interesting and novel. The puzzles are also mostly quite short and snappy – generally speaking, there’s only 1-2 “core insights” you need to complete each puzzle, but the puzzles, despite their apparent simplicity, make you feel quite clever for solving them. The game does a good job of teaching you the game mechanics, and there’s only a couple puzzles in the game (mostly the “statue puzzles”) which felt like “they hid the piece in the couch cushion” rather than that you were missing a key insight. The puzzles are fun, interesting, short enough that you don’t forget what you’re doing, but hard enough to feel satisfying to solve. Moreover, because you don’t have to solve EVERY puzzle in every area, players who aren’t quite as good at it still have some outs – and there are also a (very limited) number of puzzle bypass items, that allow you to bypass puzzles – but you don’t get “full credit” for solving them, and you can retrieve these solution tokens by solving the puzzles properly. I didn’t end up using them at all in my playthrough, but it was a nice way to keep players from getting stuck if they were having problems. The game also keeps things interesting with its philosophy as well. Not only is the philosophy highly topical, but it is very interesting and humanistic – ironic, considering that everyone in the game is a robot. But the game’s philosophy is very cerebral, and the game works really well at encouraging the player to embrace hope over despair and cynicism. The message came through very strongly, and while you do have the choice to make the wrong choice, the game’s stance on what you should be doing is quite clear – you should be embracing the future and trying to build a better tomorrow, and take responsibility for the world and its environment. Given how many writers embrace techno pessimism, it was nice to see a work of art that pointed out how shallow and sophomoric such takes are. If the game had a flaw, however, it’d be in the core plot. While I loved the characters and philosophy, the game sort of embraced a sort of magic-as,technology thing that felt a bit out of place given its theming. While I get why they did it, and I did appreciate the moral choice it presented as well as the argument it presented for metaphorically accepting fire from Prometheus, I felt like it was a bit weirdly fantastic given how grounded the game is otherwise.. This game should not be$30.00. This should be priced as a AAA title!!! The polish that went into this beautiful game is mind boggling. The music is superb. The puzzles make you think, feel like a genius, and feel an idiot all simultaneously while providing your brain with enough stimuli to perplex the heck out of you. This is such a gorgeous game as well. I was blown away by the graphic, fidelity and foliage. The voice acting and sense of agency is astonishing. The topics and themes at play really get your mind going and offer up some of the most important questions humanity faces. What does it mean to be human? What is the point of being alive? Are we all just machines inside of one bigger machine? The questions that this game tries to tackle are way ahead of its time and I've never experienced anything like it. I don't normally give out 10 out of tens but this game definitely deserves. Everybody's respect. Even if you're not good at puzzle games, You will find some way to associate with this game. It's very accessible to the newcomer and the difficulty ramps up at a very fair pace. Highly recommended from this individual!. Incredible game from start to finish, filled with solid puzzles and unexpected emotional impact. Some small gripes about pacing and the monologues can get a bit...monologuey, but overall a strong 9/10 and an easy GOTY candidate (better than BG3 and maybe even Phantom Liberty). You owe it to yourself to play this game if you love puzzle games, beautifully crafted landscapes and great stories.. Great sequel. Very different from the first but the core idea and gameplay still remains. Worlds are beautiful and story keeps you interested all the way through. Most of the times I just wanted to blaze through the puzzles to get more story. Overall an amazing game. The only negatives I have is too many puzzle elements and much easier than the first. Could have done more difficult puzzles with less elements instead of introducing a new one that requires ""tutorial"" puzzles. All the puzzle elements were great though and they kept the game fresh so its kinda a double edged sword.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best philosophy-type game. Story, puzzles, music and visuals are top tier.. Its amazing, the cleverness, the music, the history, the design, truly a masterpiece. This is not a typical video game where you shoot something or kill enemies etc. This is a game that makes you think and reflect, a true work of art. If you are incapable to notice the difference between an ordinary game and something like this, then you are lost. This game deserves the 10 easily. It is for those who love video games and really enjoy exploring new game ideas that are evolving.. The Talos Principle 2 is a masterpiece. It's an incredible video game, an incredible book, an incredible painting, an incredible album, incredible conversations, an incredible experience... It's amazing from every perspective. If you enjoy puzzles, if you're into knowledge, if you have an interest in philosophy or Greek mythology, if you appreciate art in all its dimensions, this is your game. Pure beauty.. The Game Looks Good Enough 10 Out Of 10.. One of the best games I've ever played. Talos 1 was a beautiful journey, and I was wondering if Talos 2 can top it, and somehow it did. The story, gameplay, puzzles, content, graphics, characters, stractures. There's so much exploring and so much to discover, the new puzzle elements are extremely fun & there's a huge amount of puzzles (you don't need to solve them all). The king of puzzle genre is back, thanks to Croteam! <3. 1 was the best puzzle game ever made. 2 just surpassed it.","after 1 hour of playing it crashed, said that my game profile is corrupted and needs to be removed . despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews, it's still a good if not a great game . the game is intertwined with deep philosophical questions that make you think ."
596.Shogo: Mobile Armor Division,"I'm a great fan of Monolith's work from Blood to No one lives Forever to F.E.A.R. But the early years of Monolith Productions was kind off hard for them, of the games that almost make the company went bankrupt was Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, and... it's not hard to see why. Monolith decided to create a game engine of their own called Lithtech engine, it was made specifically for this game and later the rest of their game uses the same updated version... but this made no justice to Shogo what so ever because the game looks ugly... even for a game released in 1997. Character models looks awful, weapons and the arm model are as well terrible... the main character's fingers looks like if they were made from sausages. The story is not bad, but is not interesting. As this is an FPS game the only thing you do in the whole game is shooting at everything, but the controls are weird, I've encounter a situation were i had to shoot the weapon using a key rather than the mouse, i just couldn't make the game to recognize the mouse buttons to shoot. Although, shooting felt good and satisfying and the idea of switching from human to a giant mech was amazing... actually i did enjoy even more when i was playing as the robot shooting at other robots at the streets of the city than when i was playing as the human sections. Sadly... the game contains some frustrating difficult, enemies will never miss a shoot the can basically kill you in a couple of hits and they behave like if they knew from were you will show up. Is this game worth it? not really, you can play it if you want but it will not be a good experience.. This was the first shooter game I've ever played. And I'll never forget it. Surely it was one of the best games of its time. I remember with some offers, in those years, many PC were sold with Shogo bundled. The plot of Shogo was beautiful, articulate and with great sci-fi implementation. Considering that the game was released back in 1998, probably along with Half-Life was one of the first shooter to have a rooted and complex plot, and this isn't little. Among other things, the plot had more than one available ending, and this did nothing but made it a game quite advanced for its era. The gameplay Shogo was certainly not a joke. In fact, in addition to using the human protagonist, you can also use a battle-mecha, similar to those seen in the Patlabor anime. The shooter structure is made impeccably and feedback of weapons is excellent. There is an high cure and you really feel the difference between using pistols, or an assault rifle or a shotgun. Weapons are a dozen, several and beautiful, especially those used with mecha. You can also play Shogo as a third person shooter, but is rather awkward and cumbersome as method. Obviously, like any classic shooter, you have to keep life and armor in constant consideration; and the difficulty of the game is rather good also thanks to the good enemy AI, moving often and hit hard. The amount of violence is simply incredible and splatter, with arts splashing from all sides, based of type of damage received or inflicted. The maps and environment of the game ranging from labyrinthine stations or cities to wide open spaces in which to operate with maximum freedom. The frequency in using the human protagonist and the mecha is very well balanced and difficult to get bored of playing more with one than with another. The graphics of the game is simply stunning, one of the best of the time. I believe that, at its time, Shogo couldn't work on console because of its abundance and this why it is a game designed for PC hardware, and it is good. You can feel in the game an artistic achievement similar to japanese anime, both while playing and in cut-scenes; an aim surely reached by developers. The soundtrack is really beautiful, and intro's song is simply unforgettable. Shogo: Mobile Armor Division is a real piece of history for shooter games and especially for PC games. A must-have classic that, in my opinion, is still worth playing today.. Probably one of the best games of its time. I loved it for its pace, gameplay, and sheer fun factor. If you like mechs, first person shooters, and fast paced fun, pick this up and try it.. Shogo is an efficient, brutal and compelling action shooter that balances storytelling with ultimate carnage. A classic back then and a classic now. I recommend it for every nostalgia fan.","""shogo: mobile armor division"" is one of the first shooter games i've ever played . the story is not good, but the controls are weird . sadly, the game contains some frustrating difficult, enemies will never miss a shoot ."
597.Thirty Flights of Loving,"Thirty Flights of Loving continues the spirit of Gravity Bone in that it is a trippy experience that you won’t always know what is going on but want to know more and push on. Where it falls short was that unlike in Gravity Bone there wasn’t as much actual gameplay. In Gravity Bone I had to find items or people; plant devices; spike drinks; etc. In Thirty Flights of Loving it was a much more straight line of keep going straight and watch what happens. You were more a passenger than a participant. That being said the game still had a very good way of telling a story in a short time. It cut to different parts of time out of order and still manages to give enough info so you can piece together the narrative. There was also a great use of comedy and made me think of No One Lives Forever in this regard. The lighting was well done as was the clean and crisp objects. The people were poor but it was also a stylistic choice. The music was great and in the absence of dialogue helped tell the story as well. The end credits sequence was very original in that you are walking through a museum and the different art pieces are the various credits. I played Thirty Flights of Loving on Linux using Wine. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any glitches. There were two options for texture filtering; four options for AF; nineteen other graphics options and a vsync option. Alt-Tab worked. You could manually save at any time and had nineteen save slots. Game Engine: id Tech 2 Save System: Manual (any time) Disk Space Used: 175.4 MB Settings Used: All Highest; 16x AF; 1080P GPU Usage: 5-25 % VRAM Usage: 481-524 MB CPU Usage: 5-9 % RAM Usage: 1.8 GB I still found Thirty Flights of Loving a good experience but I wished it had more to do. I finished the game in fourteen minutes and paid $6.56 CAD for it. I would say the value was fair and it was enjoyable albeit a little less than Gravity Bone. My Score: 7.5/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 20.3.4 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 20.2.1 | Mate 1.24.1 | Kernel 5.11.2-1-MANJARO | Wine 6.3 | DXVK 1.7.3L-03f11ba. If this so called game had been honest about what it was I wouldn't have to give it such a terribly low score. I was deceived. This is not a game. It's like a first try from some kid in a game design class. A bad first try.. I like analyzing games from a technical/design standpoint: Thirty Flights of Loving is a masterpiece. It masterfully paces the story, using fast cuts and transitions, environmental clues, and efficient level design. While there is little for traditional ""gameplay"", I often hear the line that Thirty Flights of Loving tells ""a better story in 13 minutes, than some games do in 13 hours"". It's exactly this feat which the game should be judged on. It's exactly the fact that the developer had in mind to make the most enthralling game (no matter the length) he could, that the game should be judged on. And, that he had the courage, bravery, and balls to resist lengthening the game artificially, deserves huge credit. In every other medium, be it film, or books, the standard is to be as concise as possible. A 90 minute film which can develop the same amount of story and emotion, is always preferred to a 120 minute film doing the same. They criticize books or films having meaningless redundancy for scenes which don't have any significance or plot building. Only in videogaming is there a standard which says the Art needs to last longer. Just think about that, and if it is a rational standard to have. Try giving this game a chance to see what it means to break that standard.. FAIL! I passed this ""game"" in 7 minutes. What? Are you kidding me? I don't care how innovative it is - this is a showcase, and should be labeled as such. NOT as a game! Wow! What a rip off! I paid money for it?! WTF!. Not a game, pretensions as hell. The professional ratings only prove journalists want to seem intelligent by liking this ****. Theres no gameplay to speak off, and while there are a few interesting segments, the game is largely just filled with a bunch of **** Might make for an interesting flash game thats >>>>>>>>>FREE. TFOL seems to be a very controversial game when it comes to reviews, as it's a very ""iffy"" game, if you can even call it a game. I would call TFOL an experimentation, a prototype; a look into how storytelling can be changed. Saying that, I understand what Blendo was going for, they were attempting something new and trying to tell a story in under 20 minutes, but honestly it just didn't work. Maybe if they did something different this technique could've worked but it's just not polished enough and it feels broken or incomplete. There's even a couple random scenes that have nothing to do with the story they're trying to tell, like why do I need to know how wings work? I learned that in highschool and I didn't care then either. I just feel it's irrelevant and was simply to add a couple minutes more to the game so people can't say that it's less than 20 minutes (took me 24 minutes to complete both games (Gravity Bone and TFOL)). What I'm getting at here is if a developer wants to make a unique game, or an artsy game, throwing a couple stylized 3D models together in a few random consecutive scenes is not the way to do it. I love art indie games, I'm almost ashamed to say it since so many people hate them, but I like the art subgenre game that's been somewhat popular in the past few years (I loved Dear Esther). But TFOL doesn't do it right, and that's why I'm giving it such a low grade. I don't understand how the critics can rate it so high, call this what you will, but I think there's a small possibility that the critics were paid off, and some users jumped into the critic bandwagon (which happens pretty often around controversial games) and gave TFOL high scores to show that they weren't ""too stupid to figure out the story."" I understand the story, and I still think TFOL is a bad game. While playing it I could sense a fresh breath of air hiding under the badly put-together game, but until that refreshing feel surfaces, TFOL remains a complete mess. Hey, at least Blendo didn't make the character walk really slow to extend the length of the game. In short, these could be some reasons this game is rated so high: •Critics paid off, users jump in bandwagon •People want to pretend they understand it, even if there's nothing to understand •Purchasers can't face the fact they got ripped off, trick themselves into thinking it's good •Developer needed some cash and had an incomplete prototype laying around •Definitely not because the game is good. It's impossible to explain this game at all without spoiling it, since it's only about 15 minutes long. That said, Thirty Flights of Loving helped me truly understand the idiom ""read between the lines"": Almost all the interesting bits happen off-screen. You are shown the bare minimum you need to figure out what happened. And you won't figure it out right away either. I had to play it twice and sleep on it before I crafted the whole story in my mind, or at least my version of it. Like all stories, this one would be boring if told incorrectly. Thankfully, it is not.. I ended up enjoying it, but i can't recommend Thirty Flights of Loving, unless you carefully read about it and knows exactly what you'll get or experience. Then you can find it cool, just after you understand what it is. My first experience was disappointing. Being someone who usually enjoy art games or interactive experiences, i start it thinking about a cool, deep story-driven game, but i found me just watching disordered short scenes of a shallow and confusing story, instead of really playing something. It ended really fast, abruptly and letting me with a ""wtf?!"" in mind. The graphics, lights, colors and music are really cool, but it was not enough to make me enjoy. Then i try it again a few days later. Knowing what to expect, the experience was far better, and i used to enjoy it and understand it. Using the commentaries feature, i found it was a developer experience, something really personal using his experiences on gaming design and pieces he previously wanted to use in other ways. I don't read all the comments yet, and i still having to play better the Gravity Bone bonus, who seems to have more gameplay elements, but if you're ok with all that i said before, i can recommend this experience to you, it worth your time. But i'll not recommend to everybody, mostly without that explanation about what i feel in my first contact with it.. The high scores and the low scores are probably divided by the people getting the story and the people who don't get the story. I didn't follow what the story was about. Story telling isn't about graphics but this was too less emphasize on graphics for me.. I can't believe I brought this game, story isn't interesting at all. And to reviews saying it put a lot of love and details in the game clearly hasn't been playing it. More of a school project... Play The Stanley Parable that is a good game with interesting narrative. Not this.... If you like surreal, artsy short films you'll probably love Thirty Flights of Loving. It challenges what we perceive to be a game but unfortunately I cannot consider this as one. I want a game to be something that is thought-provoking and fun to play and if it can't be thought-provoking, a game that's simply fun would suffice. I didn't have much fun playing Thirty Flights of Loving and it was all over in a matter of minutes so I can't say I was too impressed.. I don't get this game. It is so weird and random (Not in a good way). The gameplay is none. The only thing you do is move. THAT'S IT! The game is really bad, stupid and it just doesn't make any sense.. This can hardly be called a game, I would not even dare calling it a demo, because also those are longer than this piece of Critic reviews must have been ordered and paid by someone, because a normal gamer just can't evaluate this ""game"" at more than 0 points. The only thing you can do is to walk and talk to characters. When you get to a point by walking, this sequence ends and you appear on a totally unrelated place, and walk again. This is repeated about 30 times (I did not count), and the game is over. If I knew that beforehand, I would throw the 2 into a bin instead of buying this that would be a better investment.. An interactive story that is whimsical, hyperactive, and over in about 15 minutes. The visuals are a step up from Blendo's free Gravity Bone, but the style, ""gameplay"", and storytelling haven't changed much. Lots of style and silliness without much depth. It's a $2 game that a small team has put a lot of time into though, so it's tough to complain... for me anyway. Don't go into it expecting much, and chances are you'll be entertained to a degree.. Let me start by pointing out the difference in the user score the the critic score. It's dramatically different, isn't it? Well, there's a reason for it, which I will get back to. I digress, I will have to join the side of the critics. This game is fantastic. The art style and overall graphics are beautiful and very well done. The story is great, but blink and you'll miss it. In terms of gameplay, it's basically walking, but the experience is so quick that it is almost -fun- to do it. But here's my one minor gripe with the game, and the reason people were not happy with it. It's short. Very, very, very, VERY short. On the first run, it takes about 15-20 minutes (I've beaten it in under 5). But that's what's so great about it. You play it once, and most people will try to get through the game to just beat it. But because it's so short, you go back and play it again, and see something you missed. And then you play it again, and there's a new detail. Sure, for 15 minutes, $5 is a bit high. But the experience is worth it. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But is it great? You're goddamn right it is.. [Thirty Flights of Loving Steam PC Score 9] A five minute Quentin Tarantino game movie an interactive movie trailer between Pumpkin and Honey Bunny; Yeah no **** five minutes only. Do you make games you figure out how to fit this into a game as an interlude hilarious and intense potential. Check this out (2bucks/steam). The developer knew the game was going to get bashed on, this game has a very interesting take on transitioning in games, infact I wish more games took this approach. Rather than having a consistent player space where content can indefinitely be admired, the player is trusted threw the narrative with no indication when a transition will happen; creating an interesting flow of player driven direction. Many subtleties will leave your face left with a smile during the developers commentary. This game is overlooked, and very short, but that's the point. The developer knew that many players would bash the game while leaving a very passionate niche. The game doesn't waste your time with it's very short completion time, and leaves room for re-playability with it's mind-boggling transitions and subtitles. I hope the developer doesn't read this because I haven't played it enough to completely wrap my mind around the game, but there is much to be desired. Thirty Flights of Loving is worth your time and money if you have the ability to differentiate video games from interactive media.. I played through this 3 times trying to piece together what the hell happened. That's part of the intrigue of the game though. It's open to interpretation and everyone will come away with a different understanding of the events. The gameplay itself is pretty dull, but the random jumps in time keep things interesting. The game also includes a free copy of Gravity Bone which is more fun since it's more interactive.. The 88 metascore is very misleading. I would not consider this even a game. It is a small interactive story that has nearly 0 things to interact with. The game takes around 10 minutes to finish. If you want to PLAY a game then avoid this demo. If you want to feel artistic and look at the blocky characters while wondering what is the meaning of live and how Reservoir Dogs is the best movie ever then this is the right kind of entertainment for you.. This is not a game and whatever this is supposed to be I must admit I didn't find it very artsy neither. The story is confusing (what's with the wedding scene?) and the graphics are not so interesting. I don't regret the money I spent for this (less than 2€ on Steam) but I surely regret those 20 minutes I spent running it.. Thirty Flights of Loving is a game that, just like To the Moon and Kentucky Route Zero, proves how powerful the interactive medium of video games can be in telling a story. Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other. But yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that's happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable. Thirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the ""game"" isn't really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as ""an interactive short story"". Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It's an experience that you won't soon forget.. I enjoyed this little roller coaster ride of a journey and it had some real high points, however I went in with high expectations based on the acclaim it had received and found the whole experience a bit lacking. There''s some beautiful moments and some really smart storytelling but it was so brief and slight an experience I'm not sure I really got a lot out of it sadly.. Thirty Flights of Loving is not a game in the traditional sense, and is certainly not for everyone. Your five dollars will net you a fifteen minute experiment in storytelling nothing more, nothing less. The game absolutely accomplishes what it set out to do, and successfully manages to tell an involving story (well, as involving as you can get in a little over ten minutes) with no dialogue or character text. A separate playthrough with developer commentary which I found very interesting is also included, which provides insight into the development process and what the developer intended to achieve with certain inclusions. All in all, if you're interested in the advancement of storytelling in video games, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you're looking for anything else, steer clear.. There is such little game-play besides moving and occasionally pressing E. I've played point and clicks games at least most try to put in puzzles. This is a game that was better served being a animation on YouTube. Torrent, watch a YouTube video, or play it if a friend has it don't waste money on this.. I think the expectations of many people on this were a little askew; I knew what I was getting into, that it only had 15 minutes of playtime and was rather a short story via the medium of a video game. And thus I was not disappointed, it was an interesting story where dream and reality meshed up, a story was told but in an unconventional way, with strong pictures and without many words. Agreed, this is not really a game. This is a short story. Or their equivalent in video games. - Cazy. Normally you should beware reviews of 0 and 10, because the reviewer has an agenda or is simply being childish in his extremity. This is the first game in 25 years of gaming that I truly thought deserved a 0, and it's because it isn't a game. What you will find in most of the high reviews is a lot of vague, flowery language used to champion the storytelling and quality of plot. I thought it was like 21 grams: a boring, predictable story that would have been so obvious and boring if told sequentially that they had no choice but to try and faux-art it up. So I would caution you as a reader to always look for the actual points made and examine them for content, rather than form. Here's an example. ""It's a portal to one's own imagination, the only lock on which is the limit he would impose on his own dreams--let go of all expectations to find it so much more than it first seemed."" I just described a door hot glued to a solid brick wall. Not only will if take effort to remove the door, but when you do, you're still faced with a brick wall, whose function is antithetical to that of a door. When describing a game, your first concern should be gameplay. If it isn't, you're not a gamer. You can care about other things, like plot/character, quality of voice-acting, graphics, price, etc, but gameplay is the fundamental reason why an idea becomes a game and not a movie. A blogger put it best (and I paraphrase) that it seemed like an attempt by someone who is confused by art and assumes that others are likewise confused, to reproduce that which confuses him. It's just a heist story with characters that don't even achieve one-dimensionality. The mountebanks that tell you otherwise are responding to their ill-informed gut instincts that the game is art, and as people are given to do, they oversell it as brilliant and groundbreaking in an attempt to somehow internalize those misperceived traits. These same mental gymnastics allow some to continue support of ""Indoctrination Theory"" in 2013. It's a half-story told though asynchronous set pieces separated by jump cuts. It has a kind of Diabolik era look to it, but each set piece is simply walked (or run) through with the occasional static activation of an object. In the opening scene you can grab bottles of liquor, a gun and some ammo, but you will never use them. As I approached what ultimately was the end, I thought it was a fun way to introduce elements of the back story before launching the actual gameplay. And then it was over, 10 minutes of absolutely nothing. I considered calling Steam and requesting them to remove it from my account, but its presence serves as an albatross around my neck and reminds me to always do my research. Dust off your copy of Out of This World if you're old like I am, or buy it from GOG if you still have your youth.. This is not a game. If you're looking for anything approaching gameplay, go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Go watch someone play it on YouTube. It'll be the same experience, but you'll still have your money.. This should be a free download. DON'T buy it. Those are 5$ totally thrown away. Critics should actually help gamers to choose which game to buy and this shouldn't have gone far than a ""20"" average vote.. Thirty Flights of Loving is a first-person interactive story. The story's incredibly short, and can be experienced in about 15 minutes. The story itself is told in short, disconnected segments requiring you to fill in the blanks yourself. 30 Flights is definitely an arthouse game. It has an interesting approach to interactive storytelling that may be worth seeing, but unfortunately, the story it tells is unremarkable. From what I could tell, there just isn't much substance there. What's much more interesting is playing with the developer's commentary on, so you can see some of the thought that went behind the experience. The game's prequel is also included, and while it's a longer game with more gameplay elements, it's designed clumsily, and you might be left with no idea where to go. This game has a very niche audience, and to them, this game will be worth far more than the asking price. It wasn't for me, though, and I get the feeling that it's not for most people, especially because the price doesn't pay for much content. It's worth experiencing if you have a few extra minutes, but I wouldn't pay over a dollar for this. If this looks interesting to you, I'd recommend checking out The Stanley Parable instead.. This experimental title tells a short story in a unique way, similar to that of Dear Esther and The Path. Unlike the other games I mentioned, Thirty Flights of Loving is annoying to play, triggers no emotion and features no attempt to immerse the player. It is true that this game is as long as it should be, but only in the fact of telling a story. The game has plenty of pointless ""gameplay"" elements, annoying sound effects and confusing mechanics. The title goes for 10 minutes, for a 5 dollar ""game"" it is a pretty damn big rip off. 10 minutes of confusion, 0 gameplay, linear progression, pointless features and no player impact of the story begs the question of why the player was given the controls in the first place. The new scene of art inside gaming is an interesting and for the most part a good thing, but Thirty Flights of Loving takes this scene to beyond ridiculous. The whole title is basically a waste, the story told in the ""game"" can be told a hundred times better on paper, or in a cartoon. The whole experience of this game can be summed up in confusion, and when the end credits smack you in the face after 10 minutes, you can't help feel like you have been hypnotized, then mugged for your lunch money without realizing.. Make sure you play the prequel to this game, Gravity Bone. It's free on the developer's site. Not hard to find if you search for it. As for this game, it's brilliant. It's more of a digital story and it's very well executed. The story is constantly progressing, and it only tells you enough info that you need to know. It leaves the audience enough room to use their imagination to fill in the blanks on the details of the story. WARNING! It took me 11 minutes to go through this! You have been warned! So it's hard for me to recommend this game since you're paying $5 for about 10 minutes. It's great, but hard to recommend people to pay money for it.. ****. You basically walk through an artsy story that doesn't make much sense and which leaves a lot up to interpretation. The story was not interesting or compelling to me. It also takes less than 20 minutes to complete this ""game."" I feel compelled to be especially harsh here, because critics have given so much praise to Thirty Flights of Loving, when I couldn't really recommend that anyone should buy this. So, you have been warned.. I am at a loss describing why this isn't free. There is nothing about this that evokes game and even as a story it's not interesting... Check the user ratings compared to critics. This is as pretentious as it gets. As an artist I can understand people using 'games' as a form of artistic expression and what not but this was pushing it. In short, it is a 5 minute walk through scene. I would not even call it a game and to me it felt like they created an intro with end credits but forgot to add in the middle part. I've played 'artistic' games like Dear Esther and The Path both of which played like the creators put a lot of thought and effort into an over all nice experience that made you really think about what was going on while leaving it's impression on you. However with this....'game' i walked up to the 'The end' block and seriously thought they were joking. The only impression I got left with here was complete disappointment. the short scene it's self is rather nice but had it been really drawn out more over maybe a good hour or two, i would have been able to appreciate it more. There were games made in the 48 hour game festival more captivating and content full then this. I don't honestly believe this took more then a week to make. Oh and the whole 'it's indie and cheap' thing does not excuse this. Just because it's an indie game doesn't mean they can make any crap they want and it's 'ok because it's indie.' I'm sorry but i am just too disappointed to be susceptible to this incredibly short story.... Only 15 minutes long. It's just a story, not a game. Avoid or you will be sorry. Most expensive game per minute I've ever bought. I want my GD money back, you will too.. This game is a total fraud and I'd like slap some sense into the Metacritics for **** me into purchasing this game. It's not even a game. In a game, you have some control over something somewhere somehow. This is a crappy flash movie where you press ""W"" instead of ""Play"". The story is totally cliche and boring. You keep waiting for the twist, the punchline, the epiphany, the revelation, and then BAM, ""The End"". What?!? 10 minutes does not a game make. Thirty Flights of Loving is a stain on the reputation of indie games. It should be called Ninety Megabytes of Nothing.. This game is not for everybody, and don't feel bad if you're not on the target audience. It's not elitist; it's simply trying to show a few things. There is no challenge to overcome, nor anyway to actually lose (except by killing yourself). Its more like a first person ""take a look on what we built"". It will be entertaining for those thrilled by the visual art choices and people who love to look into details. The directors commentary can be a lesson for those interested in building narratives. For anybody interesed in ""classic"" video-games, that is, win-lose situations, avoid this by any and all costs. You will hate it. For those interested in little details and an interesting approach on how to set a narrative in games, its great.. The first one ""Gravity Bone"" was much much better. The commentary was nice but my second play through crashed near the end. I do not think I will attempt to play it again.. Had I paid more than $2.50, I might have been frustrated by the ridiculously small amount of content in this game and I'm pretty sure there isn't even $2.50 worth based on the quantity or the ""quality"" of the graphics. When I read the reviews before buying it, I thought the claims of 5-15 minutes of gameplay were the usual reviewer exaggerations, but the game is really that short! Double it because it comes with its equally short prequel, Gravity Bone. Yet, for all its brevity and infantile graphics, there's something to this game: little twists in the plot that you don't see coming and a storytelling style that feels a bit like a 1960s psychological drama. As the extremely skewed reviews show, this isn't a game for everyone. You have to come at it like a wine tasting. Sure you pay too much for a small glass, but you get a taste of something you don't get every day. If you're an aficionado of the subtle things that go into a game and not just playing the games, you'll probably get something out of it. If you're looking for a game for the sake of playing it and you want a bang for your buck, you need to look elsewhere.. While this isn't for everyone, I found TFOL very enjoyable. It was short, but that wasn't really a bad thing, since you have to play it several times to really get what is going on, plus there is a developer's commentary. The story isn't presented chronologically, and it leaves parts out, leaving you to guess at what happened. There are clues left in the game, but much of it is left to guesswork. Working out what happened is the fun part, and what really makes it enjoyable. If you're still deciding if you want to get this or not, go play Gravity Bone, which is the free prequel. If you enjoy that, you might enjoy TFOL too.. What the hell was that ? It's not a game at all and i don't understand why peoples loves this and how it manages to makes money. I think this is the worst thing i played ever. Save yourself some money and go see a walkthrough on youtube, it's as interactive as the full game.. So long as you go in with the knowledge that this is a first-person short story, you'll enjoy it. The game is only 15 minutes long at most, but I believe that for that time the story is more enjoyable than many much longer games. The prequel, Gravity Bone is free so I recommend playing that first to decide whether you should spend your money on this one. Both games are Blendo Games triumphs and I look forward to more like this from the developer.. This game will surprise you, break your expectations, and make you care for the story. You will be delivered an emotional impact as you'll review what you know, new angle at a time - during the first play through and throughout the replays (you will want to play it again), when you'll learn to notice the more subtle stuff and start puzzling it out. It is fresh, fun, beautiful, thought provoking, and highly recommended by me.. I recommend it for the adventurous type, but only at a dollar or something. There are other games for puzzles and platforming. This one is about walking through a carefully crafted short story, and it's very entertaining because the story is crammed into the short form. I think the developer took a lot of time decorating the different rooms and figuring out how to show the story in an attractive fashion. I don't get the fullest out of the story because there's a lot between the lines (the bir",Thirty Flights of Loving continues the spirit of Gravity Bone in that it is a trippy experience that you won’t always know what is going on but want to push on . unlike in Gravity Bone there wasn’t as much actual gameplay . in Thirty Flights of Loving it was a much more straight line of keep going straight and watch what happens .
598.KILL KNIGHT,"Short and sweet and brutally hard (at least on the standard difficulty). Take my advice and unlock the rocket launcher primary. Made the game remotly possible for me.. got this for free on epicgames store i need to do 75 to post sooo ... brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Pretty rinse and repeat twin-stick shooter. Looks good and plays well enough, except I couldn't get my controller to work at all. And controller is the recommended way of playing. YMMV but I didn't care to keep on with the monotony after about 30 minutes.. Fast paced, strategic, replayable and leaves a ""one more run"" feel every time you play.. Kill Knight is a True Arcade Shooter that's worth playing! The game delivers an intense Sci-fi, Medieval, killer experience! Allowing the player to be absorbed in its abyss.. Incredibly challenging but so very satisfying as the mechanics all click into place, Kill Knight is fun as hell plus it looks and sounds amazing.. KILL KNIGHT has had the profound ability to capture my attention for seemingly unending hours - the constant pursuit of perfection and mastery over the game has been a journey worth taking, I don't regret a second.. Kill Knight is relentless heart pumping fun, every punishing misstep that spits me out is a siren call to descend back into the Abyss. Hands down best twin-stick shooter in years. Do yourself a favour and play this game.. WHAT THE **** KIND OF OTHERWORLDLY **** IS THIS GAME???? Devs aint messing around here. If I had a tokken for every time my I had to replace my tshirt from sweating playing this game I'd have all the unlocks already. Big ups. This is what a real game smells like.. Kill Knight throws you into a brutal abyssal keep where every battle feels intense and rewarding. The esoteric, retro-inspired levels are beautifully crafted, and the fast-paced combat keeps you on edge, leaving you coming back for more.. This is the sort of game I've been waiting for, for what seem like forever. So glad I've finally found a game that scratches that itch. (MY SCORE : 8.5 /10) Isometric Action-Shooter game which is fun and challenging even though the game is short and seems repetitive. There are 5 levels in this game, namely Solitude, Entanglement, Viscera, Echelon, and Reflection. BOSS will only appear in Ending Level Reflection. We have to face the Abyssal Sphere and after that we have to face Kuriel, The Last Angel in 2 Phases. Sever Mode will open after beating this game.. Insanely fun twin stick shooter! Play as the Kill Knight and use your mastery to slay thousands on demons. It never gets old! Pure game design heaven!. Kill Knight, an indie game by PlaySide Studios, is gaining attention for its challenging yet rewarding gameplay. As an isometric action shooter, it’s easy to start but hard to master. Players control a knight banished to an abyss, fighting through five layers of enemies. With four difficulty levels and online leaderboards, the game offers endless **** combat system is a highlight, requiring players to manage firearms, melee weapons, and ammo while building combos for increased power. Unlockable gear adds progression and customization, while the fast-paced gameplay and metal aesthetic draw comparisons to Diablo and Doom.Critics praise Kill Knight for its depth and creativity, making it a standout in the indie gaming scene.. Playing Kill Knight feels like a return to our primordial vulnerability, plunging into the abyss elicits a non-stop fight or flight response that'll leave you clawing for the safety of open ground or the bitter-sweet release of death.","short and sweet and brutally hard (at least on the standard difficulty) Kill Knight throws you into a brutal abyssal keep where every battle feels intense and rewarding . the esoteric, retro-inspired levels are beautifully crafted ."
599.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,"I thought this was gonna be difficult to play since i have only played the 3rd one a bit, but i was completely wrong. The story was really good, and it wasnt to long, which is good since i thought it was gonna be as long as the 3rd one or similar to that. Altough it isnt a big open world as the next one, this game had many and good secondary missions to do. The gameplay it wasnt beautiful, but it was ok, and for my surprise there were some bugs, not only at the gameplay but also at the audio, while it wasnt completely annoying, they could have fixed them. The soundtrack was good, it wasnt spectacular like other rpgs, but it was good. Overall it was really good, and i hope the 3rd one is as good as i remember.. I played The Witcher 3 before this one and I gotta say this game is also really good. While it might not be at the same level as TW3 it is still very enjoyable. Combat is harder here and game is not exactly open world like TW3. It has an interesting story and pretty good graphics and of course Geralt.. Don't miss out on a captivating legend crafted through the game's mature theme, immersive gameplay, and compelling storyline, drawing players into an unforgettable experience.. One of the best RPGs of all time! I can't believe the many choices that completely alter the entire game! You have so much freedom and the game reacts to your difficult, grey choices. Almost no other game does what the Witcher 2 does. It's soooo good!. The Witcher 2 still is one of the best RPGs ever made. The story and gameplay feels just right. A must play! Overall rating: 9.1.. Complete garbage mandatory email sign up it’s one of those **** games it forces you to sign into everything. The visuals in this game are amazing it's a huge jump from the first game. The worst part of this game is the combat I started the game on hard and I just kept dying for hours against basic enemies. I never realized what was wrong I thought maybe I was just bad at the game until I watched the video that Joseph Anderson made my god what an awful way to design a combat system. However the story and side missions are just as good as you would expect from a witcher game. I love how this game has two paths and many endings which gives it replay value. I hate how my choices from the first game have no important effects on this game.. I know I'm late to the party but I just had to say this is a treasure for all gamers!!! Don't miss out on this masterpiece.. Played the Enhanced Edition on XSX. Really surprised at how good the game looks considering its age and even more impressed at how good the story was. However the game does show its age when it comes to the combat which is really boring and also the quest tracker is so terrible I had to google multiple times to figure out what to do on the quest.. The Witcher 2 Enhanced edition is a great RPG game, full of great side quests and a great main quest. As a player who already played The Witcher 3 you will definitely enjoy it and feel connected instantly. As of 2021, the game lacks the polish you may expect, as well as the combat will feel outdated and clunky. The first 3 hours are very slow but once you get over it you will have more than 20 hours of great content. For 2.5 dollars, it's a must.. Great game. If you are to play it now, the graphics do seem a bit outdated but the story is great. The tutorial can be a bit overwhelming at first if you not used to playing PC. I myself had to concentrate a bit more since I have been a console gamer most of my life but once you get the hand of it, enjoy it.. The Witcher 2 is better than the first game and for me, the story is straight to the point than the 3th game of the series, i didn't finished yet because the Xbox 360 version is very buggy. In chapter 2 after picking up a king's blood in the mission ""Where is Triss Merigold?"" i was supposed to receive the rose of rememberance but i didn't received and now i have to play the whole game till this point and wish it do not bug. This game, for a fantasy game, has a fantastic story that in some ways is grounded more to reality than most in the genre which I prefer compared to the “save the world” motif that other games in this genre. Great combat and your ability to change the narrative depending on your choices in the story makes it a very replay-able game.. The Witcher series is omnipresent when it comes to RPGs. And after I played the stunning third installment, I gave The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings a chance. This game is beautiful in every aspect. The graphics are unbelievably good, the gameplay is fun and the story is beyond epic! Every RPG enthusiast and fan of the successor or predecessor should give this game a chance. You won´t get disappointed!. Still playable in 2020, thanks to the HDR patch. Rigid gameplay which needs to get used to. The story and the work in it makes most of the game, which pushes the notion of choice quite far. Sidequests are well worked too With links between them, it's rare enough to be mentioned. A classic of the european RPG.. I have spent many a day playing The Witcher 2. Its immersive story, stunning visuals and easy-to-use game mechanics make it an enjoyable experience, especially for those who like a story-driven RPG. If you have not already done so, I strongly recommend you buy and play this game.. One of the best RPG. Incredibly fast, fun, tactful combat system with amazing story.. A good game by the standards of the time. An interesting prequel to the Witcher 3 which offers some more insight into the life of our beloved monster-slayer. Captivating and immersive at its best.. The Game has a bad unfinished combat system the storyline feels like a side quests of other rpgs (its there but its not interesting). It feels like your story always gets interupted by boring events that you cant care less, like that women being a dragon uhhh ahh .... who cares. The characters are boring and the world feels like the fantasy world of a five year old that wants EVERY fantasy creature squeezed into one world. graphic are ok though. When i finaly thought ""now this is getting interesting it finaly starts to kick in now"" that were the last few cut scenes. I was left confused why so many people care for this game and thought it was decent.. I played W2 on my Xbox one recently. Graphics hold up really well. Story was the best part of W2. much more linear gameplay experience then W3. Combat was a lot more stiff and harder to use commands then W3. The worse part about W2 was the quest markers, would not show where to go for the next quest or give info on where I should go.. what a game! Amazing in almost every aspect. Is even better than most of recent games (GOTY included). Maybe i start that i played in 1st part of Witcher. And its wasnt good as i suppose. Gameplay was boring, were many bugs, and long loadings were terribles. And now i bought 2 part on xbox 360. And i love it. Great story, much much better than 1st Witcher. One of the best looking game on Xbox 360. Great work from polish people who try best from old console. Shame that one of the disadventege stay in 2 part, loadings, but shorter than in 1st part so only 1 point i have to subtract from rating. Hm.... I think it is great game, but its not masterpiece, i give 8.5 but i cant, so my rating is 8++. Great game but something annying me by bugs and little problems , that why only 8.. The Witcher 2: Assassins of kings was the reason why I got myself an Xbox 360. That and the impending arrival of the truly epic The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I wanted to find out why Wild Hunt was shaping up to be the epic next-gen game that everyone was raving about. To find out why, I'd have to do some 'research' first. My time with The Witcher 2 was short lived. Besides the story and fascinating world conceived by Andrzej Sapkowski and realised by the talent at CD Projekt Red, the unseen consequences to every decision, the gimmick of switching between your silver sword and your steel sword, the game felt largely based on the Dragon Age titles and to a lesser extent Demon's Souls. The various Signs that Geralt can cast add another unique element, but are essential when considering the game's combat. The map display for quests is flawed and the chapter-based open worlds prevent you from revisiting certain areas, meaning that if you don't complete all the quests in that area before moving on with the story, you automatically FAIL them. Don't get me wrong. The Witcher 2 is a good game, but I don't think it's full potential will be realised until The Witcher 3 comes out.. The gameplay is painfully boring, slow, and repetitive, the combat has some interesting concepts like using traps but it's a horrible clunky mess, and the user interface is extremely annoying to deal with (on a PC it's probably fine.) On the other hand, the story and lore are very deep and interesting and there's tons of dialogue and cut scenes. I would definitely watch this if it was a movie, but as a game it's awful.. This was my second favorite RPG of all time, after Mass Effect 2, now after The Witcher 3, it has gone down to third. One of the things that i like the most about this game, was once more, the Storytelling and the writing itself, the dialogue, and situations, are probably thing that would make Andrzej proud. I just love this game as a hole, and once again, its biggest problem, is its difficulty, because fighting a **** KRAKEN in the first 5 hours isn""t that fun when you have to die a lot... But since it's not has OP has the first one, is quite nice that i can play it just dying like, less times than the first one. 10/10. Picked this up after playing loads of the witcher 3 and i'm really loving it. Big choices and more of the same great combat and storytelling as 3. I think I actually prefer the levelling system in this game. Overall, better than I had excpected and gets a 9 becuase it has a lot of walking over the same ground again and again, with no sprint, which can be tedious.. The Witcher 2 is a semi-open world action-RPG that has you playing as a witcher, Geralt of Rivia. The story involves you tracking down a man named Letho to clear your name of a crime he committed and you were blamed for. The combat is enjoyable, with five different spells to use and, of course, your swords; steel for humans and similar species, and silver for monsters. Aside form the intruiging main story, there are quite a number of side quests you can go on. The decisions you make in the story can genuinely impact the plot, I should mention. Also, I like the leveling up and crafing systems (the oils and potions work well). As for the **** minigames are kind of lackluster and the glitches are a real pain (these are the most obvious but not the only bad things about the game). At least one side quest became broken due to a glitch. Still, if you're thinking of playing this game before The Witcher 3, do it. It's a fine game but not quite on the level of The Witcher 3.. First of all, this game is harder than Dark Souls by a wide margin. It's a true RPG reminiscent of older Bioware games, with a heavy focus on choices that actually matter, long-winded and robust storytelling and game mechanics that take a lot of time and skill to master. The actions you take along the story feel meaningful, the quests are difficult and rewarding and the combat is deep and flowing and play out much like the Arkham series games. There are flaws to be had, but in the end they are small and easily forgiven. The first and foremost flaw is that the game can feel clunky at times. The stealth mechanics aren't very good and only come up a handful of times, prompts are finicky with showing up and often times things feel delayed. I also feel that the UI, especially in the menu (which you will be frequent constantly) is not very quick and lacks simple yet obvious options like a sort button. The only other issue I have is just a personal nitpick, in that the whole game is just three separate chunks. You do everything in one area until you decide to advance the story, do everything in the next area, advance the story etc. Even the quests that span the whole game are separated into three instances of the same quest essentially. It makes it feel much smaller and that you are forced into doing things a certain way, since you can't leave things for later and come back, like in a game like KotOR allows. It leaves it feeling a bit too grindy for me. I didn't experience many glitches, and the only notable one is when I did a group finisher, it got stuck in a loading screen after the short cutscene (why is this even a thing?), which didn't bother me only because I saved seconds prior to the fight. This game is a must for RPG fans, but beware that it doesn't do much to hold your hand (I died a few times just in the tutorial on normal and several times early in chapter one before I got the hang of it). The game feels much older than it is, by way of being clunky in the way games from the early 2000s are (think KotOR), but if you have patience, the game really opens itself in accessibility once you start figuring things out. I recall getting massacred on normal early on in my first playthrough, but breezed through those same sections on the hardest setting on my second time around. The growth does not come only in the character, but in you as a player as well, and the entire experience feels very rewarding.. I have not very much to say about this game. You may disagree but with my Xbox360, the frame rate was pretty low, therefore less fun to play. The graphics didn't look too bad, its very good for it's time. The combat system was somewhat fun and brutal and the magic was useful for many situations. But the game feels a little boring, this game is way over-hyped in my opinion. Not the RPG for me. I would recommend Fallout or The elder scrolls.. Have changed my rating due to a wrong console version. I meant for the PC not the Xbox. Given a third party patch the game works... Third party.... sad... still..... Thank god this was a freebie with xbox gold, and its obvious why... Go here, button mash this, pause, drink potion, die, repeat, sit through another cut scene. This game lurches around like a blind drunk game of tennis. And where is this open world to explore?... you can't go more than a few steps off the pre-determined path. And since when does any decent 3PRPG not let you customise your character; who the hell wants to play as an ugly old man who keeps taking his shirt off? Still at least its better than that pointless Dragon Age nonsense but it is a very long way from a Skyrim or Oblivion.. Outstanding mature rpg with gritty punishing combat and an extremely immersive setting. I love the specificity of The Witcher's world, there is nothing generical, nothing vanilla, every monster and npc has a specific purpose and reason to exist in its ecosystem. And your choice do matter. About 33h to complete Main Quest+Sides Quest. One of my favorite rpgs of all time. Cant Wait for Witcher3!. Lets start from intro. Thats how games on next gen should look like. AWESOME. The game itself is quite interesting, but overall i think its also a bit overrated. Story is quite nice, interesting, the graphics are ok, this isnt unreal engine which is great because im tired of the games that look like copy/paste products (after couple hundreds of games on UE i really am sick of it). So what made me say this game is over rated? Gameplay - its just quite bad. Fighting seems a bit stiff just like the animation of characters. And if You take A/V from the game whats left isnt that impressive. Chceck Game of Thrones RPG - i was playing GOT after i finished Witcher 2 and besides awful Unreal Engine in GOT the game was way better in terms of story, and got pummeled by critics for... stiff animation and bad gameplay :D So the Witcher just cant get reasonable higher score than GOT RPG. TL:DR My Gameplay Time (1 walkthrough): ~40 h Graphics: 8 Audio: 7 Gameplay: 3 Verdict: Overrated, but not half bad. 7/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I had heard a lot about this game and after seeing the Witcher 3 on E3, I just could resist any more. And I got what I hoped. This game is one of the best of the past generation. I avoided it cause I hate RPGs, but couldn't resist the awesome story. Game of Thrones meets Mass Effect in a very EPIC way. The gameplay has so many aspects and all of them are well refined as are all the features. Even the puzzles, even the small details, even the recipes... everything is pretty well made so as to serve a purpose and make it meaningful. The story is probably one of the best in the history of video games and is pretty mature giving you choices that matter and that feel very ""grey"". We await the arrival of Geralt next Feb ten times more hyped.. The Witcher 2 is an amazing game. Story- the story is great, it has a lot of mystery and bombshells and keeps you guessing. Lots of characters can be a hassle but all are relevant and well written. Lots of different opnions, That intrigue you. The main protagonist is likeable, and the side characters are all well written. Content- it's a 55hr game. All the side missions (which are well done with different outcomes) there's a lot. Three different 'zones' you play in. Lots of different weapons and armours to acquire. Graphics- nice textures, shadows. Lots of colour in combat. Gameplay- swords, axes, hammers, spears, bombs, oils, magic, block, parry, daggers, traps. This tactical RPG ticks all the boxes. Three main skill trees, alchemy, swordsman, magic. Lvl cap is 35. Lots of enimies variety ranging from creatures and humans, and any in between. Sound- voice acting is great, sound effects for combat is great, background noise for nature is good but towns chatter is repitive. Overall but this masterpiece of an RPG.. Eh, it's the slightly more mature version of Fable. The sense of humor is awful along with the clunky combat. You can only accept and do one quest at a time, there's no explanation. Maybe Geralt has a limited mental capacity, who knows. I beat the game in a day and the side-quests are pretty craptastic. There's no variety in it and the love-making scenes are clunky and awkward and not to mention, hard to watch. Story's pretty bad and the narrative makes no sense.. This is a good game, but too much holds it back from being a really great game. The game has some really pretty graphics for the most part. My only complaint is that during the cutscenes the characters can often times seem a bit stiff in the face, which takes away from the immersion. The other problem with the graphics being as good as they are is that the xbox seems to struggle with it a lot when it comes to the cutscenes. Many textures pop in, which reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect game. Also, several of the cutscenes and story transitions pause to load, which to me was a huge drawback as far as immersion goes and really makes some of the story drag on, especially at the end of the second act. As a side note to something that takes away from the immersion of the game, IMO, the audio is downright awful at times. The audio can be all over the place from time to time, from loud to soft to loud. Also, at times it sounds like the actors/actresses were being recorded on subpar equipment with a level of static in the background. I just found this so distracting when I really was getting into the story and cutscenes. As far as the story goes, it is somewhat convoluted at times and can get a little confusing, but overall you get a sense that there is a depth to it that many games don't attempt to convey and they instead keep things shallow and simple. I would say that just as The Last Of Us has some very mature themes, this game holds that type of maturity, not withstanding the **** and cursing. I also really enjoyed the tough choices that didn't have an easy ""good"" or ""evil"" slant to them, as well as the game having some large story shifts depending on the choices you make. Ultimately, for me the gameplay is where this game has it's many flaws as well as triumphs, which makes it a really good game but also a very frustrating one at the same time. As said by many, the beginning is downright infuriating. I will not say it's impossible like some say, but I also can't say that it's just hard and takes skill to get through. Instead, it feels like you were thrown into the deep end without being told how to do almost anything. The small tutorial throws so many things at you at once that I had a hard time remembering what controlled what. That wouldn't have been a problem if the game had allowed me to slowly get use to all the things Geralt can do, but instead, I quickly found myself surrounded by foes, getting slaughtered several times before realizing that the dodge move would be my greatest ally for the first quarter of the game. It really made the first part of the game a huge chore to get through, and instead of allowing me to fall in love with the game's story and gameplay, I became increasingly frustrated. I actually stopped playing the game after the prologue and didn't plan on continuing. But as RPG's go, the setting was one of my favorites, so I picked it up again after about a day, and once I got past the prologue that's when I found myself enjoying it more. Some other smaller and yet frustrating things is the annoying cap on Geralt's weight limit coupled with the very involved and often complicated potion making system, making me want to carry as many ingredients with me as I can but not being able to. Also, I liked the alchemy system a lot and the various things he could make was really interesting and could have been fun, but the user interface it's wrapped up in is really complicated and in my opinion annoying too. For me, I actually had a lot of fun with the combat once I got past the frustrating beginning. Yes, the lock on mechanics are pretty awful, the parry and countering system isn't consistent, potion making and taking not being allowed in combat is just weird, traps and knife throwing is too slow and odd, and his magic signs not packing as big of a punch as I hoped for is unfortunate, but I got a lot of satisfaction from hitting monsters and humans alike with the swords. It just felt like I was a slaughtering machine and I liked that. As others said, the map isn't that helpful, and the quest markers are pretty awful. I know I spent a few more hours in the game because I didn't know where the hell I was suppose to go sometimes. Lastly, to me the game does get repetitive around the middle of the second act when you realize that each act is the same as far as overall gameplay goes. Your ""hub"" is a town, and then you can ""explore"" a little bit outside of the town, but that's about it. At least half the game has you running around these towns looking for people to speak to, and all you do outside of towns is find things, people, or monsters and then come back to the town to progress the story. Overall, I loved the setting and the atmosphere of the game and had fun playing it. I will never understand 10s or 0s on Metacritic. This gets a 7.5 for me. Wishing TW3 fixes these things and makes the best RPG to date. Thanks for the read!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is the best RPG storytelling in gaming history. It can be quite difficult also. The decision making is tangible and the combat although a little slow is dynamic and fun. What I really want to emphasize here is the visuals and the storyline. This game is like a great book, the main character Geralt feels like an ancient warrior who the player must slowly immerse into a changing world. It is rewarding, the dialogue is interesting and the game, although very very large, does not feel repetitive. This is my favorite RPG of all time and I would recommend it to the Pope.. TERRIBLE CONTROLS, REPETITIVE COMBAT... ...Many people are suggesting that the Witcher offers subtle, layered gameplay that's complex, tactical and realistic. In reality the controls are infuriating and unpredictable. You will spend most of your time rolling around in elaborate semi-circles on the ground like some drug-crazed loon with a big sword strapped to your back. If you want a game that simulates epileptic fits then the Witcher may be for you. The lock-on mechanic will get you killed the Witcher cannot strafe, he cannot side-step a foe. He does roll though, and that's about it. Anyone who's used to the fluid, natural sword-play of a Zelda game or even Prince of Persia will be left reeling and yes, I know those games are easier but they play well and that's the point. There is real ambition in the story-telling and the cut-scenes dramatic talking heads that easily rival Mass Effect but the play is in the controls and they are distinctly rubbish. Save your money, the Witcher 2 is a huge disappointment.. Great story, solid gameplay, and appreciated mature themes. This is the type of game those of us who grew up playing Nintendo and Sega console games have been waiting for. Movie-quality story, adult themes, occasional nudity, bloody and gore. It's as good as your favorite action-adventure movie. Fantastic voice acting, characters you grow to care about, and terrific pacing. The menu system can be clunky at times, but for an overall gaming experience, this one is hard to beat. Without question, belongs in the same tier of action RPG games as the KOTOR franchise, Mass Effect, and Fallout 3. CD Projekt Red has created a gaming experience. Anxiously awaiting the third in the trilogy.. What a waste of money! I've never wanted to throw a game in the garbage before! Luckily I only paid $30. But that is still way too much money for this piece of crap! I gave it a 1 for the sole reason that it actually booted up!. This game is outstanding. Coming from the Baldur's Gate and Fallout background, I absolutely love the proper RPG feel in Witcher 2. The story feels real and engaging. Dialogues are amazing. Game mechanics are pleasant. The world is alive, and there's a freedom of choice. Yet, there are few things I didn't like. The story feels too political at times; and it's rather linear. I wish there was more freedom in the Witcher world. Conversations sometimes become too long and too deep. I love a good dialogue in Witcher it feels like reading George Martin book but I often caught myself tired of following all the intricacies of the conversation. Some things stroke me as unrealistic. You can freely pick up stuff from people's houses. Of course it makes things easier... but perhaps too easy? While the fight dynamics are pretty satisfying, I do wish there was more combos. And the fact that you can't restore health in a fight is really annoying at times. On the other hand, it certainly makes for unique strategy in this game.. Great game just not long enough. Loved the story and characters. More of the same please only bigger. And why only release it on nxt gen.? As long as it lives up to the last one I'll forgive you.. I give this game a 5 mainly because its not as good as the hype, plus not to mention people compared this game godlike to that of skyrim which made me feel like buying it more. I bought this used at gamestop with a $20 off coupon so i paid $7 for it so it was definitely worth that price. Don't get me wrong the story of this game is a great one, and you don't need to play the first one to understand the story. Though this game is more story than gameplay to where I find myself often bored and rushing some of the pointless dialogue. It feels more like you're watching an epic medieval movie where you get a few free moments to live it. The graphics are great and the textures are sharp with amazing contrast to the colors. Very vibrant foliage while out questing that is pleasing to the eye. The towns on this game look very disappointing. They look like a giant just ate a village and crapped them out calling it a town. Very difficult to navigate through and ugly to they eye. Combat in this game is a plus because its very creative and I love the direction the combat system is moving for this game; however, with this game being more story and dialogue you hardly get to enjoy questing and fighting baddies in this installment ****. You can craft armor in the game which kind of makes me think of a watered down version of monster hunters armor crafting. The side quests get a little on the repetitive side and you spend alot more time in dialogue of your quest than actually questing. The bad guys in the game get old after a while because it seems most of them fight the same way. I will say that in dialogue it stays true to modern RPG's where you can decide what happens in the game rather than it forcing you to do something. I'm the kind of guy where I work many hours at my job so when i get home and have caught up with dinner and more I have about 2-3 hours of gaming left before its time to pass out, so this game wasn't truly for me and reason is because 2 1/2 of those hours I spent gaming were more sex scenes and dialogue than actual gameplay. The maps aren't very open more so limiting, yet still looks great and the game itself can be beaten quick. The game plays more like if you took Fable and mixed it with dragon age origins, and hours upon hours of dialogue with a better story yet improving the combat features. This game plays well on a day where you're hungover and don't want to focus on gaming yet giving yourself a movie experience. If you love nudity and softcore sex scenes in games over actual gameplay then this a game for you. If you want to be a gaming hipster/elitist and say you play something thats not a popular skyrim game then this is for you. I just found myself unsatisfied after beating the game and was wishing there was more gameplay to it. I mean the game itself on xbox 360 was a 2 disc game, so i was expecting a game that would take me months to beat while being **** in its vastness. So yeah I was let down alot. I think the 3rd installment of this game will be alot better. It looks like they might be giving gameplay more of a spotlight this time. If you have alot of time on your hands and love medieval themes with sex scenes and alot of story then this is for you, but if you love to be more interactive with your game then I would say hold off till the 3rd one and play games like Skyrim, Dark souls and Monster hunter. Still a shame that with a good combat system you don't get to truly enjoy its potential.. Disappointment sums it up... Playing the Witcher 2 feels like a chore; it's not enjoyable but more of a bore. It features very linear gameplay, and is not the open world thriller it's been marketed as. Instead of a vastly open map you navigate through a spider web of trails divided into small regions which are susceptible to load-outs when boarder hoping. Combat controls need to be executed precisely and will take hours to master. The game often leaves you in combat situations that seem impossible thanks to the stubborn controls and complexity of motions required. The sad part is I want to like this game so much, I put it back in my xbox once a month only to remember that its ****. And whats even sadder is, I'm decently hyped for the Witcher 3, as if it will be any different.. The Wither is my favorite franchise. The game hasa an adult plot, interesting characters and outstanding graphics. I can not wait to see The Witcher 3.. Although i started playing this game with a lot of enthusiasm it really didn't deliver the experience i thought it would give. Lot's of cut-scenes, loads upon loads of dialogue, a good share of technical issues, a horrible in game menu, a frustrating map system, all wrapped up in a very boring and uninteresting story to say the least... Don't buy this game, it's a waste of both your money and your time.. The story and characters really tie together well and make for an interesting and purposeful gamin","the story was really good, and it wasnt to long, which is good since i thought it was gonna be as long as the 3rd one or similar to that . the soundtrack was good, it wasnt spectacular like other rpgs, but it was good . the visuals in this game are amazing it's a huge jump from the first game ."
6.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"Grades on MC suggest you should get ready for absolutely top of what gaming has to offer. Unfortunately this game is more of a relict of the past that Nintendo cannot and is not able to leave behind. No dubbing (that one there is only stresses out that full dubbing is missing),practically non-existent story, repetitive gameplay and assets. Had this game been cut into pieces, you would not feel you have missed anything. I do not buy this open world concept. I adored LA Noire, where open world was only a stage for the story, but completely empty map with some redundant collectibles does not make this game great. Game feeds on lowest gamer instinct of collecting and exploring but is shallow and too repetitive to be something truly unforgetable. Great starting title for Switch. Absolutely average game all in all. If it was not called Zelda it would have a rating closer to 7. This is the true power of Nintendo, promoting average games into ""legends"". Even though this is not my favorite Legand of Zelda game or my favorite game, it is one of my favorites and I think that it is one of the Greatest video games ever made and there are many reasons why I think this game deserves a 10/10. Great Art style... And One best Game that changed open world... This games is bestZeldai have ever played. The game is a master piece, it's perfect and has as much as possible possibilities and playing and replaying it you always discovers new things.. Still an amazing game. Played it recently again and it just shows you how much is possible for this console.. Another masterpiece, with its large and contentful world, breath of the wild is an insanely good game. A game that **** you in and never lets go. Amazing mechanics, fun to explore, while feeling good to play. It was the first Zelda game I played from start to finish and introduced me to the other games.. Just perfect, fun to play, fun to adventure and puzzles. It is like true successor of the first Legend of Zelda.. this game deserves to be one of the all time greatest games. It does still have its flaws, most notably its garbage dungeons and repetitive bosses. I HATE RAIN SO MUCH. So many options , great story , so much gameplay and its so fun . Was my favorite game for some time especially the puzzles are great. 100% the best game I’ve ever played. Genius. Totally immersive world. I can forget I’m on planet earth when I play it.. Perhaps the best game I've ever played. It was simply beautiful. The load times were good, the story was engaging, and the graphics were nintendo's best. I love this game.. Interesting world with interesting plot, but the graphics and style are unique (subjectively, but in my opinion in a bad way). I love this game! I've played it for almost 90 hours and completed a lot of side quests, like shrines, Korok seeds, and the Divine Beasts. There's still so much to do! In other words, the story is huge. The only downside is the inventory management. For example, if you want to cook a dish, you have to select five ingredients from your inventory and drop them in a pan to start cooking—and the game only allows you to cook one dish at a time! That process takes a lot of time.. Truely the best zelda game i have ever played! Such breathaking sceneries and so much lore! Simply Amazing!. incredible game.. Great game, love the open world, amazing shrines, my only problem is the shrine quests were annoying and confusing at times. Best single player game I have ever played. The beginning of the end and the start of Ubislop ""Nu-Zelda"". Avoid this festering diseased sore like the plague.. It is an extremely fascinating game that captures the sense of the series: exploration and puzzles. I love that there is no ""correct"" solution but an intended one (unintended stuff work) It is mostt fun for ages 9+ because of the importance of understanding the environment and the dialog to understand the abilities (that is what held me back on the first shrine in 2017). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My 4th Zelda game & 3rd one I couldn't bare to finish, I just don't get the appeal, even with this one being different & a true open world yada yada, I'd rather just play Genshin Impact than this, lol. Found nothing about this game interesting, Link himself I've never been liked, I tried to give this game a chance & played for several hours & found none of it even a little fun.. The nintendo swich is worth buying for 'Zelda' alone. I really played for hours without putting the console down.. This was my first open-world game, and I have to say, l couldn't have asked for a better introduction. The fights are well put together, the story is well thought out, the dungeons are incredible, and the landscape is beautiful. the world is full of out-of-the-way things to explore, incredible sidequests, and epic fights. the mechanics are very well done, as the runes are extremely useful, though some are better than others. I love this game, and after beating the Champions Ballad DLC, I do have to say that this game is well deserving of its 97 here on Metacritic.. This game is simply a masterpiece. The deep story, combined with an addicting and absolutely enjoyable gameplay, this game never seizes to make me smile due to how great it is. Definitely deserved GOTY and is one of the greatest games OAT.. I've played several Zelda games for 30 years and for one or another reason I've never completed one until Breath of Wild. I found this game relaxing, stressing, fun, thrilling. This is a masterpiece, it does not matter when you read this, you MUST play this game.. Insane game it changed my life, I can´t describe how muchI love this game it´s perfect. BOTW is an absolute masterpiece and definitely deserved goty. With the open world aspect, BOTW was ahead of its time, and executed everything perfectly. This game is amazing. Best game of all time. Absolute masterpiece ****. Bravo Nintendo!. Genialna gra ale lepsza tears of the kingdom dlatego że tears of the kingdom jest bardziej rozbudowane. Simply the best game I've ever played. It opened the whole Nintendo universe to me, and it couldn't have been a better start.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best games of all time, definitely the best Zelda game and it would be my favoruite game (if Luigi`s Mansion 3 didn`t exist). This game revolutionized open world games. It has a perfect story that broke my soul (in the good way), a fitting, natural and fantastic feeling gameplay, a peaceful, natural, unique and perfect world/world building that encourages exploration, deep characters with interesting backstories that are extremely easy to empathize with and it features a light, gentle soundtrack and sounds that draw you into the game world perfectly in a unique and charming way. But I still have a few issues with the game. The shrines in BotW are overall pretty good, but they could have been much better, because a bunch of shrines are blessing shrines and most shrines aren`t too overwhelming. My second problem are the ""dungeons"". In my opinion dungeons of previous zelda games were way better than the titans from BotW. My last problem are the quests. Most quests in the game are okay and I wish there were more of the banger quests, because the game has shown in some cases that there are banger quests. But overall this game is fantastic and there is ALWAYS a WOW-effect. Definitely worth a try. 10/10. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a must play game. The visuals are quite good, although running on the Switch, I saw no problems visually when playing the game. The music, story and open world are incredible. It feels like every character has life.. Even though it is a really fun and enjoyable, it still has its flaws, like the bosses and the poor story, and the simple combat system, but those flaws are overshadowed by its amazing gameplay, both in bringing a new and unique (at least for the time of release) Open World, and the incredibly satisfying feeling of walking around and doing missions.. This beautiful game blew the formula for the series wide open and reimagined the land of Hyrule in an expansive open world style. With a lovely art style looking as though its being drawn in front of your eyes, every action feels exciting and satisfying to do. The most enjoyable aspect of the game is the sheer amount of ways you can approach each challenge, whether its invading a bogoblin camp by lighting their dynamite barrels or stealthily eliminating each one there are endless ways to experience the games and use your ingenuity to play how you can imagine. The story is simple but with many hidden aspects to uncover if you choose and many interesting side quests like the eventide island trial. A large controversy for players is the low durability of the weapons however I believe this encourages the player to always be ready to adapt and think quickly without relying on one overpowered weapon throughout the game. I wouldn't recommend finding all 900 korok seeds however would thoroughly recommend beating and then exploring the lands to your hearts extent as this is one of the most defining games in history.. Hands down the best game I have ever played, I dare say the best game ever in the history of video games.. the best open world game i've played and the best Zelda I've played, along with it's breath taking graphics, and amazing story. it is very great game i haven't finished yet but I made 3 beasts and it is very good I think there should be more instroucions in shrines i don't like system of breaking weapons beacouse i think weapons are not enaught durability but open world is very funny and plot is nice and it isn't really hard to understand. Truly one of the Greatest Games of all time, Made me want to play many of the previous LOZ games and made me understand the spark the Zelda series has had for loyal fans for years before this released, Still exited to play Tears of The Kingdom when I can. Not just another open world game, very immersive and entretaining. Beautiful graphics and subtile but very well composed soundtrack. Masterpiece.. Most of the content in the game is perfect and the animation beautiful. My only gripe is the final boss that may be thrilling at first but can get boring. just buy the game if you have a switch its worth it. top notch gameplay and animation. I certainly do love this game and I spent so much time searching every nook and cranny for all of these shrines. The story was sad and intriguing and I do recommend it for anyone looking for a fun adventure and puzzle game that Zelda is so known for.. Breath of the Wild is a great game, no doubt, however, it's far from a great Zelda game. The characters are amazingly designed, and their segments are amazing. My favorite part of this game was learning about the champions, Mipha, Daruk, Urbosa, and Revali, as well as the champion descendants, Sidon, Teba, Yunobo, and Riju. Learning about them was easily my favorite part about the game. Yes, areas like Zora's Domain and Rito Village were fun to explore but nothing was really there for the Longterm it was all esthetic beauty. Breath of the Wild in my opinion was weighed down by the Zelda franchises name.. 9.6/10. No game as ever captured the feelings of adventure and discovery like this game did. I'm usually more interested in serious games with realistic graphics, but the light-heartedness and childlike wonder this game has makes it so enjoyable.. Yeah I know it has its problems, but I don’t care it’s a 10/10 for me. Quite literally my favourite game of all time. I imagine a lot of younger people will grow up and have the same feelings for this game that I had for Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask growing up. Many of the older Zelda fans have disdain for this game because it is so radically different from the traditional Zelda experience, but I feel like they can’t think outside of their own experience and bias. The heart and spirit of Zelda are still here in spades, it’s still a nearly perfect game, and I fully understand why so many people consider this their personal masterpiece. It isn’t mine, but it deserves to be theirs. There is so much to love here, but the degrading weapons, lack of meaningful items, and disappointing quest rewards are really the only things that prevent me from calling it a masterpiece.. One of my favorite games of all time, took me about twenty miniutes of warming up to but once you start playing you realise how good the story is how enjoyable the combat and exploration is you will just fall in love. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a surprising game with beautiful graphics for a portable console and a vast world full of things to do and discover, taking Link to another level of fun. An unmissable experience for adventure fans.. The best open world that I have experienced in any video game. I always felt like the game was letting me figure out where to go and what to do.. This is easily the best open world ever made and nothing even get close to it.. It's a really amazing game, but to be honest I just never liked this open world style of Zelda. I really wish they could make another Zelda 3D in the future.. Don't get me wrong, this game is good, but it's simply not worth, Grab this when it's on sale.. Look, this game is not a master piece everyone is talking about, but it is still good. Yes, it is great that you can travel around and stuff like that, but people downplay the ****. The **** in this game is that towards the end, the amount of menuing and stats either makes the game too slow from spongy enemies, or makes the game way too easy with the stat boosts. They should have made the damage of weapons much lower and controlled. In every previous Zelda game, it is fine tuned how many times you have to swing a sword to defeat an enemy. Also, towards the end of the game, you kind of lose interest and don't really feel like getting items anymore. Definitely still a good game, and every open world game should have the Link's ""go anywhere you can see"" mechanic, but there are some icky things that just come with a game like this. After Ocarina, this is a new huge revolution for Zelda. This game changes everything in the videogame's industry. Amazing masterpiece, nothing to say. Thanks (again), Nintendo.. Masterful world building and gameplay mechanics, It evoked memories of Shadow of the Colossus for me while traversing the open world at times.. This game is cool, and easy to pick up and play open world game, but I don't care about that. I care about climbing ice, like on the good old days when I still had a physical form on the NES playing Ice Climbers. After some girl talks to Zelda about the cannon get full control and I run up to a wall and OH MY GOD I CAN CLIMB IT! And after I go outside I see it. ICE. I instantly rush over there, killing all the enemies in my path with a stick in order to get to the ice faster. And the climbing is epic. I spent 8 hours on this game, 7 of which were climbing ice and dying my clothes so I can look like my role model Popo from Ice Climbers. overall it was a great game.. Every Zelda game is great. This one is the best, at least out of the ones released in the last 10 years. A revolutionary game. Climb walls like an assassin, travel the world like a dragonborn, and soar like a crafter.. Breath of the Wild is the Ocarina of Time that Gen Z needed. Most of us young gamers missed the chance to discover Ocarina of Time like everyone else, I personally discovered it with the 3DS Remake, and while the remake helps you enjoy the game, you don't see it as a revolution in the gaming industry like it was when it was released on the N64. While I enjoyed Ocarina of Time and understood its legacy on the gaming industry, it didn't change me the way it changed the people who discovered it in 1999. But Breath of the Wild did, and I personally think of it as the second breath of the Zelda franchise, and the second time Zelda revolutionised the games industry.Breath of the Wild belongs to that small group of games where you are completely immersed in the game because everything feels natural and you can't find a place where you say: ""Hmm, this is what the developers want me to do"". Most other games use immersive story to do that, but Breath of the Wild doesn't have an immersive story. Breath of the Wild is just a bunch of crazy game design choices by developers who embrace emptiness to let the player enjoy the universe just by walking **** mechanics follow suit. Each mechanic feels pretty basic at first, but as you use the few mechanics you have access to, the possibilities are endless. Again, you don't think about how the developers thought of all the possibilities as you play, because everything feels **** last thing I want to mention is the art direction. The Cel shading makes the world colourful and pleasant. The last time the Zelda franchise used cel shading in this way was for Wind Waker, and the game hasn't aged a bit, and we can expect the same for Breath of the Wild. The most remarkable thing is the music... because it isn't. The music in Breath of the Wild fully embraces the nature in which you evolve, which is why most people say there's no music in the game. I can assure you that the game will not be as immersive if you turn the sound off. This also applies to the sound design, and there are very good videos that talk about how brilliant the sound design is in Breath of The Wild. I will end this review by saying that I think Breath of the Wild is the game the Zelda franchise developers always wanted to make.. This is the best game i have ever played in my whole life. It has a perfect story telling and it is an open world as well. I am a Zelda fan and of all of the games in the franchi. Everyone should play it at least once. It is one of the best games ever made. Too me the was the best open world Game I’ve ever played! Truly perfection in my eyes. Those who made this Game should be ashamed of themselves. As if they never played a Zelda Game in their Life. Breath of the wild ruined the other open world games for me. I got lost in this Hyrule and I loved every second on my exploration there, a very fluid and organic experience overall. I really struggle with the fact that this game has the ""Zelda"" name on it, to my it's kinda misleading in some aspect since this maybe to far apart from a typical Zelda type game. I disliked the ""dungeons"" this game has, I'm not a big fan ofmost of the shrines presented here and I would loved to see more which is a lot to ask because this game it's massive, but I can't stop thinking that it could have been much more and it's still one of the best nintendo games ever made just with the content it offers. This game feels like freedom, creativeness, a called to the exploration and a love letter to gamers in general. 10/10 Please play it and get lost in it, you won't regret it.. Absolutely life changing, this game made me cry over a thousand times, the second best experience of gaming for me (number 1 is ocarina of time) but this game is something else, i love you sincerely Nintendo. This changed completly my whole life.. Awesome and beautiful, but i really miss the classic music while you where riding epona. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. as my introduction to gaming as a child, this is hands down one of THE best games ever created.. This is by far the best game I've ever played. I can't recommend it enough. * This game is an absolute masterpiece. I'll definitely be recommending it to everyone.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awesome, compelling and inspiring, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild brings a memorable masterpiece to millions of players.. The game deserve 10/10 score but the story drags too long to be perfect game. Some content is just non-sense and boring. Animation often becomes repeat chore such as crafting food.. It's anathema to hate a Zelda game when Ocarina of Time is your favorite game ever, yet here we are. I hate even 'minor' details, like hidden collectible Korok seeds being found on the rooves of peoples makeshift shelters, forcing Link to run around on top of their bivouacs like a jackass. It's gonna leak like the titanic in WindWaker the next time it rains. Imagine finding someone's simplistic wooden shelter in the forest and then jogging around on top of it. Only a complete moron would hide a collectible in such a location. The combat bored me and I hated the new weapon durability system. You don't have enough inventory space to carry all the weapons you find, and EVERYTHING breaks in a handful of swings. You're back in the inventory system interrupting the gameplay over and over and over again switching to your next weapon. The cooking system is another massive unnecessary time sink unbefitting a hero of time. Can't the millions of other civilians who never help you fight do your cooking for you? Inventory management simulator. The fun of cooking is people TASTING your food afterwards, but it's a videogame and VR is nowhere near that realistic yet. The whole thing feels like unpaid work, like clocking into a job you hate and never receiving a paycheck at the end of the month. I can't think of anything positive to say. It rides on the coattails of open-world masterpieces like Skyrim, managing to be both WAYYY late to the party and WORSE in every conceivable way, including graphically. This ""Open Air"" game is so late to the scene that it's almost nonsensical to compare it to all the other masterpiece open world pioneers of the genre. GTA IV, Skyrim, Far Cry 2,3, Assassin's Creed 1, 2. Borderlands, World of Warcraft, ETC, ETC, ETC, are all vastly superior looking and playing games that came out years before. BOTW brings nothing new to the table that could be misconstrued as innovative - All it's new inventory management time wasting ideas feel like a drag on the entire genre. Ironically, the game begins with Link waking up from cryosleep having slumbered through the past 100 years, which is essentially what this game did, sleep through a decade of dozens of superior masterpieces that released in the intervening years. The art style is simply a WindWaker knock-off without the cel-shaded cuteness, both less impressive from an originality perspective and an artistic one. Technically it may be pushing higher resolutions and polygon counts, yet it still manages to look worse than the 2003 GameCube game, which is **** insane. I hate the Switch controller, both the num-chuk joy-cons (horrendous) and the pro controller, which is merely a 2005 Xbox 360 controller that's far less ergonomic and yet somehow costs more money : the buttons are sticky and the triggers ****, plus it's uncomfortable in the hands - as both were designed to be held by 6 year olds. The score is forgettable, so much so that I completely forgot it even had music until I had to sit down and write this review. Not awful, but so rote that the game might as well not have been scored at all. Seriously, they could have left it out of the game entirely and recorded some bird calls and some wind rustling through the trees and crammed it in here instead and saved the money. Why was Koji Kondo not in charge of the music this time around? Blow me, Nintendo. Having no music probably would have been more effective anyway, I don't know why they even bothered. Listen to the sounds of nature as you navigate a vast open world. Makes sense to me. The music would not have been missed - how am I even saying this about a Zelda game for Christ's sake? Plot wise it's an even bigger disaster : It's a complete rip-off of Wind Waker, just like the graphics. An apocalyptic event has taken place and left Hyrule Castle inaccessible to the player. Civilization has had to rebuild from the ruins and create a new world over 100 years. Instead of the old world being drowned by and endless torrential downfall of rain, leaving only the mountain peaks as islands, Calamity Ganon is trapped inside Hyrule Castle instead of it being trapped under the ocean. It's literally the exact same plot as WW. The cryo-sleep **** instead of being the ancestor of Link. It's the same exact **** thing. Instead of entering and cleansing temples, you enter and cleanse the giant magic beasts with their **** graphics and ugly architecture. They're the **** ugliest and least thematic temples in Zelda history. Ask any Zelda player to recall their favorite temples from the franchise. The colors, the music, the atmosphere... in this game, all the temples are the innards of giant **** robots. You'd have to be **** to come up with such a stupid idea. Exploring the insides of giant stupid **** robots. That's the theme of ALL the temples. Robots with the same textures reused again and again.. Everything when this games come out was genius. The only things people can say about it ( no me ) its not a big dongeon Zelda . Yes and like just play it at a new games and enjoy it because this is phenomenal .You are free. My favorite zelda game, so much to do and endlessly replayable with all the fun glitches the speedrun community has found over the years. Phenomenal game, clocked well over 1000 hours into this game and set my standards a little too high for other games lol. the legend of zelda thats wild makes y6ou fell like spider men and i cannot stress enoughow nig thjis world islke wow i gues mimntendo kockedliek wiow 7 out of ten because im i gn. This is the best game I have ever played. I've had it for over 8 years and I'm still amazed by the visuals and the gameplay. The story is great and the combat system is really fun. Definitely recommend.. Good game. However, the dungeons are lacking in personality unlike the previous installments in the franchise.. Truly a magical experience, redefined open world games, creating a new gold standard with endless entertainment. It has an amazing big world and rich puzzle elements, allowing players to use their creativity to pass a variety of levels.. This right here is the game that will forever be in my opinion the greatest more exciting *Legend of Zelda* game I have ever played, this will forever be my number 1 favorite and forever my #2 favorite game of all time in my opinion,and even I don't play this game at all or have the game on hand and not playing at all in my life, I don't care, this game will forever be my favorite.. One of the greatest Zelda game, TOTK is a little bit better, but BOTW is still a must have in your Switch or Wii U library. Nice game i really like the openworld and the **** my opinion this game is a masterpiece. This is good on Switch too as now you can take it anywhere you like! Otherwise, plays same as Wii U.. So much to love about this game. The animation, the playstyle, the excellent sense of adventure and exploration. My biggest gripe - the weapons are made of glass, they break constantly. Don't get attached to any weapon, you know it's going to shatter in a few minutes!. Langston Abdullah on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an expansive and captivating sequel to Breath of the Wild, elevating its predecessor's open-world exploration and inventive mechanics. The game introduces new features such as sky islands and underground regions, adding layers of verticality and depth to the already vast Hyrule. Players can seamlessly explore these environments, solving puzzles, battling enemies, and uncovering hidden **** of the most notable additions is the crafting system, which allows players to combine materials to create custom weapons and tools, adding creativity and strategy to combat and exploration. The game's puzzle-solving mechanics, especially in the new shrines and dungeons, are more intricate and rewarding, encouraging players to think outside the box.Story-wise, Tears of the Kingdom builds on the lore of Zelda, focusing on themes of legacy, restoration, and mystery. Link's journey to stop the evil threatening Hyrule once again is filled with emotional depth, engaging cutscenes, and memorable characters.Visually, the game maintains the beautiful, stylized art of Breath of the Wild, but with even more vibrant environments and weather effects. The soundtrack is atmospheric, enhancing the sense of wonder as players explore new and familiar territories.Despite its vastness, Tears of the Kingdom runs smoothly on the Nintendo Switch, with minimal performance issues. Some may find the reliance on the stamina system and weapon durability frustrating, but these mechanics add layers of strategy.Overall, Tears of the Kingdom expands upon everything that made its predecessor great, offering a rich, immersive world with endless possibilities for adventure, puzzle-solving, and combat. It's a must-play for Zelda fans and newcomers alike, delivering one of the best open-world experiences in gaming.. there is nothing left to say. just one of the best games in history. only down side is from the performance of the console. switch is the only limited for this game. Breath of the Wild is one of the greatest video games ever made. The blend of exploration, beautiful gameplay, and just the overall atmosphere makes this game a must play.. there is not much to it other than that it is a masterpiece!must play!amazing that you are more or less just dropped into a big world and then the freedom of choice is completely yours where you go and how you want to face all the problems. there is no form of forced line at all. One of the best games I've ever played. The freedom to go anywhere and do pretty much anything you think, in a giant world filled with so many quests to do, areas to explore and characters to meet. It is truly a masterpiece ****.. Yes, Botw has issues. The combat system is broken especially when it comes to the armor upgrades. The shrines can feel monotonous and frustrating. The story while right and fits the game leaves a bit to be desired especially for a Zelda game. -See Joseph Anderson's Youtube video. Open World - But it is a beautiful and unbelievably polished experience, especially for running on a 7-year-old handheld. This wasn't the first or last open-world game, but it still is arguably the best. This game took what games like GTA did and polished it to an enormous magnitude degree. Even now 7 almost 8 years later I'm still finding out new things in this game. As soon as I started playing I fell in love with it. Everywhere I looked I wanted to see. I would get put on a main story mission and hours later finally arrive at it, because I got distracted by something in the world. Story - And say what you will about the story, but I really enjoyed it. I loved the implementation of the 4 champions and the fact that they had real personalities, unlike the sages in Totk. Her voice acting may not be perfect, but Zelda's character is a well-written take on the princess of Hyrule and often has very well-done and emotional plot points and scenes. Final Defense - There's not much I can say about Botw that hasn't been said a hundred thousand times over. But what I can say is this: stop trying to find only bad things to say about this game. Instead of dwelling on its problems, we should celebrate its accomplishments. Yes, this game is beginning to show its age even after only 7 years. (Its combat is absolutely destroyed by Eldin Ring, Its story isn't as developed and compelling as Balder's Gate 3, and its puzzles aren't as great as previous Zelda titles.) But it isn't put at the top of list after lists greatest of all times games for no reason. This game was something special, is something special, and will continue to be something special.. One of the best discoveries feeling open world games that is maybe inspired by skyrim,everywhere you randomly walk the world/story just reveal itself gradually,they did a good job of almost completely not giving any clues/hint of what to expect when exploring/move forward the story,",grades on MC suggest you should get ready for absolutely top of what gaming has to offer . unfortunately this game is more of a relict of the past that Nintendo cannot and is not able to leave behind . i think that this is one of the Greatest video games ever made .
60.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D,"the best game of all time this game is absolutely beautiful and perfect in so much modes. Its just Ocarina of Time but on the go. I don't like handhelds and would prefer to play it on original hardware which is my only problem with it.. Perfect remake of OOT for the time, graphics look exactly how you imagine the original being.. Being built from the ground up to run amazingly on the 3DS, this sets the bar for remakes by succeeding in not meddling with the majority of the original but improving in every aspect to make the game more user friendly and smoother to play through. The inventory and menu system is far easier use but the greatest improvement is in the dreaded water temple with the remake colour coding the levels making it not require 7 years navigational training to complete. Overall this is in my opinion the definitive way to experience the ocarina of time experience with completing the game being a must complete experience for every gamer out there.. This was a great remake; however, the new designs lacked some of the character and depth of the original. I have since played the original using an emulator and maxed out all the specs, and I actually prefer the original polygon design maxed out than the design in this one simply because it has more soul. Sometimes, it is not about making things more colorful but giving them depth. The design here works, but I wouldn't call it superior to the original. I would say play this one as an intro if you are turned off by the graphics of the original, but if you want the real experience, play an emulation of the original and max out the specs.. A remake that you MUST have as a 3DS user. Not only does it have much more beautiful and detailed graphics than the Nintendo 64, but it also brings back the fun of the Zelda classic. The story is great, the game has lots of eastereggs and in general you can only say that it deserves the many good reviews.. An excellent remake of a classic, this game fixes most of the originals item mapping issues, although the early 3D led to some decisions that I felt compromised some of the original art direction (with the final boss being a notable downgrade in presentation). An improved version of a masterpiece that needs no introduction. A timeless classic.. Please delete this review. I accidentally rated it and I can't delete it because there is no such option on the site.. Simply an improved version of an incredible game, the models, textures are better and the 30fps are much better than the 20fps from the original!. I grew up with this game and I loved it to bits. Its such a good game, that I didn't even realize that it was a remaster **** made over a decade ago. The original game is undoubtedly a classic, but because of its extremely dated graphics and abysmal FPS, it can be hard for a new player to get immersed. That is absolutely not a challenge the 3DS version faces. While sure, the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the original is gone, I actually perfer it that way. It strikes a balance between realistic and cartoony that hasn't been seen before (or honestly since). Aside from that, this is basically the same game, only with a few new quality of life features and extra gamemodes. But the original was so perfect that I don't even mind the lack of changes. Overall, I do believe this to be the definitive addition of such an iconic title. If you have a 3DS and can find this game off an online store, get it. It made my childhood, and I hope it makes your day too.. It's a good remake, it's not as difficult as the original maid but just as cool and addictive, the graphics are nice and I honestly think it's an excellent game even if it doesn't shock as much as the original did.. Way more accessible to people, pretty much identical to the original unlike Majora's Mask 3D. Continues a legacy. Despite the atmospheric changes, the level of love and detail put into Ocarina of Time's remake makes this, in my opinion, the definitive version of the game. It keeps in touch with the original vision of the N64 version while also streamlining what users actually took issue with, like the water temple.. Way better than the original version, Water Temple is now good! Better Graphics, Remastered OST, the definitive version of this classic! Overall this game is so frickin good! The best game ever. (in my opinion). Worthy of a masterpiece status. Truly ahead of it's time - this time with QoL changes, better framerate and reworked game mechanics for a much smoother experience.. this game has an amazing story about maturing, and is all around so.... Legendary A Legendary Game Remastered For The Modern Day. playing this game, I feel like Link. i found this game in a very dark time in my life and it helped me through so much. thank you Nintendo. This is an easy ass 10/10, was my favorite game for a very long time. The world it builds and the wonder it instilled in my mind is something achieved by very few pieces of art. Phenomenal.. Good game. Nothing else to add here, this game is a must play for anyone out there.. As someone who has played both versions I think both Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of time 3D are both amazing. However, Ocarina of Time 3D gets rid of the horrid N64 controls and uses button controls for better and easier control in general. The improved graphics are definitely noticeable, but I found the original graphics charming in their own way. Also the original Ocarina of time has the better Ganon boss fight. Having to use the lightning to see where Ganon is gave the fight a lot more tension. While there were some things lacking in this game mainly the epic atmosphere of the Ganon fight from the original Ocarina of time. Despite that I have nothing really bad to say about this game. It's fun and can be enjoyed multiple times.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The crisp new visuals, slicker equipment system, and other improvements give it a boost over the original. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is the fact that it's a rerelease. But besides that, it's AMAZING. Every 3DS owner should play this at least once.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite game of all time. It's just perfect. The music, gameplay, story,.. it's all amazing. Master quest was fun but a pain in the ass though, after I completed it I was tired of playing video game for a while. A transformative experience that shaped my childhood. Always a treat to explore, as long as I have a guide for some parts. The story is monumental, and it shaped the way Zelda stories were told for years to come.. This is an excellent release, it takes basically all the problems with the original and improves them, but the N64 version’s low polygonal models have their charm.. Undoubtedly, the definitive version of the game. A couple of downsides, mainly the screen size, but the motion controls, improved graphics, and portability, enhance what is already one of the best video games, ever made. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best remakes ever made. It gives a new look and feel to the original classic that works pretty well with the Nintendo **** only complain would be the gyro controls when aiming, but they are just a small part of the game and it is not representative of the final quality. Better graphics, some changes, but still a masterpiece. I'm fanboy. Updated visuals make this world too colorful and bright. The final encounter is ruined by this remake. Although its nice to have it accessible to more players the original is the better version.. W game. Modern graphics with retro challenge. (Very brainhurt with the puzzles). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games of all time. When I was young, there's nothing I looked more forward to than coming home and playing this game.. I grew up with this game (call me young, I don't care), and it is absolutely phenomenal and made my childhood. Since I never owned a N64 and the version on the 3DS was what I know and absolutely love, I can't comment on the original, nor say if this is better or not. This game has good graphical improvements and because it's on a handheld, it makes it so much easier to play and enjoy. The final boss, no, all the bosses were incredibly memorable (except the ones in the water temple, jabu jabu and shadow temple) and their dungeons (all except water) were all worth my time going through them over and over. I love this game and you should too.. .................................................................. That's game is perfect rate 10000/10 !!!. A truly innovative product of its time, Ocarina Of Time has combat variety and puzzle systems that would rival even games today. The incredible use of the Ocarina itself for gameplay is remarkable, sometimes to solve puzzles and even others to unlock secrets hidden away. I love The Legend Of Zelda because it feels like everything you do matters and you as the player, as Link, are even reminded of that while you play and it invokes a special emotion when all your hard work has paid off and you can enjoy the final cutscenes knowing you once again saves Hyrule. The Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time is a classic game that will always stand the test of time, a true 10/10 and something I'll always come back to.. First time i actually beat the game after playing my dads n64 version when i was a baby, my mom got this for me as a child and i never played anything like it before and cried so much after finishing it. To this day this and majoras are my favorite and in my opinion best games of all time, i think the soundtrack is unmatchable and the songs that make me the most emotional in games. This, Majora and Wind waker Actually made me get a Triforce tattooed on my hand.. One of the worst remasters I have ever played in my life. The movement feels awful. Link moves awful and not 360 like he usually does (windwaker, twilight princess, skyward sword, etc.) . The worst part is the fact that you can't move the camera but i guess that is the 3ds's fault. When the camera can't move it is hard to platform. And even if you can just L target to move your camera, it doesn't help that link has bad and oppressed directional movement to the point where you keep trying to L target to the right direction, but it wouldn't work. 0/10 game with embarrasingly dated parts to it like the bugs, sound effects, and bad but improved graphics which really isn't much considering Oot came out back in the 90's. If you ever want to have an awesome experience with this game, play the original. It is really unfortanate how they butchered such a legendary game.. I played on this version because it's more polished. I arrived late to Zelda, already in my 40s, but really, although the camera movement is terrible, it is an incredible game. Within my top 5 best games.. Best game ever made period. The hud and ui is so significantly better than the N64 version and the graphics are way nicer. Also the small changes like the boots being items rather than gear.. After finishing this game I have to admit that the story is really great and zelda OOT will be remembered by me mostly because of that story, amazing music, very magical locations and unique characters. Even by today's standards the overall atmosphere of the game is outstanding all of this is making zelda OOT really timeless and nostalgic. But unfortunately under all of those great things there is a huge amount of irritating and frustrating aspects. The Controls are absolutely terrible. I seriously thought that this game will make a good use of a new 3DS C-stick but unfortunately I was wrong. Lack of second thumbstick is just very wrong in 3D game these days. It's really frustrating when you're trying to Center the camera for jump or hit but then the camera decides to Center it for you because why not. Ufortunately a major portion of the game is so unintuitive... a lot of times seriously I had big problems to figure it out what I'm supposed to do at the moment. In lot of situations I ended up wondering in location for about an hour or two just to see the guide on the internet, that shows me that there is some kind of a hidden wall that I'm supposed to blow up with a bomb... Without the guide it's seriously very, very frustrating, unintuitive and just simply bad deigned game. Another strange thing is when you die or load a save you are teleported to a beginning of dungeon or location and that just forces you to reply whole location once more. Despite very good impressions after last boss fight I just simply can't ignore lot of wasting hours trying to find a way. And I can't forget the strong feelings of irritation and frustration. It's really not fun to play a game with guide all the time simply because you can't understand the dungeon design of creators. I highly recommend to watch some walk through or story explaining videos on YT but if you want to beat this game ""on your own"", a hugely recommend YT channel ""ZeldaMaster"" he will provide you with excellent tips and dungeon strategies.. The quintessential Zelda game and the best Zelda remake (tied with MM) in my opinion. Although I do think it's overrated, it's certainly still good. Most of the temples are fun and interesting and the side quests are okay, but the game is a little bare because it's an older, less in-depth game compared to what the standard is nowadays It's charming but feels like it's missing something.. Zelda: Ocarina of Time has always been my favorite game and I simply cannot say anything negative about this game. I have always loved this game since the original came out in 1998 and I still play it today. I've played it so many times that I can complete it blindfolded. If you want to try a masterpiece from the “old days” then try this.. the second of all parts of the legend of Zelda. An interesting plot, a lot of content, the whole world is built whole and you quickly enter it, there are no boring dungeons, except underwater, both in the past and in the future. The music is incredibly catchy. everyone to play.. Ocarina of Time isn't randomly considered the best video game of all time. As a first 3D Zelda game, it's the basis from the masterpiece entries which follow. You must play this game, and this remake is a great way to experience this adventure, and in 3D as well.. This is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It has all of the pros of the Nintendo 64 version of the game and then gives everything a fresh new coat of paint where it was needed. New visuals, controls are altered and easier to use, the bottom screen of the 3DS is utilized perfectly for the game, making it leagues easier to use. The soundtrack for the game is also phenomenal. Easily one of the best gaming experiences you can have ever.. Since 1998 Ocarina of Time remains the greatest masterpiece and the best game in history I've ever seen and now with better graphics it's impeccable I have no words to describe this game I highly recommend playing it. Linkmhas to be more like green arrow and hawkeye especially hawkeye link needs to get better at using the bow. This game is absolutely perfect in practically every way. The gameplay is perfect and some of the best to come out of the entire Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. The characters are endearing and some of the best I've seen in any video game ever. The soundtrack is iconic for great reason, as it has fantastic music throughout (the title theme in particular still gives me chills, to be honest). It just does everything right for me, which is why it is a perfect game to me and my favorite Nintendo 3DS game as a whole.. The legend of Zelda Ocarina of time is the best game ever made. It’s flaws were fixed In the 3ds remake which brings it even closer to perfection. It is undoubtedly the best $20 you can ever spend. This metroidvania, exploration driven, acoustic orgasm of an experience is to the video game industry, what Dune is to the sci-fi genre. Long story short, if you have a soul it will be lifted by playing this game.. One of the best i ever played. Remember the summers after school break i used to play under the bedsheets. This game is simply fun, addictive and gorgeous, even for 2021. Having this on the road is a pretty good reason to own this version, as well as its low price. This is easily one of Nintendo's greatest games ever made. And it's incredible on the 3DS. The story is what got me on this title. It's a story about Link who messes up but grows up and decides to fix what he broke. The adventure to this game is incredible and the dungeons are great. A must-have for 3DS owners.. The greatest game of all time gets the greatest remaster of all time. What more could you ask for? Many things about the original game have been fixed, such as having to open the menu 40 times in the infamous water temple. The visuals are absolutely stunning and all character models have been rebuilt from the ground up. Aiming is better and combat is also smoother. Although Ocarina of time may be obsolete to Breath of the Wild, this game is still well worth playing today.. The best game in human history. 1st place in the world's best game.. 1st place in the history of eternal immortality Metascore. The game that made you realize that the only natural enemy that can surpass The Legend of Zelda is The Legend of Zelda. The only game in the history of mankind that surpasses 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A magical ride of calm mystical worlds and species, tricky dungeons and a strong villain. Ocarina of time is a true masterpiece. This remaster kept everything that made ocarina great but adder things that made this the definitive version. This version has better graphics (makes sense since the original was made in the 90s). The gyro controls make it easier to aim. The only things I don’t like is they made the game a little too bright in some areas that were dark and gloomy in the original. This game is great and I recommend this to anybody.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Why is this rated lower than the original! It fixes every problem from the original game like the shooting, and makes it an incredible game!. This is one of the best games I’ve ever played. The graphics are vastly improved and it controls nicely. A true gem in the 3DS library, this game is basically the N64 game with better graphics and a better interface. Had trouble with the 64 version? This one's a heck of a lot better with it's map on the bottom and having a touchscreen in general.. Good game. The music is good, it has some nice quests, the atmosphere is good, there's a few really good dungeons, some good symbolism, good mini-games, the world is well-crafted and mysterious, and the exploration is great. However, there's also loads of flaws with the game. There's really only two good bosses: Twinrova and Dark Link. Dark Link isn't even a main-boss, since it's a sub-boss. The characters are extremely bland, basic, underdeveloped, and not interesting at all. Not a single one of the characters are good. I don't get why they get so much praise. Well, actually, I do. People mostly look at nastolgia, when praising this game. Actually, 50% of the time would be more accurate, but you get the point. OoT gets far too many passes by the TLoZ fanbase, despite the flaws being so easy to see and the game is filled with them. Of course people can have their own opinions on the characters and the game in general, but when I look at this game as objectively as possible, I realise a very large amount of the praise OoT gets is utter nonsense. Still only in my opinion, of course, but you likely know what I mean. The dungeons are largely bland. Shadow Temple and Water Temple are masterpieces, Dodongo's Cavern is also good, and Spirit Temple and Bottom of the Well are great. Other than that, however, the dungeons are quite underwhelming. Ice Cavern and Jabu Jabu's Belly are piles of rubbish stacked upon each other. Fire Temple, Inside the Deku Tree, Forest Temple, and Ganondorf's Castle are underwhelming and mediocre. Some quests are really great and fun, whilst others like the Biggoron's Sword fetch quest are tedious and overly glorified. The story is painfuilly mediocre. Little to not depth, short, incredibly overrated, and pails in comparison to other Zelda stories. Keep in mind this is still a good game. When it comes to how good the game is it's good, but an absolute joke compared to what gaming would become after it. I'd say The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Majora's Mask do everything better than OoT. And when I say everything, I mean everything. The narratives, main quests, gameplay, worlds, characters, exploration, mini-games, side activities like quests and hearth pieces, etc. all crush OoT's. The games also have loads more detail, symbolism, sub-text, and depth in general than OoT could ever dream to have. OoT is still a masterpiece in the sense that it was a major milestone, but as a game it's a joke - both when compared to the Zelda games that came before it, the Zelda games after it, and what gaming would grow to be after OoT. Still great when comparing it at its time of release, though. The remake is also quality, without taking much from the original experience, and adds a lot of nice quality of life features. To end this off, let's not forget OoT is not as much of a milestone as it is believed to be. The vast majority of its features had been done before. Things like linear stories, its entire format, etc. were all done before OoT, both inside Zelda and outside it. Seriously, name just ten things that were unique to OoT back then, since there is very few. It borrows most of its content and structure from A Link to the Past, but whilst worsening them and glorifying them, yet the game still gets credit for so many things that ALttP and Zelda I did. The only major unique thing about it is that it was one of the first games of its kind - a successful 3D game. Still historically important for gaming, a big achievement, and pretty fun game, but it's simply not even close to as great as places like Metacritic and r/zelda would have you believe.. Quite possibly the best version of Ocarina of Time. The game is the same, but the graphics, some sounds and of course the 3D and gyro sensor features add some welcomed improvements. As for the 3D in particular - it is excellent, it adds depth to everything and does not feel 'tacked-on'. I would definitely recommend this game if you have, or are considering a Nintendo 3DS.. A wonderful remaster of the original game but with improved grafics and gameplay! This was my first Legend of Zelda game and I absolutely adored it. You can sink for hours into this world even if it's nothing compared to massive games like Breath of the Wild, Assassin's Creed or the Witcher but it sure is nostalgic and layed a milestone for the gaming industry we know today. the devs did a great job porting the best game of all times to the best handheld console ever made. i replayed some classic games and many zelda titles during lockdown and this was by far the best experience!. it's a perfect **** have a huge world.unforgettable dungeons.adorable **** have the nicest side missions. and it introduce a new ganon ""ganondorf"".ganondorf transform to ganon. i love all the **** fix all the problems in the original OoT like changing from boot to iron boot or hover **** graphics and the animations improved and hell yeah you can play it on the go!it's the best game of all time and the best game for me and the best zelda game.. Revolutionary game. Ocarina of Time paved the way for virtually all adventure, puzzle, exploration, dungeon crawling, story telling, target real time combat games that followed. To this day, many games still borrow these gameplay aspects from Ocarina of time. The progression is amazing. Whenever the game introduces an item, the game also makes the player use common sense to see where to apply that item to solve a puzzle to progress. There's a great sense of satisfaction when I did figure it out. Passing by unsolvable puzzles, I knew I'd probably pass by an item later to help me. However, there were some puzzles where the solution was a little vague, forcing me to refer to a guide. However, these were far and few in between. Most puzzles were reasonable. The puzzles within the dungeons were very deep, and fun to play through. Anticipating what new item I'd come across was exciting, and seeing how it could be applied to solve puzzles. The story is amazing. Time traveling between young link and adult link was cool, and probably a mind blowing concept to see in a game back in the 90s. The way some puzzles were incorporated with the time travel was also really neat. The areas were varied. Forest-y areas, watery areas, volcano, snowy caverns. It gave the world so much live on top of the abundance of different characters Link met. Some bad things **** ice cavern was stupid, because my wallet was full, so why would I think about getting the silver rupees when they are worth 100 each. I would go back when my wallet is empty to get the rupees then. But little did I know that the rupees also served as switches to open the gate. The game should have used switches instead of rupees to not be misleading. In Ganon's castle, I needed golden gauntlets to move big pillar in puzzle, but they didn't let me know I had to get it in another room in the castle. In kakaro village, I had to go through invisible opening in the well with no hint aside from ""whispers in the area"". This was to get the lens of truth which was used to SEE invisible walls. Being required to solve a puzzle using the item which was concealed inside is like trying to open a safe that has the key locked inside.. This game is maybe one of the best in the videogame history. The history is super good and the gameplay does feel great. With this remake, the Seikah stones have appeared giving clues if you get stuck in some moment. I highly recommend it.. What can I say? Its Ocarina of Time after all! This game is beautyfully remastered in the 3DS, its quite surprising how well they made the transition to a portable system. The gameplay and story AND experience remains the same, with some details added here and there.. Its basically one of the best games of all time, with better graphics. If you have a 3DS, you should try it.. I love this game. This is such an complete masterpiece, that goes even beyond than the N64 version. If you own a 3ds and yet don't have this game, get it now. My favorite game ever.. A good story, great graphics, a sublime soundtrack. Overall, a game that aged very well as remastered as it should be. I enjoyed it a lot.. A magical game. I never get past Deku Tree as a kid(What a stupid kid I was). Years later I started to get interested in TLoZ games. Had to play this game on my 3DS as a way of growing up for me. And wow, I loved this game from beginning until the end. The soundtrack is a masterpiece. Gameplay is fun as always, I love the dungeons and bosses. I love the story in this game, it's one of my favorite TLoZ stories. I can only say that this game is a masterpiece and will always remain in my heart.. One of the greatest games of all time remade with a slew of new features, less bugs, and new visuals. I would definitely recommend playing this version of LoZ: Ocarina of Time over the original, as you also have bonus content with the master quest. If you own a 3DS and have never played OoT you have to pick this game up and play through it.. Edit 9/29/2020 - Updated my score from 9 to 10. Just finished the Fire Temple and just entered the Water Temple and this is the best 3DS game I've played so far, with many to go on my backlist. Despite some camera issues, everything in this game is PERFECT, especially on the XL. Music, dungeon design, gameplay, **** excellent. Story is pretty much non existent, but it is Zelda after all, and Nintendo was never much about story in their games. And the addition of the touch screen makes equipping items that much easier. It's seamless. Having finally started my 3DS journey in 2020 (better late than never for this amazing portable console), Ocarina is my second game after Mario Kart 7, which came with my 2DS XL. And I was not disappointed. I just finished the Temple of Light and met Ganandorf, and just about to start my first Temple of Sages, but after about 5 hours I have been absolutely hooked. The visuals, sound and gameplay are all great. Targeting and controls are a little annoying from time to time, but nothing even remotely game breaking. A Link to the Past is still my all time favorite Zelda game, but I also have A Link Between Worlds to try. But so far with Ocarina, I am pleasantly surprised since I haven't played a handheld console since the Gameboy Advance, which lasted like a week for me, lol. Too busy with PC and main console I guess. Ocarina 3D is a gorgeous game on a 9-10 year old handheld and I'm glad I FINALLY started playing these Nintendo games again, after being a Playstation and Xbox fanboy for so long. I am just loving Ocarina, and the only reason I do not give it a 10 is because I feel like it's just so ancient and Hyrule Field is so barren, but I'm sure if I would have bought this on N64 back in the day I would have drooled. Even the almighty Ocarina soundtrack isn't as good as A Link to the Past's, imo. But for this old 3D adventure it is just beautiful. I'm grateful I experienced Mario 64 on the N64, but I wish I would have had the opportunity to play Ocarina. Regardless of all that, my first experience with OoT has been awesome so far on the 3DS and I can't wait to finish it and check out Majora's Mask.. Nintendo managed to improve upon Ocarina of Time while still remaining faithful to the original. Better looking visuals, better framerate, and other quality of life improvements make OoT 3D the definitive version of the game.. Must have remake of this beloved N64 classic. one of the best games of all time. you have to play it knowing its the first 3d Zelda. many aspect of gameplay are updated and game as today game standards seems simple and easy. but its charm is timeless. one of the best 3ds games and an essential for the collection. I grew up with a PlayStation growing up, so I never got to experience the original Ocarina of Time for the N64. I received this game for my birthday and played it until I beat it, with the help of walkthroughs of course. Must buy game for the 3DS.. Ocarina of Time is already a masterpiece in its own right, obviously. One of my top 5 games, probably, and easily my favorite Zelda. Kudos to the developers for taking on such a challenge of taking what many consider to be their favorite game of all time, rebuilding from the ground up, and releasing it back with such high praise. Experiencing this game all over again in 3D with updated graphics was a joy. Honestly, I now feel that when I imagine the game in my head, I am recalling imagery from this 3D remake and not the OG N64 version. I also appreciate the quality of life improvements to the Sheikah stones and the Water temple: revisions to improve your gaming experience while not overstepping by any means. The touch screen menu makes such a remarkable improvement to gameplay, as well, I would not have imagined. Thank you for updating this classic with such care and passion!. Probably the greatest handheld port of all time, Ocarina of Time 3D take one of the greatest games ever, and makes look and play better than ever. With better graphics and controls. It's certainly for anyone who never experienced it on the N64.. This is one of my favourite Zelda games, specially beacuse it is the first one that i played. i really liked the story and all of the characters and bosses in the game. I really recommend playing this game.. It's not said to b","the best game of all time this game is absolutely beautiful and perfect in so many modes . being built from the ground up to run amazingly on the 3DS, this sets the bar for remakes . the greatest improvement is in the dreaded water temple with the remake colour coding the levels ."
600.Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft,"Destroyed the game with every New Patch. Unbalanced as S#it. Make no fun anymore. Uninstall this crap after 15 years of playing. Thank for Absolut Nothing Blizzard.. Worthless and pointless! Just doing the same thing over and over again!​​​​​. ok gameplay, pretty graphics but gets a 4/10 because of disappointing lack of skill needed, stupid and repetitive. Enjoy it for a short while then move on unless you want to become stupid.. Just disappointing gameplay. Ontop of that, it's just an absolutely evil company. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Battleground mode is rigged. If you win 2 to 3 in a row all of a sudden it will determine what cards you have played and not give you any of that class. The new meta depends heavily on getting the same class so its pointless. Also now there is a feature for a tinker shop players will get an option to get 2 free cards of their class they are playing while others will get a option to get 1 extra gold per a turn. You notice players with the 2 free card a turn will win so if that is not an option when you get to the tinker 1st shop just quit the game. The battle pass will grant you a higher chance of winning due to you get better abilities for having it making the game p2w. Sad to see how down hill money grubbing it has become.. Hearthstone is a proven rigged game that has been rigged by ""Blizzard Entertainment"". 0/10.. Avoid this game. If you see a streamer playing battlegrounds and mostly getting favorable draws then know that it is just for streamers. For a regular player it is not possible. It has nothing to do with skill. There is nothing random at this game. If you pay more you get more that is it.. Been playing the game from 2014 to now, been legend for 5 years straight, played 1.5 years competitively and enjoyed all the steps, but the game as never been in a worse state, everything new feels more and more like tired efforts from the dev to make the game feel fresh but nothing works. Used to be a great game but died eventually.. This game is a RNG horror show. It's worst than gambling at the casino. Don't waste your time.. If there was no that big paywall in this game, I'd say the one is just perfect as a CCG game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely a game to love and absolutely EFFEN HATE!!!! Sometimes it's so BUGGY that it makes you wonder wha tin the world their game devs are actually doing and other time so MANY BOTS that it makes wonder what in the world they are thinking allowing this. I literally go through cycles of DELETING this trash game only to come back hoping something has changed for the sake of good OLD TIMES. I can say that at times I WHOLEHEARTEDLY HATE THIS GAME.. What the hell have they done to this game? I used to play Hearthstone several years ago occasionally and quit because I got bored of it and annoyed by the constant push for new cards and packs and so on. Now I booted the game up again today for a couple of matches. All my old decks were useless because most of the cards are either gone or disabled for standard matches. So I went through the horrendous menus while constantly having the screen orgasm at me about achievement this and new unlock that (I had no idea what most of it even is). After going through all this nonsense I then wanted to get a feel for the game again to see cards and playstyle and so on. I had no idea what cards to use for a deck so I went with one of the 6 premade ""loan"" decks where supposedly you can keep of them at the end of a certain time period. I tried several of them and play about 10 matches. I lost every single one of them on the lowest rank and it wasn't me making mistakes. I simply had no chance with the deck because whatever these other players had always literally obliterated me. And a lot of times I didn't even understand what moves my opponents made. I saw mages use his 1 damage class ability mini fireball that killed a minion that had 2 hp. I have no idea how that worked. The log didn't show anything special. It just died. There's also way to many weird effects jump all over the screen and are difficult to keep track off while you're under constant time pressure to make your moves. I have no idea what kind of players enjoy Hearthstone at this point but I can't imagine it's anyone doing it for casual fun. The UI is messy and the gameplay is terrible. Not much else to say.. I'd rather eat my fathers **** than to play this game ever again. I also want to add that the players are braindead. They can't even make their own decks in a deck-building game. Just copy-paste games happening every other second. FY. Current meta is just based on no interactions, braindead cards and the only two viable classes are warrior and plague DK... really sad when comparing the old HS with what we have today.. This game used to be good, USED. Since Covid they have made all efforts and put all energy to fail it. Each and every meta is worse than the previous and each and every patch breaks the game even more. The developers wanted to make a game full random, with mana cheat and crap turns or uninteractive elements. Seriously, if you cant take it anymore, there is less shame in leaving and letting capable people work on the game, than staying and disrespecting your game and your players. Just leave. Tired of bs, random crapola, overpriced cards and no fun. At the moment literally no mode is playable, you actually get minus fun in it. Developers, leave, just leave honestly, you had your time. Youa re incapable anymore, you are done, its fine. Accept it and move on. I hope Microsoft makes things better with the takeover and I am happy people are getting sacked from Bliz. they deserve it as they brough this upon themselves. Literally every game has had the HS treatment. Enough is enough! Way to celebrate 10 years, show how much the developers respect their jobs and their audience. GO away get lost! Enough! ENOUGH!. The impact of Hearthstone is strange. While on release it was a one of kind unrivaled masterpiece, that was ten years ago. It no longer has the beauty instead replacing it with an addictive gameplay loop (/neg).. Once this was a really good game, but since Ben Brode left, this game is really bad... Mage can deal 30+ damage in one turn... One titan has a special ability to deal 20 damage.... Ben please come back and make this game right again... Now 20 health is considered ""You can die at any moment in the game."" The good old times when combo priest would dominate and a 4/4 minnion... First you doubled its health, then you made it 8/8 or 16/16... And your opponent destroyed it. Now this game became a ""New Generation eye candy run and gun"" pathetic. Would give zero but the zero rating is occupied.. A tired, stupid game. Timers are **** in battlegrounds. Same lousy players playing the same lousy tired card plays. By far, the most **** game I've come across.. Battlegrounds ****, you wanna combine beasts? **** you, there's no any late beast cards, only 1/1 garbage even you up tavern to 6... Every time when my phone wants update this trash, it have to spend over 15 mins before update start. Whatta ****? You have no 1 good connectionon your pentium 1 server? Why it starts with delay, i press button - update,it means i accept size of ""new ****"", but app asks me - you really want it? Seriously? Game didn't allow to win, all you can do - buy cards, but minions pool always castrated, you have troubles every time you want to play 0 out of 15. A perfect card game. While i fell off the bus long time ago, I regret none of the time I invested in this game. Amazing voice-acting, cleverly crafted cards, and while some of the decks were absolutely crazy (ekhm, Pirate Warrior) the game balanced greatly most of the time between the absolute power-fantasy and RNG based gameplay.. What once started as a funny casual game has become a nightmare of a toxic community combined with terrible balance. Back in the day - where it still was ""the old Blizzard"" it seemed that Devs cared about the game and carefully made adjustments and adding cards with sense. Nowadays it is all about milking the customer, every 3 months new expensions with random effects, each worse than the last. The player is forced to spend a huge amount of money alongside overpriced other cosmetic stuff like a poorly animated portrait for 40€. It is completly absurd what Blizzard has become. Surely nobody is wondering why Blizzard is not considered to be a AAA-Studio anymore.. Most of time is unbalanced, unfair, frustrating, RNG game. RNG is 90% of the game, but it has its good times though. An unbalanced, unfair, frustrating, RNG-heavy mess ****. Obviously, RNG plays a big part in any card game. But let me tell you something, you've never seen RNG like this in a game before -- it's absolutely absurd. Hearthstone never was a good game -- if it wasn't riding the coattails of the Warcraft name, it would have died years ago.. HearthStone, much like Blizzard's other games, looks great. The battle effects especially stand out. The story book feel gives its own pleasant aesthetic. The sounds are appropriate and the voice acting, especially the smack talk during a match, is very entertaining. If a player seeks a quick card game with a lot of action, this is the game to choose.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have played Hearthstone since 2015. I have spent over 3000 hours in the game. I rate the game what it is now, not what it used to be. Pros: - relatively frequent updates of content - a little bit of Warcraft's atmosphere - brilliant tavern music - many beautiful arts Cons: - gameplay is often unbalanced - many new cards added but lack of new mechanics so the freshness of gameplay is unsatisfying - relatively high entry threshold (in Standard) - the meta is often a “rock, paper, scissors” - lack of basic function as in game deck tracker, graveyard, detailed statistics/progress, one-click unhooking (open all packs button etc.) - lots of bugs and problems with fixing them - very very bad (for the players) monetisation of the game. - blatant pay to win in Hearthstone battlegrounds (dramatically increased chance **** hero by purchasing a battle pass) - senseless esport system, very unattainable high demanding and low rewarding for players. I started playing this game in 2015 and am still playing in 2023. Honestly, I can't give an objective review of this game. However, the quality of recent expansions has been spotty, so I'm not giving it a 10.. The update rate increases, the quality of the game decreases. The latest update generally rolled back the game to the Stone Age: lags, bugs and outages Apparently, all they need is to squeeze out more money until the game dies completely.. Hearthstone is a remarkably enjoyable and finely-crafted card game. Coming from someone who typically isn't drawn to card games, it managed to hook me in. Being intertwined with the Warcraft universe is definitely a major plus, but even if you look solely at its gameplay, it's undoubtedly a solid 10/10 in my books.. definetly pay to win, but also really poor game balance. They do everything to find crazy new game mechanics that are never intended to be balanced and rework entire card(-sets) after to make somehow bearable. Most of the time strong decks are quickly crippled so they are not even fun anymore. Also too much ""randomness"" for a game that claims to be competitive: Luck beats skill in 100 of 100 matches where this could be the deciding factor. Of course people get angry for it and they try to direct their anger to the only vent they have: the enemy player - reasonable, since winning enemies are not free of guilt. But Blizzard completly disabled chat for non-friends - which is by far the most crucial mistake for a multiplayer game. You would think that Blizzard is into the Online-gaming business long enough to know that ""Toxicity and flame always finds a way"" - if not by chat then by emotes, or abusing the items in game they have. The code is quickly understood and even then on top of that you can't even make friends, because a friend request always means ""flame"". Complete desaster. 1 point for it being ""technically"" free to play, which on a closer look actually reveals that it is not.. Game designed to scam children and their parents to buy 2 virtual card packs for 3€, when they find game on appstore. Two packs wont get you anywhere in this game, so they will quit the game soon or ask for more (70-200 to get you started). Bundle deals are much more value however that two packs for 3€ may seem good deal to try it out. But it's going to be worst 3€ you will ever spend.That doesn't get you anywhere and if million people buy it, it's 3M€ to world's hated and greedest people in gaming indurstry, Bobby Kotick. Battlegrounds used to be free to play, but now it is also pay to win cause you need to pay 20€ for season pass or you have much less chance for winning. Game also has so many similarities to Casino's slot--games and they are pretty much manipulating your children to be gambling addicts in future. Same thing was with Overwatch loot boxes. Have fun in Activision Blizzard's universe.. Terrible card game, have to spend alot of money to get the decks/cards so you can compete. It's also come to the point where it's all about playing the right meta cards. Alot of people are abusing this.. Honestly, if Hearthstone just keeps stall warrior at bay and continues to balance the game, so you can make whatever deck you want. Then it is like a 8.5 out of 10. Having a physical companion game would be nice, and instant open all packs would be nice as well. They do great promotions for the game, which I appreciate that.. Dead game as all blizzard games. Esports dead. terrible balancing. Only autochess with p2w mechanic. Burn it with fire.. Scam and money grab. First of all, the game is fun. But it is very much p2w, but it does not stop there... i spend about 100€ on card packs to get the meta. And after a while, the game meta change and on top of that some of my cards that i bought gets invalidated. Now my 100€ are wasted, i can of course choose to spend another 100€ each time the meta changes, but instead i decided to quit the game.. Good introduction to card games, can be good to unwind and just have fun with new expansions and packs. It was good before. Now it's a roll fest. There no game, it's a solidare who plays their combo first. No balance, death knight decks have 70% winrate and blizz does nothing about it. They heal increase their health for 20-40 cards and then heal for a billion. Who the hell has fun playing 40 minute matches to lose after that? Also, why the hell would you add classes that consist of two words? The classes had consistent and different names. and then you add a class name that consists of terms that are already in game? Whoever took over the game has no sense of why this game was good. I want to get killed by a 20-card combo I can just play yugioh.. The biggest ever joke of a ""free to play"" game. Free to play but most obviously and ridiculously ""PAY TO WIN"". Another product of the continuing legacy of Blizzard's broken games. If you value your time and don't want to be humiliated by stupid mechanics, totally unfair RNG, and trash bugs, consider ignoring this game. You will thank me afterward!. Great casual game. hard to build a competitive deck, but you still can have fun with starter decks. This is a pretty bad card game compared to Magic the Gathering from what I've gathered (haha.) Overall a pretty bad card game in every way.. Easily the worst game I've ever played. The tutorials - you realize how bad this game is when you vs Illidan, and you notice his character can attack and summon 2 cards per turn while you can't. Then I pvp someone and I start with 30 hp and they have 35 hp, like, why is that a thing? When you go to the main menu for the first time, you're bombarded with 20 different pop ups like its a mobile game. After 10 minutes I happily uninstalled and will go back to TFT.. It is ""interactive,"" not always ""fun."". I went exclusive HS battleground player for hearthstone since switching to Gods Unchained for TCG gaming. It's a wholly rigged piece of **** designed like a poker machine to keep people playing. You might as well sit at your PC and flip a coin and when you start winning, don't flip it but place it on the table on the losing side.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. I've been playing since launch.. Love the Duels game mode and Wild. Sometimes I dabble in Standard but not much for it. I just wish balance changes would come out sooner or better.. since today, it is totally pay to win. I won't pay for any runestone. blizzard... shame on you !!!. can be played casually or hardcore, but what holds this game back is its totally pay to win. however, when your matched up against someone with even cards its a pretty fun turn based card game. The only reason this gets a 2/10 is because the artwork and sound are on point for a game like this. However, everything else is just flaming Pay-to-Win garbage. If you're not willing to open up your wallet, you aren't going win a single game or have fun. This game will remind you every time you play that you haven't given an appropriate tithe to corporate overlords. Also the game is horribly unbalanced. You HAVE to have certain cards for certain classes otherwise you're just going to waste your time and sanity. And how do you get those cards? Money, of course! Another disgusting practice is this battlepass system that replaced the old daily system. You can't do **** with it if you can't win games, thus you are back to square one of ""give us money, now."" Just save yourself the headache and pass on this. Flushing money down the toilet would be a more thrilling experience than this game.. It did not fail me to entertain. What else can we expect from this game? You did not marry it, did you?. this is **** totally **** game dont play it and waste your porr time if u play it u ****. The game has a great update, because of it I delete the game. thanks to the developers. The game has a great update, because of it I delete the game. thanks to the developers. The game has a great update, because of it I delete the game. thanks to the developers. The game has a great update, because of it I delete the game. thanks to the developers. + Its free. + it's fun. + Awesome user interface and OST - Lack of depth makes the game repetative relatively quickly. - Luck determines the outcome of a match more often than skill. - Only 1v1 game mode, 2vs2 would be a great addition to the game.. lame game, no skill, just pay to win. Only RNG. No fun. BS mechanics. 20 million board wipes for everyone. Negative 20 million IQ for everyone. Why Bother to play.. In my opinion, they used well the capabilities a pc offers to a card game. Mechanics like rng, fast pace, instant deck effects made it unique as one of the first serious card games for pc. As a negative, in order to gain profit they made it ""pay to accelerate"". Also after many releases it is normal to release bad or unpopular expansions.. This might be one of the worst games ever made. You would imagine for games to bring you joy and happiness. Heartstone is prime example what will just ruin your day. Competive mode is complete pay to win with no skill involved, just throw money at the game, look hsreplay for best ""meta"" deck and roll some heads. Only purpose Heartstone has is to milk cash for the greedy abomination called Activision Blizzard. Thats what the whole game design is baded on, not enjoyment for anyone.. I have spent probably more than a 1000 hours in this game and also introduced the addiction to my girlfriend. Its a simple game, and I could best compare it to like a bag of chips. You crave it, but after having it doesn't feel fulfilling at all. But a bag of chips from time to time is always nice. And gotta give credit to Blizzard for giving this much content for free. I have never spent a single cent on this game and I have never felt restricted by the fact that I don't buy packs for myself. Fun card game that's a bit shallow.. Ultra-greedy top-management + incompetent developers = Pay-to-win piece of crap. Becomes worse and worse from expansion to expansion. All you need to play well is 30% skill and 70% luck. The type of garbage where not the player plays game but game plays the player. Don't waste your time, there are a lot of games much better then this casino.. F*king lagging piece of crap, devs don't do any balance check ever before big patches, plus the f*king card just frozen in a middle of screen in the bg lobby and I lost a match - amazing f*king job ///////. Hearthstone once had great potential, but became a really really bad game. Not to mention how extremely expnseive and unrewarding it is and another big point: extremely buggy and badly maintained. DO NOT INVEST ANY TIME IN THIS GAME. A chic collectible card game, in a familiar universe, of the minuses, too much frivolous. Hearthstone's tagline: Deceptively simple, insanely fun is very descriptive of the kind of game that Blizzard set out to make and in many ways did succeed to make. At it's core, hearthstone mechanics is easy to grasp, but the skill ceiling of the game is pushed much higher by decks with intricate combos and game plans. In hearthstone, I have always leaned towards combo oriented decks and it has always been super satisfying to pull out complex combos and crush my opponent's face. However, having played for years, I have to give HS a negative review. Firstly, the monetisation of this game is extremely greedy compared to many other games. The card packs are priced at close to the cost of TCG's physical cards when the value of virtual cards are nowhere close to that of physical cards. The simplest example to highlight HS's greedy monetisation, the preorder bundle for the upcoming expansion costs 80USD and does not provide even half of the full content of the expansion. Another thing that has really bugged me playing this game over the years is how Blizzard have always been slow to react to community feedback about balance and QoL changes. The community had to beg for months just to have additional deck slots. Also, it is simply embarrassing that a gaming company as storied as Blizzard is still unable to provide simple features like replay functionality even 6 years after the game's launch. It is also indicative of Blizzard's greed that the battleground's statistic page is priced behind the 20USD battlegrounds perks. I could buy several indie games for the same price, and all I get from the 20USD perks, is a statistic page, ability to use emoticons and the ability to choose from 2 more characters which is strictly speaking, p2w.. Battlegrounds. Lose 10 games in a row ending up in top 6-8. Then finish one game in top 4. Repeat. This is your love fe now. Welcome to Hearthstone.. This game was fun and interactive when it came out, however, expansions totally killed its magic. Developers decided to add imbalanced cards and use them to force players into playing expansion-specific deck archetypes. Any element of fun just got lost, the game is no more decided by skillful play and careful consideration of opponents deck, but merely by draw luck, as cards and their specific combinations are so strong that one card drawn card can basically kill an opponent on its own. It doesn't pay off to create a unique deck and surprise opponents with non-standard cards, because the difference in cards' power-level dictates what cards can you play to be successful. In other words: I really enjoyed the game up to the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, but afterward, it became an unfocused mess. In my opinion, it's not worth getting into at this point. Battlegrounds is a fun mode, but super luck dependent, and the Arena suffers from the same issues as competitive: snowball effect can kill you without having a chance to react. Update: problems of luck and hyper-powerful cards are increasing every expansion. Your skill and experience don't matter in the slightest. Encountering 12/12 on the third turn against the druid, losing to single cards, and opponents generating basically an infinite amount of cards from nothing absolutely soured my experience with Hearthstone. Trash. Not worth the time investment.. Children card game,dont play this game this is it's terrible for a normal person. All Warcraft magic in a competitive card game that can totally hook you up for life!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Superfun and cozy game that relies too much on p2w and RNG. It's the only card game i've ever played and i've played it for years casually. Just how it's made is amazing - that playfulness and graphics, combined with how sharp it's gameplay is. With that said, it is a very expensive game to play and sadly it's not made with consumer in mind, but made to make money and thus most people cannot have fun and play different decks if they want to be competiive without paying several hundred dollars a year. But if you can afford it, it's a fun game. + *Design *Art *Cozy-factor *Free to play (Haha, yeah right... im just joking) - * Expensive as hell * P2W to a certain extent. You have a to have a good deck to be competive and most of the good decks require you to buy cardpacks for real money, but when you have a good deck and faced with other good deck your skill and meta knowledge will determine if you rise in the ranks. * Not made with consumer in mind * Too many expensions released per year (for them to make more money). * RNG heavy. Mostly just about luck and pay to win. Skill factor has been reduced for each year.. First of all Hearthstone used to be a great cards game. Now it's full of bugs !! I am a Hearthstone player since the begining. Now i feel like i dont want to play anymore because of the huge number of bugs while playing ranked and so. It's a shame the fked this game up so bad. The kind of bugs that i always encounter are total freeze of the match because for example i used a card from other class and this leads to loss. If Blizzard wont fix these insane ammount of bugs i will get rid of the game forever.. Primitive pay to win dump. There is no skill. Just pay money and play green cards.. This game would be infinitesimally better, if I didn't have to sell a piece of my soul every expansion just to have one viable deck. but In my personal opinion a bigger problem is the community itself. It used to be good, but now its just cards with high and higher stats,making it overpowered in every meta deck , simply make all you effort to get a deck literally become nothing, and that's where you spend money to boost back up.. I really want to give a 0 on this one but I can't due to my long story with the game and what it meant to me. Unfortunately this game is the complete proof on how game developers can ignore completely the community and work entirely for money. Every choice in the game for the past 2 years was bad, getting worse one after another. Battlegrounds was the only salvation to this games almost certain death and even this gamemode is boring and not new. The esports for it are the biggest joke ever. The balance team really doesn't understand how card games work and economics in the game don't exist, the complete p2w game. I really don't have anything good to say about the game, if you wanna try card games REALLY don't play this one, try Legends of Runeterra or Magic: The Gathering. Do not waste your time with this.. the normal hearthstone game mode was addictive when I started playing, but I never went much further. And the game is p2w. But the new battlegrounds mode is very good and addictive, although it also has an advantage by paying more.. I've played Hearthstone everyday since Beta up to the Boomsday Project expansion. I've bought couple pre-orders. In the early days of the game it was the best card game ever, with brilliant visuals, simple yet fun gameplay and cool setting in the WOW universe. BUT ever since the Witchwood the game began to be more and more repetitive, the grind was real, you couldn't keep up with the meta without paying money. Playing Hearthstone became more of a chore to me. Every time when new expansions were announced I was thrilled to see new cards but then I read about the massive paywall behind the content. I'm ok with paying for actual quality content but paying about 60$ for every expansion, couple times a year is horrendous, that's the price of an AAA game you have to pay in a F2P card game. It is a good game if you want to play VERY casual and spend 2-3 hours a week on it, but I advise you not to get too invested in order not to waste a lot of your time and money. What a big waste **** core game.... I'm one of the idiots who spent a ton of money on this game, I started in 2016 and I'm planning on quitting in 2020. They improved the game a lot but it's too expensive, the game is pay to win because getting gold in this game takes way too long. Crafting cards in this game with dust is just so unfair as well. If Blizzards cuts crafting costs by 50%, I'll give hearthstone a positive review but at the moment it's just negative or mixed, the game is too expensive for people to get into, I understand Blizzard needs to make money but the crafting costs make this game way too expensive. Sadly the game mechanics and the 10 card, 7 monster, 30 life, and 30 card system is really fun but the card pack prices and especially the crafting costs ruin the game. A good game ruined by its costs, try Legends of Runeterra instead, even Yu-Gi-Oh is a bit cheaper if you just buy a few structure decks.. Love this game, play it every now and then. I have to say, that I don't play regular ranked as much, as I rather play the Battlegrounds mode and the occasional duels/arena. Highly rate that, but I do acknowledge that this game definitely has some pay 2 win issues if playing the regular ranked game mode. But for a free game, you can have a lot of fun without spending a dime.. Hearthstone is a Fee to play card game, that once upon a time was a free to play game. If you like to play this game, fork over $100ish$ to buy all the cards in the lates expansion of the game so you can actually play ranked... You know so you can earn gold in the game to buy a card pack once in awhile... Get all the cards in the game? Ohh... fork over 1000ish bucks and hope for it mate If you like to be spit in the face by the creators and robbed blindly then this is the game for you. They will most likely **** you over again next expansion and you will have to pay to play not only for the expansion but for all the new unbalanced cards again too... Save your time and buy an actually good game. Blizzard, please, fix the battle pass. the old system of daily tasks was much more interesting. I have to say this...I've been playing this game for almost 6 years, since betastone. I started to preorder since Witchwood, one preorder at time untill Scholomance and outlands I preordered and bought almost 400USD in my currency (1000,00R$) and I was okay, I decided to stop and start to play normally for the next months, decided to not buy this Darkmoon expansion and that's it. I would save to buy the January preorder, but right now, I don't want to even log in to the game. Everything is under a paywall now, lots of stupid modes and no focus on the real game. I don't know if they were hijacked for Chinese CEOS but this is the state of the game right now. The new system became a real bad stuff, it's not only greed, but criminal. The game states right now like a Gambling for children and adults too, but children suffers most for addiction. You spend thousands of cash in this game and can't reach full collection. I had to spent at least 200USD and i'm still ","ok gameplay, pretty graphics but gets a 4/10 because of disappointing lack of skill needed, stupid and repetitive . the battleground mode is rigged. if you win 2 to 3 in a row all of a sudden it will determine what cards you have played and not give you any of that class . if you see a streamer playing battlegrounds and mostly getting favorable draws then know that it is just for streamers ."
601.Unity of Command II,"Very good restoration of the battlefield of World War II. Excellent 3D model. The content is rich, and the upgrade of the command headquarters is very immersive. Fully consider the impact of weather, terrain, buildings, and supplies on battlesI like it very much. The only flaw is that there is no Pacific Ocean campaign. I need that part. It was also an important battlefield in World War II.. The second edition and the improved version of one of the most overrated games of all time. This isn't a tactical war strategy game; it's all about supply management which is impossible to do. Just don't listen to the other reviewers and the hype. Don't waste your money and time by playing this stupid game like I did. You may try the cracked version if you don't believe me.. Not realistic enough for me; to have my panzer troop wiped out by a enemy cavalry troop seems impossible, and the same when I try to invade a city and that the score is 5:0 because I use tanks in place of infantry. So in real life, to invade a occupied city with tanks makes no casualties for the resistance, really ?. I played through the campaign of Unity of Command II and had a blast. Excellent strategy game as you fight through WWII as the Allies. Game(s) like: Panzer Corps, Fantasy General II Pros: - The supply line was a lot of fun to manage and cut off - Unique turn based combat using steps as units - Nice long campaign - took me about 30+ hours Cons: - The game could be a little obtuse on special units, steps - but they have added more tooltips with details - I still never understood your percentage to hit on air strikes and the special attacks - suppression and others. Either I missed it or they should add a better UI display.. Excellent strategy game with the added layer of logistic supply, which is so critical in real war. Very approachable yet very deep as you play and learn more. Very fun and challenging to play, which can be toned down based on the level you choose to play. Play this challenging, approachable fun strategy game, we need more games like this.. In 40 years of playing strategy and war games, this is in the top 5 wargames ever. Incredibly deep and engaging gameplay, and scenario design is first-rate. There is a great deal of diversity and interest in the individual battles - everything from set-piece slogs in the mountains of Italy, to frantic pursuit scenarios across France, to intricately planned river crossings in Germany. It's great fun by a dedicated and dogged development team, who continue to refine and release additional content.. I like to control other people and better when i can hurt people so i love this game alot. The blood visuals of permanent injuries delights me. Usually I'm high when i play. Its not better than sex though. A great evolution from the first game. + Deeper logistics and HQ mechanics; + Same great visual style, only better. Great map! + Excellent overall look and feel. + The field manoeuver tutorial is an excellent idea. + Cloud save, yay! Lunch breaks gaming here I come! + Comes with an editor! Can't wait to see people's content with this, I haven't looked at it, I *think*, for now, we can create only single battles but hopefully, we'll get to create full campaigns. + Dunno if people will be able to visually mod the game, would be great, especially to get more variety on motorized/mechanized units. + The more I play, the more I find that there's a lot to love in the way some aspects of operational warfare are being abstracted, from stragglers being reintroduced as spare steps to the expense of HQ command points to the flexibility provided with re-assigning steps. + The HQ actions and upgrades are really interesting and quite useful. They provide a surprisingly deep set of options to run your battle. - - - - There are some mechanics that are a bit harder to figure out, would be great to have access to the manual from the game. - Somehow I find navigating the map not entirely intuitive (I often select a unit when I actually want to pan the camera, for example. No big deal, easy to get used to, just a note). - I find the AI to be overly cautious at time. I realize this is likely the ultimate challenge to pull off in making a strategy game, but there are gains to be made on this count IMHO. - I would add some tooltips on the unit data card. Some of that stuff is unclear. - Some of the scenario progression is slightly odd. For example, once you complete the first leg of mainland Italy's invasion and choose the historical path for the second one, the frontline and the objectives assigned to you are moved back according to the historical timeline. I understand why it is so, but in terms of overall game progress, it's somewhat puzzling. The game actually cares for this, as it offers an option to make an alternate-history earlier run for the Apennines, presumably factoring in my previous success. I think this could be articulated better so that I understand the frontline rollback implication. It wouldn't be a huge issue if I could simply go back and select a different course of action, but with the Conference system, but the game doesn't allow this. I eagerly recommend this game!. UOC 2 is a simple game to learn, but a very hard game to beat. A great challenging experience for anyone who enjoys strategy games. If you enjoyed the original UOC then you will love UOC2. If you're not familiar with either game then just give it a go, you will not be disappointed. The basic mechanics of the original game, tactical use of force, maintenance and disruption of supply lines, etc. have been expanded and enhanced to add both complexity and depth to the game-play. Replay ability is guaranteed by varying levels of difficulty and differing starting scenarios for individual battles. Something that was not present in the original game which had a single setting of ""hard"". There is a demo version of the original game available from the developer's website at ****.","this isn't a tactical war strategy game; it's all about supply management which is impossible to do . in 40 years of playing strategy and war games, this is in the top 5 wargames ever ."
602.Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,"The greatest entertaining product of all time. It's insane how Rockstar Games and Rockstar Leeds could produce such a masterpiece.. Just more of the same thing, over and over and over. I played this because, at that time, there was nothing better to play for this console.. Virtually identical to the PS2 version and just as good, which is a real technical achievement for a hand held console. One of the very best games on the PSP.. At times irritating in its clunkiness, particularly evident in relation to the mission designs, but brimming with atmosphere and emotion. A really pleasant surprise and proof that not only the main parts of the series were so special.. Yeah, it may not have as much features as San Andreas. But keep in mind, this was originally made to run on a handheld console that's not as powerful as the PS2. So, cut it some slack, will you? Otherwise, it's basically GTA 3, but with more features carried over from its PS2 sequels.. Well, at least i consider it better than GTA 3 thanks to some quality of life additions like the map and other minor things, but it doesnt add anything to the series besides that, is only an excuse to play a portable GTA, and in that regard the game succeds, in fact, i was really impressive on how this game looks and runs. And the multiplayer was one of the best in the series. But there´s still all of the problems of previous 3D GTAs like clunky autoaim, some annoying missions, filler secondary missions and no replay value after finishing the game. I recommend it if you like 3d GTAs, but dont expect something really new, apart from playing it in any place.. Getting back to Liberty City was a blast. It's not as revolutionary as the original GTA 3 but still an awesome product.. Great game. One of my favorite parts of gta. It needs a remake or remastered. But that's never going to happen.. Very good game for psp. I filled like in full PC GTA. Good voicover and cutscenes.. Really good and great game just like other gta series, and i can play this at classroom goodjob rockstar. GTA3 type game brought to the PSP to be able to play on the go when traveling? Yes Please. Great game.. Feels like more **** DLC than a standalone game - also you can clearly feel it's a handheld game, not a complete GTA experience. Still a decent game tho.. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a masterpiece of a portable game. I've been playing on Android, and thanks to the ""Mix Tape"" radio function, that is playing your favorite music in a GTA title during an epic police chase, the gameplay stays fresh. Speaking of gameplay, expect the typical 3D GTA formula with slightly shorter missions to make up for it's ""portable"" market. There is a PS2 port of this game, but the Android/IOS and PSP ports are the best ways of playing this fantastic game. For completionists, you have trophies to collect, big jumps to hit, and of course, rampages! Similar to GTA: San Andreas, there are gang members that shoot you on sight, there is even a portion of the campaign where your own mother puts hits on you until you become a ""made man"". The amount of unlockable content in this game is second to none, you'll always find something to unlock in this game. Final verdict? 10/10. GTA LCS is a surprising return to Liberty City in a way that fits in your pocket to keep you guessing what’s happening next as you play as the Mafioso right-hand man, Toni Cipriani and it did not disappoint. Plays well, and fits well in your pocket or console I must say.. Story - 7/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Levels - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10. Its an og game, its quite fun. The story is the weak point of the game but the Gameplay is for that time really good. Awesome graphics and real 3d gta world on psp :O WOW you can play a 3d gta game on psp. Solid way to play LCS today. but... the iPhone version is still better but... The PSP version is Grrreat!!!. GTA:LCS is a very fun game. Its far from a masterpiece but its still a good game. I enjoyed it but its replay value is low. When I finshed the story, I was done with the game. I have no urge to replay it.. While it has the feel of GTA 3 it felt pretty clunky especially on the controls of the PSP..... My favorite Grand Theft Auto spinoff on the PSP. I think it is better than Vice City Stories. The graphics are much better than the PS2 version. It has much better frame rate and pop-up than the PS2 version. The soundtrack is really enjoyable. I love Flashback FM, Liberty Jam and MSX FM. The other radio stations were very underwhelming. The sound is very good. The gameplay is essentially the same as Grand Theft Auto 3 but massively improved. The pastimes and side missions are more fun than Vice City Stories. The story is the only thing I don't like about this game. Get this game.. GTA: LCS is a game that is impressive performance-wise for a PSP game. It features a pretty large world, with a variety of distinct characters and locations. There are problems however, such as controls being frustrating at times, espescially with targeting and some driving sections. Overall though, it is a good game for the PSP.. A very good handheld GTA game. Not quite as good as some previous entries in the series but still well worth an investment, especially if you're a GTA fan.. If you played ""GTA San Andreas"" on PS2 and want a portable GTA that has the same game style, ""GTA Vice City Stories"" might be the better choice for you, since the free roaming is more satisfying with its design and the freedom is greater (i.e. boats, helicopter, territorial fights, making business etc.). Due to that lack ""GTA Liberty City Stories"" feels like a sorta stiff, straight line story. Of course you can go on rampage and you get your typical mini games, but the whole product lacks charm. Even the ending was quick and unsatisfying. If you know ""The Sopranos"", some parts might remind you of that show, since it's very obvious. I haven't seen ""The Sopranos"" back then, but in hindsight it does not affect the game. It's just a homage. Usually GTA's radio stations are great, but GTA LCS's rather annoyed me. Of course that's just my opinion, but gladly you can use your own music from your memory card, which improved the game.. A great early PSP title. It plays exactly the same as its PS2 counterparts, without omitting any of the features. Definitely one of the must have titles on the PSP.. Today is FEB 2016, still playing after 10 years. Especially woth the help of multiplayer. Grand Theft Auto - truly one of the best and mos important game series in history.. At first I found this game frustrating and boring, but after returning to it years later was absolutely enthralled with it. There are so many possibilities of play from stealing police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, taxis, etc. that it virtually becomes a different game for each one. That may be nothing new, nor is the ability to take out some violent aggressions peacefully in the palms of your hands. With the full endorsement of mayhem, carnage and outright heinous murder the moral dilemma here is obvious. This game is great fun but disturbingly bad for society.. Gameplay: Gameplay is largely the same as previous installments, however, that isn't a bad thing! You can complete missions, go on a rampage, race against other cpu's, etc. I wouldn't consider Liberty City Stories a ""watered-down"" version of GTA. I would consider this game a console quality title, on-the-go. I'm very impressed with the seamlessness of the controls. It's a bit difficult to control at first, but it'll eventually feel as if a second analog stick isn't even necessary. Story: Toni Cipriani, who was introduced earlier in the series, returns from lying low after the events of GTA 3. If you played GTA 3, you'll see many familiar faces and areas. Just like most GTA games, the main character is forced to do missions that include killing enemies, foiling plans, and every other ludicrous thing you can imagine! It's an amazing feeling to see such a great storyline, voice acting, and well-fleshed out characters appear on a handheld. The story does not disappoint and you will be satisfied by the conclusion of the game. Graphics: I'm impressed with the environments, animations, car physics, etc. A lot of hard-work and dedication was put into the making of this game, and the end result is a city that feels alive. Car models are well-made, environments are detailed, and a weather system is present. This is easily one of the best looking games on the psp! Verdict: I highly recommend this game! The gameplay, storyline, and graphics are impeccable! This is a must-own title if you own a psp! However, if you aren't a fan of previous titles, I wouldn't advise you to pick it up. It follows many of the mechanics that were in previous installments.. I LOVE the PSP version and still play it to this day. It is fun GTA carnage on the go. It may feel like a watered-down clone of San Andreas (which is my favorite), but its on a handheld. Sadly the same can't be said about the PS2 version. That version ****. This version doesn't.. Its not the best GTA game but Liberty City Stories is still entertaining and has great characters and a good storyline. Plus it being the first PSP GTA its another big leap for the series.. I have a feeling that Liberty City was just a bit too big of a bite for the original PSP and its main bottleneck the UMD. I never got around to finishing this game, because it just felt too dumbed down compared to GTA games that I've played on the PC before it. I also couldn't care less about the characters, which felt very shallow. Something not common for a GTA game. And then there were the controls, PSP in general had terrible controls whit just one thumb stick and this game made the lack of the second one very obvious. The targeting system was downright terrible.. Grand Theft Auto Liberty City has to be the best GTA game for the PSP. The graphics are better than any other and the missions are so fun you will want to do it all over again. If you get a PSP this should be the first game you get. What do you get when you take Grand Theft Auto for the PS2 and squeeze it into a very neat UMD card trying not to loose as much as possible? A bloody fun open world chaotic master class **** that's only draw back is its story which is far from bad. Most fun game in the PSP in my honest opinion.. At first I thought it was virtually impossible to put a fully complete 3D Grand Theft Auto masterpeice on a UMB for a PSP. But my hypothesis was proved wrong when Rockstar launched GTA LCS for the PSP. At first I thought it would be a far completely different experience from the GTA console version but I decided to get it (well 2 years after when it was ALOT cheaper!). When I first got it I wondered why the loading between and after cutscenes were so long but after a couple of months I became used to the 15-20 second wait when skiping cutscenes and going straight to the gameplay. I was amazed when I relized I was again back on the streets of Liberty City, the same exact one from the PS2 version of GTA III. I then became attached to this game (for a 12 yr old its normal). Even though it seems weird there are no times in the game where you can go hijack a plane and look at the beautiful 3D city from the sky. Also what got me irritated was there was no ability to swim whatsoever (not even with cheats!) so henceforth there was no ability to ride boats. But all in all the game is a great experience. The mission cut-scenes seem short but must are extremely funny (in adult and perverted ways), the voice-acting was alright, the rap stations were alright, the amount of weapons were phenominal and the gameplay was just like a GTA game. In my opinion this is an amazing experience. This game gets a 9.2/10 -3D city really makes you want to explore the place to bits -the amount of weapons and missions are crazy for a small UMB disk -the game has lasting appeal even after the missions -alot of odd jobs and cheats that really keep you glued xloading is very annoying at times going from cutscene to gameplay again to cutscene xthe ability to swim,climb,and fly are not availble xmusic is not so amazing, only the rap music is tuned xthe city is not so big, compared to gta vice city stories. This is one of the best GTA games, period! The city itself and the overall game-play doesn't improve on the original too much, but the story is much better and serious than other GTAs, and it easily tops GTA:VCS, which came next.. GTA 3 in PSP,OMG....This is so **** Gameplay are still good as GTA Franchise,Graphic,well **** i don`t care about that,and this SandBox style game will **** you in for hours and hours.. It is even better than Grand Theft Auto III because you can play this game on the go on your PSP. It is mostly the same as GTA3, but there is little wrong with that.. Not as good as Vice City Stories but you still get the same Liberty City as in GTA 3 and the missions are pretty decent. It is basically a more up-to-date version of GTA 3 but on a portable console. Is there anything wrong with that? No! How can there be?!?","it's insane how rockstar games and rockstar Leeds could produce such a masterpiece . virtually identical to the PS2 version and just as good . clunky autoaim, filler secondary missions and no replay value ."
603.Metroid Dread,"This is old school hardcore style,2D Metroid Game.Expect Classic Game with few new ideas,which don’t change Classic Metroid style,but makes game experience more rich!Action is very fast(one of the fastest games) and game is serious challenge,even for hc gamers(difficult bosses - especially final boss fight!)!So everyone interested this Metroid need too „get good”or Quit!. The most salient element of a Metroid game is, in my opinion, atmosphere: the various environments, the sense of isolation, the music, all combine to create some of the most engrossing 2D worlds Nintendo has ever made. Even Metroid II managed to make exploration interesting on a technologically inferior piece of hardware with a monochrome display. It truly pains me to say this, but Metroid Dread has the least memorable environments of any 2D Metroid. I cannot express how much this impacted my desire to move forward in the game. Everything feels so samey, it feels monotonous after a while. It's a shame, because almost everything else about the game is better and feels true to Metroid. This is the slickest that Metroid has ever looked or felt, and you feel like you have complete control over Samus. E.M.M.I. is a worthy nemesis that reminded me of the SA-X from Fusion (that's a good thing). The secrets are well-hidden. The bosses are challenging and fun. The story is intriguing. But none of this is enough to make up for the lack of atmosphere. I hope one day someone will make a Metroid game that recalls all the elements that made Super Metroid an enduring classic.. I managed to have a bit of fun with this but it's mostly a chore. It just involves too much wandering around wandering backwards and forwards over the same ground wondering what you've missed and being chased by enemies that are just really annoying.. If you’re looking for a challenging but great game Metroid dread is for you. Graphics, gameplay, controls and story is great ****’t miss this legendary game. Amazing!!! I've beat it many times on all difficulties. Truly masterpiece!!!. Metroid Dread is an amazing continuation of the 2D Metroid series. I highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch, even those who don't enjoy Metroid games. I did not think I would enjoy this game as much as I did. I am not a Metroid lover (at least until now) and did not have high hopes for this game. I found it to be an amazing ride through the different areas of the game, and any time I got lost, it was not long until I found my way forward and enjoyed the game even more. I enjoyed it more and more up until the very last part. The bosses are tricky, but not unbearable, and most give you enjoyable and useful abilities. The graphics are beautiful and showcase what the Switch can do. Overall, I highly recommend this gem **** to anyone who can play it.. Overall though, Metroid Dread is excellent. MercurySteam has more than proven themselves to be a worthy steward of the 2D Metroid games. They understand the genre and what fans are looking for from Nintendo’s bounty hunter extraordinaire. Metroid Dread is simply a must-play title for newcomers and fans alike.. I had to give this game a few tries before settling on this low score. Leading up to my final attempt to enjoy Dread, I replayed all the previous 2D Metroid games to see if I still even liked them. Fun fact: I do because they are all great games! Then comes Dread, co-developed by a studio that I personally don't think has ever made an even middling game (Mercury Steam). For starters, I didn't even begin to like Dread until over an hour in when I go the Morph Ball ability. I see now why the other games introduced this exploration ability very early on. Having the first or second ability (can't remember if you get wall hanging before or after) be move slowly and stealth is such a drag. From a series that has the Screw Attack and the Speed Booster (which MS also somehow botched), this is perhaps one of the worst design decisions they could have made to draw in a Metroid veteran. It continues to make the whole experience slow and boring. Another major problem MS couldn't develop well was the balance between progress and backtracking. Backtracking should generally come later and be a reward to re-experience an old area in a new way. MS's approach is to make you bypass a part ('was I even done in this section?'), explore a new area for a few minutes, immediately backtrack and finish the section. I think this starts happening after the second EMMI and is just annoyingly boring. I don't think I made it much past getting the grapple beam because I lost interest. The Speed Booster requiring an activation just killed any further hope I had for this game. It's like every step they took forward, they immediately stepped two backward. For me, the series ended at Fusion and I'll just pretend like this abomination never released. MD is mogged in just about every way by Shadow Complex that released 12 years earlier.. I've played every other Metroid game and this one is easily my favorite title and one of the best games I've ever played.. Story is peak, gameplay is peak, boss fights are peak. There's a reason my username is what it is.. boss fights is probably worst part of the game, would like an option to skip them all together. The year is 2005. Three years have passed since the release of fan favourite Metroid Fusion on the Gameboy Advance and with the release of Nintendo’s latest handheld quickly approaching the world is awaiting news on the next game in the franchise, which would reportedly be a launch title. Fast forward to 2007 and Metroid was still absent from the console, while the home release of Metroid Prime 3 instead left fans with a cryptic message that would go down in gaming history - “Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion.” As many people know, the mysterious Metroid 5 went silent until the year of 2021 when the game re-appeared fourteen years later on the Nintendo switch, still helmed by the infamous ‘Dread’ title from so many years ago. But in a post Hollow Knight world saturated by games of its genre, could the aging series hold its own? The answer is thankfully yes. For those unfamiliar with the series, there are a number of staples that define a typical Metroid opening. Samus Aran, space bounty hunter will arrive at a mysterious new world with all her abilities, before the game takes those powers away and scatters them across the map. This seemingly tedious tradition is no different here but as always, these games soon turn this scavenger hunt into a compelling narrative. Approaching the planet ZDR, the game opens with a recap of the story for newcomers and veterans alike as we are introduced to the elusive X parasite – and the seven E.M.M.I. robots sent to find it. That, with a whole environment ahead of us and a few cutscenes out of the way, is where the exposition ends and where we are left to unravel our whereabouts alone. In a 2D platformer centred around exploring it's important that the movement and moment to moment gameplay are fluid, and this is thankfully where Metroid: Dread shines the brightest. Thanks to Mercury Steam’s modernisation and various additions to Samus’s moveset, these games feel better than ever. The ability to slide under tight gaps or looming enemies and deliver a crushing melee parry whilst running speeds up everything considerably, and several upgrades to both movement and combat leave you feeling like Nintendo’s version of the Terminator by the end. As is expected of the genre, the narrative is dotted with numerous boss fights to stop you in your tracks and bestow a new ability upon their death. Each of these encounters shine with creativity and fun and the perfect amount of challenge to make a boss memorable, including one late game encounter that left us impressed even when we were being repeatedly shown the game over screen by its many arms and teeth. However, you cannot talk about Metroid: Dread without its titular hook, the anxiety inducing E.M.M.I. zones shown in its reveal trailer. In these stark, brightly lit, laboratory-like hallways cordoned off in each area of the map is an Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier that has been instructed to take out any lifeform in its path. This unfortunately includes you. As you enter one of these zones the difference is immediately clear, the ambient music and sounds of nature is replaced by the high-pitched whistle-beeps of the machines that now hunt you, become spotted by one and you will be mercilessly chased until they catch you – giving you only a split second frame to try and parry them or else you’ll sent straight to the death screen to try your luck again. This does however link to what I consider one of the few major flaws of this game, being the repetition of certain encounters. While the E.M.M.I.s each have new abilities to keep each meeting fresh, certain other miniboss fights are repeated one too many times for my tastes. Thankfully, as mentioned earlier the boss fights in Dread are designed so beautifully that it’s not much of a bother – but it is definitely a drawback in an otherwise golden game. As for replay value, this game yet again excels as it pushes you to beat the campaign in faster and faster times for bonus rewards whilst also offering additional difficulty modes and a boss rush side game to keep the game feeling fresh. Take it from me, I just finished my fifth playthrough before writing this review. Overall, Metroid: Dread is an outstanding example of world design that holds its own in the modern day and when compared to previous games in the franchise in order to be one of the Nintendo Switch’s finest releases to date. On top of all of this, even on outdated hardware it runs at a fine 1080p with a rock solid 60fps throughout, without a bug in sight. A game truly well worth playing over and over again, even if its just to experience that killer ending one more time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An incredibly fun, tense and varied Metroid adventure with very well-executed new concepts (the EMMI for example). It's challenging if you're not used to this style of game, but very rewarding.. This game is the best controlling 2D game I have ever played. With such a variety in movement options, the weapons and enemies as well as the great variety of areas to explore come together to create a Masterpiece of a Metroid game. Challenging but never unfair every boss battle feels even more great as overcoming that challenge with the tools you must master as well as adapting to the attacks of the enemy. Prepare for a lot of deaths. But that shouldn't deter you from giving this game a shot.. This game makes me loving this franchise. The map is perfectly designed and the pace of the whole game is also well done. This was my first Metroid game and, unfortunately, will be my last. Despite the good reviews from fans and critics, I found this game stressful and disappointing for the following reasons: First, the game's pace is unbalanced. Some gameplays require playing fast being chased, while some (including save point) require waiting needlessly. Second, the general game direction is to get stuck, roam, come back to unlock, fight the boss, and repeat. Third, the story is generic. I am fine with challenging games like Dark Souls, but this Metroid game is rather annoying and not rewarding.. The level/stage/combat design is all so phenomenal here. I can't think of any complaints. The game succeeded and hooking me in. I have completed multiple playthroughs, something not very common of me these days.. Metroid dread is a great strong standing game it does most things and game mechanics great. Every time that I get a new upgrade to samus I feel like I am progressing and getting stronger. If you are new to the series and want to get into the Metroid series, go with Metroid prime. Nintendo needs to give the main series to someone else. Yoshio Sakamoto’s last two titles, Other M and this one, are such badly executed messes, they feel like glorified fan-made projects.. This is a sequel to a 20 year old Gameboy Advance game, making it a kids game for people over 35. It looks like it came out of the Gamecube or PS2 era of gaming, looks less sophisticated than a last gen game, or the generation before that, or even the one before that. And yet this is a full price $60 game. The game has some of the least imaginative enemies in the series and it keeps reusing them. The chozo warrior and robot chozo soldiers come in different colours as to indicate that they are tougher to beat, but they are not interesting to play against. It's a shame because this is the first game to overuse humanoid enemies like this. In all of the other 2D games, there were humanoid enemies at times, such as Samus x, but they were rare and the focus of the majority of gameplay was on unusual alien creatures. The main enemy is recoloured six times and passed off as another different enemy, this was really lazy and would have been more impactful if all seven encounters were presented as the same enemy so there at least would be an evolution of the same thing. In addition, this enemy is limited to certain zones, because it would take effort to program the enemy to be able to navigate the whole game map. This is a shame because the character is clearly an evolution of a concept, Samus x, from the previous 20 year old game, and while that boss was also limited to certain zones, it was not communicated with visible zones and gates, making it seem like it could turn up at any given time. Seems a real shame the devs couldn't take notes from the previous, really old game. I rate this 8 out of 10 because in spite of the above shortcomings, which do detract from the experience, this game is very good. While very old fashioned in terms of presentation and gameplay, it is great to see a single player platformer, in 2.5D keeping things simple and just doing a lovable genre and franchise well. It's rare these days to play a game, that is not selling skins or trying to create an online community. It is great to just play a game and enjoy it for what it is. Some of the other non-humanoid enemies are imaginative, in places they are brilliant but often they are reused or re-skinned in an obvious budget saving strategy. A small number of old favourites return, bosses and normal enemies. Some regulars are notably missing, but it's nice to see them try something new. An underwater boss looks like it was created in the early 90s and looks like some of the boss was cut, because it doesn't seem to do much. There are rooms that look like boss rooms, but there is no boss in them. Large empty rooms, with pointless platforms. There was speculation that bosses would be added to these rooms via DLC but this never happened. The loading screens are obviously 2D images of 3D objects, which looks jarringly low budget for a $60 game. While I sound critical of this game, and I am, I loved it, and played it religiously until completion. The game honours what came before it while doing something new, and imaginative. Samus has a new costume design and there are some really special 2D bosses. Some lame, lazy ones, but also some really good ones. This could have been a 10-10 if given more time and money, so less corners were cut.. Possibly the best metroidvania ever made. Incredible movement, fun secrets, and phenomenal boss fights. The gameplay is fantastic, although the soundtrack could’ve been better. They we’re going for something much more atmospheric, and although it works, I still would’ve appreciated some actual songs.. I really liked this game to be begin with. Good graphics for switch, great atmosphere, good gameplay overall. Weak or at least points for improvement were for me two things. First of all the backtracking in combination with the labyrinth like map later in the game was frustrating from time to time. Second thing is the overloaded controlling later in the game when you have all abilitys. It´s just so much that even if you´re practised you will be misclick from time to time. The difficulty is also really high, that was ok for me because I play lots of Souls games but other gamers could get problems at bosses.. I quit this game after Kraid. I want to empathize that Metroid is one of my favourite series of all time and I gaslit myself into think this wasn't a bad game and I was the problem. But after finishing Zero Mission and Fusion for like the 4th time I realize no this game is just that bad. I genuinely believed I was the problem and that Metroid games have always been this hard as a result of listening to people online praise the game and say the difficulty is on par with the older titles. I tried to like this game as a huge metroid fan but yet again like Mercury games did with Samus returns remake they added complicated controls with stupidly hard difficulty as default for no reason. People online were saying ""metroid has always been this way"" and no it hasn't I've never had to reset Kraid almost 30 times to beat it and even if that was the case does excuse the fact that in modern day games should be this hard. Retro games have an excuse of having limited storage space which is fine. The game as well as samus returns is stupidly hard for no reason and as Metroid fans we wonder why our favourite franchise is a failure in the eyes on Nintendo and has poor sales numbers it's because of devs like Mercurysteam who made the samus Returns remake publishing game like this. It's only a vocal minority that push up the numbers to make it seems like this game is good. This game is awful. All the character and personality is removed from Metroid in this tile. The aspect of isolation and exploration is lost and the stealth segments made me want to gauge my own eyes out. Samus Returns Remake was trash and so is this. Just play Zero misson, Fusion and the prime trilogy because this company couldn't make a decent Metroid game if there life depended on it. The open mouth soy jacks love this game but anyone who is and has been a real fan of Metroid knows this game is a **** of our beloved series. OOO big cannon and parrying< I want to choke these devs to death with their own ethernet cable I hate that **** so much As someone who played througn the original GBA games including Fusion (the game this is a sequel to) it wasn't this hard. I regret giving this company a chance after the **** that was one of my favourite games of all time Metroid 2 remake a chance. I will not be fooled again and I'd rather see Metroid as a series die than a **** company like Mercy games be given the license to further butcher my favourite series of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I haven't played a Metroid game since the first one on NES when I was 8 or 9. I familiarized myself with the lore before purchasing the game so I could understand the full story. I finished and got most of the extra stuff along the way. It was a good challenge and something I might replay later. One thing's for certain; I love Samus.. honestly one of my favorite games ive ever played the controls are **** perfect and really smooth. And probably the smoothest ive ever played, the cutscenes also tell a lot without having to say a word. The bosses are fantastic and the upgrade system feel great.. Great polish, very fun.. Very awkward controls combined with repetitive backtracking really hold this game back from being fun. A pretty irritating, boring, and disappointing game overall.. Another game in a series and all the elements are in the place. Exploration, fighting, platforming, intriguing story, all executed at the highest standard. On the other hand, it makes no improvements as all games of this genre. The game is well made, that’s for sure, but it is not enough. The world itself seems dull and no great lore or mini stories are hidden in it. In other words, you do not want to live there and it is more like a one time adventure.. Die to boss in three hits. Come back with SEVEN additional energy tanks. Die in three hits. Three hours of searching for those tanks wasted. Scaling damage ruins the experience. Also has most of the same issues that Samus Returns had. Just look up the cutscenes on YouTube for the lore and skip playing this entry.. I really didn't expect to like this game that much but I am truly suprised how tightly everything function. THe game is terribly hard but all the times I decided to put the game down don't feel like such a big deal now and for the first time I understood why people love hard games like this. I feel that sense of accomplishement with this game and its structure.. I have played this game so many times and I love it, dread mode is also the best difficulty, ravenbeak is a peak metroid villain, movement is so fluid. Very good comeback for Samus, it can't keep up with Metroid Zero Mission or Metroid Fusion but is without a doubt a must play for metroid fans and a good entry point for newcomers to metroidvanias. Also people who love the Ori series wll love Metroid aswell.. It's a good metroidvania game. It doesn't allow the player to enjoy new ability required. You face bigger troubles as soon as you acquire new ability. It should allow you some time to enjoy it and get relaxed a bit. Then of course there can be new obstacles and powers against Samus... Apart from that it is truly a good one.. Some of the reviews here are unthinkable. This game was a solid 10, nothing less. Actually one of the best games on the switch.. Peak Metroid. Very challenging, especially the Dread mode, but it's a very rewarding feeling when you get through it. There's also a Rookie mode for newcomers to make it easier to get into the game.. It's just a slog. Shooting every surface to find the way forward isn't exploration. The controls are outdated, most of the enemies are boring, and there's barely any story.. Epic game! It is very hard and challenging, but fair. I enjoyed it very much. The world and graphics are exquisite. This game is completely recommendable. My score is based on the encounters with some of the enemies (EMMI) that takes away the immersion. This encounters are very frustrating. Also controls are difficult because of the combination of buttons for each ability. Other than that an excellent game.. Loved this game love the vibe but the music is lacking in comparison to past titles.. Metroid Dread is a game of moderately high highs but unfortunately pretty depressing lows. By far the best part of the game was how it feels to move. Samus controls very well and new additions such as the slide and dash really help the gameplay feel fluid. She is also very fast making backtracking for items feel less annoying. Also, the graphics were pretty and I liked the cutscenes. Unfortunately, there are many things that brought down the experience for me. The game is very linear, not in itself bad, but there weren't really enough story beats to justify the linearity and I would have rather have to figure things out for myself more like in Super Metroid. The EMMI encounters are one of the worst things I've experienced in a while. In certain areas on the map, robots called EMMI can track your movement and if they find you it's GG. There are supposed to be ways to evade them, but sometimes the EMMI will just walk into you anyway triggering the game-over cutscene. You can counter them, but I could never do so consistently. The EMMI zones also look the same which leads to great swathes of the map lacking identity and feeling homogenous. The game did improve as I got further into it, though some mini bosses seemed to get repeated a few too many times. I think there is a lot for the game developers to learn from this game, but I hope they can make more 2D Metroid games in the future.. I am posting this review so people don't get driven by the hype on this none. I really enjoyed both 2D and 3D Metroid but this really falls short and user ModestPavement does a good summary also. Enemies are not challenging, are very boring and repetitive, mostly changing appearance rather than gameplay. They also re-spawn too frequently, which adds to the problem. The level design is very repetitive and bears much of this blame also. The level design is extremely linear, which is surprising. I had to contend with two invisible breakable wall after each level and one of these didn't even register anything on the map. If you spend time teaching players that breakable walls have marks, why would you have both on the same levels?! Worse, why would you put one of these next to some breakable blocks that can only be unlocked later? This is after 3 hours of play, mind you. The EMMI encounters are interesting but quickly become frustrating. They say you can counter but really no, so it's another gameplay fail. The platforming is ok but nothing really worth talking about. I'm glad I bought a physical copy because I am shipping this one to someone who wants it. It would have been very frustrating to pay $60 for this, as many indies that cost 1/4 the price are much better games.. Metroid Dread has some great boss encounters, cool worlds and, some fun power ups but it comes up short in many areas compared to other games in the genre. MetroidVanias are supposed to encourage exploration but the game wants you to tread a specific path so whenever I went to explore and get power ups, I would get hopelessly lost. This is mainly because the map is unintuitive and many rooms look similar. There are too many abilities for the joy cons to handle so this can lead to frustration, especially with the spark mechanic. The E.M.M.I. encounters are cool at first but quickly become annoying and tedious stealth sections that also discourage exploration and just force you to run through the rooms as fast as possible. There are also a surprising amount of repeated bosses in the game. Complaints aside, if you can push through some frustration with navigation, an overwhelming control scheme and can handle some extremely difficult bosses, this is a decent entry into the franchise, but far from the best.. The gameplay is incredibly smooth. The pacing is amazing. The level design is top. The music is fantastic. The boss battles are great. This game is a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dang. that was epic. best 2d Metroidvania IN MY OPINION! It just feels so smooth to control. and the story is really cool. The combat is really sick as well as the **** exploration is fun yet not to easy for hard. kind of like the perfect combo of Metroid fusion and super. Amazing.. Back to the roots of classic Metroid. I was worried the chase parts of the game, as I am not a fan of unkillable monsters in games like this and Resident Evil 2, etc. But they are very small sections and kind of a non issue. The gameplay is top notch and looks fantastic. Some of the level design can get annoying as there is some backtracking. Surprisingly, the story is also really good and means something for maybe the first time in the series.. the longer I think back on this game, the longer I see it as a crowning achievement in every aspect. The smoothness of combat/movement, the way you slither around the map seamlessly, the perfect balance between open-endedness and clear objectives. A perfect sprinkling of bread crumbs to the end, and one of the best final bosses I’ve ever played. Only slight I can say against it is the shocking and borderline offensive lack of accessibility features. I’m lucky that I, say, have all my fingers, can hear properly and can see properly, because if u have any of those issues, ur kinda SOL on this game. Great Metroid game, keeps up with traditional metroid gaming experience we love while adding interesting features. Bosses are fun to fight. Just a great game.. One of the few good things that can be said about the game is that it is graphically beautiful and the map is quite well designed. The controls are not very accessible and cannot be modified. Samus moves very quickly and controlling her can become complicated at times. The double jump only works under some nonsensical rules. Some items cannot be obtained by the average player; the difficulty to acquire them is absurd. Was the counterattack mechanic really necessary? It seems to have been added more out of obligation than to enrich the gameplay. But the worst part is how the E.M.M.I completely break the game's dynamics. It should be a game of exploration, not a chase game by a murderous robot that will kill you in one hit, and this is repeated 7 times. The game becomes boring and frustrating; this game is only Metroid in name.. The game is boring and absurd difficult with horrible controls. The game have fans and wanted to be one of them. But it’s impossible for me to have fun with it. The intro is soulless with static text. I bought a game and not a book. And the partial voiceover is hard to understand. I wanted to give the game chance again after playing the new great PoP LC. But nope. I don’t like.. Metroid Dread is, well, very much a Metroid game. Have you played previous Metroid games? Did you like them? Save yourself the read, and decide based on that. That's the short of it. The long of it, on the other hand, starts off with little fanfare. The early game is a bit of a slog. With few power ups and very few areas accessible, the game feels a bit claustrophobic. It took a few hours before I felt like I had some autonomy to explore. Metroid games have always been somewhat linear, but some parts here felt very restrictive. One time, I couldn't figure out what to do, and thought I had soft-locked myself into an area I wasn't sure I was meant to visit. It turns out there was a destroyable bomb block hidden in a tiny space that I had ""missed"", which opened up to a powerup or something that would allow for more exploration. Sadly, this wasn't a completely isolated event. Many times during my playthrough, the game kinda prevented me from exploring, and really railroaded me to my next destination. Which is not necessarily bad in itself, but it often felt like I was just exploring at my own pace, enjoying the experience, and suddenly I'd be forced in a direction I didn't really want to take. I remember this happening a bit in Super Metroid, but never quite as harshly as this. Maybe this was intentional, removing the player's autonomy to give the atmosphere a certain sense of, you know, what's that word, a feeling of, of, of impending doom... Ah yes, a feeling of dread.*BADUM TSSS* Seriously though, there are some moments where the game is stressful. Running away from EMMIs can be nerve-wracking, even if the consequences aren't that dire. Disclaimer, I'm not a horror game fan, Resident Evil and Silent Hill are too scary for me. If your idea of a relaxing evening game session is playing Alien: Isolation or Outlast, you'll probably find Metroid Dread very mild. But for a pansy like me? It's stressful enough to get my heart pumping a bit, but not scary enough to prevent me from sleeping. It's not a bad thing. Later in the game, we've got all these skills, all these powerups, and what can we finally do with all these? Not much really, except hunt for missile tanks. And that kinda blows, because I want to find new places, I want to see new things, fight new enemies, but there just wasn't anything really interesting to find at that point. It was just prepping for the final boss and doing the completionism thing. Admittedly, though, the final boss is tough, and any prep was welcome. In fact, bosses are probably one of the high points of the game. Having mostly complained up to this point, the game certainly has some strong points. It is, for the most part, quite fun. It took me a while to get comfortable with the controls and movement, but Samus certainly is mobile in this game. Wall jumping is quite a bit easier than in Super Metroid, which makes me happy t","this is old school hardcore style,2D Metroid game with few new ideas . action is very fast(one of the fastest games) and game is serious challenge,even for hc gamers(difficult boss fight!)"
604.Medieval II: Total War,"The second best Total War game after Rome Total War and second best RTS game in my opinion. Everything worked, battles and politics, all made sense, and it captured the magic of medieval times. 10/10. Basically Rome: Total War but yet, somehow better in every way. If you even remotely like medieval history, or history in general, this is a must-play.. Hands down one of the best of its kind. With huge replayability, you’ve got one of the most fun gameplays you will find anywhere coupled with the most epic and beautifully composed music in the genre. Who doesn’t like a good medieval setting, anyway? This game hasn’t been matched in almost 20 years and it doesn’t look like it will anytime soon.. One of the best in the history of the game. While many games are being renewed, see: Diablo II, this game also urgently needs to be re-released with new features. The buyer is already ready. I'm sure it will reach serious sales with just a few innovations.. Favorite game of all time i come back to it at least once a year, perfect mix of strategy, country running, and army commanding. The on the field battles never get old and still holds up to new total wars. Have never found a game like it or a game i enjoyed enough to return to it year after year for the last 17 years.. Fun game overall but failed to be as good as its predecessor rome total war. While it was a good game for the year it was released, it is now too dated to be played anymore. This series either needs a new game or a remake of the second game.. Very good game, fun to play with a lot of different approaches, diplomacy, agents, war... Also good tactical considerations on battles but may have more settlements management. Probably the best total war game I've ever played. AI is good and resists at higher levels. The system and strategy in the game also look great.. The best Total War game. Period. While the battles are not as balanced as Shogun 2, everything else is great. The standout for me are the politics and religion, which are reasonably deep (by Total War standards). I also love the Crusader Kings aspect of the game, where building the family tree becomes really important.. Battles are fun but sometimes it’s a bit hard to control your soldier as they seem to do what they want.. The best game that I've played in the series. There is just something about it that works better then any game I've played. Cons: the units have some really bad pathfinding (especially in cities/castles), the AI can be very special and sometimes makes choices that leave me dumbfounded, Graphics are out dated for current games, but this game came out in 2006 so that's not an issue for me. Pros: Cities and castles build up naturally and in a way that makes sense, the battles are massive and the sense of scale of watching thousands in massive battle lines while knights fight on the wings is awe inspiring, the campaign is a great experience when dealing with the pope and his many asks. If you want to command a medieval army, this is the game for you.. Rome 2, but medieval and everything's highly improved. Absolute banger ****. It was just perfect, and still playable in 2022, which says for itself.. If i have to do a tier list on my favorite Total War games, Medieval 2 would be in the second place.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 10.. This is the kinf of massive rts games in my opinion. A gem for its age. The medieval theme was very suitable for a game of the total war series. Soundtrack is really memorable.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 78 IIIIIIIIII====================. In 2021 I am writing reviews for the best games that I ever played. This is one of them, and I played it a lot.. Basically a legend. Hundred of hours of game play, mediocre diversity, mediocre graphics for its time.. My first Total war game... I love it! I love the grand campaign and the third age total war mods even more!! thank you oh so much for those who created this game!!. Excellent game, perfect for fans of strategies. I have to be honest, I **** at leading my troops so the AI wrecked me mercilessly. The auto-fight results in wins based more on numbers than quality, plus removes the whole fun of being commander.. I still play this in 2020, its a shame that its code locked to so little provinces and factions, it really restricts the modding community, mods are the only reason why i still play this. Great units, immersion and fun factions. An epic and wholly entertaining time.. It was well made game. Graphics were much better than alexander in same year. Gameplay were worse than rome total war and fun was also. It was little bit slow but still can get a shot, it is also most moddable one in it's series so think about playing it today. You can enjoy from it more than others with mods. Graphics:10/10 Sounds: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Fun: 9/10. Very diversified factions, very good battles, excellent campaig. The only thing that prevents this from being the best game I ever played is the diplomacy (it's a bit lacking). in name of allah this game still fun. best history war game to date. other total wars try t obeat that but non achive this level. the lord of the rings or game of thrones mods of this game better than offical games. muslims in this game first time in west presented actual value and realstlcy. its universal game.. Brilliant game that has stood the test of time. For me, it will always be the ultimate member of the Total War franchise. Huge range of units, many playable factions and really open to tactical freedom. Have also only just (2019!) played the Brittania DLC and really enjoying it. A break from the chaos with a smaller pool of factions involved. Only negative remains as always - a totally flawed alliance system. It relies on gifts and tributes, but will still be impossible to maintain an alliance, the AI are coded to backstab!. It was pretty descent game. Sieges and open field battles very good. Campaign was interesting too.. Best total war game out of the old ones. Just perfect grand strategy with incredible mods like Third Age. I am sure everyone fan of strategies know M2TW so there is no reason to write more here :D.. Still a great experience even after 12 years from release. Games mechanics works just fine, graphics is not bad even nowadays, great soundtrack but AI could be a little bit clever. For me the best game from the Total War serie and still a piece that you should try.. Probably my favourite game, definitely on my top 5. Bought it back in 2006 and eleven years later and I'm still playing it. Mods like Stainless Steel also inject longevity into the title. This is a true strategy game where careful planning and timing will almost always trump brute-force and tank-rush tactics. In my opinion the Total War serious went in a downward spiral after TW:M2, but what a peak it is.. Simply a masterpiece, never has a game since perfectly represented medieval combat, strategy and sheer size. Over 1000s of units on the screen at once, with little-to-no impact on your PC. A legendary AI that uses tactics and everything the game has to offer, and if that doesn't take your fancy, the modding community surely has something that can entertain you. Pros: - Epic (siege & regular) battles with 1000+ units. - In-depth tactics that anybody could learn and utilise. - More advanced tactics and strategies for veterans of M2TW. - A large world map with many settlements to conquer or hold. Cons: - At battles with 1500+ units, the game becomes choppy when played at x6 and x2 speed.. An all-time PC game classic. This game is epic in scope, seamless in execution and breathtaking in detail. While Historical accuracy is not a big concern in this game, as a graduate in Medieval history I still enjoy it. The strategy map gives you a massive array of options, challenges and tools to conquer the world. Your rivals act in a fairly sensible manner, attacking each other and you in equal measure. Every playthrough will be subtly different. However I have one minor criticism - diplomacy. This is an incredibly illogical and buggy system. Betrayal of alliances is virtually guaranteed regardless of what is done in the game. Some factions will act provocatively, i.e. by placing large armies by settlements but you will be regarded as 'treacherous' for responding. This is a minor bug though. All-in-all I've played it for 1,000 hours (according to Steam) and I'm looking forward to the next game.. One of the best games in history. It's a shame things happened the way they did. The rest of the games in the series besides Rome Total War are absolute disappointments.. This will remain my favorite game of the series until Medieval3 comes along(hopefully of same quality). If you liked the new games you should definitely try this one, if you didn't than more so you need to try this proper TW.. Great strategy game for its time. It is still a good game to this day, but it has clearly aged. The management of your cities for example can be incredibly painful when you have a lot of cities.. Build pretty cities and stare at them amazed on the strategic map. Then realize the single player campaign is garbage because CA can't write AI to save their lives. You can win any siege with 1-3 units of any kind and ballista/cannon towers. Move unit outside of walls. Enemy will charge in. Walk back inside castle. Enemy slowly retreats while getting hit by tower fire. Rinse and repeat. Uninstall game in anger. Shogun Total War (1) was better.. This is one of my favorite Total War games if not my favorite. The game has a lot of good things such as the family tree, diplomacy, combat, the economic system etc., but there are a few problems that keeps this game from being a 10. For example: sometimes can be just downright stupid or brain dead, the AI will declare war on you for no reason even if you are allied, and some of the quests that the game gives you are questionable. Although these problems aren't so prevalent to the point of it being God awful.. Best total war in the series. Great fun! The best time, fine graphics (though they might be a little bit outdated nowadays --> MODS are the answer) absolutely fantastic gameplay, great music. Oh did I mention the mods?! Free to download a huge Third Age lord of the rings mod which basically is a game of its own. Besides that many many great mods, like Stainless Steel. Absolutely worth giving a try!. Probably my favorite of the entire series. Especially with all the modding that's been done. My only issue is some of the AI is garbage, and there's some unavoidable bugs. I also wish they would have left out the muskets and guns.. Medieval II Total War is a strategy game to rule them all! A huge leap since Rome Total War, Medieval II almost perfects the beauty of large scale battles, and international war. The graphics are stunning - especially since this was made in 2006. The music and game-play are breathtaking, even though the AI do still struggle on the battlefield occasionally. This game will offer you a mesmerizing experience in a time of Total War!. Check this out once you have been **** in the series by Rome 1. Battles need time getting used to, however the strategic world map is a huge improvement to all total war games. If you are a fan of turn based games like civilization, check this out... You just might be quite surprised.. This game would deserve 8 without the fantastic modding community (try third age tw!). There are too many UI bugs (shame on musketeers!), but this game remains pure pleasure to play at.. This is probably one of the strategy games that I enjoyed most. The game is amazing in all aspects. There is variety of units, it's relatively accurate in historical topics, the campaign map is big and you can play with lots of factions that make the game replayable thousands of times. It's true that sometimes your units disobey in the battlefield, there are some bugs and the diplomacy occasionally seems totally random, but this is with Rome the best TW game without doubts. And the experience gains much using the fantastic mods that exist for this game. I hope that CA will allow to do mods like the ones of this game for other TW in the future.. I play tons and tons of games many of them great and many of them awful. But this is still one of the best games ever made in the last 10 years. I wish they would just remaster it. It's the best bang for your money; as long as you don't mind looking at graphics that are nearly a decade old.. Medieval 2 Total War. Sure, doesn't sound as interesting as a game like, for example, Final Fantasy or Battlefield 4, but don't let the name be the game. In truth, Medieval 2 Total War will probably be one of the best military strategy games you have ever played. What is it? Medieval 2 Total War is a game where you get to build a mighty kingdom, through economy, diplomacy (if necessary), and - wait for it - ... brute force. This isn't like Clash of Clans, Good Game Empire or Game of War: Fire age, I'm talking about legitimate conquest: capturing cities, castles, and spreading your empire across Medieval Europe. Some categories that determined the score were: Graphics - I have a not-so-great computer, I'll admit. So I was surprised when I saw that Medieval 2's graphics were almost as vivid and real as they would have looked like in real life. No joke. They're that good on a medium-low level computer. Battles - I would have given it more had it not been for the max of 10 points. Here's how battles work: When you engage an enemy army or attack an enemy castle or town, you go into battle mode. This is where you engage the enemy army and try to kill them all, but here's the catch: YOU get to command your own army, instead of throwing armies out there and not get to see them fight, or get to see them fight but not have control over them, like in Clash of Clans. And once you get the hang of the simple controls, it'll make you feel like a true general. But wait, there's more! When you attack a castle, you get to fight the enemy army - in a castle! If you love strategy games but find them dull or lifeless, and want more in your games, I strongly recommend that you try out Medieval 2: Total War. It is truly a masterpiece. Creative Assembly, great job!. My friend brought this game over and I was pleasantly surprised (I prefer more hardcore games like Victoria). So I got the Gold edition from the bargain bin. The hotseat multiplayer mode is great fun if you have some friends and a lot of time to kill. This is a good game but not a great game because: it is still too arcade, the highest difficulty level is still way too easy, the AI is quite bad, the battle autoresolve is very unbalanced and the controls can be temperamental. Good mods like Stainless Steel 6.4+ address some of the flaws. 5/10 for base game, 7or8 out of 10 for Stainless Steel mod.. This game is boss. It is the ultimate strategy game for PC(my opinion). It has amazing battles and the graphics are really good. The historical battles are real-life battles that can teach things about history. The campaign is realistic and it's really fun. This is an amazing game.. great game lots of fun to play. I hope they make a Medieval 3 Total War and they don't muck it up like they did with Total War Rome 2 or Empire Total War. I hope that Sega is know done with putting Betas out on steam for at full price like Total War Rome 2 or Battlefield 4. This is an incredibly fun and high-detailed game that is sure to keep the attention of many! Set in the medieval times (around the founding of the americas), this game is pretty accurate on its history. This game is truly no less that Miraculously fun.. The next stage in European history: Middle Ages. Brilliantly dark and bloody, combined with obviously stunning graphic improvements, Medieval II: Total War is an outstanding strategy game that great fans of Activision's Total War don't want to miss at all.. This may be the last Total War game I ever play for a serious amount of time, the new ones just don't do it for me, and everything after this one has simply put..... flat out ****! They removed many of the best features of Total War games like the retraining of units, family tree, the depth and amount of faction specific units. At this point I don't even want to see these guys make a M3TW, because they will just mess it up and probably in the process ruin M2 for me.. This is a great game! Compared to Rome: Total War, I'd rate this an 8 or 9, but I'll rate it a 10 to make up for some people rating it a 0. It's obviously not a 0 people, don't rate it that harshly. The only game with a 0 is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Everything else gets at least a 5.. this total war game is the one of the best total war games there are aj have all of them medieval 2 total war 2 have jeg playing 350 hours rome 2 is also a good game buy ittttt !!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 total war ps im am from denmark hehe. I've owned the gold edition of the game for about five years and in the means of medieval warfare, this is by far the best on the market. The entire Total War series is great but this one holds a special place for me. The graphics are superb, the combo of RTS and TBS makes this a real gem. The real time battles along with night/day/weather effects depending on the season is just incredible. My favorite faction is England. I usually knock out Scotland early on and take over the entire British Isles for myself. It's the perfect strategic stronghold. Each faction has historical units which is a complete blast. The English Longbow and Knights of England are devastating in battle, as so are the French Crossbow and Calvary. You may even get lucky and be asked to allow the Knights Templar to build a facility within one of your towns. These guys are like a tornado on the open battlefield, and they look cool. Furthermore, you can build up each city, Town or Castle, assassinate people, battle heretics with your priests, marry off your daughters or use them as diplomats, sabotage buildings, and much much more. The game is so in-depth, it's crazy. Even your leaders can take on unique traits; anywhere from being a saint to a drunken lout. For better or worse, this will effect the town(s) which your general governs. At times, you may even discover a cheating wife or husband, or get accused or heresy. There are even historical events which happen over the course of the game which adds even more flavor to the game. Mongol/Timurid invasion, crusades to the Holy Land, exploration to the Americas, and even the Black Death. Some events are down right cruel, such as a general being murdered or killed in a freak storm at sea, but this just adds even more icing on the cake. I truly don't understand the negative reviews, for there is nothing wrong with the game. I guess you either like it or not. I for one, love it and have nothing negative to say about it. It's a classic masterpiece. Great job Sega! 10/10. I gave it a 9 because you can not choose your heir and the cavalry can not destroy the fleeing enemy, it just run along them. other wise it will be a 10. Easily one of my favourite games ever. I have more than +2000 hours of gameplay since it came out. The AI isn't perfect, but there are plenty of mods for all tastes. Altough it is quite old already, I still play it nowadays, and have great fun, and this game is way better than Empire. Unmodded 7/10, modded 8/10.. Getting slightly out of date now but still a fantastic game. The graphics for its time were groundbreaking and the scope of the game is huge but best of all manageable and keeps you involved. The real time battles are breathtaking and challenging but allow you to develop your skills as the campaigns unfold. Still one of my favourite Total War games and a great look at this fascinating period of history. A benchmark even today in the strategy game genre.. I am always surprised people prefer Rome Total War to this game. It has everything Rome had and more, so how can it be worse? It is really a very similar game but just in a different era and has a better campaign mode for sure, as well as some fantastic expansion packs and and larger campaign map. It was and still is my favourite ever total war game.. The game is excellent. I like it much more than Empire: Total war and a bit more than Rome Total War. Giving it 9 stars and not 10 because of some pathfinding bugs which make fighting in closed space (like when attacking a city) annoying. There are other bugs as well. Still, a great game. Waiting for RomeTW 2. Because of the unique mod-ability of this game, it's still in 2013 one of the very best computer games of all time and the best of the total war series. The Third-Area mod makes for the best Lord of the Rings game ever made! The Call of Warhammer mod makes for the best Warhammer game ever made!. Simillar to Rome, but prettier, better, bigger and faster with last thing maybe being the most important. Medeval gave players more freedom and more strategic options, also in much greater scale and less slow army building (no 20 turn waiting to gather an elite army if you have infrastructure). Like in Rome, you get pretty various and interesting factions, that force to to choose different strategies and policies of building your empire. The pope, crusades/jihad and mongol invasions give the game a nice strategic twist, creating some really though choices and problems for player to manage (for example, obvious advantages of capturing Jerusalem are reduced by facing a nearly unstoppable Mongol hordes in that region soon after). It all combines in a really enjoyable experience, even today worth trying if you never played this title before.. Great game. Has a few faults but they are minor ones. I prefer the strategic aspect of the game, its combat can be tedious and the controls aren't perfect. But there is nothing better out there after so many years.. My first Total War game. This game is pretty good it actually gives you a feeling that you're actually controlling and keeping peace in your faction and in your settlements. The game's graphics is good and combat is nice but sometimes your units won't listen which is really annoying sometimes. Mods help make the game better and add some extras like better combat and some historic events so that's not a bad thing.. Great game, best in the TW series in my opinion. Takes the awesome Rome: TW and improves it. Individual soldiers in each units are also really diverse.. One of the best games ever made, bar none. Sorry if I come across as a fanboy, but it'd be easier to list the features which aren't perfect! Those being; the AI is pretty shoddy, it's quite historically inaccurate, even for a Total War game, and there was a very limited number of factions, though thankfully that was remedied by the Kingdoms expansion.. A bland and repetitive game where CA offers the same engine, the same mechanics of map painting of Rome Total war with graphics that would be considered inadequate 10 years from the release. Is so hard to invest in the artistic department? I felt shame for the developers when I saw the outdated menus, the poorly created icons and protraits, and the freatureless fortresses that were supposed to represent my settlements. If previous titles offered a smooth battle, in Medieval 2 the units are unresponsive and buggy. The AI is totally absent, they are as incapable of capitalizing on chances as they are of accepting your peace offers when they have only one city left and you are besieging it with a doomstak, like any sane human player would do. The factions are empty, you'll grow tired of spamming always the same units, the mechanics are disfunctional with broken economy, broken upgrade trees, broken unrewarding units and broken religion. There is no geopolitics whatsoever, religion spread and priest production is unrealistic, assassination/sabotage is unrealistic, the game is ahistorical... After some time playing, supposing you have eaten other factions, you'll get bored very easily. Sieging is so damn broken I can't even understand the logic behind upgrading your wall levels. The music is great, really, all the rest is crap. Paradox is a company able to portray geopolitics in their maps, CA not.. Could have been much better. The AI is broken in too many ways to put in words, and there are problems with units not following orders. There are a crap load of mods though. Nothing like Rome or Shogun 2.. Medieval was not my first contact with the Total War series. Before that I was in Rome: Total War, and therefore many mechanisms was not foreign to me. That's right - I had the impression that I play the same thing, only that transferred to the Middle Ages. You can not deny the charm and expand the game, it certainly needed in strategy games. Fortunately, that Rome was a good game. Medieval Thanks is also very good, but not perfect. My score was 8, I think fair.. Pretty good, but full of bugs. The gameplay is just as good as Rome, sieges are even better in my opinion. I absolutely hate the Mongols and Timurids though, they have massive armies that are almost guaranteed to not be destroyed unless you are able to mass thousands of troops to meet them right when they spawn on the campaign map. That, with the combination of many bugs/glitches, makes this short of being a great game.. This was the second Total War game I played, the first being Rome, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved this game even more. Many improvements were made for this game, such as militia units, fortresses, larger unit queues, and more advanced diplomacy. Like any game, this one has its faults (e.g. bugs, bad AI), but overall it was a very fun game to play. I very much enjoyed the addition of castles and upgradable turrets, which offered a much more secure defense for contested areas, as well as the introduction of traders, which can be very useful for developing strong economies. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games, especially fans of the Total War franchise.. Six years later and this game is still the best Medieval strategy/simulation game ever made. Until they decide to make Medieval III, this is the game to own!. Medieval II: Total War after 6 years is still a decent 4x strategy game, single player campaign is nice, has a great custom battle mode (which is better than TW-Empire's) & the Gold Edition (Medieval II: Total War + Kingdoms Expansion Pack) can be picked up on **** for less than seven pound whats not to like.. This is one of my favorite 4x strategy games off all time. I find myself constantly going back to this title. The weight of the religious influence seems accurate for the era and makes for a delightfully corrupting good time. Want a free pass to do whatever you please to Christendom? Well thatâ. I find this game to be the most frustrating game I've played in my entire life. Why? Among others, there's the fact that: 1. Units tend to disobey your orders ALL THE TIME when in battle 2. economy totally **** in this game. it's vague, unpredictable and just plain irritating 3. unit damage doesn't make any sense. it's impossible to tell if your archers are doing any damage in battle, or that your cavalry is actually DOING SOMETHING. there is no such thing as a total HP meter to see if you are actually winning or not. too annoying!!! 4. the AI in campaign maps tend to attack you for no freaking reason at all. last time i played, suddenly the Roman Empire just decided to attack me for no reason, along with the Danes and the French. their behavior is beyond idiotic 5. you will be excommunicated for the most simple things. too frustrating 6. conquering lands takes FOREVER. it's too much of a struggle to just take a single freaking city 7. the overal battle system is complete crap. automatically resolving battles is NEVER in your favor 8. you cannot choose every faction by default. this game wants you to complete the 50 hour campaign of 5 factions before you can play as the race you want. why not just make every faction playable by default?? 9. building stuff is lineair and does not have any depth. you build a tannery to get leather armor. you build a fletchery to get archers. you build a stable to get cavalry. this DOESNT feel like i'm building a city at all. it's lame 10. the overall repetitive gameplay. conquering other factions requires you to do the same things 50 times over and over again i can go on like this for a very long time. please, don't buy this game. it's really bad. Havent played shogun 2 or pre rome games. But this is the best in the series, far better game then rome, and a generally awesome game. AI is not great, but its entirely playable. The people saying you cant charge with cav are stuipid, double click and u charge, how could u not understand this, its in every single game and medieval 2 is no exception. Sieges are great, although u can hold off huge forces with just 5 peasent archers if the enemy doesent have siege weapons like catapolts and cannons. And even then any phalanix form able units can stop any breach with 2 units, but that is still pretty realistic, since generals from the time even said u need like 5 times the invading force if u want to capture a well defended castle, and 2x if u have the element of surprise. Pope can be annoying however, and i am sad you cant turn off the pope, as he will often threaten with excommunication when u invade a christian city after they attack you, even if u have higher rank with the pope. Also if u break a ceasefire or alliance in under like 10 turns of making it u cant get any nation ever to ceasefire without spending like 50000 and a major city. The pope often requests impossable things, eg in french campaign, his first mission was get england to give caen, a major castle that is englands greatest strategic area at the start of the game. He will also slightly down rank you if u dont join the crusades, which often are on the opposite side of the map (im in england and he requested crusades take juesalisim. But aside form those few flaws, im loving this game much more then rome and definatly the later games empire and napoleon.. Great game but doesnt compares to Rome Total War, in some aspects it improved but in others it downgraded from the prequel, it has great mods such as Stainless Steel and Broke Crescent, and also the long awaited sequel to Europa Barbarorum (Rome total war mod), Europa Barbarorum 2!. A good mix of turn-based and real-time strategy, although the turn-based elements often feel oversimplified. It does have a solid real time combat foundation, but the AI is either really good or really bad depending on the difficulty setting--there is no middle ground. If you are new to real time strategy games, this one has a pretty steep learning curve. Even seasoned players may feel overwhelmed. 17 different factions on top of long and short campaigns give a lot of room for different story paths and immense replayability. One campaign can take days, even months of play time.. Awesome game, my favorite of the total war series by far. I cannot wait to see what they do with the next version. Only thing to improve really is the Americas part. 'Nuff said.. Although M2TW was released 5 years ago, it's still an incredible game. Want to conquer all of Europe, North Africa and part of the middle east? Maybe even the New World? All of that is possible. And, let's not forget the epic battles with a large variety of troops. Plus, there are also great mods for the game that'll take it to the ultimate step. It's a must buy for every strategy game fan.. This game is great.Greater than most games, decent game-play, but not as much mods as Rome:total war. I like playing as the English because I am English!. An almost perfect game. A superb blend of RTS and Turn based strategy. Medieval 2 has stolen more gaming hours from me than any other title. Ever. Period. Coupled wi","essentially Rome: total war but somehow better in every way . with huge replayability, you’ve got one of the most fun gameplays you will find anywhere coupled with the most epic and beautifully composed music in the genre . with huge replayability, you’ve got one of the most epic and beautifully composed music in the genre ."
605.Super Mario Maker 2,"The game is burdened by a host of limitations that ultimately hold back its creative potential. One of the most glaring issues is how small and short the playable areas remain, which significantly restricts the scale and ambition of levels. Why not have 3 possible subareas and bigger ones? There's also a lack of an infinite timer option which is one of the most requested features during MM1. On top of that, level themes are frustratingly rigid, as liquids like lava, water, and poison are locked to only two themes for some reason. This prevents creative combinations like lava forests, lava grassy plains, poison deserts, or haunted house lava levels. It's impossible to make such combinations, which completely goes against this game's supposed ""experimentation"" philosophy. Nintendo tried to add more variation with the new night themes but failed miserably. They all look exactly the same which is really strange given that a level theme's main purpose is to give visual variety. And the music is really bad too, which honestly has made many people not want to use them. They all have their own unique effects like sandstorms, low gravity, the level turning upside down, etc, which is again a horrible way to implement such things and removes experimentation. A lava underground level with darkness isn't possible, so is a submerged airship with a sandstorm during the night, a waterless forest with low gravity, or a castle filled with poison, with a slippery floor, at night, nothing of this is possible, at all. Now, do you see how unfathomably much missed potential this game has? It'd be much better to have the night themes as additional aesthetic variations with no preloaded effects and let the player freely choose the effect(s) as a level setting instead. Paired with liquid freedom, this would open up countless possibilities and combinations, yet Nintendo decided to not let the player experiment, not even an inch, which is extremely sad and counteractive to what the game is supposed to be. Moving on, it's also strange that there barely are any new enemies in the game, and a lot of the requested ones like firebros and Porkupuffers are locked behind 3D World for some bizarre reason. The world maker, which was added in one of the content updates, feels very restricted as well and is limited to the Super Mario World style. We can go on and on with the game's unnecessary limitations. All these constraints combine to create an experience that feels unnecessarily restrictive. Instead of being a playground for creativity, the game ends up feeling far too constrained and underwhelming.. Sadly the game's many unnecessary limitations bring it down quite harshly. There's no way to mix level themes with liquids as they're locked in their respective 2 themes. So no lava underground, water castle, poison desert, lava sky, etc. The night themes all have the same exact background except the airship, and they all have similar tinny music, overall making them very unattractive to use. No infinite timer, only 1 subarea, only 4 doors per area, areas are still too small and short in scale, there's no way to draw semisolid tiles individually, there are barely any new enemies even after the 2 updates, world maker is very limited and only includes one style, a lot of the course parts feel uncannily rudimentary like the skewers, angry sun, twisters, 3D world is separate and even more limited than the other game styles, etc. The game even removes some of the course parts placing freedom from the first game. You can no longer place things in the starting area, a lot of objects can no longer overlap, a lot of quirks with some of the mechanics are completely removed, etc. It’s extremely difficult to find good levels in the online section, most is just hot garbage, “refreshing” levels or speed runs. Overall the game feels too limited, and this only hurts the game. Level editors shouldn't have such a giant pool of restrictions as it completely hurts experimentation and creativity.. With the success of the first Mario Maker, a sequel was highly anticipated—and Super Mario Maker 2 definitely delivers. This installment brings back everything you loved from the first game, plus a whole lot more. One of the standout features is the added Story Mode, which is a pleasant surprise for players who aren’t as interested in user-created levels due to the inconsistent quality. Thankfully, Nintendo provides a variety of expertly crafted levels, making for an enjoyable and well-rounded experience. The inclusion of new power-ups, like the 8-bit Link, feels surprisingly natural and fits seamlessly into the Mario universe.However, the game isn’t without its flaws. Multiplayer mode can sometimes be nearly unplayable due to lag, which is a major disappointment. Endless Mode is a great concept, but the quality of levels is hit-or-miss, and more often than not, you end up with lackluster creations. If Nintendo curated this mode to feature levels based on completion percentages, it would be a significant improvement. The game also includes several suits and unlockables for your avatar, adding an achievement system that works well. For instance, you can unlock items by clearing 100 courses on normal difficulty or by winning three consecutive matches in Versus mode. While the core gameplay remains the classic Mario we all know and love, the level design possibilities and creativity in this game are limitless. Overall, Nintendo knocked it out of the park with Super Mario Maker 2.. Super mario maker is such an easier formula and they didn't do the one thing they needed to do. Not allowing all the old creations from the first game be playable was the dumbest thing ever. So stupid and ruins the entire game.. I adore this concept. A Mario game where I get to showcase my lack of creativity and imagination by making the most basic levels in existence whilst looking enviously at everyone else’s levels, which are all full of imaginative and creative ideas!. one of the best 2d platformers i've ever played the story mode, the maker and the fan made levels are perfect. The best 2D Super Mario game, with infinite levels and unlimited replay value even with most player made levels being duds. But the Nintendo included experience is sure to make this the 2D Super Mario game to buy. Although it must be said that the creation maker element is substantially worse than the Wii U game due to the lack of the GamePad that gave that game its edge.. It's great. The level isnt as good without the Wii-U gamepad, and somehow Nintendo hasn't made it better to find good levels. I say that because this game has really high, highs, but they're kind of hard to find. This is because you have to find the needle in a haystack with these levels. For every one 10/10 level there are 100 1/10 garbage levels.. Super Mario Maker 2 is the most creative nintendo game so far. Even that there are no updates anymore, its still a game you could play right now. You can create your own levels, put them online, explore people levels... I don't like that you need Nintendo Switch online toplay people's levels online. I think that this game is really good, but it has it faults. The game needs to have some more content, I'm not saying it's garbage, I'm just saying that if you don't have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you won't be able to have full access to the game like online play, playing other people's levels, etc... 5/10 it has no potential, but it's entertaining.. Ive spent over 1500 hours on this game and i still dont get bored. With the endless game modes and things to do it is definitely my favourite game of all time. The sequel that we desperately needed. This brought many assets into the game that the original lacked such as slopes, the super acorn, coloured yoshis, poki’s, more biomes etc. this is what the original should have been.. Only problem is without online it gets a little boring. But other then that masterpiece.. This game is incredible, just nintendo. PLEASE. Just have a gamemode to play only QUALITY level, no Random ahh block placement by a stupid 8 yo. This is the only nintendo game that really deserves to cost $60, so much content, story mode is very awesome also super worlds are very fun. The only bad point is that he doesnt update anymore.. ""DAD, I made a video game"" - said the child alone in a TJ MAXX, after being abandoned by their father. It’sgood but the physics is the main problem. The physics don’t make any sense at all! Like when Mario can’t move much while jumping.. It's super mario maker 1 but with some new things added. Like there's really nothing else about this game. If you can't play it then you're not really missing out on much. Probably more fun for a big Mario fan but I'm just a casual mario fan so for me it's not as cool.. Story is ok. Creativity is not bad. I can take inspiration for creating videogames. This is a good example for a game developer!. The amount of creativity this game births, conceives, adopts, [other synonyms for 'create'] is unmatched, and it comes with a bow on top; that bow being the mustachioed man himself. Mario Maker 1 was already a great sandbox game, so adding more items and gimmicks to it was the logical next step, and that step took them to the land of gold. The addition of extra background themes was a great step, and it gives levels more flair. In MM1 the level themes were fine, but the lack of diversity just made levels feel like ""platform challenges or cool tech showcases"" rather than graspable places Mario would visit. Now, who knows where your level could be? A jungle full of acid, a windy desert, high in the clouds? The list isn't infinite, but the new options feel so welcome. But that's all cosmetically; howis the gameplay? As many people have quoted throughout the history of our species: ""fun"". The new items feel ""spicy"" enough to justify its difference from it's Wii U father, yet tend to stay calm enough as to not overwhelm the maker or players with complicated items. Slopes feel so good in levels and HEAVILY alleviate the problem with the New SMB style in MM1; you can make fresh hills rather than blocky awkward steps. The addition of Swinging Claws has given creators a new tool for platforming, as you can suspend enemies and items in the air and make them fall if you walk under one; Spinies are my go to option to put on the claws in a platformer. While it was an update item in ver. 2.0, it's hard to imagine this game without Spike Balls. They follow real laws of gravity, so you can have fun making hilly levels that take advantage of the ball slowing down and speeding up on slopes. Twisters and Snake Blocks, albeit underwhelming when the public first saw them, are cute obstacles and feel like a natural and justified inclusion in this game despite their few uses. Fish Bones are a unique enemy introduced; on land, at least. They'll be destroyed if they touch literally anything, yet can still harm the player. To take advantage of this unique property, I like to put them on parachutes. And lastly,the ON/OFF Switch. Wow, this is impressive. So much uses have been seen for it; a jump sensor, a way to make rhythm game levels, kaizo platforming... it's such a perfect fit for the game and fits the spirit of the game like a glove. The courses you find online are very polar; they're either extravagant or awful, if you found an inbetween, then wow good for you. You tend to get recommended a certain ratio of recent uploads/at least 1 heart given, and it works okay. The ONE SOLE issue I have with viewing online courses, as well as this game as a whole, is that like YouTube you can ""Boo"" or dislike a course, but no one will see that Boo. Being able to see a Boo to Yeah ratio would have been so good for level browsing and would've made you aware of bad levels way faster. Other than that one gripe, this game is phenomenal; and again, so much creativity has blossomed from it. People have made entire 2-digit calculators in this game, that's impressive. So what are you waiting for? Let's-a go get making!. This is such a good game, the creativity of the levels people make in Super Mario Maker 2 is just amazing, and yea i know there can be some bad levels, but some of them are just masterpieces, 10/10.. So fun you can creat your super Mario level alone or whit friends the story mode is good and the online Good. It actually brought a proper campaign! I'm so happy they did that, and something I certainly missed in the original Mario Maker. Aside from that, it's a great sequel that doesn't ruin anything already set and adds more than it takes away. Although I still miss the Amiibo function... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The ultimate Mario maker: it has a lot of items and hours of content you and other people can make, but it has ONE major problem: the online is paid. You must have NS online to play other people levels so, that takes it down a little bit for me. Great Game! Tons Of Positives And So Many Great Ideas For Levels You Can Make! One Down Side Is That While To Most People Its Better In All Aspects The Kaizo Community Has Taken A Big Hit, The Physics Took A Hit As Items No Longer Bounce And Hitboxes Have Been Changed. But Still A Amazing Game! Thanks Nintendo -Korgi. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While Super Mario Maker 2 has its faults, it delivers a fun and enjoyable experience that is replayable many times over. The level designer is easy to learn, but hard to master. My main complaint with this game is that the main gimmick of the game, the ability to share and play user created levels, is locked behind Nintendo Switch Online, but even this didn't even slightly taint my experience with this game. It is an amazing experience that you must try if you are a fan of classic Mario platformers with a twist.. has a lot of features its overall really good hopefully they also make these maker games for other nintendo franchises. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very fun, and could sit down and play for hours and never get bored.. Excellent to play every now and then, try to beat some levels, do a bit of endless and whatnot. I’m not much of a creative guy myself, so I don’t really make levels, but my only valid criticism of the game is the online mode. I’d rather not suffer another second of it.. Is overpriced and requires a DLC. waste my money. Where all Mario maniacs end up at last. This game is fun. The ability to build Mario levels and worlds using a plethora of tools provided by Nintendo themselves is a great idea, however, there are some disappointing things in this game. The tools provided are good but a lot of things are missing. Anything that's off screen doesn't load properly, leading to level creators having to do workarounds. I wish Nintendo provided better support in that area. Another thing that's weird is the 3D World theme. It just feels unnecessary because it's missing a lot of cool things from 3D World and has some bizarre things such as the car. Now, onto the things I like. I love seeing the older Mario themes in widescreen. It just feels awesome to see Super Mario World in such a format. Another thing I love is the Super Worlds. People can build their own worlds, complete with custom overworld maps. I just think that's neat. Overall, Mario Maker 2 is a good, but flawed game that strives to create a fun creative tool for budding level designers and brand new stages for people that are looking for that next Mario fix.. The ultimate Super Mario Bros level maker is now available on the go! I swear the only reason I didn't play it at first was because I lacked the inspiration to create new levels. Back on the Wii U, players weren't allowed to simply have all the building items in arms reach. Players had to wait nine real life days in order to unlock these items. So if you wanted to build the level of your dreams, you would have to play a game of back and forth with the date and time settings. But now, ultimate power is now at your fingertips! Though I personally prefer not to use the touch screen on my Switch. I'd say the best addition of this game is the world map maker, currently it's only limited to having Super Mario World theming. But the fact that I have the ability to place alive icons, alternate routes, toad houses to go with my stages it takes me back to the days of my childhood, drawing my own Mario levels for fun. Their's even a solo mode if you want to search for inspiration and challenge Nintendo staff levels. Life is good! One of the most important elements of video game design is freedom. The more options you give your players, the more enjoyable the game becomes. So this sequel is a big step in the right direction. However I will say the best way to enjoy this game, is to have other people try out your levels. Whether they be local or online, the true joy that comes from creating levels is seeing the people enjoy themselves while playing them.. I have about 300 hours into this game, it is my most played game on my switch. It's really fun to make levels and play them... too unless you do endless, which is fun but give you less 'good' levels sometimes. I can be very creative in this game and made about 70 levels and even a super world. Really recommend if you're creative or want an infinite amount of 2d platformer levels!. I recently played Super Mario Maker 2 and I have to say, it's a fantastic game. The level design is top-notch and there's so much variety in the types of levels you can create. The controls are tight and responsive, making it easy to jump and maneuver through levels. The addition of new power-ups like the Super Mario 3D World cat suit adds new dimensions to gameplay. The only reason I don't give it a perfect score is that the online multiplayer can be a bit glitchy at times. Overall, I highly recommend Super Mario Maker 2 to any fans of platformers or Mario games in general.. This is a really good game. It has so much play value in it. The story is nothing special, the online games are often laggy, but Joycon Drift is not very prevalent! The worst part is playing on a tv. This game is only playable (for making stages) on handheld. Playing is bedt on handheld, and fine elsewhere. I do suggest buying the game if you have a switch! I have at least 500 hours playing it. I think that this game is very creative and great as a first game for kids! It does have some problems, like the 32 level upload cap, but it’s got basically infinite content (endless mode), so it’s perfect for long road trips. Definitely a good purchase for someone of any skill level as it covers a wide scope.. Such a creative and well made game! Building your own Mario levels is obviously an amazing concept that I'm surprised wasn't worked on properly until now. And as a plus, you get an adventure mode, and an inconsistent multiplayer mode that's still fun nonetheless.. This game should be a considered a must play and is an absolute must-buy on the Switch. This game is awesome, no doubt. 10/10. A dream come true This game is everything a sequel to Super Mario Maker should be and went above and beyond adding online 2d Mario for the first time ever, sure it had it’s flaws, but it improved a lot over time. All of the updates were solid, none felt like let-downs or included anything that should have been there at launch like check points in SMM. This game in my opinion the best game ever.. A fun game that lets you express your creativity in many ways. A variety of tools have been introduced which makes it an improvement over the Wii U and 3DS games before it. A fun time to mess around. Nothing special but worth it if you have a creative mind. 8/10. As great as Super Mario Maker 2 is - and it is genuinely great - it is perhaps the only Nintendo Switch game with a direct predecessor on Wii U that somehow manages to be inferior to the original. Much of this can't be helped; no game made better use of the Wii U GamePad than the first SMM when it comes to designing and building courses. Using a controller in TV mode works well enough, and there's also the touchscreen in handheld if you're so inclined, but I just wish I could make courses with a mouse and keyboard. The built-in challenge levels are superb. The World Builder is a welcome addition. The new modes are great. All that said, I really miss the many extra characters we got with the Wii U game, like Mario-Kun and Weird Mario. User-created courses are very hit and miss, and mostly miss. You can avoid the all-time top 20, as they are all just identical automatic courses that make loud noises. It's best to find a few active course designers you like and follow them, or at least someone who *was* active a few years ago and made a ton of courses. Regardless, you'll never run out of fun new courses to play! (At least until Nintendo ends online services at some point in the future.). This was the first game i got with my switch in 2019.. Absolute must have for anybody who has the switch! The only con for me is that there is some things missing which i would like to add. But the rest is all good!. Great game! You can build and explore levels! There is a great story mode! But the search feature is not that great... But there is also infinite mode!. This game in its prime was honestly 10/10, but with lack of support from Nintendo and the over abundance of the “satisfying” levels kinda made me fall off of it. This game added a whole lot to SMM1 but also kinda didn’t. It feels like just one new game style when it said “Extra Games Styles” was kinda off to me. There also wasn’t that much added if you look at it. I’m not saying it felt like a rip off, but I’m saying that it feels like they just put Mario maker on switch just because they had to put it on and they added some extra parts to say “Hey! This game is brand new!” But even with all of these complaints, the things that they did add was fun like link, world maker, story mode, and multiplayer. Would be 10/10 if Nintendo gave this game the splatoon treatment and added new updates all of the time.. must play, fun game. just stay away from multiplayer versus. filler filler filler. Good additions to the original. On/Off blocks being the best ones. Dab on all the haters, cause this game rocks.. One of the best sandbox games on the Switch. The community levels range from brutally difficult to surreal. The story is kinda mid though. Would recommend aside from that.. I get bored with all the boring stages. Not enough additional elements for 2. No Frog Mario or Tanuki Mario. Online service is now charged.. Just a blast, infinite levels is so fun! Play this game, I really love it, spent 50 hours on it on the first two weeks. This is the worse video game... to exist. How hard is it to make a hitbox around a square box! Apparently very hard because everything thing in this game doesn't work. It's that Nintendo has given up updating this game after 1 year. If you enjoy a dead community who makes the same refreshing levels over and over. If you enjoy the worse match making and insane lag! Input delay is inconsistent. Multiplayer versus games use single player levels. Even though there is a tag for multiplayer levels. This game is unfinished. This game could be great if Nintendo puts some effort into it. Fix Mario Maker 2 please!. Very good game, but too few updates. And the hype faded away too quickly ):. It's like Mario Bros, just better! You have the ""adventure mode"" where you have to complete levels created by Nintendo, or you just build your own levels or play levels from people around the world. CREATIVITY. ""A transcendent experience that will only continue to improve over time"" siiiu. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game simply doesn't work in a few ways. First, it just isn't well suited for the switch hardware. Making levels is tedious without the gamepad for the Wii U. Second, most of the levels you encounter are bizarrely hard nonsense. If you want to fail over and over, this is the game for you. There's a reason that game developers are the ones with jobs making games... playing random's levels (the main premise of this game) is a miserable experience.. Overall not my kind of experience, I like more to play games and levels made by real developers. The online is bad and I would like a better way to search for levels.. this game is so good, all the things you do has a purpose. i love everyhing this game offers. Ok, sure. The editor is very powerful and you are unlimited with what can you create. You can create the craziest Super Mario Bros. scrolling airship you can possibly imagine, you can add power-ups, checkpoints and stuff... though, it still has its flaws - maximum of one checkpoint per sub-world, only two sub-worlds per level, limited level lengh... You can play levels made by others! Cool! The problem is that 90% of the levels (especially in Endless Challenge) are garbage and pure unplayable from start to the very flagpole. Popular level tab is completely flooded with some... ""refreshing"" levels which are all the same (and they all ****), plus they can be potentially dangerous for players with epilepsy. All other levels are some crap minigame levels and the rest is blue platform challenges, all the same. Other nice levels do not get a chance to get played. Story mode levels are the only decent levels in the game. So just to finish this off, the game is very promising, but very disappointing. A great game ruined by players and small children. EDITED, 30th of July, 2022: removing one point for the extreme lag in online matchmaking.. Super Mario Maker 2 is a fun game, and definitely an improvement from Super Mario Maker on the Wii U. It adds a bunch of new features which makes creating and playing levels much more enjoyable. It also adds a single-player campaign, and although it's short and relatively uninspired, it's still something new to play around with. I have a problem with some of the cut features, like the amiibo costumes, as these were such a great feature in the original game, which many people adored. However, regardless of this, the game is still worth picking up if you're feeling creative, or even if you just want to play some platforming levels.. Mario Maker 2 is not a great game. The game has so much potential and could be an extraordinary game but Nintendo fails to add the resources needed. Me and my brother had created a Mario Maker 2 level that needed to take place across multiple worlds. Though the game only allowed us to have two worlds! In fact when we tried to make a third world it deleted half of our second world. The game fails to give cool resources like npcs, more than two worlds, and changing the graphics between worlds without resetting your progress. The game could use way more building tools, mechanics, and enemies. The game would be cool if you could connect multiple levels as one world. If you were to build a simpler level and less care about the complexity, the game is a blast! Though I hate to say it but a great idea for a game was put at waste and I recommend Minecraft over this game until Nintendo can fix up its lack of resources.. The concept of creating Mario levels is genius, I really like it! its a fun game and sharing your courses with the world is fun too, I wish the online mode wasn't very laggy but putting that aside its a good game.. this game is so good. has so many content and the challenges is so funny yes!. This game is awesome, no doubt. When I got this game one Christmas, I was miserable because Mom told me I wouldn't get any presents. So while my brothers were rejoicing about getting theirs, I was miserable about being the only one who didn't get any. But Mom got my back and told me she DID get me my game. I was ECSTATIC. With all the selling-out done, though, I'd like to start praising the game for its extremely catchy soundtrack, especially its title screen should you be playing in the SMW mode onwards. It's just SO nostalgic. Now only that, there's several customization options available, proving Nintendo loves their variety. My only problem was that there were loads of Story Mode missions that were **** to do. But it was fun, especially when I had Luigi to lend a hand. You'll understand when YOU play the game. Also, Course World is amazing, as you can see other people's creations. Multiplayer Versus, in particular, is pretty damn cool, even though I barely win. Anyways, to conclude, it was a good concept for us to make our own levels in the first game, but THIS game blew it out of the park with TONS of content. If you want to try this game out to see for yourself, go for it!. This game is endless, really. I have never seen this much creativity in one game ever since minecraft. People make new levels all the time. The only nitpicks i have about this game is 2 things. Why can't i search normally? Why do i have to use codes? -1 for that There is no quality control. You can make a messy level and if you're good enough, you can submit it. -1 for that.. Great title, certainly worth picking up if you own a Switch. Designing your own levels and getting to play other people's provides endless replay value.. This game is very fun, however, it does have problems. I'm going to talk about the positives before I go over the negatives. The overall content is packed. You can make the Mario level of your dreams. However, there is more to it than making your levels, there's also a campaign that allows you to play levels created by Nintendo to rebuild Princess Peaches castle. This allows you to unlock more items for you to mess around with within the main maker part of the game. Another thing is the vast amount of levels to play in the maker world. You can upload your levels for the world to see, or play others made by other people. And, with the version 3 update, you can make your worlds, which is like making your own Mario GAME. This is got to be Mario Maker 2 biggest part. Now let's talk about the main issues with this game. The Multiplayer ****. It is so laggy and is unplayable at times. You could have made the multiplayer single player and it would still be laggy. That's how bad it is. Plus, once you have done with the campaign. If you don't often play other peoples world, it gets kind of dull, that's the main reason why I don't play the game often. However, this game is great fun, and I highly recommend it if your a fan of Mario and sandbox type games.. I love 2D Mario, and just when I thought Nintendo wouldn't do anything interesting with it anymore, they released the original Mario Maker and completely recaptured the magic! And this is a more than worthy sequel! I want to thank everyone who provided endless amount of fun Mario action through this amazing tool!. Great game. I think it is good because you get to make mario levels+in“worldbot” make the world. This concept was much more interesting the first time, but the sequel is really great in its own right with lots of new content. Most of the stages that others made are unplayable trash, but every once in a while you find a real gem of a level. The single player is also great.. Nintendo really said: If you hate the New Super mario Bros games so much, then make it yourself. One of the most expertly crafted games in the platforming genre.. Fantastic game. With millions of levels to play, there's always a new level to play, and you can search by difficulty, Mario game style, popular courses, and more. Making courses is also fun and is a good outlet for creativity. This is a must buy game for Mario and platformer fans.. This is a huge improvement from the original wii u game. It introduces so many items we wanted like: slopes or online multiplayer (although it's incredibly mediocre sometimes).. A very bad game in comparison to mario maker on Wii U, I lived that game but this one doesn't fix the originals issues, loses a ton of personality and in general is just sad","the game is burdened by a host of limitations that ultimately hold back its creative potential . one of the most glaring issues is how small and short the playable areas remain . level themes are frustratingly rigid as liquids like lava, water, and poison are locked to only two themes ."
606.The Crimson Diamond,"I bought Crimson Diamond directly from **** after playing the Colonel’s Bequest and the Dagger of Amon Ra. It’s miles ahead of those games, and is a masterclass in how to reinvigorate an old forgotten genre for contemporary audiences. I don’t mean “point and click” adventures of which there are plenty of contemporary examples. This is a forgotten subgenre of Sierra’s text parsing adventure games that Roberta Williams experimented with to limited success. Julia Minamata did a wonderful job here breathing fresh life into it, borrowing from some mechanics of both of William’s games, such as the look-then-examine feature and the ask-about feature. The result is the experience of actually feeling like you have to do detective puzzle solving work within a traditional point and click story-heavy adventure, and it pays off. There are times where it can get a bit frustrating here or there, but given the developer didn’t have a massive company play testing it for her (as Roberta Williams did) and given that it’s far far less frustrating than anything Sierra ever produced, I’d call this a masterpiece of game design. I really hope she makes more games of this subgenre, whether a sequel or not. I also hope Roberta Williams plays this!!! I think she’d love it.. I love P&C adventure games, and I've played my fair share of text parsers, but this game just frustrated me too much to finish it. I kept running into road blocks because I knew what I had to do, but the game wouldn't let me actually /do/ it. Needlessly finnicky with prepositions, certain items can't be used until they are looked at AND THEN examined in your inventory, vague objectives that scream ""nonsense video game logic"". I truly truly wanted to love this game, but I just couldn't.",i bought Crimson Diamond directly from **** after playing the Colonel’s Bequest and the Dagger of Amon Ra . it's a forgotten subgenre of Sierra’s text parsing adventure games that Roberta Williams experimented with to limited success . it's far far less frustrating than anything Sierra ever produced .
607.Sly 2: Band of Thieves,"Sly 2: Band of Thieves is a game that gets universal praise from almost everyone who’s a fan of the 3D platformer genre. As a huge fan of these games as well, them being my favorite genre of games I was going into Sly 2 with high expectations, expecting to enjoy it a lot. Unfortunately, I ended up becoming more and more disappointed with my experience the further I got into the game. It just has so many outdated elements and tedious jobs that hold me back from liking it more. The fact that you can’t fast-travel to the Safe House after finishing jobs or be able to switch characters on the fly makes the game feel sluggish and a chore since you have to constantly run back and forth to switch characters. The power-ups in this game are also insanely overpriced—getting all of them is required for 100% completion and the platinum trophy as well, but I didn’t want to spend so much time grinding out coins for them, as going for 100% on this game seems like a chore. And I know this is the most subjective thing ever, but I’m just not a fan of the stealth aspects of this game, and stealth in general in fact. I don't enjoy having to wait for my enemies to move out of my way, I just prefer faster-paced games where I can fight enemies without consequences. There are also a couple of jobs that require a certain power-up for you to be able to continue the game, and I do not think those should be paid and you should be able to obtain them right when you start the job. I also think playing as Bentley is tedious since he cannot fight enemies at all, and if one of them spots you then you’re forced to run away while avoiding their attacks. Sometimes the markers for jobs don’t always appear on your screen too which I think is annoying, and I wish there was something on the top of the screen that would show the markers and how close I am to each one. The game still has great things about it such as the interesting story, fun writing, memorable characters, gorgeous art style, and these super fun linear platforming segments that are my favorite part of the game, but it’s littered with so many elements that just don’t gel with me. I think these first three games desperately need the Crash and Spyro treatment with a remake trilogy, then they could iron out all of the outdated issues with them and make the good stuff even better. I understand why so many people love this game and even consider it a masterpiece, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as everyone else, which upsets me since I really wanted to love this game. I want to see what everyone else sees in this game, but with a remake trilogy, I feel like I could.. sly 2 and 3 were my favorite games as a kid, sony please bring these games back. my favorite game of all time the levels are and aesthetic is very unique for a platforming this was also the first video game i have ever played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just great, it has aged of course, but it still holds up really well, the art style is time less and never gets old, the characters are fun and well written, the story might be the best part. Every sly cooper fan knows that this game f#cks, hard.. whilst the first one was tight and very linear, this one is open world and more loose. unfortunately, i thought this decision was a downgrade. some of the levels you can roam in are just too simplistic and you usually do the same routes a few times in a row. story is an upgrade from the first one, the writing still being pretty good. i did often find myself a bit bored and abrehensive about continuing. the first game was so much more dense, it felt much more entertaining overall. still fun for about 75% of the time tho. Sly 2 is a step up from the last game being a (mostly) stealth 3d platformer. They took what was iconic and created detailed open zones that feels like a perfect fit for the genre. There is plenty to love in this game; the small zones that are dense and plenty to do and explore (the complete opposite in todays gaming world),quirky characters and interactions, and the various gameplay which includes the mini games. The theme and setting for Sly Cooper is iconic and leans more into it I enjoy that you can play as all 3 members in this game, all having unique moves, abilities and ways to setup the heist. For instance Murry can take on 5 enemies no problem while Sly is fantastic in traversing the stage. Sly 2 is not perfect as a few issues I found is: - World 3, is not good. The missions and level design is sub par. Thankfully it was only one world I had issues with. - Although an improvement, the story is fine but is lacking punch and the heists seems too lack sense upon what you are achieving and can hinder motivation. - When going though the zones the game loop barely changes and makes the game repetitive towards the end. The zone areas are similar size and the enemies are the same just a different appearance. - The games difficulty stays constant after the third zone so lacks the feeling of progression for the player The game took about 17 hours to beat and was so rich in content. I played it on PS3 but if you are building a PS3 library, this game is one of the greats to have. Now to wish for a PS5 remake. Very charming little platformer hybrid game. The story is very fun and full of many memorable characters, the presentation is top notch and there's a number of mini games and locales that keep the game afloat with variety. Unfortunately there's very little depth to anything in this game. It's still a fun game but it can get repetitive and you should avoid it if you are looking for something with tight satisfying platforming challenges. A fantastic game, with good Graphics, unique character Development, and some of the best storytelling in a ps2 game. It's a must-play!. Sly 2: Band of Thieves is a stealth-action platforming video game developed by **** Punch Productions and published by Sony.. Sly 2 capitalizes on the first by introducing larger environments and maintains its great characters.. Best locations, best music, best plot, great dark atmosphere. My favourite game in the series.. It's not just nostalgia for me I completely love this game. Other than the ending needing more explained other things just feel like nitpicks. A very good game but it´s hols back from a prerfect score på one bad hubworld and a few bad missions.. I can't really see any negatives in this game, I love it so does most people, a masterpiece in the platformer genre. I came back to give it a high score as apparently Sony only care about game scores on Metacritic, so I am here to support the game and hopefully help get the series to continue.. Sly 2 Band of Thieves is one of the greatest games ever made(in my opinion). It is my favorite game in the series and it is my favorite game of all time.. Sly 2 Is An Amazing Game With Great Story, Gameplay, And Great Dialogue. This Game Is Amazing, 10/10. Sly 2: Band of Thieves is a phenomenal follow-up after the events of the first game and it’s full of surprises that you don’t want to miss.. This has such a noir, tongue-in-cheek mood. Sly 2 is one of those landmarks in aesthetic games that you might play just so someone watches you play it and its aesthetic looks cool. Its storyline and gameplay aren't that interesting but its characters are to fall in love with - Sly, Dmitri, Carmelita, Bentley, and its Arabian Nights graphics with its criminal suaveness.. what a gem. still want it for my ps3 but man did i have a gewd time with both this one and sly3 those were the days. Best game in the series! The story is almost too well written for a kids game. Playing as sly and jumping around really makes you feel like a master thief. And I also love the way you pull of big heists at the end of every chapter.. To this day there have been few games like Sly Cooper 2, in every way a flawless game, from the graphics that have aged well, the unforgettable soundtrack, fully interactive gameplay, charismatic characters and a satisfying script, sly cooper is certainly a must play for all ages and shapes.. Sly 2 takes everything right about the original and expands upon it, amazing game A simple yet good story and mission is once again the backbone of this game but it is even more fleshed out than the original Sly game Fun is the word I’d use to describe this game. Great game wish they make new versions for the new consoles out there, ps5 about to get released in November 2020 and this game just disappeared. R.I.P this was one of the top 3 games (Hitman bloodmoney, Sly Series, King kong) i used to play in 2006.. A platforming masterpiece with tight controls, fun missions, an engaging story, likable characters, and a captivating atmosphere. Taking the player from night-time Paris to a rainy jungle and snowy mountains, the game's quality never dips below an extremely high level. One of the best platformers of all time.. Great game sequel takes what worked in the first and expanded on it both in story telling and gameplay and trimed the fat from the first game. The game also looks significantly better than the first and also expanded the idea of being a thief with heists rather then a regular platformer with thieving elements. Over all good game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. story is great, characters are interresting, gameplay is smooth and feels very polished. one of my favorite games of all time.. A little bit better than the first and gives you the ability to now control other characters other than Sly. This isn't always the best as sometimes you wish you can just play as Sly the whole game.. Not content to simply make a good sequel to the already-great ""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus,"" **** Punch evolved the series in a big way with ""Sly 2: Band of Thieves,"" adding new playable characters with completely different playstyles, large open-worlds to explore, and more control options (there's a run button now!). The result? A sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor, but even surpasses it! ""Sly 2"" has plenty of gameplay polish, great visuals, an interesting story, charming characters and, most importantly, it's just a lot of fun to play. You couldn't really ask for much more out of a 3D platformer. The only (very minor) downside is that, despite having a nice balance in length (it's not too ""long"" and not too ""short""), it's not a very difficult adventure. Even so, ""Sly 2"" has it all, and it's certainly one of the PS2's best games! Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". Sly cooper is the best plattform game ever made **** mario this is how a game is supposed to be made and the characters are absolutely lovable and the art style is absolutely beautiful this game is 10/10. This used to be my favourite Sly Cooper game as a kid. However, today I think it's my least favourite and it's kinda overrated. The game is just to easy, the bosses are cool but there is no challenge. When I played through it again I thought it was kinda boring, even though the story is the best thing about this game, Sly 1 just felt faster in gameplay and was more fun and challenging. The final boss is also not as good as the last one unfortunately. I actually think that the hub world does slow down the game. I do still think It's a good game, but definitely not the best Sly game. SCORE: 8.4 / 10. Sly 2: Band of Thieves is a platform stealth video game developed by **** Punch and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Level Design + Good Story and Characters + Variety Gameplay + Mini Games. This is the best game of Sly Series . This game has got cartoon graphics and amazing storyline about thief Sly Cooper . This game is Stealth , Action and Platformer . This game like on Assassin's Creed Series and Prince of Persia Series . In this game there is a parkour . Best Stelth on PS2 with Splinter Cell Chaos Theory . Very good and amazing game . 8/10 .. One of my favourite games of all time, the gameplay and story in Band of Thieves provide hours of enjoyment. The only downside is that the game suffers from bugs, on very rare occasions, which have resulted in the loss of hours of progress.. A great game for fans of platformers and adventure games. Still holds up after all the years. Fun puzzles and good story telling with strong graphics. The extras and repeatably are present, but don't really introduce anything new outside of timed events. Good for all ages.. By far the best game in the Sly series. Amazing storylines that make you want to continue playing, great stealth, great, theme-fitting music, every character is always fun, level design is perfect, fun gameplay, feels great when you complete anything. Amazing game.. The best game in the series. Not too short, not too long. Greatly expands on the first game, and has a great plot and fantastic gameplay. Completely recommend.. WHAT IS THIS GAME?: You, a raccoon, and your turtle and hippo buddies must go around to different levels (worlds) and complete a bunch of missions so you can collect parts of an evil deceased metallic owl named Clockwork. Each level culminates in a heist and a boss battle. Pros: -varied missions keep the game fresh and free of monotony. -The game is stealth then platformer then action adventure in that order. -The character are extra quirky and have more personality than the last game -The game is much much much longer this time around. About 20 hours. -Each world/level has collectibles, you can pick pocket people for more money, and there are hidden artifacts you can find to get extra money to buy moves. -You mostly play as Sly, the raccoon, though there are also Murray (hippo) and Bently (turtle) levels. They each have a different feel but imo Sly's ability to climb around makes traversing the worlds a lot more easier and subsequently it is very relieving to be back using him. Cons: -The boss battles aren't as unique as the first game. Most of them boil down to learning the boss's moves then dodging them and hitting him/her in the back. -The voice acting is improved but still at times feels amaturish. Conclusion: A lot better than the first game. You should try it out.. The best game in the series. Combines diverse gameplay mechanics (platforming, stealth, vehicle driving and shooting sections), cartoony graphics and interesting adventures among the world. Stellar presentation included. The only downside for me is turret levels. It bugs me operating them in every possible mode. The game is a blast and easy platinum if you're playing on PS3.. This is my favorite game of all time, unlike the previous sly games, this one has an open world aspect, a life bar, and improved platforming. The music fits the environments in the game. The characters are all great, This game is an all time classic. My only complaint is that the graphics look a bit dated even back when the game first came out. I honestly think sly 1 looks better but the graphics are not too important in this amazing game.. This game is fantastic. It's clever, it's full of humor, the story is good, the atmosphere is freakin' amazing and the characters are love able. I would say that this is one of the greatest video games ever. It's not only a kids game. Just try it!!! It's amazing!. 88?? How dare you put it lower than even 95. It's the best game on the PS2, oh yeah i have played Ratchet and Clank, Final Fantasy X/10, oh i have played Jack and Daxter. all of which are absolute masterpieces. But this game in the Sly series is the best and there is no deny-ing that. The graphics are great (FOR PS2 STANDARDS)The story is ""GODLY"" the soundtrack is ""HOLY"" the gameplay is ""TOP3EVER"" The only time i felt frustrated with the game was when i did Dimitri's quest in the last area, you know the diving quest. that was just just soo cheap, because there was no way to avoid the plates, you litteraly had to memorize the order they came in which i ""hate!"". oh and BTW the voiceacting is some of the funniest and best i have ever heard, and it's very rare to say that it is good in other languages too which you can not say with most games. overall i would give this game a 97/98 out of /100. It's oosing with nostalgia from the minute you start the game.. Sly 2 is a Stealth/Platformer/Action-Adventure game where you play as three characters. The first character is Sly. Sly is a master of thief and also the main character of the game. Sly could pickpocket guards, although you need pass a mission to unlock this ability, walk on ropes, climb ladders, pipes or latch on wall hooks, and etc. Sly is not the strongest so you can't going in arms blazing. You sneak around guards makes it stealth like. The next character is Murray or 'The Murray' is a lot different. He's not like Sly. He can't climb or even under tables. He could kill guards in two hits. So he's the one you want to kill people with. Bentley is the character you won't play. The only time I play Bentley is when I need to do mission with him. He's every weak and kill guards neither whacking them with your dart gun or putting them into sleep a planting a bomb on them. He does have interesting gadgets though. The way you play the game is by, you in a open world. You have to mission to beat the level. This is longest Sly game by far. The story is really good. You could unlock power ups or gadgets. Some you have to get like a paraglider and a alarm clock. There's also clue bottles. Getting 30 per level, gets you a special power up or gadget, but only with Sly. By getting power up, you need coins. You get coins by breaks objects, kill guards, or pickpocketing. Then go to TheftNet, in the safe house. The music is very well compose. Sly 2 will worth every money. Just have a PS2 or get the Sly Cooper collection in ps3, or get it in PSN.. This game is awesome it has way more replay value and a much better story than InFamous. There are a ton of surprising plot twists and constable Neyla is a good villainess and the name Klaww from the Klaww gang was taken from the second boss counting the dark Eco plant from Jak 1.. In the golden age for the PS2, there were many of the ""Greats"" GoW,Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank. One racoon gave me arguably my favorite game of all time. Yes i am writing this review in 2013 but that still doesn't change that, i've never had this much fun in a game in history. Unlike the third game, this game reasonably gives us the main 3 characters to play as, Murray, Bentley and Sly. Murray is the stereotypical muscleman with no brains, Bentley is the Brains with no brawn and Sly is the inbetweener making the most functional team in history. The missions and different worlds are a blast, although i had trouble on certain missions when i played the first time, i find that i still have trouble today with them. All in all Sly 2 is my favorite Platformer, 2004 GOTY, Game Of The PS2 generation, Game Of The Decade and Favorite Game Of All Time! You should be proud of what you accomplished here ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game! This a mixture between Action/Adventure/Platform and Open World. The gameplay is great, and the plot is very nice. Graphically very good, this game gets a full 7, because this is a very funny and nice game.. This is my favorite game of all time to this day. Excellent story, graphics, gameplay, and sandbox elements. This game was a complete blast to playthrough. The characters are very charming and it has a deep story for being a kid's games. I'm 15 and I still enjoy this game A LOT. I highly recommend you get this for the Playstation 2 or Playstation 3!. If you have not guessed it I love Sly 2 Band of Theives because it gets a lot right. The game expands and enhances the elements from the first game really well. The story and characters are better. The design is restructured and is outstaning. The gameplay is solid and a ton of fun to play. While there are some missions that could have been handled better and I miss the platforming segments from the first game overall I enjoy Sly 2. The stuff Sly 2 does well it does really really well. If you are a fan of the series pick it up you. The best in the series. With an awesome script, game mechanic, art style, and presentation. Totally worth more than one play through.. Best Sly game. Outstanding game for those who like platformers. The levels are brilliantly done with lots of eye candy. This is very fun game. Art desingn, characters, music and gameplay are very very good.. Great characters, a fun plot and very diverse gameplay. The graphical style is nice, boss battles are also great but the game doesn't really know what it wants to be.. best series ever. Hands down. Very fun gameplay, likeable characters, etc. Whats not to love? Good graphics too. The people who rated it bad, cant get past the boss fights LOL!!!!. Best game in the series, it's a long, deep adventure and it's worth all your time to beat this game. It has a wonderful story and genius gameplay. Worth every cent to pick this game up.. 2 years later **** Punch doubled the length, tripled the characters, improved the music, sound, story and gameplay. Missions are somehow even more varied than the first game, characters somehow 100 times better and it very rarely gets at all repetitive. It is a game that should however be played in small bursts because it can be very frustrating.. my 3d favorite game of all time.(after sly cooper and the thievius racoonus and sly 3 honor among thieves) I love everything about this game. The graphics and gameplay are just amazing and the length is perfect. I play this every week at least once. i will never stop playing sly cooper games.. With a lot more features and variety in the gameplay, Sly 2 (even with that) don't beat the classic humorist predecessor . But end of the negativeness, Sly 2 prevails in cartoonish graphics ( improved) and adds a more bigger city to explore that is fun to always circle it. Instant sabotage. A huge improvement from the first Sly game. It's like a cartoony, kid version of Assassin's Creed, but with 3 playable characters and tons of gadgets to buy. While some of the missions can be a little frustrating, the addictive gameplay will keep you from throwing the game in a dark corner. The transitions between episodes are more or less animated comics than videos, but the comedic storyline and good voice acting make it worthwhile.. GREAT GAME with good graphics a good story but it's a little bit short but the other parts make up for that it's amazingly fun to play you have to by this game now!!. i played the demo on ratchet and clank up your arsenal a while back and got it for my birthday (also a while back) i was amazed and love the graphics. the story is great and character is funny. this is a fun game for anyone.. Quite possibly the best game in the series. The setup is very effective as a sequel and its also the coolest. The character designs are way better than the first one. And the game takes some risks that almost push the ""E for Everyone"" rating but it all works and it makes the game only more enjoyable. And lastly the final boss battle is straight up awesomeness. The only problem is the episodes ""Jailbreak"" and ""A Tangled Web"" are really dark so its kinda hard to see. But this is a great game. This game is exceptional. **** Punch did an exceptional job making you feel like your a real thief; going around Paris, carefully avoiding guards to get to your next mission. The key system of the first game has changed to exclusive open world sandbox-esque level selection. This game is probably my favorite 3rd person platformer of all time, because each mission if different and the gameplay mechanics are perfectly complimented by the level design.. This game was awesome! one the elements was that from the start you were really working towards a goal! everything you did had a role in the final big robbery of the stage. those robbery's really had something like a good movie robbery (however, i couldn't find the first sly anywhere so i haven't played the first).","Sly 2: Band of Thieves is a game that gets universal praise from almost everyone who’s a fan of the 3D platformer genre . it just has so many outdated elements and tedious jobs that hold me back from liking it more . the game still has great things about it such as the interesting story, fun writing, memorable characters, gorgeous art style, and these super fun linear platforming segments ."

61.Chrono Cross,"A masterpiece in its own way, and a great legacy to Chrono Trigger. The amount of characters allow a diverse experience to each gamer. Story is intriguing, soundtrack is phenomenal and gameplay is pretty innovative.. A complex, revolutionary, and engaging fight system paired with a truly amazing and profound story traversed by an insanely deep and customizable team make this arguably the 2nd best JRPG ever behind only it’s Step-Father Chrono Trigger. The reason I say Step Father is because the only thing they really share is a name and a few extremely small links. Its graphics are excellent for the time. The only complaint is that like every PS1 RPG, the load times between fights really adds up. Overall, it’s a Top 30 game of all-time and probably better than the perceived kind of the PS1 era RPG’s- Final Fantasy 7.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An artistic and classic masterpiece, definitely one of the greatest and most mysterious video games I’ve ever played. The world of Chrono is beautiful.. Chrono Cross is just not a good game, and as a sequel to Chrono **** some reason, it's also a disappointment. From weird battle choices, characters leaving the whole time, story narratives straight up being different, mundane graphics, and a slow soundtrack; Chrono Cross steered itself so far away from Trigger that it just doesn't feel like it was trying to do anything right, just different.While I can certainly get not wanting to be stuck in the same role, Chrono Cross is just an odd game all over. Why this game deals with different dimension instead of time travel is already different enough, but they really just changed everything they could. Combat is often slow and tiresome with how often you have to manage it, and most of this comes down to the magic system. Magic in Chrono Cross is dumb and stupid and I hate it. Why do I have to buy magic? Why can I still not understand the combining system, WHY DID THEY BREAK SOMETHING THAT WAS SOLVED. I really, really don't know, but just having traditional combat would have been miles better. Instead you can just run out of magic and be SOL. Then you also have a stamina bar that just sort screws a lot of the system. It's like a proto proto version of the bravery default system, but with next to nothing of that systems coolness of risk and reward. We also have over 40 characters that would have to be trained and used properly that it just ends up being a waste. It's very clear that there are just better characters to use and having a bigger party is often just a status symbol over something useful like Suikoden.Honestly how they went from having gripping characters in Chrono Trigger to just an outright mess of a character cast in Chrono Cross is perhaps it's biggest offensive. With like only 5 characters getting any proper screen time, and the rest getting small neat parts just makes for a far cry of the dynamic the Chrono Trigger group had. Really this whole game's story is a mess, and while I understand it has a bit of connection to Chrono Trigger, it really shouldn't have. The games plot is too vastly different, tone and otherwise, the game does have an interesting plot twist, but before you can even get there the game would have shown you it's ugliness and either you're in for a pound or just left for something more interesting. Largely the different dimensions only holds interest for so long, mainly because you think they do something interesting with it, but they just don't. The dimensions are just too similar to one another, and it never really exploits the parallel dimensions the way Trigger did with time travel.Really Chrono Cross is an ambitious game that was a huge disappointment and a let down for anyone that liked Chrono Trigger. Why this game has to share the same name is also as maddening as it is disheartening. Honestly you're just better off playing Chrono Trigger again.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's been years since I originally played this on PS1. It was actually the first game I ever played on the console as well. I remember being addicted to the game and playing it daily after school. The story and characters aren't the most well thought out but I still had a fun time playing it. The Hi Ho Tank was my hardest battle and it actually took me a year to get past it. Graphics and style are amazing for PS1, sometimes even looking like PS2 title. Atmosphere created by beautiful world and music is breathtaking. Unique battle system mixed with interesting bosses makes this game one of the best jrpgs out there. Too bad there's no bestiary to review all amazing creatures you have fought through the game.. I'm not going to say anything to keep you curious, I only confirm that this game is in the Top 100 games with the best story/lore and if you are looking for something that will leave you with ""existential void"".... Default one of the best RPG's of its era. Serge, Kid, and many other characters are awesome and really interesting. Music is great, combat is weird at first, but you learn about it pretty quick. Graphic-wise, the Akira Toriyama style has been abandoned, but the designs for Cross are impeccable and I wouldn't want them any other way.. Definitely should play!!! Best game ever, you will have a good time playing it. It has a great plot in the story, it will hook you to the game.. It's a game I very much like but I still give it an 8 (more like 8.4). The music is a 10, as well as the art. The story not so. The first half is very good, but later it gets boring and confusing. I think the mistake was focusing on the NUMBER of characters, an innovation at the time, but on huge detriment to the QUALITY. I can reconstruct the story of many games but not of this one after the first disc, let alone remember the sidequests, even after playing many times. Why? Because the characters help you to remember the story, and if the characters are not well developed then there is no connection, no bonding, the enjoyment is not going to achieve good enough levels to remember it later. Huge contrast with Chrono Trigger or games like FF9. Another flaw is that the villain or villains of this game are not well developed either. Then why I like this game? I really don't know, maybe the music, the art, the nostalgia and momentum given by Chrono Trigger. The story also had great potential and there are some philosophically interesting moments. The first disc and the beginning of the second save it.. Just perfect! Amazing! The ""Squaresoft"" games are the best! The ""Square Enix"" games are horrible!. Chrono Cross is a spectacular sequel that is sadly often overshadowed by its predecessor. Those looking for simply ""more Chrono Trigger"" will be disappointed that Chrono Cross has far more ambitious goals. Instead of recycling its predecessor's structure, Chrono Cross is its own beast, with a revamped battle system and more of a focus on storytelling. Chrono Cross features a whopping 45 playable characters, most of which need to be recruited in specific ways through multiple different playthroughs (Chrono Cross does feature the return of Chrono Trigger's New Game+ mode). This does make it difficult to give each and every character a fully realized arc, but Chrono Cross' characters all have fun and unique characteristics, as well as their own abilities in combat. I would also be remiss to not give special mention to Yasunori Mitsuda's magnificent score. After composing two brilliant soundtracks with Chrono Trigger and Xenogears, Mitsuda does it again in what could be not just his finest score, but the finest in any game to this day. After delivering two of the greatest RPGs ever made with Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, it's a shame that Square Enix has since left this franchise out to dry.. One of the best RPGs I have ever played. It is a game worth returning to over and over again.. This is my most favorite JRPG of all time. Overall ""Excellent!."" I love time travel games and this suits to my style. Chrono Trigger too. I can't wait to play this again as a remastered on PS4.. One of the best JRPGs ever done. I hope that someday we will see a remake or remaster of this wonderfull classic.. Great story filled with interesting concepts and views. Phenomenal soundtrack, fun combat system, and a vivid and colorful world(s) to explore. I highly recommend this title for those who like more experimental and thought provoking games.. I've finished this game a few times, and it feels like reading poetry. You may not fully understand at first but you get the feeling you're being drawn into a beautiful and mysterious story. It's philosophical, it's artistic but also funny and joyful. It's the perfect balance between having bright and colorful graphics, and dark and suspenseful story. And the OST covers all that the best way possible to actually become one of the most beautiful and well done game soundtracks ever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a wonderful game. I revisited this in 2020 and it's just as wonderful now as it was almost 20 years ago. Unfortunately the 3D graphics have not aged as well as I thought they would have (the pre-rendered backgrounds are still beautiful). The music is incredible, the characters are fantastic, and the story is wonderful. The combat and level up system is very unique and I prefer it over the random battles of many other JRPGs from that era. And to top it off, it is a great sequel to Chrono Trigger. Although in the beginning it may seem like it has little connection with. But progression proves otherwise.. I love this game so much. While it is a departure from Chrono Trigger.. this is still an amazing game. The OST is one of the best. The graphics are insane for its time. And the gameplay was fun and the vast cast made it more interesting. The story was very good and the whole art direction made this game a memorable experience.. This game has heart and it has soul. It's truly awesome and I love it so much! The game is just interesting and engaging. The sound track is second to none! Yasunori Mitsuda is a God among mere mortals! The battle system is awesome! The story is awesome! i love how the common battle theme is in the odd time signature of 9/8. Truly engaging and never gets old! Perfect game!. I enjoyed the game a lot. Square was huge in the PSX era. I loved the characters, all of them had a backstory and a personality, the development system was not the best but the story was amazing. The battle system was fun and engaging. a must play. This game wanted so bad to be Chrono Trigger... it fails, badly. This game is ok... you won't try to claw your eyes out while playing it... but it fails horribly as a sequel to one of the best RPGs in all of gaming.. The game gets boring at endgame when leveling up but the game sound track is a masterpiece.. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: AWESOME. Dialogue: GOOD.. You'll notice that a lot of good reviews are from nigh-20 years ago. For the time the graphics were good. The gameplay was interesting. The music is very good. But thats about all. There are only 3 characters, and no real story to speak of. Its like an Adventure time game: ""Go to the next place because I DONT KNOW"" mixed with a suikoden-level of characters to pick up, that do not fit with the story, or worse... if they are stronger than the main 3, you'll spend time using those and not hearing the little bit of chatter from the 3. The ending of chrono trigger is bashed into mass-effect levels of depressing: ""We know they did something, long ago, but they're all dead, and they didnt get to do anything they set out to do."" and there isnt a time travel aspect to send you back and fix any of that. There is some timeshifting, but it isnt memorable, considering the lack of story. The world is a mess to explore, the enemies are.. creative. The leveing system is creative. There just isnt much to praise about the game, when it presents a strong narrative that isnt strong. It took itself very seriously, and when it starts to loosen up, at times, thats when the game works. Good art direction and soundtrack dont make up for everything else. This is like a summer movie ~ you need to see it, but you shouldnt buy it.. Inconsistent, Convoluted Story Uninteresting Unendearing Cast of Characters Genuinely dismisses the legacy of the game it claims to be a sequel of At least the OST is good. This game is indrebly beautiful and has one of the best game OSTs ever made. The battle system is very interesting, but the game never really lets you use it's full potential, as it's pretty easy. It's a great game, and a must play RPG.. This game is not the classic people make it out to be. It tries a bunch of new things that none work very well. You can only have three characters, only about 6 matter to the story, and there are 44 of them in total. RPGs are supposed have great character development, this has one of the worst character developments in any RPG, that and the level system with the stars is lame and uninspired. The story is not easy to follow and jumps all over the place. I'll take quality characters even if it is a small core cast over a character cast that's this big and shallow any day. Pass on this, it wasn't great in 2000, and still is nothing to write home about.. Honestly this game is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, game of all time. The soundtrack is amazing. The programming and list of available characters is impressive. not to mention a divergent story path at multiple part of the game, for a PS1 title!? It was far beyond its time.. Word cannot describe my love for this game. Must try for RPG : Masterpiece, 10/10. This is one of the best stories in any RPG. It's one of the few that actually grab your emotions, and at certain points can abuse them. Its very deep, and might require a second playthrough to fully understand, but thats what makes it so amazing. It is one of the few that can actually offer comedy, sadness, anger, and every other emotion. Now on with the story: You are a teenager named Serge who is transferred between 2 worlds. you go on a journey to find out what makes these 2 worlds different. Unlike Chrono trigger, you don't do any time traveling, just dimension hopping. You meet many characters along the way. You battle with ""fate"" and the main antagonist Lynx. You have options at certain points that can determine different outcomes of the story. you have many side-quest that can also help clarify certain characters background. this game offers amazing character development, and once again, the best story I've ever encountered in a game. It drags you in and doesn't let go from beginning to end. It also features one of Game informer's top 10 plot twist ever in a video game. Interesting huh? Its kind of hard doing this without spoiling it, but I will say that I went into this game not knowing a thing about it, and it turned out to be the best story there was. you will learn to love some characters, and even some NPC's as well. This is one of the best games I've ever played. Total a must play for everyone, ignore the Trigger fanboys. Legendary game, play it, this game changed my life for good, all I have for this game is LOVE.. While more of a ""spiritual"" sequel to the acclaimed Chrono Trigger than a direct one, Chrono Cross certainly stands apart from it's peers. The graphics, while not ground breaking, were absolutely perfect for the tone and mood of the game. The soundtrack is, to this day, one of the best in any RPG. The combat is an innovative take on traditional turn-based mechanics. The story does kind of begin in a very open-ended way, which can leave some a bit confused at first. However, it doesn't take very long before things begin to fall into place and you can't help but get absorbed into it. Also, for having as many playable characters as they have, they all feel very unique from one another and in my personal experience, I've never felt as though any of them were ""copies"" of others. With that, party makeup flexibility is very present, lending excitement in the prospect of multiple playthroughs just to see how different characters react during the story as well as how they perform in combat. I literally only have one or two qualms with the game and even they are minor and completely subjective to me. I would have liked either a little back story or just a bit more informative plot build up in the beginning and also, I'm personally not as big of a fan of the ""silent protagonist"" angle but as I said before, neither of these things are deal-breakers by any means. Overall, I'd consider Chrono Cross and absolute ""must play"" for any and all RPG fans.. This is one of the great games I've played. The story, in which you will find from comedy to drama, is amazing, a lot of characters and each of them has an interesting background, stunning soundtrack, great battle system. Chrono Cross is a game that I will never forget the experience of playing. Thank you for existing.. There was so much hype when the game was announced, but when i finished the game that I realize that was a total loss of time... Chrono Cross was not able to follow the magnitude of its predecessor. The story is weak, the characters are shallow that some should not even exist (44 characters and a battle system with just 3?! C' mon!!!) The graphic and the Music are fantastic (let's be fair)but still not enough to save the game.. great game, great story, one of the few RPG's with a lot of playable characters and that their availability depends on the decisions you make through story. you can play it 3 times, and obtain different characters in each. Cool abilities, and story, after final fantasy VIII and VII, one of the best games i've ever played.. I made an account just to give this game a 10. Chrono Trigger and Cross are both deserving of 10s. Trigger is old school fun, remarkable, innovative. Cross benefits from PS1 technology (great visuals, movies) and has a wonderful storyline which hooks the player from the start. The 'good ending' is outstanding, unforgettable. Makes me want to play the entire game over. My memory cards are full of different Cross save files. This was the first PS1 game I ever loved. The music is outstanding, and I have spent free time just listening to the soundtrack (and teaching myself some pieces on piano). Fan for life. Just played through this game again a month ago.. Chrono Cross is a very hard game to score. If you get into the nuts and bolts of how it connects to Chrono Trigger and Radical Dreamers is because confusing and most people will not understand it. I'm not even sure I understand it at the core. That said, my review is ignoring the relationship with the two above mentioned games. On it's own CC is an amazing RPG. It has amazing music, a great and fun battle system, and a unique and excellent story. Everything about it is superb. Well, almost everything. My only complaint about CC are the characters. There are way too many. Character development is nonexistent for most of them. Once you get away from Serge, Kid, Lynx, and Harle you start to wonder why these characters are here. Some have a little bit of story. Most have none. It's a shame because it had a lot of really cool characters. That's my only real complaint. Leveling up was kind of weird, but never really got in the way. In closing I suggest everyone give this a go. Ignore the connections and focus on the here and now. Kid's connections to the other two games are hard to ignore, but jump down that rabbit hole if it compels you to. Also, as a closing note; Harle is one of the best RPG characters of all time and I am still angry how the game seems to punish fans of her. Sigh.. We have a Masterpiece here, everything from visuals, music, etc were way ahead of it's time, there's no mistaking here, they doesn´t make games like this anymore, still withing for a port version or even Chrono Sphere. Nothing short of an amazing experience. A true spiritual successor to the wonderful Chrono Trigger. Not only does it pay homage to its younger counterpart, but it does an amazing job at creating a whole new story with remarkable characters you cannot ever forget. For those of you that don't know this game is based off the Satellaview SNES game Radical Dreamers which was supposed to be the sequel to Chrono Trigger on the SNES but was never officially released as Satellaview failed. With a great combat engine and a story that blows your mind at every corner this is a must buy on the Playstation 1. Pros: +Wonderful Music +Amazing Story +Engaging Characters +Challenging Boss battles +Balanced gameplay +No grinding (thank god) +Wonderful magic spells that push Playstation expectations +PLENTY of characters to choose to join your side Cons: +No dual/tri techniques that Chrono Trigger had, except for 1 or 2 out of the 40+ characters. I've played a lot of games, good and bad. Chrono Cross is one of those that brings something new to the table, and provides an experience you probably won't have again. There's good, and there's bad, but Chrono Cross **** you right in, leading you straight into the setting of the story. You feel as if you're right there with Serge, having everything happen to you. Is it because of the music? The amazing visuals? Combined? I don't know, but I've NEVER had a game do that to me, and I don't think there will ever be another one. Say what you will, but Chrono Cross is one unique game - something that can't be replicated.. This is seriously one of the greatest games i've played. Amazing music, great story and wonderful dialogue Everything about the game is perfect (especially the music).. The best RPG ever made! Awesome story, good characters, awesome battle system. One of the best games i've ever played. 15 years waiting for another game of Chrono's saga.. First of all, don't believe in someone who says Chrono Cross is better than Chrono Trigger, whoever says such **** is crazy. The gameplay is one of its weakest parts, the battle system is different of the former, but there's nothing bad towards it. The problem is that Cross is a very long game, and has only few different places, that means you will backtrack in the biggest part of the game. The game uses elements instead of magic and items, and you will every time stop the game to enter in the menu to rearrange the position of the elements in their grids, in order to have a strong party. The game features 54 characters that you can't get in a single play, making you play other times to get all of them. While that brings diversity, most of the characters are useless, don't have a decent development and have similar weaknesses and strenghts of lots of other characters in your gang. The story is pretty, but very confusing, throwing at you thousands of informations in long text parts. In the other hand, the graphics have beautiful colors and the soundtrack is beyond masterpiece, even better than the soundtrack of Chrono Trigger.. The Chrono games are amazing and this one just adds to the amazing that both games exude. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great RPG adventure. The story is interesting, the graphics are dated but beautiful, the battle system is interesting and fun if used right. It is one of my all time favorite RPG's.. An amazing RPG that is miles ahead of it's competition. It's just so sad to see all these Chrono Trigger fans complain about innovation and creativity. This will forever be worthy of my perfect score.. The awkward moment when EVEN all 16 of the official critics gave an (extremely) postive review, some idiot users still gave it a negative review. I mean, 17 negative reviews? For this masterpiece? Blasphemy. This game is a straight up 10/10. Timeless classic, will be forever remembered.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Never mind the fact that this game is meant to be a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It's still a rather disappointing experience. Even if you were to try to count Cross as its own game, its blatant, though rare, references to Trigger make it hard to do so; it's incredibly distracting. Its story falls flat due to two things: its needlessly complicated plot and lack of focus on characters. The producers of Cross must have underestimated just how attached players had become to the characters of Trigger; the characters felt real and players felt they could relate to them. This is what kept its simple plot alive. Cross, however, trades this off for a plot that starts out interesting but ends up falling over itself and stuffed down the player's throat. The gameplay is somewhat engaging, though not very balanced between player and AI. The stamina and percentage mechanics are neat concepts, but the battles usually feel easy. Combine this with a magic-grid system for 45 different characters and you have something that is, like the story, needlessly complicated and tedious. The game does deserve to be praised for its presentation: this is probably the best looking PS1 game. Add to that a stunning and fitting soundtrack and the game suddenly becomes something worth playing at least once. Overall, Chrono Cross attempts to stand proud with it's older brother, as well as with other JRPGs, but utterly fails.. Great story, no real grinding either in the game, you just mix and match attacks and characters and enjoy the ride. With so many characters and paths in the game, it has great replay value.. Too many people try to compare Chrono Cross with Chrono Trigger directly. Other than having ""Chrono"" in the name and being RPGs, these games are nothing alike. Not to mention they are on different systems with entirely different capabilities. I love both, and yes I love Trigger more, but Chrono Cross was a beautiful creation that deserves its own respect. For one thing, the soundtrack is AMAZING. I'm not a big video game music kind of guy, but Chrono Cross is the first game soundtrack I actually put on my iPod. It's a masterpiece and quintessential daydreaming music. Second point: the graphic detail. Every last scene in this game has an incredible attention to detail that I don't think can be matched by any other PS1 RPG. It's not the best RPG on the system, don't get me wrong, but it certainly shined in some areas where the typical contenders for best RPG weren't nearly as strong. The gameplay itself certainly didn't add anything new, which is what I think hurts this game the most. It's not exactly marks against it as far as smooth gameplay is concerned, because they stuck with what was proven to work. I still think a more innovating approach was worthy of a branding name as iconic as ""Chrono"", but I think Squaresoft was too afraid to take such a big risk with something that was inherently going to be attached to Chrono Trigger by name alone. This backfired, as Chrono Cross is clearly inferior, but its still a strong game. The storyline and characters are interesting, and the FMVs are pretty amazing. If Squaresoft took a leap at some sort of innovative combat system, they probably would have had the best RPG of the PSX on their hands. But their oddly conservative move instead added another ""great but not epic"" RPG to the Playstation library.. Okay... I'm possibly the biggest Chrono Trigger fan... and let me tell you... Chrono Cross... is NOT a sequel to Chrono Trigger by any means... sure there are a few references... but that' all I seen after playing the game for approx. 5 hours. So not only does it not have anything to do with the original, but the gameplay itself is nothing like the original either. And the music for the basic battle sequences... has to be some of the most annoying music ever. Sure... they did do a few remixes from the original score... and they had a nostalgic feeling to them... but yeah. This was a very poor game in comparison to the original, and I seriously cannot believe the high scores this game received. Just goes to show that you can't always trust reviews... Final thoughts... I suppose graphics were decent enough, and a few of the remixed songs were ok. But other than that, this game is, and was, complete garbage. I'm only giving it a 1 for the world map which is about the only good thing about the game, and some of the remixed music.. A brilliant game that deserves a the same reversioning being given to the equally brilliant Final Fantasy series. A fresh translation and an HD update would likely lead to the dozen sequels Trigger and Cross fans imagine every time a new FF spin-off (or cash-cow, as the case often is) is announced. Which is to say, 'was Dirge of Cerebus really a more vital project than a shiny new Chrono?' or 'How many Dissidias's did we really need?' Not that i didn't enjoy Duodecim or Duodenum or-- whatever the hockey-sticks. i absolutely did. It was what Tobal no. 1 might have been if we were up to Tobal no. 947. Exceptionally good fun, with lots of smashing and fan setvice. But it's not likely to end up in the Smithsonian 100 years from now alongside FFVII and Metroid and the Xenosaga trilogy. (Hey, don't knock it till you've played it all, including reading every codex entry and understanding every reference. While it's not strictly necessary to speak french, german, japanese, english and to study the more ""eccentric"" edges of Judaism to play and enjoy Xenosaga, it does help. It's a game for eager, curious, smart people, and in that context, it is arguably the finest science fiction ever conceived in any medium. It's a bold declaration, but also one that only those who didn't finish the trilogy with a full understanding of the story ever argue with. It's a favorite among sociology and theology majors. i digress.) While i wouldn't go quite so far as to give Chrono Cross a 10, as doing so would confidently declare it in every way equal to the greatest games in the entire history of video gaming, a solid 9 is by no means an exaggeration. Chrono cross is a rockstar ****, and JRPG royalty. ""Magnificent"" is a good adjective. ""Perfect"" is a stretch, but i understand the impulse. There are better RPGs in the world, but bet'cha by golly **** many. Tangentially, dropping a 0 on a game of this caliber (while simultaneously misspelling every third word and displaying a complete inability to utilize even the most basic tenants of english grammar) because you couldn't follow the fairly straightforward story is admitting you didn't finish the game and tantamount to saying ""Don't play this game if you're slow in the head, recovering from a severe concussion, or have difficulty with polysyllabic words and understanding the concept of zero as the absence of a number."" Zero is the Dark Matter of mathematics. We can't see it, but we know it exists because without it, the rest of math doesn't function properly. That's what zero is. An absence of numbers. And, as this game clearly exists, and for all intents and purposes does precisely what it sets out to do, giving Chrono Cross, (or any functioning game) a zero is rather silly. I'm sure many a halo-fan would find this game slow and wordy, but wasting your own time in an effort to accomplish god-only-knows-what achieves very little beyond making you look terrifically stupid and astonishingly petty. By all means, write a negative review if that's how you feel. Such editorial balance is crucial to painting a picture of any product, but throw in a reason or two. something beyond ""i can't read good"", and please, please (i simply cannot stress this enough) play the whole game first. Indeed, i myself, as a god-like master of using words that make me appear far smarter than i really am, find that it can be awfully difficult to grasp the full scope of a tale before i've...heard the tale. It's just a thought. Also, good grammar is sexy as hell. Don't let anyone tell you different. love and textbook-length game manuals, the Doctor. Chrono Cross is one of those games where","a complex, revolutionary, and engaging fight system paired with an insanely deep and customizable team make this arguably the 2nd best JRPG ever . the only thing they really share is a name and a few extremely small links . overall, it's a Top 30 game of all-time and probably better than the perceived kind of the PS1 era RPG’s- Final Fantasy 7 ."

611.Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection,"My introduction to the Tekken series, Dark Resurrection was a game I transitioned to fairly easily, given my past with Soul Calibur. While Dark Resurrection might not look as good as the console version, it is still a visually amazing PSP game, with solid combat. The combat is as tight and responsive as previous, and future installments, and the customization adds a lot of personality to the game. A must buy for Tekken fans on the go.. It is wonderful to have such a game with such great graphics on a hand held device.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is like Tekken 5 but with even more characters and stories to explore, really good game and highly recommende for every person that likes fight games.. Another fantastic Tekken spinoff this time for the Playstation Portable. This is an upgraded version of Tekken 5 with more added content and a few changes. -Fighters were given new moves and damage balancing was updated to make the game more fair. -It improved on the customization system. -We get two new characters to the series: Sergei Dragunov, a Russian agent who specializes in Russian Martial Arts and a French aristocratic girl called Lili who lives with her grandfather Sebastian. Armor King also makes his return to the series since Tag Tournament. -New remixed stages with remixed music were created instead of using the Tekken 5 stages although we get the Streets, Ground Zero and Final Frontier stages. -We get a bonus game mode with mini games for players to earn gold for the customization mode and a dojo mode to prove you are the greatest Tekken player. -You could listen to the game's soundtrack and watch the endings when you beat Story Mode like Tekken 5 as well. A great spin-off to my favorite fighting game series.. Probably one of the best fight games in PSP, makes the most of the graphical power that the console has. The gameplay is excellent for the system, and has a wide range of characters in there, with a different stories each one. Excellent game at all!. Tekken: Dark Resurrection is a fighting video game and an update to the PlayStation 2 game Tekken 5. The game is developed and published by Namco. + One of the Best Fighting Game of PSP + Excellent Graphics + Ending Cutcenes + Excellent Rooster + Ranking and Customization + Great Gameplay. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The port itself is very good, having the tekken dojo as an extra content to tekken 5. The graphic and the sound also is convincing. The problem lies in the digi pad that gives you hard times, when you play a serious match where quick combinations and reflexes are needed. But expect this everything else is good.. Great Tekken gameplay with a large roster and plenty of extra modes online and offline (I'm a big Tekken Bowling fan). Tekken looks surprisingly good on PSP. In fact, no area has been sacrificed in the sizing-down of the game. This is the kind of game that works well on a portable device, with quick and satisfying action on hand whenever you need it.. Tekken: DR is awesome game packed with most of the fighters from other titles in series, huge amount of moves and combos and big number of unique special attacks for every character. Because of that this game is ritch with content like new game modes and two all new and powerfull characters. Tekken: DR is great port from big console on smaller. This game is worth your money.","the combat is as tight and responsive as previous, and future installments . the customization adds a lot of personality to the game . a must-buy for Tekken fans on the go ."
612.The Stanley Parable,"It's one of those games that tries and succeeds in making a bold statement. Be prepared for something really special.. The Stanley Parable is the “Being John Malkovich” of video games, a complex and shapeless digital creature, that we will play over and over again, sometimes staying with raised eyebrows and a sea of questions, with the only certainty of having experienced something as much surreal as poetic.. This game is great, 10/10, really cool, well made masterpiece but its of course not for everyone, this is more like an interactive movie rather than a game like gta or skyrim, don’t expect anything about gameplay after all it’s a walking simulator (but a great one!) play this game if you like games like superluminal, gone home, what remains of edith finch or firewatch…. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For gamers looking for something intellectual about their medium, in their medium, The Stanley Parable is the only choice available – and thankfully, it’s a good one.. The Stanley Parable has this provocative and perpetual elusiveness that aches to break whatever system it’s applied to. Perhaps it's part of a weapons-grade disinformation campaign appointed to destroy all videogames, or maybe it was commissioned to wreck game criticism. Through any interpretation The Stanley Parable is equally hilarious and genuine, and if nothing else it’s going to merit inclusion in any serious discussion of its medium.. The Stanley Parable is built upon a single, simple premise, and only offers a few hours of entertainment. That said, they were a few hours unlike any I've experienced playing games before. If you're a fan of experimental indie projects or just in the mood for a fun detour from your typical gaming adventure, look no further.. The Stanley Parable is a great experience that you need to experience if you love videogames. It makes fun of popular ways of storytelling in games, and does it in a way that is fun to see and to play.. Basically a variation on the concept of a Russian doll, with some of the layers containing unexpected satirical diversions. Although if you had the chance to play the original mod, this overhaul has less new ideas than one would hope for. [Issue#236]. Great Game. Many people hate the narrator and his incessant strings of speech, but without him there isn't a game. The gameplay of all the versions are absolutely utterly incredible. I am talking FABULOUS, STUPENDUS, OUTRAGEOUSLY GREAT, IMPOSSIBLY WONDERFUL, TEEMING WITH CREATIVITY. VERY ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS [THE BEST] NO POSSIBLE WAY TO CONTEST THIS GAME. Try it for yourself. I mustn't spoil it for anyone.. idea of this game is really interesting, but the realisation, imo is bad. there is a tv show ""Severance"", and its awesome, really awesome, but this game is just... iunno its really boring just to walk and do nothing, also its too short. Idea is original, game is interesting, but paying 15 bucks for a ""1 Hour to Complete"" game is bad. Moreover, that 1 hour was actually boring. Most of that 1 hour passes by listening the narrator. Even 5 $ seems a lot for this game.","the Stanley Parable is one of those games that tries and succeeds in making a bold statement . the game is great, 10/10, really cool, well made masterpiece but its not for everyone, its more like an interactive movie rather than a game like gta or skyrim . if you're a fan of experimental indie projects or just in the mood for a fun detour from your typical gaming adventure ."
613.Shogun Showdown,"Great Roguelike. Loved thinking 2 step ahead the enemies. There is a great variety of builds too. Finished the game and now i'm sad because there's nothing else quite like it to play. 10/10. Easily one of the best turn-based strategy games I've ever played. Addictive and polished to a fine sheen. Banger soundtrack too. Play the demo and you'll know if this game is for you in just a few minutes. And if it clicks for you, it will click hard!. Game is great and a lot of fun on the steam deck. The core gameplay loop is satisfying and winning with all characters already should give you enough content for the money with all characters feeling different enough and the customization possibilities during a run. After that there’s still way more to go with the ascension system which I find more satisfying than some others since it’s more compact. Six more difficulties feel more surmountable than twenty as in StS for example. I think that’s one of my favorite things about the game actually that the „endgame“ which many people care about in roguelites is just a bit more contained and smaller in scale.. A perfect roguelike, massive replayability, gorgeous graphics and the music soundtrack kicks ass so hard. I recommend this doubly so on a handheld like Switch.. I played the demo for this and immediately after one run I bought it knowing this was gonna be something special. Incredible game design and a breath of fresh air in the indie scene. Such a unique roguelike with really tight, responsive controls, pretty pixel art and a fantastic ost. Checks all the boxes. Try the demo if you're on the fence and thank me later. Also, I find the lack of reviews for this game so far baffling. What is up with that?","a perfect roguelike with massive replayability, gorgeous graphics and the music soundtrack kicks ass so hard . the lack of reviews for this game so far baffling ."
614.God of War: Ragnarok - Valhalla,"If you want to hone your combat skill for an upcoming give me god of war play through look no further than here. It adds more lore and gives new comers tastes of the story from Greece.. A DLC that I didn't think would entertain me so much but I was wrong, I liked the way of playing and the challenges, it's very fun and satisfying.. Combat is bland and boring... gets repetitive and predictible rather quickly. Graphics ok. Story kinda of meh if you are not really into this type of stuff. Only buy because it was on sale. Still dont think this game worth more than 30$. This is the definition of beauty. The story, the character development absolutely perfect down to the finest details. The expansion we were waiting for. Fun and exciting I had a blast diving back into one of my favourite games again. Highly recommend if you love Ragnarok. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The fact that the tone of the game became serious in this DLC is a good thing!!! God series should really be serious, not like the mistake that happened in Ragnarok, and Marvel's jokes made the game take over the space of Marvel's world, and Gods became Metroid superheroes.. Free is always good. And this definitely worth a lot more than free. The fact that they released this out of nowhere without asking for money? Santa Monica Studio, you are amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A FREE rogue like mode without Atreus. A nice mode with references to the past. It could be the true ending to the main game and feels more like a lecture about Kratos life from the old days till now. Nice way to enjoy a Kratos-Mimir only combo.. A very nice (and free) addition to an already excellent game. The Roguelite gameplay has been pushed forward for the better since the previous opus free dlc and moreover, providing an excellent gameplay twist and moreover, a touching epilog going through Kratos insights.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of war Ragnarok it’s a fantastic game masterpiece, have to say PlayStation Studios never disappoint me 99%. I’ll always having fun.. Very low-level pictures.Boring explorationWithout guidance, it is easy to get lost.Very repetitive bossThe combat angle is very bad.. Garbage game! Gow IP died after GoW 3. They took a terrible direction in the norse saga as well adding garbage characters like Atreus with trash story.. A fantastic mode for players that crave the combat and desire a challenge. It also beautifully concludes Kratos' personal development from the Greek saga.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good fun and hard ! Story is perfect! 10/10 Played on every difficulty and its really hard on every so if you want challenge play this dlc. Requirement of PS account (considering that all the leaked data suggest that the players database is locked behind password ""Password1234"") AND connection for single player game is mockery. Especially after the whole Helldivers 2 fiasco, Sony is the least trustworthy company and everybody should realise, that they can and will not hesitate to lock you from game you have bought.. This add on is so short. Only adds another 2 hours of gameplay lol. The dlc Valhalla does nothing different to God of War Ragnarok, just same old refresh same weapons for the concept. I had not played Ragnarok in a very long time, but stepping into Valhalla made the gameplay feel familiar and fun right from the get go. It struck a nice balance between satisfying and challenging. Although the story doesn't take long to finish, I consider that one of its strengths. I had my fill of jaw-dropping graphics, got the gist of its Hades-esque mechanics, and witnessed another masterful performance. Seriously, that last cinematic is Shakespearean.. Rogue-likes just aren't my thing. It's a fun DLC and it's free so there's no loss on that front but it's so boring and repetitive at times. As a god of war fan I like it, as a person that hates rouge-likes I hate it. I do recommend at least trying it since it's free.. When I say this was INSUFFERABLE, I mean it. I did 2 play throughs of the game, 1 on easy and one on god of war. Least to say, will never ever EVER be doing that again, over all the story is also really bad, only thing that carries this is the god of war line and the cut scenes.Also, since this DLC is so bad, I'm using it as an apology because I meant to put every 7 rating to 10 but I can't do that because ****. Not to be confused with the current 7's in the game category. 1/10.. Just a good DLC that again ends the story of Kratos beautifully. Roguelike elements are well done and the fact that it's for free is unbelievable.. God of War: Ragnarok - Valhalla is a must play for any God of War fan. It continues the story of Kratos in a satisfying way. I just wish it wasn’t a rogue-like. The difficulty spikes take away from an otherwise great experience.. Genuinely a great time for no extra cost. I went into it expecting very little and got an incredible experience.. It is a good DLC, more than I imagined, it is a love letter for lovers of the franchise.. The total perfect game ever made by humans!!!! Perfect story and characters. ""The gameplay time artificially stretched out completely nonsensically, if it took 15 hours less for that platinum, I would gladly play it again, but running back and forth completely nonsensically from gate to gate, what's achieved there is for me the second worst installment in the whole series. Nowadays, anyone can make a beautiful game with good gameplay and a good story. Your games were playable over and over again, who would want to play this again."" ""I won't comment on the fact that they turned Kratos into a part-time mom, but the fact that you've simplified the puzzles by half or even less, I don't understand at all. Just don't include them at all. Bye."". Insane what they released for free. Its basically its own game on top of the main game.. One of the best DLC's I've ever experienced. To put is simply, the main character is going through rouge like therapy session, going through past demons. If you're not a fan of rogue like gaming, you're going to be using up a lot of time, depending on the difficulty.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nice little surprise we got this free little free rogue-like experience. Decent amount of good story and fun fights as well.. This DLC adds a lot of plots, like Higrion, Tyr, Mimir, Freya, and many players who have not played the old God of War A plot summary of the old God of War, especially Higrone and Tyr, supplements the problem that the appearance rate of the main line of Tyre and Higrone is not high and the creation is less, and it is also a perfect image for Kratos to accept his past. Whether it's an unexpected surprise for players of the God of War series, the key is that it's still free, and these deserve full marks.. Reallllyyy realllyyy fun. Great OST, The fighting is good as usual and the DLC is unique in the sense that its more of a ""choose your own aventure"" sorta thing with weapon upgrades, focuses, etc. I'd give it a 10 if it was jusssst a bit longer and had more Greek references- would've loved a boss fight against Hercules!. This is how you make a fantastic DLC expansion to an already amazing game! The many callbacks to the old greek series is just insane, ranging from the levels and returning Enemies. If this is truly the end to Kratos' Journey, then it's a worthy send off to the OG GOAT of War and GOAT of Sparta!!!. Great DLC, plenty of action and has all the things that God of War fans would enjoy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Never in my Life have I Played a DLC that is so boring like this. Aside from the good story told the Gameplay is the biggest piece of ****. It pains me that this DLC has such a boring and bad gameplay. Even the Boss battle being ridiculously hard that you die 9 out of 10 times is beyond stupid.. will not go in depth about it as i did not finish it 100% but i felt like this is somehow am in Kratos therapy session. free DLC , thanks Devs for your hard work Overall : 8/10. Meant to do the PS5 version please ignore.............................................. Liked the lore and the callbacks. Unfortunately I don't think this version of combat is up to snuff enough for a fully realized and kind of half backed roguelike.. It’s a perfect epilogue & pre-prologue for the next game and it tries a newgenre and perfects it and all of this is free. this is a must play for any fan of the series..even if it wasnt free it would have gotten a high score from me.. the combat is as good as ever and gets very unique with the roguelike elements but the real star is how much story you get with it... This shouldn't be free; what an amazing epilogue story! Kratos is the epitome of character development. I still don't get why this dlc was free lol. Had an absolute blast playing through it. So many surprising and unexpected story moments, especially for fans of the old games, & overall a very satisfactory ending for the game. Its about 7-8 hours long if you wanna hear all the coversations and get the ""secret"" ending. And imho this dlc's story is way more engaging than Ragnarök's main story. Still I wish it was slightly longer and had more to do in it. Either way its free and meant to be an epilogue to the story so I ain't gonna complain.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was a really good DLC. As an addition to the base game (which I would rate 8/10) , it's excellent. Great combat as before, really love the roguelite twist. I thought it was just gonna be a bunch of challneges but you actually get some really good story bits as well. A great expansion for this great game, and fratis, pure nostalgia, fun and expansion of what is to come.. I was disappointed with this DLC. I’m very happy it was free but I really don’t like what they did with it. I was expecting some meaningful story content, or an interesting side story. The only side story u get here is some backstory on Kratos and Mimir rambling on about stuff I don’t really care about. The combat is good because the combat system in Ragnarok is good, but the DLC, in my opinion, manages to make it less interesting because on each run u just get the same enemies spammed over and over again. There’s also a time trial section which I won’t elaborate too much on but it’s just a slog having to do it again and again and again. It’s quite easy to get confused where your meant to go here and the worst bit about it is that it gets harder the longer u spend in the section (which to be fair isn’t too much of an issue because it’s not overwhelmingly hard). Over all it’s worth a try because it’s free but I was a little disappointed myself.. This is a comparatively small-scaled Roguelite DLC independent from the main game mode. Considering it’s free to play for the original game owner, this is a good supplement of the ragnorok experience.. For a content like that and for the price it has, any grade under 10 is unfair. An absolute must-play, this dlc is worthy enough to be called an expansion. Sony Santa Monica seriously knocked it out of the park. They shoulda put in efforts to get more people hyped. Highly Recommended.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story, surprises and the teasers of a FREE dlc are just too good to be true. Sony Santa Monica is cooking. incredible addition to an already amazing game. Once again they have delivered in the intensity that is the combat of GoW with so much additional content. Cannot believe that this is a FREE DLC!. Santa Monica simply cannot miss. A whole story unfolding in this DLC for FREE is something I’m sure the God of War community greatly appreciated. Revisiting characters and enemies from previous installments was a fantastic touch!!. Just brilliant I was expecting a mere run & die and this is a whole new story unwrapping before our eyes. The gameplay is even better, of possible, than GOWR. Kratos is very well developed and many events of the past are now revealed under new angles. The OST for itself worth the download of the DLC. God of war Ragnarok & Hades tuvieron un hijo, le pusieron valhalla 10/10 por ser gratis.. I cant express how much SMS delivered here and gave us fans such a gift. My jaw dropped several times when i played through this, so many story beats and lore thats gets explored and teased here is incredible. I love it and cant wait what comes next.. Awesome DLC with additional story details and godlike combat as usual. Amazing idea for a different twist on an already remarkable game, completely free. Kudos to Santa Monica studio.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sony Santa Monica don’t miss. First we get an incredible reboot for God of War in 2018 that blew us all away, then just 4 years later we get Ragnarok that blew us away again, and then only a year later we get a free 8-12 hour long DLC………again I say…….FREE DLC!!!! That not only adds an awesome rogue-like mode, but additional story bits with new cutscenes that seamlessly blend gameplay with cinematics the entire time where you at some point forget the cinematic scene is over and your thrust back into gameplay. This……THIS is how you handle DLC!!! Funny enough is I would’ve gladly paid $15-20 for it, but the devs are so amazing to the fans that they gave it to us for free! Playing this on the best place to game, the PlayStation 5, is absolutely one of the best early Christmas gifts I could’ve got this year! Thank you, Sony Santa Monica for delivering the best free DLC ever made!!!. gameplay was ok. Leveldesign not so much but i love the dlc. Better then the main story without Atreus.. Santa monica studio teaching other devs how things should be done , and btw : this FREE DLC is longer than the COD MW3 campaign .. A DLC that promised very little (a reflective journey), but delivered everything (a homage to kratos’ story). It’s a fun DLC that brings back a lot of the fun,“ragy” combat from the greek saga, while convincingly taking Kratos on a journey to find in himself the type of God he wants to be.. As a fan of the Greece games, this DLC is without doubt the most engaging, emotional, thoughtful, beautiful, and incredible DLC I have ever played. It truly explores Kratos, while delivering an incredible gameplay loop that’s addictive as hell.. Just as this year for gaming couldn't get any better, we're surprised with a roguelike DLC for God of War Ragnarok to wrap the year up strong. I really have no complaints. The combat is just as fun as in the main game, the difficulty is accessible for newcomers and vets alike, and the story is unraveled at a brisk pace between runs. Maybe the old saying is true after all; the best things in life really are free.. An unexpected DLC never thought we'd get one but here we are god of war Valhalla dlc is one of the best dlc I have ever played and it’s for free , a blast from the past where kratos goes back to old times while travelling into Valhalla where he faces his past the combat is still fun as always with rogue like mechanics which makes it both fun and challenging it’s honestly shocking how games charge money for very basic extra content while Santa Monica created an amazing dlc fitting the name god of war and for free it is a must play for sure and you have no excuse since it’s FREE!. This DLC is a love letter to fans, with many surprises, with an incredible soundtrack, Valhalla did not disappoint. As a cyclic single-session gameplay, roguelike alone isn't sufficient as the sole gaming experience. However, introducing a roguelike mode after the endgame is a wise choice. It allows the reuse of previously encountered gameplay elements and resources, enhancing the overall player experience. This DLC adeptly leverages this aspect, while the addition of new monsters, combat mechanics, and storyline enriches the gameplay and lore, making it a worthwhile experience.. I don't believe that Sony and santa monica drop this fantastic dlc for free!. A love letter for GOD OF WAR FANS There’s some moment i realize how this MUCH of content is absolutely for FREE!. Absolutely wonderful it's remind me God Of War OG i love U santa monica this is should be going to be masterclass.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GoWR Valhalla DLC is so good i can’tbelieve it’s free SMS really did agreat work , everyone should give a chance. Amazing, liked it even more than the main story ;) replaying the old games is just such a good idea. Phew, what can I say - this DLC is everything a god of war fan could ask for .. and so much more! endless new challenges, INSANE story moments, incredible new gameplay variety and even rewards you can carry over to new game+ ! It's very clear what Sony Santa Monica meant when they were saying that this DLC is a gift to all the fans - it'sthey biggest gift they could ever make! Especially if you also liked the original games, prepare to sit in front of your tv awestruck and speechless. This is the pinnacle of god of war games!. The best DLC in the history of gaming. Everything is integrated. I cannot find enough words to describe the addition. It is a new epic. Even with this DLC, This game is still a steaming pile of garbage. When I heard about this DLC having ""endless replayability"" it's pretty clear that these developers read my Ragnarok review. What replayability? I beat the roguelike mode, now what? The prompt at the end mentions something about challenges and there being ""no end"". Are you freaking kidding me? That's the replay value? That's not good enough for me. We're not in the PS2 era anymore to count challenges as replayability, it's 2023 for goodness sake. Multiplayer is what replay value should be. Sony Santa Monica literally proved my point, they are too greedy and lazy to add multiplayer. Returnal and GoT (also by Sony) at least added co-op, so what's the excuse? Even Volition had co-op for the Saints Row reboot. That's embarrassing. This just proves Sony Santa Monica are greedy and lazy cheapskates. ● It's obvious why there's been so many roguelike games lately, and that's because it's a cheap and lazy way to make a short campaign longer. I bet this ""Free DLC"" is just Sony testing the waters to see if people would be interested in short roguelike campaigns for $70. This roguelike mode is boring and repetitive. The greedy developers were too lazy to improve the horrible physics. The camera is still too close. It's pathetic that a Hot Wheels game got a jump ability before the over-the-shoulder GOW games, all because these devs think the lack of a jump ability suddenly makes the game arty farty. SM2 and AW2 made the anti-woke crowd aware of Sweet Baby Inc. That is undeniable proof GOWR was woke. Are you Millennial conservatives still going to deny it? And then these people wonder why games go woke. It's because they end up accepting it anyway, but I digress. Ultimately, this DLC being free does not satisfy me when I spent $70 on this garbage and it's still half the game. ● As I mentioned earlier, there is still no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $70 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. It's funny how that GOW voice actor made a joke about his acceptance speech being longer than COD MWIII's campaign. If it wasn't for that COD money, Kratos voice actor wouldn't be in the Game Awards making that joke. He would be outside of a corner store begging for money, because aside from the fact that his acting career has been a complete failure after Stargate, Sony used that COD money to fund their AAA arty farty movie games. Why do you think Jim Ryan panicked when Microsoft bought Activision, to the point that it led to his ""retirement""? Why do you think that Playstation showcase was lacking in AAA first party titles? Exactly. You want to know what the problem is Sony? Lack of multiplayer. If you had actually put the effort to add online in your games, you'd have enough money for more AAA games. But no, you insist on wasting so much money on one-and-done trash. I don't recommend this game at all.. SI QUIERESVER UN JUEGODD VERDADDENTRO DE UN DLC, VALHALLAES TODO LO QUE BUSCÁSL, PERO QUE PEDAZO DE JUEGO SE HA MANDADO SANTA MÓNICA, SIMPLEMENTE MAGISTRAL, NO HAY PALABRAS PARA LO QUE ESTOY VIVIENDO CON ESTE JUEGOL, SANTA MÓNICA NO TE MERECEMOS, GRACIASPOR TANTO Y NOSOTROSPOR TAN POCO QUE OFRECERTE.. Amazing, liked it even more than the main story ;) replaying the old games is just such a good idea. A love letter to OG god of war fans and also something for the new ones. Amazing gameplay loop with new and fun mechanics to delve back in the god of war saga. A fantastic epilogue to Ragnaroks story and Kratos past. One of the best soundtracks of ALL TIME. Fans of the God of war franchise are in for something special. Thank you Santa Monica Studios !. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This DLC had an amazing story and plot, Especially considering that it’s free. The combat was really good, and the roguelite features were a brilliant addition.",god of war adds more lore and gives new comers tastes of the story from Greece . combat is bland and boring... gets repetitive and predictible rather quickly . the fact that the tone of the game became serious is a good thing .
615.Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Fun and unique metroidvania with unque style and flair. lacks a lot of the backtracking with new abilities, is generally more linear, but still tons of fun.. Music, art style, weird but funny story make Guacamelee! entirely fun to play.. A very bad game. The developers make the whole game easy and only at certain stages does the game become incredibly difficult. And this difficulty lies in the constant jerking off of the same episode, because the developers gave a very narrow range of errors. You spend hours to work it out and any pleasure from the plot, from the design, from the mechanics dies. There remains only disappointment and reluctance after the passage will ever return to this game.. Very fun challenge with a regular learning curve and challenge levels. The story is fun, and there are a lot of humorous parts that make the game a satisfying experience.. Guacamelee is a very stylish 2D metroidvania. Juan the (very muscly) agave farmer has his girlfriend kidnapped by Calaca, a skeleton from the world of the dead. After being summarily dispatched by the sombrero-wearing skeleton, Juan finds himself in the world of the dead. There he gets a mask that allows him to return to the world of the living as a luchador (Mexican wrestler) and fight back against Calaca and his henchmen. This game is steeped in Mexican tropes and terrible food-based puns. Almost everything in the game is a pun, and the whole thing is wrapped in a very irreverent air. There are silly little screens that pop up before boss fights to announce who is fighting who, the character(s) make silly poses when they get new powers, your helpful wise old man guide is a goat, and one of your important upgrade powers is the ability to turn into a chicken. Yes, it is a rather silly game. Overall, the core gameplay is pretty straightforward for a Metroidvania – you have your basic set of attacks, a little trio of punches and kicks, and over the course of the game you gain six additional combat maneuvers, the ability to wall jump, double jump, the ability to turn into a chicken, and the ability to swap between the world of the living and the world of the dead. (And, if you complete an optional sidequest, the ability to fly in chicken form at the very end of the game) Sometimes enemies are surrounded by a colored aura which protects them from harm, and if you want to hurt them, you have to use the proper move on them. You have to use your abilities to break some colored stones to access new areas, as well as some secrets. And of course, you use your new movement powers (including a couple of combat maneuvers) to access new areas over the course of the game. It’s all pretty standard fare, and honestly, the game isn’t particularly innovative in any way mechanically. Honestly, the enemies aren’t particularly remarkable either; there’s not a huge number of them, and not a great variety in them, either. Fortunately, the game is pretty short, so before it would become tedious, it’s all over, and you’ve beaten it. Just going through the game would take you five or six hours, and 100%ing it takes about nine – and the game would outstay its welcome if it was any longer than that, so that’s a good thing. The whole game is just… done competently. It’s nothing particularly remarkable, but the style of the game works quite well, the game is silly enough without trying too hard to be lulzy, the game looks good visually, the overall core gameplay is solid enough, and it avoids the trap of being overly long. If there is a flaw to this game, it is that it doesn’t really wow the audience in any way – if you’ve played Metroidvanias, you’ve basically played this game, and there are certainly better ones than this. But on the other hand, this is well-paced and a nicely sized experience, and it is probably above average overall within the genre – it doesn’t do anything remarkable, but what is there is done well. In the end, I give it a thumbs up. It’s worth playing if you like Metroidvanias, and it’s small enough that it ends before you’re tired of it.. Guacamelee! Its Guacamelee! A 2D action-platformer game inspired on Mexican traditions and folklore. The game is full of action, adventure, puzzles and more. It can become a challenge for those who like me do not use a driver, which is recommended right from the start. Graphically the game is very colorful and ""cartoonish"". The game also has a very interesting and fun soundtrack at good old mexican mariachi style. Very fun experience that I fully recommend. Here is small YouTube vide with the first minutes of the gameplay if you wanna check it out: ****/NK-auTVPnuM. OK, this game is hard. The first boss fight (X 'tabay or however you spell it) is not too hard once you learn the patterns. The second fight (flame face) was too easy and I first-attempted it. There are various sections of the game with gruelling horrible platforming sections that do not require much skill but patience. They are a cheap shot at making the game harder. You will find yourself clutching various buttons on your controller (or keyboard) at once, then messing up and pressing the wrong buttons. Breathe deep during these sections to reduce the risk of a panic attack... Once you finally beat these sections you feel rewarded... for about 30 seconds, then you are faced with another horrible section (ugghhhhhhhh). The third boss (Jaguar Javier) is SO FREEEKIN HARD. The game goes from -meh kinda medium difficulty- to -HAHAHA ALL THAT WAS JUST A TROLL NOW WE ARE GONNA GIVE YOU A BOSS WHICH YOU WILL ONLY GET 2 HITS ON BEFORE YOU DIE- diffuculty. All his attacks are fire so you cannot dodge them. He constantly gives himself shields which you neede to press some kind of combination which you are so likely to mess up, then he gets a hit on you. The annoying part is that you have a delay from being hit to getting back up again (which means as soon as you get back up again he sends you back down. OK, enough of the cons. Aside from what I just mentioned the game is preeeeety cool. The open maps are fun to explore and the metroidvanian exploration, backtracking, opening new areas and exploring them is all a blast. Also the art style is cartoony and cool. I like it. Let's talk about the core of the game: the combat. It is polished and satisfying to whack skeletons and throw them aginst the roof, reducing them to a mere pile of bones. The El infierno stage of the game adds an extra challenge for completionists to unlock all of the characters. The storyline is not the strongest point of the game, it is a cliche story of an ordinary guy who becomes a superhero to save the world from monsters, except this time, it's set in Mexico. ¡Oh si! Burritos! The Soundtrack is catchy and fun, and the game is an (sorta) good time (apart from what i mentioned before...) By the way, don't try to play this with a keyboard, you will spend half an hour just re-mapping the atrocious controls, only to make them a tiny bit less atrocious. Verdict: This game is cool, but only get it if you are a fan of rock hard difficult games. If you are a fan of super metroid, try this game out. After all, it is metroidvania. For me however, what i hope to see in the future is an easy mode. Thank you for your time reading this long review.. Guacamelee is a love letter to the Metroidvania genre, in the form of a super-powered romp through the world of Mexican folklore. You are Juan Aguacate, a destitute agave farmer who finds his village under attack by the undead army of Carlos Calaca. The love of his life, who happens to be the daughter of el presidente, has been kidnapped. What is Juan to do? Why, acquire a magic lucha mask and go on a non-linear platforming adventure, get powerups from ""choozo"" statues, power-slam bad guys, find secrets and navigate rather tricky jumping puzzles, of course. Guacamelee oozes style from beginning to end, with a colorful palette, excellent music and a well-used light/dark world mechanic, requiring the player to frequently switch Juan between the living world and the Mexican land of the dead via portals, often in mid-jump. But the game is inconsistent in difficulty. The combat is generally managable and the boss fights are quite simply awesome, but some of the jumping puzzles are incredibly frustrating. In addition, to reach the game's golden ending, it is neccessary to obtain a number of secret items, some of which are located at the end of some fiendishly difficult challenge rooms, many of which, like the trick jump room with its accursed disappearing platforms, I was unable to complete, and this left a bad taste in my mouth. The final boss is also quite difficult, requiring you to demonstrate a mastery over all the abilities you have learned over the course of the game, but when I had finished, I was very satisfied despite not getting the best ending. I would recommend the game to any fans of Metroidvania, but with caution- it is not a forgiving experience.. The harmonious blend of platforming and fighting mechanics is absolutely brilliant and unique. Special combos and abilities are expertly introduced and keep the experience fresh and enticing throughout ; These amphibious game-play mechanics means that most of the special moves and combos used in combat articulate with the platforming elements to form an ultra-fluid action experience ; Brilliant. The controls are ultra-responsive and are a joy to interact with. The pacing is superb and the levels are both, clever, challenging and action packed. The audio-visual presentation is both lovely and immersive. Simply put, this is one of the most ingenious and brilliant platforming experience to grace this medium.. Challenging but not unfair gameplay, exploration, funny story, lovely animations, absolute wonderfull soundtrack, really nice graphics that fit the style with a love to detail, coop-mode huge-ass boss-fights fair save-points upgradable move-list cool coustumes (with stats!) backtracking with value, and funny dialogue. Some ""meme"" and forced in internet-humor is kinda out of place, others fit in very great.. Guacamelee! Gold Edition is an absolute joy to play. With its great Mexican atmosphere, great story, great animation and great and smooth combat, Drinkbox Studios made a great Mexican game with great melee combat! Guacamelee has some of the best atmosphere environment/scenery I have ever seen, with its transition from the living world, to the living of the dead like in Mexican tradition, to its great Mexican music, it really made me happy how much the atmosphere was put together well! The story is great and really made me happy seeing the comedy written in the story, as well as the great cultural references and game references like Castle Crashers and the troll face, it really made me smile and laugh The animation reminds me of the classical Disney and DreamWorks animations like Aladdin (from Walt Disney Animation) and The Road To El Dorado (from DreamWorks SKG) and many other great classical animations. The combat is smooth and very satisfying, reminds me like I am playing Dust: An Elysian Tale which also has great and smooth combat The only thing I was not really happy with is that the game is best played with an XBOX controller which I don't have and the controls especially on the keyboard are really awkward at first, but after getting used to them you will easily play through with the game, plus I did not enjoy the shift in difficulty, first the game is fun and enjoyable, next it is frustrating and you have to keep on retrying which kind of put me off, also I was dissapointed that as I heard the Main Storyline is really short (round about 6 hours) which I was surprised, but if you do finish all of the side quests the game should finish between 13-15 hours BUT with all of its greatness and some problems, you HAVE to, not should, you HAVE to get this game, sadly there is no Multiplayer Co-op but only offers Local Co-op Oh! Also, after 2 hours or so into the game... you get to play a chicken! OMG NEXT-GEN!!! What's next!?! Moving fish!?!. This game is fun, but gets boring and repetitive PROS -Neat Graphics -Plenty to explore -Fun combat CONS -Weak story -Gets repetitive -Levels are very long. I kill the first boss, I get rewards and the stuff, the game sends me automatically back to the hub and I decide to stop here for this time. I was surprised the next launch that I had to do the whole **** again, what kind of game does not autosave after the end of a boss ?! 0/10 would not play again.. It's a pretty good game. But it is a little short and the camera is very stressful. The controllers are also good with X box 360 controller not rec pc. One of the few good 2d Metroid-style games available on PC, although it's melee-based (if you couldn't tell by the title) instead of shooting. Good: Combat is fun with all the combos you can pull off. Game is full of humor and video game references. Bad: Has some really frustrating jumping puzzles where the game seems to turn from Metroid into Super Meat Boy. Certain bosses are really tough in comparison to the rest of the game's difficulty.. Rating ""Guacamelee! Gold edition"" a 0 because of the cheap final boss. The game was being good until then, which feels so much more disappointing.. A great platformer and, like Rayman Legends, another one that achieves the feeling of being a living cartoon. You guide your Luchador (a man at first, but you quickly get the option to swap your protagonist for a female Luchadora) on a quest to rescue the president's daughter. It's one huge interconnected map of 2.5D environments, branching via the doors at right angles to the plane of play. It's got a delightful aesthetic, and I can't think of any other game that looks quite like it. There's a lot of humour, and it's a cheerful and colourful game whose very darkest moments are several shades lighter than Scooby Doo. I should warn you that it's quite challenging. Customers who are used to easy games, or struggle with accurate timing, could have trouble here. Then again, maybe Guacamelee will train you and turn you into a seasoned platforming expert! If I had to choose between recommending this or Rayman Legends (the two best platform games of 2013) then without question I would pick Rayman Legends, but you should certainly play Guacamelee too.. PROS: +A solid and original theming, Wrestler versus Mexican folklore +A very fun game: Castlevania with wrestling combos +Combos are actually challenging to pull off +Puzzle segments are very well made +Good atmosphere, music and characters CONS: -Replayability could be made a tad better: there's basically just a couple of side quests that I personally didn't even care for that much, and looking for the pieces of mask to unlock the alternate ending which doesn't take a lot of time given that you know the locations -Those stupid. References. EVERYWHERE. PLEASE STOP IT WITH THIS TREND, IT ISN'T FUNNY AND IT'S BASICALLY FISHING FOR THE APPROVAL OF IMMATURE PEOPLE AND WITHOUT EFFORT EVEN. The first thing you notice about this game is it's charming art style and charming theme, but that all soon gets buried under repetitive, shallow combat and controls that fight you. It is linear as linear can be, the side quests are a joke as you really aren't convinced to do them at all. The main story was honestly really dull as well and seldom keeps you interested enough to actually play it further. I hated the controls, and what is supposed to be the meat of the game, which was the combat, was done poorly. I think this game is an opportunity missed, and it's a damn shame.. This is the best game of it's general type i have played in ages. It's good mix between fast paced combat and clever platforming challenges. Combat: This is the real heart of the game. Your move set is a little like Captain Falcon from Super Smash Brothers, and you get to have a lot of fun knocking enemies into the air, setting up the best combos, interrupts, dodges, etc. It gets a little frantic and can be frustrating in parts because you can't just mash through, you have to pay attention to enemy attacks and work proactively. The difficulty does get quite high, especially if you are playing hard mode and going through some of the optional content. There are many 'arenas' as part of the regular gameplay where you walk into a room and the walls close and you have to fight through several waves of enemies to progress. These increase steadily in difficulty, and later ones you will probably die at least once to learn the tricks you need to progress. However, it is pretty fair about death: you only have to restart the waves. Platforming: Really standout, you have a pretty intuitive and familiar set of abilities that you can use platforming, but many of the puzzles are very clever, especially some of the challenging optional content. The platforming elements reminded me very much of Metroid Zero Mission, especially some of the optional parts. The difficulty for each section can get quite high, but is never insurmountable especially since there is very little punishment for failure (usually just restarting the section you are on). There are cute retro game references, the music is really pretty fun, and I grew to really like the graphics (I wasn't really into the subject matter and it won me over). It is probably a little racist (I was mildly offended by some of the Mexican stereotypes) and really quite sexist (you are saving a damsel in distress, the main female villain's motivation is that she is jealous and short tempered) but it didn't really hamper my enjoyment of the game. The plot is secondary to the amazing gameplay, it's just a shame. This is still the 2d game I have enjoyed the most in at least a decade, it's also the first steam game I got every achievement for. Even after having a perfect hard mode file, I still come back to play it because I find it so enjoyable.. Seriously annoying jumping challenges combined with phase switching. Very similar to the new Giana Sisters. It wasn't funny then and this is equally boring. To bad that they mess up an otherwise ok game with crap like that.. This game is amazing. The music and art style are both captivating. They work together well to create an unforgettable and unique experience. The platforming at many stages is downright genius in that it will not only make you think, but often allow you to piece together a platforming solution on the fly. It is an intense experience that is not hindered by difficulty. It's corny and humorous at times, which gives the game a personality all it's own. The game is downright charming. This game also does not forget its roots and knows it's fan-base. It has plenty of Easter eggs that pertain to it's inspirations, which will only add more flavor and appeal to those that like this kind of game. A must have for anyone who likes fun.. The graphics are great, the art style is original, and the music is pretty good. Provided you're using a gamepad, the game is fluid and responsive. The writing is funny and the dialogue is clever. However, all of this is a smokescreen. By the time you get to the endgame, the difficulty cranks up to hateful levels, unfairly changing established rules and making mandatory level segments near impossible for the average gamer. Any ""professional reviewer"" who gave this game high marks obviously didn't make it past the first hour of gameplay, when things were still fairly manageable. You could charitably call this a Metroidvania-style game, but the big difference is that those titles' designers knew how to properly scale difficulty. I got so frustrated with Guacamelee that I simply deleted the game entirely without finishing it. My only regret is wasting a few hours of my life to get that far in the first place -- thankfully I didn't pay actual money for it.. Played: Feb 2014 Pros: + Very comfortable controls that allow you to move intuitively (with controller) + Interesting visual style Cons: - Feels very short - Some enemies get very stale by the end - Story starts promising and ends nonsensical This game bills itself as a “metroidvania” type platformer, and let’s face it: it pretty much is. Some areas are inaccessible until the correct special movement is unlocked, but ultimately there aren’t that many special moves, so many areas are open to you right from the start. You play as a luchador, so there won’t be any weapons to find, either; the few additional moves you can get in the game are all grapples (a move you can complete when smallish enemies have taken enough damage). The low number of moves contributes to the short feel of the game (probably about 8 hours for the first play-though), but man are they satisfying! Throwing a damaged enemy through a whole crowd of others and sending them flying like bowling pins should bring a grin to anybody who picks up this game. On the other hand, there are only a few enemy types, and late-game difficulty increase consists largely of forcing you to take on more of them and introducing some unblockable types (read: fire-based attacks). As you get good, you’ll find that you can destroy many enemie types in 1-2 seconds, which is good, because otherwise you’d get really bored fighting the same 8-10 monsters. The story starts out feeling epic, but pretty quickly you find you’re actually just rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser again. The boss minions of the main enemy have very crudely sketched reasons for working with him, nor is it ever clear just why your girlfriend was abducted in the first place. Furthermore, the devil is introduced as a character, then plays essentially zero role. Why introduce a pointless character you might ask? Maybe because the developers just wanted to… in any case this is not a game you should play because it “features elements of hispanic culture”-you won’t pick up any traditional lore at all. Overall, the game is pretty darn good, and very memorable in some parts. You may find that you’ll get replay out of it if you go in for additional modes unlocked at the end of a run, but I’d try to get it for less than $10 if possible.. Guacamelee represents all that is good in indie games. It has excellent references, looks phenomenal, and has one of the funnest game play models I've seen in an indie game since Castle Crashers. Definitely worth the play. I've had more fun with this than I've had with some of the recent AAA titles that have been released in recent years.. It's a good action platforming game. Lots of charisma. Not laugh out loud funny but the mood of the game and of the characters are humorous. HOWEVER, it is extremely difficult. The platforming is the most difficult parts. I can't play this game for extended periods of time without getting frustrated. In fact, I am not even sure I am enjoying myself because the platforming levels can be so difficult. But with that being said I recognize that this is a good game and if you want that challenge then this is the game for you.. Love it! Shadow Complex meets Super Meat Boy. Illustrations and Colors are perfect, might be the best looking 2D game in a long time. If you find the combat or bosses in this game difficult, perhaps you need to train more at the 2D gym with the rooster.. which I did... then I dominated. Like SMB, there's going to be some Extra levels (outside of the game story) that will make you lose your mind. The only thing that sorta' pissed me off were the precise timing of moves (for extra levels) that don't necessarily work perfectly with an analog controller, but with repetition is doable.. Amazing platformer with a very polished atmosphere. The learning curve is well balanced, however, the game becomes pretty hard at the end. Personally, I think that in the past few years Guacamelee! is the best in its category. You should not miss it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Guacamelee is simply the best platformer I've played in quite a while. The graphics, sounds, and soundtrack are spot on for the world. Generally I'm not a huge platromer but I found this one immensely fun in all the classic sort of ways. The bosses were just challenging enough with being a pain and the combat is very satisfying with good feedback to the user. The only thing that would have been nice for the PC version would have been re-bindable keys for those who don't own controllers, cause if you don't... you might end up hating this game.. Guacamelee! Gold Edition, is arguably the best of the many modern metroidvania games released recently. While other modern metroidvanias tend to favour combat and RPG elements, Guacamelee instead focuses on providing satisfying, yet interesting and puzzle-like combat, along with many thought-provoking platforming puzzle sections. It's clear that Drinkbox know their game mechanics, and most puzzles and combat scenarios are perfectly designed around use of the many game mechanics, an example of one being dimension switching, a mechanic which is used to great effect throughout the game. If Guacamelee does have flaws, though, it has to come with the obnoxious internet memes, the length of the game (clocks in at, like, 7 hours), and the fact that opinions on the game are easily subjective.. such a great game i enjoyed this game so much great gameplay great music and great graphics it is actually perfect i played it without the Gamepad and i didn't encounter any problems a great classic game. Guacamelee is a well-made game that gets boring quickly. Despite gaining new abilities frequently, combat feels repetitive. Mandatory dialog is frequent and sometimes funny, but also got old quick. I bought the game because I love metroidvanias, but it feels more like a fighting game. There is a lot to like here, but it just didn't hold together for me.. Guacemelee is a very well made and gamed 2d platform. The game is very amazing. The graphics for a 2d platform standard are good. The levels are challenging and fun. Nothing more to say. A good game anyways.. An absolutely amazing Metroidvania platformer. It has extremely rewarding and challenging platforming elements, a really innovative beat-em-up combat style, and a really interesting integration of combat abilities with platforming challenges and Metroidvania-style locks. Also the music, art, and luchador theme are hilarious and wonderful. I loved this game.. The game looks fun. Average side scrolling. Music is nice, graphic is good, story is ok. Playing with keyboard is little hard. To much keys to press. Controller is highly recommended. Price is ok. Nothing more to add.. Great game. Great music. Great graphics. Great gameplay and powerup-level design. If you are good at Metroid or Super Metroid, you should play this game. But DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A GAMEPAD.. Do not buy this game if you are looking to have fun. The story is atrocious. The graphics are cute but nothing special. The music is god awful throughout the entire game. The controls ARE TERRIBLE if you are looking to play without a controller dont even touch.. Game starts out nicely, but eventually reveals some frustrating flaws. It demands absolute precision from the player, but is pretty sloppy with its own hit boxes and timings. Boss characters are given massive amounts of invulnerability frames, which aren't indicated in any way, that you're forced to learn by trial and error. Conversely, you can be damaged at any time, even during special moves when your character is just a blur, which is maddeningly counter intuitive. Many people are reporting they never get past the final boss, which leaves little incentive for me to play the final quarter of the game. This is a punishing game for 15 year-olds who have the time to play it as obsessively as it demands. I used to have that sort of patience, but now I realized games are supposed to ****. On the plus side, it has amazing style and a great sense of exploration. Really unique stuff. But with all these rave reviews, I thought someone really needed to chime in with a reality check.. Great game, even though it's a bit short, and doesn't offer much replay value, apart from a ""hard difficulty"" mode. But if you're looking for a metroidvania game, starring a Mexican wrestler with great music (Rom Di Prisco) and atmosphere, look no further. Combat is fun, challenging but never unfair, controls are decent and the level design keeps it interesting till the end, with increasingly difficult puzzles and platforming.. Guacamelee combines a huge swath of the best game mechanics ever devised, stuffs them into a barbacoa burrito and will punch off your head with such velocity that the blood will rocket from your neck and propel your lifeless body all the way to Phoenix. No really, it's Cartoon Sushi of the best of everything. Metroid, Zelda, Earthworm Jim, Castlevania, Smash Bro's, Portal, Gunstar Heroes and countless more inspiring titles; there are so many great classics represented here in the most genius subtle tamale pie bake of all their fine elements, I'm left speechless. Yet, it's completely fresh and unique and adds to that cadre with its own twists. It's unbelievably addictive and so much deeper than I ever would've guessed. Quick list of amazing traits. Art Gorgeous. Samauri Jack meets Nacho Libre. You have to simply experience it. The visual cues are perfect. GamePlay Breakneck and satisfying. I can't say more without spoiling it. Attention to detail is thicker than molasses. It takes some skill but jaw dropping things will result. Story Classic. Few games can pull off this simple story, hit a grand slam and do it with style to spare. Imagine Zelda Mario Portal Earthworm Jim Okami all smashed together. Sound You want 5.1 surround. Crank it. Bring Tequila. Control The depth, speed and responsiveness are so well done the only problem I found was remembering how much beat unmerciful you have at your disposal. Definitely my favorite aspect. Overall Great wholesome, scream-at-your-screen-in-ecstatic-frustration-because-you-were-so-friggen-close FUN. This would've been an instant 90's classic giving the likes Sonic and Crash a run for their money. Also, co-op, though I haven't had a chance to experience how insane that must be. The only con I have found is it leaves you wanting more. However, replay-ability, yup it's got that. I would wager a bet this would be a smash at parties w/ co-op. There are a lot of good side-scrollers coming out these days. This is one of the best. Absolute 10/10. Timeraider's Review Time: Dust 2d sideview platformer/massive fighting Gamplay: 9/10 Graphics: 8.5/10 Performance: 8.5/10 Problems/bugs/glitches: 8/10 Storyline: 9/10 Emotional attachment/ general immersion: 10/10 General score: 9/10 Additional comments: I am usually not the guy to play sideview fighters, especially chaotic ones. However this game it deserves everything. The graphics are great and fit the gameplay.. not to detailed and slightly cartoony, while maintaining the resolution and graphical advancements found in the newer games. The gameplay is great it has nice performance on even weak PC's and the game just feels very smooth. Pressing 30 buttons per second will happen, but it wont show even the slightest microstutter on the screen.. its all fluid and smooth. The storyline is very immersive (ive heard people actually pinked away a tear and i myself felt touched at some moments to so far) and the game keeps you in a tight lock im known for never finishing games, which is a trait alot of gamers suffer from. However since ive started playng this game im stuck to the screen and will certainly finish this (will be my third pc game ive ever finished in the last 8 years (others were Trine 2 and.. Star Wars Battlefront 2 i believe)... This was my short recommendation. If you want a full review.. sorry but i dont do those.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is really fun. Just g",the developers gave a very narrow range of errors . the game is steeped in Mexican tropes and terrible food-based puns . the core gameplay is pretty straightforward for a metroidvania .
616.Monster Hunter Rise,"For my first Monster Hunter game, I had a blast. Yes, it did make me rage at times, and yes, it took me a while to learn the combat and get used to the movement—but that's the fun of it! This game is splendid indeed!. I got this from Game pass for free because of all the positive reviews, but never had I played any of Monster Hunter games brfore. I couldn’t get past the few hours. I kinda think jrpgs are not for me. Is it really that scary to create a new attack moveset??god**** same attack animation since the stone age,game felt dull because its like playing a dlc from their last game(too similiar),and for some reason my switch oled became really hot when playing like the machine being overworked,lame and not innovative too scared to try something new. good game but no surprise I like Monster Hunter franchise so I was enjoyed this game but if you have never played MH, this game is too hard and complex to play. This game is very overrated i regret playing it The combat is so bad and im surprised that its score is 88. As a series veteran, I'm not a big fan of excessive rope use in Monster Hunter.. Monsters are too hard, terrible game balance. Movement is sluggish and attacks are monotonous. The sharpness gauge is a hindrance. Weapons are too weak.. It's a more casual feel with a lighter hand and a little more ease. It feels a little more Japanese.. This is the first Monster Hunter game I've played. Sometimes I'd pretend the monster I was hunting was someone I know in real life, like my insufferable aunt (and her big butt) running away after starting a fight. That made the game way more entertaining.. Story is weird and pretty empty. The controls are clunky, slow and actively works against intuitive movements. I'm amazed at some of the critic reviews because they must've been on something. This game plays like a barely AA MMORPG with a souls-like stamina bar. A combination I wouldn't even wish on Elon Musk.. Generally like the game, Find it pretty unique and i really love the theme of kamura. Like the wirebugs at first but finds it really bland sometimes as it is too dependent of a mechanics but it is still fun though. Graphics is not its strong suit but its feasible enough. As usual for a monster hunter game there is tons of monsters and thats where its meat is. Combat is fun but traversal is makes the map feels small because of the wirebugs. Overall a great game with a few shortcomings.. I haven't played a lot of Monster Hunter games, I only played Monster Hunter World before Rise, so a lot of things are new to me, like the tower defense style battles and the idea of having a cat and a dog to help you. I've played the whole main story and the DLC. The game has a great amount of monsters, big and small. MH Rise make you feel rewarded by exploring the map before you kill or capture a monster, to keep gatherin some resources with an explorer cat companion, or even fight against every monster in the map with a fighter or trapper cat. The gameplay is fluid throughout the game, I got no frame drops and the graphics are quite good. You can combine different skills for the same weapon and change the way you play the game. At the end of the game you get a parchment that you can use to store two lists of attacks that you can personalize (like in fighting games when you switch from boxing to Muay Thai during the fight). I definitely recommend the game to the people who know how Monster Hunter works, for people who never played any Monster Hunter before, I don't think this game is better for learning compared to Monster Hunter World.. Great game, with great graphics considering that it runs natively on switch. The story is good, maybe not the best, but it is still a monster hunter, you have to fight the monsters, and the aforementioned fights, considering also the most recent skills are considerably appreciable. Horrible time waster. I just finished Wild Hearts and it is a masterpiece when compared to this. This game drove me crazy after around 20 hours and Im never touching it again. Here is a list of things that completely ruins these games. - Monsters have so much HP that you waste at least 30 minutes every time you have to hunt on down. Really in **** hp is multiplied by 2.2 so have fun. - You spam the same attacks forever there is hardly any point of even making different weapon choices. It gets so boring. There is not even really a weak points and if the monster drops some part it is definitely not shown the monster continues as is and looks exactly the same. - You are forced to eat and to sharpen you weapon constantly. Otherwise out of stamina and your weapon does no damage. So this makes the fights even longer and way more irritating. - The co-op gameplay is so freaking stupid. Calling people to play co-op is tedious and starting missions with them is super idiotic. It is so counter intuitive that there is not a person in the world who did not read instructions to figure this thing out. - You cannot upgrade your weapons and therefor there is no way to speed up the fights in the beginning so have fun doing the same freaking fights 20 hours straight. Yes beginning phase takes ages.. Great game... Many options to play as... Recommended. immense world. Fun and entertaining. What can I say... It's a brilliant game with beautifully difficult fights and a very addictive factor. It even performs very well with the Kintendo switch, I've already played 2576 hours, so I can say that it's a very successful game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played it, I liked it. It runs and looks like a dream on the switch. I think it is a great game. (version 1.0.0). Not my favorite iteration of Monster Hunter but still pretty fun. Combat is mostly about using your wirebugs. Performance is okay. Overall a very solid game.. Monster Hunter Rise on the Nintendo Switch is an absolute triumph, delivering an exhilarating and immersive hunting experience. The game's stunning graphics and smooth performance showcase the power of the Switch, bringing the vibrant world of monsters to life. The gameplay is addictive and rewarding, with an extensive array of weapons and armor to master. The introduction of Wirebug mechanics adds a new dimension to combat, allowing for thrilling aerial maneuvers and strategic attacks.. The menus are horrid and physically anger me trying to navigate them. They are some of the most arbitrary and least intuitive menus i have ever seen in a game. The most simplest things have become the most arduous tasks. Also depending on the weapon you use, the exact same move can be swapped to different buttons which drives me crazy. It's a core skill too; like if Mario and Luigi used different buttons to jump. The story and world from MHW doesn't exist. This is similar to old iterations of MH. The wirebug is neat and rampages are boring.. I really enjoyed the new game mechanics and I hope to see similar elements in the next generation. However, the game can be a bit repetitive at times. I believe it's definitely worth playing for fans of the series and newcomers alike.. It's a fresh monster hunter with new mechanics that make it faster phased and exciting, but it also makes the game easier. Added siege mode is also not as exciting as you think, it loses the feel of how strong each monster suppose to be. All in all, it's a very good and polished game.. I have been a huge Monster Hunter fan for about 8 years now and was expecting another experience like the previous game Monster Hunter World but was pleasantly surprised by far more than that. The game is far more fleshed out in terms of Gameplay, Replayability, and Mechanics than all of the MH games combined. I'm not gonna spoil anything but all of these things combined makes it a blast for veterans and newcomers alike which is a first for the franchise. Would recommend at full price but you would be a fool to pass this game up if it goes on sale.. Monster Hunter Rise Wow this game is so much fun I have around 100 hours on the game and I still can’t stop but there are some problems in the game Pros: -The music is next level -The gameplay and the movement is just addicting I cant stop using the wire bugs and riding the palamute -The map design is superb and the fact that everything around the map such as beetles and bugs are all so useful for your hunt just shows how far the team went in terms of making the player travel more around and looking everywhere to find all kinds of secrets and power ups -The weapons are similar to the way they were in world but so much better the devs just took the weapons and made them so much better plus you can change your skills and the wire bug skills are just wow -The new monsters are super cool I really liked the whole yokai design -The armors look fantastic and real as if they were really made by the monsters you hunt -The new rampage mode had me worried at first but I got hooked I found myself just doing the rampage missions non stop The new armor skills they added and the whole re work they did in comparison to world is just superb Cons: -Although good the gameplay is clunky at some moments -the game is beautiful but the switch is still a very weak console and I sometimes found myself in a cave or near a lot of monsters and the fps drops just made me want to turn the game off -the lack of end game because of the pandemic is just awful again I know that the team is not at fault here and they are releasing the missing content at the end of April but the game as Is right now is missing a lot of monsters and an ending to the hub story plus the village story just feels weak and short in conclusion the game although lacking at some areas is such a fun experience even after I finished my build and every mission in the game I still want to come back and play more so my final score to monster hunter rise is a 9 out of 10 I really recommend this game for veterans and new comers alike. Monster Hunter Rise is a perfectly serviceable entry in a franchise that I have found so frustratingly and obstinately resistant to change. Mechanically, it performs quite well, and will likely provide tons of enjoyment to anyone who was already a fan of the series. However, after becoming quite fatigued by MH: World, Rise was not enough of a shift for me to find this game enjoyable. I found the combat and movement rather clunky, and the quality-of-life additions seem too few for my tastes. Rise is just as obtuse as its predecessors. I believe there is a great deal for people to love here, but I personally found the game frustrating after only a short time.. Haven't tried other MH games but it is a really good game for the new hunters. Could be a bit more overewhelming with all the weapons at the first beginning, but super fun if you really pick one of your favourite and get into it. Well worthed the time and price!. An excellent Switch-Game! Very good graphics and performance, much to do and a solid Multiplayer-Experience. Unfortunately too many Monsters from MHW included, feels therefore a lot like a Spin-Off, imo. However, for a Switch-Game it's still a 10. Like it better than World and might be equal to MHGU for me. My first MH game is MHGU and that's where my love for this franchise exist and grow. Then, I enter MHW but somehow it feels like a complete different game. Spent 30ish hours and still cannot get the feel of Monster Hunter in MHW. Then, I decides to enter MHR right away and it just feels like home for me. Definitely they get back to the traditional formula but with QoL from World and it's just delicious. The combat especially is just wonderful, everything feels way faster and I love the adrenaline from the fast combat due to the addition of wire bugs (Insane!). The graphics is great to be honest remembering it being released for Switch and I never feel there's any important or significant compromises that can affect how you view the game. If you compare it to MHW, you are just nitpicking. Monster Hunter is always about gameplay, graphics is just a bonus for me. One thing that I just can't put this on top of GU is because the fact that you only have 1 village, Kamura. In GU you have 4 villages, well not big but it just feels nice as every village has a different theme and feel to it. On top of that, the amount of content in MHR probably only around 30-40% of MHGU. I spent around 70 hours in MHR and basically I finish all the missions (excluding Event, Rampage and Arena Quests). In GU, I've spent 135 hours and just barely play a little content of High Rank. Yes, I've just entered High Rank after 135 hours in the game. Last, one epic moment in Rise is when the OST of Proof of a Hero kicks in when fighting against Narwa and Ibushi make me feels invincible and aggressive all of sudden. Completely brilliant composer. Overall it's a great MH game and I prefer this one over MHW. Will definitely purchase Sunbreak when its on sale (too expensive on Switch).. Very good game, the best of his genre and one of best game for switch, Good grafics, good battle system.. must play god game.......................................................!!!. The game can be very daunting at first while trying to understand the multiple mechanics and weapons that are available from the start. However, after understanding the basics you can enjoy a well-crafted game.. my first monster hunter game ever. Great series with solid gameplay design. No wonder why Capcom dominates action game genre for years. Storytelling are below average line though. Wish they could work more on that in future releases.. For people who are with Monster Hunter seriws longer time it's common knowledge Capcom always releases each title in pretty much two waves. Base game which focuses and experiments with various new features and mechanics followed by expansion (ultimate version) which builds on the base game eliminating major flaws while outlining the best aspects of the base game. Therefore, I'll judge it in this fashion as ""just a base game"". And oh boy. This game truly delivers one of the best base game experiences. I'd say only 4th generation (Monster Hunter 4 and Monster Hunter X/Generations) had more memorable base game experience imho. Truly great base to build upon and fully recommended to try out on Switch as one of the best games on the system.. Cant play the game on steam deck outside home cause you put denuvo in all of your games, plus the slutter it causes..... The most refined monster hunter experience. This game took everything that world did right and just made the combat more fast pace, the hunting quicker with the addition of mounts, and made it all available on the most portable console. This game is a must for switch owners and monster hunter fans. This is probably the best monster hunter experience outside of iceborne. Definitely recommend this.. this game is flawless al the gameplay is very huge with so many good things to do. Monster Hunter Rise is such a great game with awesome graphics and music. They did a great job with presenting some new and older monsters. The vibe the game gives us is humongous. I don't know how is it in co-op since I played it solo, but I love the gameplay, the grind and the weapon differences. I played mostly with switch axe, hammer and great sword mostly and the only reason I stopped playing this was that I had other games to play as well. However, I will play it more, someday, especially that Sunbreak DLC came out. I loved the character creation options as well as the diversity of the armours. I poured my whole heart into the looks of my female character called Aileen!. Rise takes the best aspects of its predecessors builds upon them in the best way possible. The fluidity of the wirebugs adds mobility while the same heft is still felt behind each weapon. Not to mention there are new ""switch skills"" that add more variety to each of the already extremely varied (and all viable) 14 weapon types. This is the first MH game I've played where I can't decide which weapon to main as they're all great! The rampage mode is a nice change of pace and the wyvern riding is a significant upgrade from the previous mounting feature. Also the dango cutscenes are cute as heck. *2022 update: rampage get boring after a while, knocking off a point. I wanted to like this game. On paper this would seem to be what I want. Action RPG where you go fight monsters and gear up to go on the next hunting expedition. Lot's of systems to dig into and work on. Instead what I found was an action game with some on the most cumbersome controls I've ever experienced, with barely any explanation of how to use the weapon appropriately. Every system in the game, from crafting and upgrading weapons, to training up your Palicoes and Palamutes, to just connecting with players for a hunt, is all just needlessly complicated. I went and watched hours of Youtube videos to try and parse all of this, finding out that there are tons of weapon moves that are never explained in the game, different scores on your Palicoes that you want to aim for, and levels of minutiae that would only be appealing to an accountant. Even the fastest weapon in the game feels unbelievably slow and clunky to play. Trying to chain combos to do anything just has such weird timing that you feel like you get trapped in an animation loop. Then you're just dodging around the monster waiting for it to reach the point in its cycle where you can actually do something. Everything about the game just feels like it's from an older era of games that I'm happy to leave behind. I understand people love these games, and had I experienced them back in the day maybe I'd feel similarly, but the sheer amount of effort necessary to get to passable with this just feels off. Overcoming the monster should feel like a triumph, but instead I just feel like I've finished some kind of obnoxious homework assignment. I don't hate the game, but it is not something I'm going to spend any more time on, especially with so many other great games available at the moment. For anyone thinking of picking this up I would highly suggest checking out some of the videos or the demo before buying, as the reviews don't really dig into the mountain you're trying to climb with this.. it's monster hunter, its all about monster hunting, to me this game is the true Masterpiece!. Absolutely great, every monster is intricately designed. And the cats are awesome.. Gore is BACK! what more do you ask for?? Weapon balance + Engaging monsters + new weapon moves + 2 new zones + new town EASILY 200 Hours + game time. Let's go. The combat is better than world, but lost the amazing graphics and world design of its predecessor which brought life to the game.. It's ok i guess... looks nice but getting repetitive very fast and after a while there's not much to do.. Monster hunter rise is one of those games that even after you have done literally everything, you still want to play it. This happens with very few games to me, but rises core gameplay and qol changes are absolute godsends and really push the limit of what this series can do. It has flaws yes, but is vastly outnumber by its strengths. Play my rise, it's so worth your time. Happily waiting for sunbreak. OHHHHHH my god this games is amazing, If you don't know this type of game, let's go it's a big pleasure.. I don't understand why this game has so many positive reviews. I am not a huge monster hunter fan, but I played the PSP games and MH World and Rise feels like a significant step back in every category. After playing for almost 20 hours, I have not finished the village quests and honestly, I don't want to, now let me tell you why: Firstly, the music. Sweet mother of god please I am begging you to include a soundtrack comprised of more than 30-second sound bytes that repeat endlessly for hours. The first thing I did, before even going on a hunt, was turn the music off completely. +1 for it being an option to turn that crap off, still not enough to make you a good game Secondly, the story. It May as well not be there, but no surprise there, it's monster hunter after all. Thirdly, the gameplay. **** genitals. Who in their right mind at Capcom thought it was a good idea to put out an action game like this WITHOUT A LOCK ON MECHANIC?! Its gotta be one of the most frustrating things in the world when you combine it with the fact that the hitboxes are inconsistent, clunky, and frankly make no sense. Critical hits seem to be random, sometimes they hit for 10 damage, sometimes 3, sometimes 1, sometimes it's like I hit a f'ing wall and am also a long-term alcoholic because I stumble for far too long before recovering. Additionally, the button delay. Screw you, you're not FromSoftware, you will not be able to make that fun in your game so please stop. The new mechanics the game advertises as a selling point are neat, but feel like something that would have been cool five years ago. Now that I think about it, thats a really good way to describe this game: ""Would have been cool five years ago"". What's that Capcom? I can essentially double jump and wall run? No way! It's like my balls dropped all over again! Whats that another time? I can ride a mount? Like a horse? Oh, not a horse? A mini horse? like a pony? Oh, you call it a palamute, totally a new mechanic. Perhaps I'm being a little too hard on the palamute, but then I remember he doesn't f'ing show up 90% of the time you hold down the button that's supposed to summon him. Again, I've been summoning mounts in games for over a decade, WTF? Lastly is just a general question: ""why the hell do I care?"". This game has no purpose. None at all. You drop into an, admittedly, very pretty hub, get some barebones information that doesn't make enough sense for it to be worth hearing, and then you proceed to do the same handful of tasks until you can't take it anymore and move on to a real game. Not to mention every design choice in this game is focused on frustrating the ever-living crap out of you and slowing you down. There's another review out there where someone mentions that ""it's not harder, just more annoying"", and man is that true. The game is painfully easy, and at the same time painfully frustrating. Everything mentioned before combined with the fact that it's the same stuff you're doing over and over again just makes the experience painfully frustrating. Like I said, im almost 20 hours in and I just feel like giving up after HR4 because whats the point? The starter armor they gave me is far better than anything I can craft (not to mention, if I wanted to craft it I would have to grind slaying the same monster I already killed endlessly), so the whole point of the game (crafting cool armor sets) seems superfluous. Thank god I bought this used, I am truly sorry for anybody who paid full price for what could ultimately be a mobile port of a once-great franchise. Play MH World, leave this on the shelf, it's not worth it.. Several hours in. Already with the price tag at 50% OFF + Fun fights + immersive world - fights feel a bit more boring than I remember it. Maybe difficulty and grandioseness of the game scales later -/+ more mechanics than I’m using now which is fine because it allows for both hardcore and beginner players to hop on. I just can’t help but feel there’s better ways to do what I do.. Most entertaining and streamlined MH yet. I adore this formula (with MHW a near-tie) and look forward to the next series addition!. My absolute favorite game series and another banger added to the list of fantastic monster hunter titles. If you're a fan of action games and want a game to play with friends(or meet new ones) look no further as MONSTER HUNTER allows you to shred massive creatures to pieces and carve their @$$ up to make a fresh new coat and bigger stick to smack with.. One point off for stupid AI design of small monsters. One point off for treating weapons with shields so unfairly (not including sword & shield). One point off for dividing the original game into three parts and advertising two of them as “free updates”. Taking 3 points off a 12/10 game, I give this game a 9 out of 10.. This is my first Monster Hunter and dang was it nice. Loved the portable nature of this with all the quality of life changes. I also enjoy the quicker nature of this one compared to other Monster Hunter titles. I have now went back and played World and missed many things from Rise. So many weapons to master and yet the weapons are deep and require many hours to master. This game continues to draw my attention long after the credits have rolled.. OHHHHHH my god this games is amazing, If you don't know this type of game, let's go it's a big pleasure.. Kill monsters, carve their bodies, make armor and weapons from the parts, repeat. The game play loop sounds simple but capcom has really refined the formula down. For first timers dont be discouraged as Monster Hunter made my head spin personally when I was playing my first one so don't be afraid of searching the internet for tips. There is a bit of a learning curve but once you are on the race track you are good to go.. Got 400 hours in this game, abd with the upcoming G-Rank expantion that number will go up to AT LEAST 1000! I honestly think rise is the most FUN game of the series, not the best one or the most challenging, just fun. Flying around with the wirebugs is such a nice change of pace and the best single gimmick of any MH game IMO. the endgame is lacking, but i would be lying if i said that world's was any better, and at least it isnt al tedious and just straight up boring tempered monsters. The story is not very good, but no MH game has a good story since it is not the focus in the slightest. One of the best things about your MH is his goofyness and i was very sad to see it almost completely removed from the previous game in the series. The roaster is EXCELLENT, a lot of monster types and some of the best creature designs ever seen in the franchise makes any hunt different from the other! You will fight bird wyverns, elder dragons, flying wyverns, leviathans, fanged wyverns, fanged beasts, temnocerans and many more. Overall i have a few gripes with the game, like the complete failure that are solo rampages, and the lack **** endgame, but would not vote it any lower nor any higher than this. 9/10 would hunt again. I've put 165 hours into this game and I can definitivley say it is best Switch multiplayer game. While I am a little biased because of my love for boss fights from any video game, this was my introduction into the franchise, which in turn has made me play the previous games in the series. What makes Rise stand out among it's predecessors, mainly 4 Ultimate and World, is it's wirebug system. No longer are you an immobile piece of brocolli with the insane manuevurability of the wirebug. It acts as an enhanced combo tool allowing special moves for each of the 14 wildly different weapons, while serving as a extremley fun grappling hook like device for you to swing around from wall to wall. My biggest gripes with the previous games in the franchise is the movement. The key to make a fun 3-D game is movement, with the massive verticality the various stages provide for the player mixing tremendously well with the enhanced movement options, even further emphasized with the edition of a Palamute, an adorable ridable dog (who is endlessly customizable) to assist you on hunts much like the Palico, but with an emphasis on speed. Throughout gameplay I was frequently switching between the 2 depending on the hunt and weapon. Gameplay is where any series shines the most and monster hunter has perfected since 4U. The 14 weapons each play so different from each other it's staggering how they snappy, tight, and powerful each one feels. Hunter customization is the bulk of what's going to keep you going to fight new monsters, enhancing your armor and skills to max out your arsenal using the monster's parts you receive from carving it against more monsters. I never found it boring going back with friends to slay a monster for one specific part because each of these barborous beasts fight so differently with such creative movesets, and jaw-dropping designs. The flagship Magnamalo is my particular favorite from this game's amazing rouge's gallery, with Narwa following closely, a much better line-up than World's cast that left so much more variety to be desired. Must-play for the Switch, has a perfect difficulty curve but if you're not feeling it I promise it's because you're not playing the right weapon.. It's ok i guess... looks nice but getting repetitive very fast and after a while there's not much to do.. With a better storytelling, general difficult and end game this game was a full 9, but for a MH lover it miss some points.. 87/100 I'm a new player of the Monster Hunter series and this game is incredibly addictive. Extremely recommended. I played MH4 on the ds and some demos on the wii u but never had good internet connection nor a good plataform to play it on. Now that MH has eliminated the separation by areas i can say i finally get the game and is realy good. This would be a 10/10 game of the year over Shin Megami Tensei V buuuut, it has +100 dlc, and the tutorials are HO-rrible, besides that, buy this game now. FAILED TO SAVE PC date release 12 janv and he dont work ... 80 $ CA wow gg capcom. Failed to Save - Can't even reach titlescreen. It's been a week with no updates from Crapcom. Definition of 0/10. Amazing graphics for such a small console, Portable mode looks very nice. The game itself is interesting and does not tire the player with its difficulty level.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After the huge success of the previous entry in the series (MHW), Rise was set up to be the best game the series has seen with a massive speed boost and streamlining of the features that drew players to World. Despite this, I'll admit I was kinda disappointed and overall it isn't something I'll consider playing again in a while- I'll split the review into separate parts to understand. Presentation- When I first saw the textures on the environments I was overall sceptical due to the very apparent downgrade to the graphics and while I can accept the theory that this is due to 'hardware limitations', I simply cannot agree due to the games put out with much higher image quality before Rise was even announced. On the positive spectrum, however, it is appreciable that the Monsters still look as scary as always. Difficulty- many players were preaching about the inherent ease of the entry but I decided to ignore it and come to my own conclusion. So is it easy? Yes, and it's not for the better. Why are these giant creatures so ridiculously pathetic in the face of literally any weapon? I confronted this game solo and most beasts just provided 20-minute speed bumps that would just make me feel kind of bored. I think I only really had minor issues with were Teostra and Chameleos (end game challenges if you're wondering). The weapon you choose will really change your outlook on the game, I ran Charge Blade and was swiftly able to master the inputs to create stronger attacks and that was considered the most confusing weapon? Eh? Sound design- as someone who doesn't listen to videogame music; it was alright but it could've been better. (Also just something I thought was funny was the fact that you can set the town's theme to one of a monster's occasionally surprising people when they enter your lobby). My main gripe here is that I wish you could choose to toggle warnings of attacks, it just becomes annoying rather than helpful but when I used it, it felt like cheating in an already simple game so I ended up just playing with the sound of and then having my laptop play the theme to me in the background. Enjoyability- while in some points it created tedium, the ease allowed for a fun social activity which I would play on subse","the combat is so bad and im surprised that its score is 88 . the game plays like a barely AA MMORPG with a souls-like stamina bar . Generally like the game, Find it pretty unique and unique ."
617.ESPN NHL 2K5,"A marvel answer to sport games or games in general.A game starts with a feeling,yes a feeling you have then it evolves to what is happening within the game.Game play,graphics,replay **** true, but when you get the chills from a game like when you first fell in love then you know you have a gem in front of you,a diamond.A game that is so authentic of the sport of hockey that it will be in your xbox 2 generations of consoles from then.Xbox 360 then 720,whatever but you will remember what made you fall in love with the game of hockey,fan or **** you not people,BRILLIANCE!",hockey is one of the most authentic games on the xbox 2 generation of consoles . the game is so authentic of the sport that it will be in your xbox 2 generations of consoles from then .
618.Counter-Strike: Source,"I like it. FPS graphics are so good for its date. But not enough for today. 8/10 gameplay,9/10 graphics, AND 1000/10 servers and mods.. A solid modernization of classic 1.6. However, the slightly altered mechanics, like recoil and hitboxes, didn’t quite capture the precision I appreciated in 1.6.. this game was so awesome i love it more than cod 4 and world at war if i'm being fully honest. Skipping school and playing countless hours. Child and highschool memories, our national game. 10/10 gameplay 9/10 graphics 9/10 environments. Still playing this game after almost 20 years. I grow up with it and I still enjoy it daily. The best Counter Strike version so far.. In a word, it's great, both the game of my childhood and a unique game that still maintains its quality. Source is a special game for me, I can say that it is the best game of the counter series for me, I can say that it is a great experience with zombie escape mode and legendary maps, hours flow like waters and it is never a game to be given up and seen simple. including the player base, the game is solid and high quality that makes the game a game, and I still highly recommend zombie escape modes for the source game, such games do not always come and should be appreciated.. This version of Counter Strike has the same feel as 1.6, but with better physics and graphics. Especially the physics of this game, which is still wonderful. And it is a very fun game. This maybe not the best Counter Strike of the series ( in term of tournaments and competitive ), but still, CSS is very good multiplayer game. Very good graphics (for a 2004 game) and great physics system. You can play with mods, which CSS has many good mods. It's the best way to killing time, then you never get bored lol.. Counter-Strike: Source stands as an impressive successor to the original game, building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. It successfully carried forward the iconic Counter-Strike gameplay while adding improved graphics and physics, enhancing the overall visual and gameplay experience. One notable aspect that set Counter-Strike: Source apart from the original was its initial lack of popularity in the competitive ESports scene. Despite its numerous improvements, the game struggled to gain the same level of love and recognition that the original Counter-Strike enjoyed among professional players and competitive leagues. Perhaps it was the result of established players being reluctant to switch to the newer version, or maybe it took time for the competitive community to fully embrace the changes. Despite these initial challenges, Counter-Strike: Source managed to establish a dedicated player base that kept the game alive and thriving for years. Even to this day, one can easily find servers with active players, allowing enthusiasts to continue enjoying the game's timeless appeal. What makes Counter-Strike: Source endure is its combination of classic gameplay and updated visuals, which struck a chord with many gamers. The familiar mechanics, team-based objectives, and intense firefights remained intact, providing a sense of nostalgia while still delivering an engaging experience. Furthermore, the improvements in graphics and physics were significant, enhancing the overall immersion and making the in-game environment more realistic and dynamic. This added a fresh layer of excitement to the gameplay, as players witnessed the impact of their actions more vividly. Despite its earlier struggles to capture the competitive spotlight, Counter-Strike: Source's enduring player base and continued enjoyment are a testament to its lasting appeal. The game's legacy continues, standing as a worthy entry in the Counter-Strike series and a beloved title for fans of tactical shooters worldwide.. Played as a kid and it is really fun in a casual setting, not really that competitive but it depends on the people you play with.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Great game , i love it so much , good mods , gameplay , online with friends , great. this game is very similar to half life 2, every valve game looks like the other. russians yelling review: story: none characters: none graphics: 9/10 (for the time) detail: 9/10 combat: 8/10 models: 9/10 (for the time) UI: 7/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. nice game very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. This game fun and entertain me. Because easy to play and the best FPS game offline or online at that time.. Source engine was something insane back in the time of release but I still prefered CS 1.6 over this for some reason.. Counter Strike Source is one and the same CS, only the Source engine is used here and the graphics are improved 4 times. Of course, this game is no different from CS 1.6, but the physics, lighting, graphics and textures, shooting are improved here. Suitable for replacing CS GO, it's just a pity that people play little CS Source. this game took best from cs 1.6 with better graphics and it is not such s hi t as cs:go. Few players are just as bored with the time of the game, but it is very incredible personally I enjoyed spending time with this game.. One of that games that you can play for hours and not get bored of. Awesome graphic for its time.. Amazing for 2004. The ""Source"" game engine has been used to the fullest. Especially, the game physics and dynamics are very strong. The weapon handling is realistic and the animations are great. Graphics and effects have jumped compared to previous games. The interface is not very useful. But for a 2004 game, it excels in everything. This game is definitely a legend.. this is a fine game not the best but still grate if allso if you don't want to play it still buy it if your a big gmod fan bc dark rp and others use models from it.. Great game, competitive, looks still good kinda. Custom maps and mods! No smoothing with raw input on. Runs great on high fps! Memes and good memories playing zombie escape maps and having fun on custom servers! This game was so fun and great. It is pity cs go, replaced it. I wish they never made it!. A solid fps experience that feels very tight and precise. A decent experience.. This has been a defining game during my teenage years. With over 1.500 hours played, I think this is the game I've played most of all. The fierce clan matches, the relaxed mod servers, this game had it all.. Sorce was different type in series. it was more difficult but when comparing call of duty, it gives better multiplayerunlike Zero. So I like it. Graphics:7/10 Sounds: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Stabilization: 8/10. Great ""tactical"" first person shooter game. Sometimes fast-paced but mostly slow-paced. Counter-Terrorists versus the Terrorists force. The Terrorists have to plant the bomb and successfully detonate it to win, but the Counter-Terrorists have to defuse it to win. Both forces can also win by killing the full opposing team of five Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Great game with still many people online.. My favorite multiplayer shooting game. Great mechanics and provide a high learning curve for the player. Detailed weapons as well. 8/10. Counter-Strike: Source is a worthy successor of CS 1.6., with very suitable Source engine, and impoved graphics, maps, and gameplay. This game didn't mess up any really important things, and was very good-looking and fun to play game for mid-2000s. Also, this game aged well, and it was cool to play Source even in early 2010s, because graphics are wonderful and gameplay is elegant.. This game would get a higher score IF there were a competitive mode AND a quick-play/casual mode. Other than that, it's a really good game if your laptop/pc can't handle Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.. Counter-Strike: Source is considered to be one of my favorite first-person shooter's in general. In this game, you can play as either the Counter-Terrorists (CTs), or Terrorists (Ts). Some maps will be based on a certain objective: Defuse a bomb (or plant it), or rescue hostages. Like every other Counter-Strike game, you have a ""Buy"" menu in which you can use virtual cash to buy weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, and equipment like grenades and flashbangs. Alright, enough explaining. I'm going to move on to why I enjoy this game. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of the Counter-Strike series. I've put in countless hours of playing it on an old PC, but who cares if the PC is old, because it can still run great games such as this. The gameplay is excellent. The maps/environments are well-detailed, and the graphics are revolutionary for it's time. Audio quality sounds nice. Overall, this game is a must-buy for hardcore gamers out there.. An incredible online shooter where you can really test your skills, with easy to select servers on all kinds of the fun maps to explore and different game modes (Gungame and Deathmatch being personal favorites) are lots of fun. It's traditional but is plenty fun and makes you strive for more kills due to how fun it is to get perfect shots. I wish I could say more, but there isn't much, but I recommend it heavily. Also, better than GO.. This game is really fun and intense to play with i remember playing this game with my friends. It's a test of speed and reaction. Most of maps are really nice and easy-to-learn.. Counter Strike Source is the best CS Game. Awesome graphics for 2005, in CS GO isnt better, good community, in CS GO community is terrible, many different cool things and weapons, in CS GO isnt more, CS Source much better than CS GO, CS GO isnt cool and not deserve has got popular, CS Source is better, but in CS Source there are one minus, this is cheaters.. An iconic multiplayer FPS of the ""oughts"", my most played game between the age of Tribes 2 and that of Team Fortress 2. I would not say it's aged well, but the diversity of mods and occasional quality of life updates have ensured it's lasting playablity.. A lot better than CS: GO, but faces out dated graphics, even at the time. However, if there was one Counter-Strike I would recommend, it would be this.. All time best shooter and most fun PC game ever. What make the game rock is the realism, the dynamism of the matches, the tactics and the graphics. Impact of this game no other PC game has ever caused since then. Remain intact the physics of the original game while adding much better graphics.. I laugh a lot when i see that this **** page says that the ccs is better than the cs go,css better than cs:go JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA. Very good game! Very great graphics for the year of 2004! Valve did go very far with this game, just play it man, if you loved the CS 1.0~1.6 just grab this, its an graphic upgraded cs 1.6 br0, i dind't even play it that much ... ( 1300.00 hours in steam ) Overall, 420/69 would smoke again.. Previously playing CS:GO, I decided to buy the predecessor to see the origins of the game and how it flourished to the caliber it is today. I was greeted with servers that are less likely to share lag spikes with everyone on the server itself, but to individual players with high pings. A ghost town already, there was abusive chat and such that you see in any game open to everyone. The way to cure that is to just ignore chat and turn off voice chat. As the game is a ghost town by the time I write this, it is still quite enjoyable to play on a 24/7 deathmatch server and just muck around with the different guns. Back to it being a ghost town again. Just like CS:GO, the community is wild, unregulated and very salty due to the lack of common people with administrative power (other than server owners).. This shows a very good improvement in Counter Strike, managed to bring a lot of player and required a lot of fun .. Exceptionally good and well crafted online fps game, raked up a total of 180 hours in this highly addictive steam based game. Love the overall combat style in stead of conventional aiming down of sights its hipfire and thus i belive adds more skill in the process of killing the opposition, love the inbuilt bot feature in which you can fire up anytime and get into the quick and fun action of a fully functional and interesting first person shooter. The maps and addition of maps made by the community and the whole range of game modes available from a click of a button is an awesome feature that was integrated into the game to improve the users experience. Overally recommend this game to users who enjoy fast paced, instantanious, warfare.. As of 2012, this game still has a huge online presence and comes with a decent map editor, but those are about the only good things I can say. The community is immature, unintelligent, rude, and very narrow minded as to what a good game or map(level) is. de_dust for life!, and all that... I might come back to play with my friends, but every time quit because this game is too arcade, the maps are small and boring, and there are too many ""WTF"" moments.. *Terrorists kill nearly all counter-terrorists* Bot 1: ""Taking Fire, need assistance!"" Bot 2: ""Hold this position!"" *Everyone is dead except me* *Snipes last terrorist with moving headshot* ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" :D 10/10. I spent hundreds of hours playing this game in College. If I got bored of the regular game mode I always went over to a zombie server or a gungame server. The game had a large variety of maps made by the community, it's hard to get bored of the game.. This game is pretty good. My first cs game. + (Unboxing can be a waste of time or something really good) There is a nice thing called ""CS LAG"". ""CS LAG"" is a random lag spike that stays for a couple of minutes and that is a really bad thing.. They improved pretty much everything from the original and therefore made it better than it already was. Nearly 10 years old and it's still worth buying. 10/10. The pros of this game is that this game is always fun and different, and I have played for 100+ hours and recommend for anyone who likes valve games or fps's. For those who care about graphics and animations might not be too happy with it, but I promise, it is super fun!. THE BEST MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER EVER! Really never had so much fun in an online FPS this is how Multiplayer Shooters should be! Better than CSGO in my opinion. I've had so much fun on this game and have spent hundreds of hours on this game, shifting from gun game, to zombie mods, deathrun, deathmatch, normal team deathmatch, bunnyhop servers, you name it. This game is beyond amazing and is great fun at LAN parties. This is one of my all time favourite games, and even though there are a few problems with it like tick rate on certain servers and stuff like that it's still a solid perfect working game and I love it. I can't believe this game is almost 10 years old. Everything about this game is still impressive even to this day, such as the graphics, sound, engine, the gameplay.... It really shows the work that Valve and Turtle Rock Studios put into this game considering it's still one of the most played games on Steam almost a decade later.. Although the Counter-Strike: Source is so ambitious, it cannot reach its succeed like the Counter-Strike.however, we can see Valve had put a lot of effort to make this game to be **** addition, it is a good game.. A boring, repetitive, multiplayer-only shooter which has spawned a terrible community. The gameplay mechanics are cheap and create a game that just isn't worth your time.. I hated this game so much. I played it for a couple of hours just trying to get use to the bulky and slow controls. Then once I found out how to finally control my character and play the game well I found it to unrealistic and dumb. I read some reviews and some said that the game is very realistic. I shot a guy with 7 rounds from a 9mm he didn't die. Plus not being able to aim down your sights unless you have a sniper rifle. What kinda of fps is this. People say that this game is great for team work and is just a great game overall when I'm constantly being yelled at for not doing good, but then when I learn the stupid controls and actually do amazing I'm called a cheater and still be called names. The community is worse than any other fps I have ever played. The terrible game play does not help either. Your options are move, jump, squat and shoot. What I can't even lay down. I've play iPad games better than this. In all honesty this game is a total piece of crap and is not worth spending your time trying to figure out how it works while being yelled at by your team mates and called some of the worst things and told to go do some very inappropriate stuff. Like blanking my dead father log. Yes I was told to do this by every player in a server, in many different ways. This game should be discontinued.. Although rather frustrating at times due to how unique the hit boxes are with the source engine, I've never had an online game that I play for as long at a time as I do this one. Also a joy to play with friends/other people, as most players online are really cool, laid back people.. Great remake. With so many mods. You never get bored. Drawbacks are the numerous cheaters that ruin public servers and some updates that force it to depend on steam. Other than that an classic what you should definitely have in your valve library.. Admittedly a multiplayer masterpiece, this grand game once again popularized and revolutionized the multiplayer/shooter genre It can feel the same as the first game of the series, but it's still addicting fun. In this game, you can choose to be the counter-terrorist or the terrorist, both of which have their distinct differences. Let's look at the differences: Counter-Terrorists: They distinctly include on their inventory the overly popularized M4AI they also have other exlusive weapons and, to win, they have to defuse the bomb that terrorist planted or they can kill them all. They can be recognized by their clothing, usually wearing a helmet and an armor. Terrorists: They have their awesome AK 47 which is heavily used b players, they also have some exclusive weapons, and they need to plant the bomb to win or to eliminate all their enemies. Although it is fun, for newbies it can be punishingly difficult, being incredibly hard to master. I'm myself average at the game, but I enjoy it. What to say else? This game is fun, addicting and satisfying. I recommend this instead of the disappointing Global Offensive, and you won't regret it. (Final Score: 8.92). One of the most strategic FPS games to date. The fact that you only get one life makes it all the more tactical and less of the usual run and gun. That said it can be quite difficult for beginners to get into this game because of its high difficulty.. Who ever gives this game a low score is a pathetic 8 year old CoD fanboy. This game is awesome, PERIOD. The graphics are amazing for 2004, gameplay is realistic, and requires skill, do not hesitate to try it out!. Still playing, logged in over 2000 hours. Need I say more? Nothing fancy but just a great arcade FPS game. Made many friends on here, had many amazing moments I wouldn't know where to begin.. Buy it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There is not much reason to be playing this after Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released. Everything about it is dated in comparison. Most importantly, there are only two or three servers that play official maps with a ping lower than 100 and with populated matches in my region.. This is a hardcore PC game and thats why I like it its still one of the still truly hardcore games ever and it looks better and is better than the first one so if you have a PC it is one of the best multiplayer games on the PC and there are loads of mods and its still very popular. i love it this takes gamers to the next level it this game takes at least way more skills than cod and day of defeat. the point of making a game great is by having it built for hardcore and they went through way more requirements for that than halo.. Source is incomparably better than classic cs 1.6. It just takes some time to get used to it. Nice graphics, beautiful detailed maps, better physics, excellent gameplay.. I don't think it is the best FPS or even the best CS in the world, but it is certainly a really good mixture of tactical and a simple shooter (at some servers..), but it has a huge bad point. It's community is awful. I mean the noob who says you are cheater because you play great and the pro who says you are a noob when you play not so well... And the swearing in chat and in microphone almost every minute is really annoying. If you didn't play with any of the older CS games, you should try it out.... but 1.6 is better.... Without any doubt the best multiplayer team game I have ever played. CSS is a fun and awsome game where you must work with your team to win. There are a lot of weapons to buy, the maps are all great and uniqe, and i definetley recommend this game to all who like team based shooters.. Bad ass. This game seem to be pretty simple plant the bomb and wait until it explodes. However, there is plenty of factors which are putting this game on 1st place in multiplayer co-op genre. Skill, speed and team-play, that's what is all about. Definitely a LEADER in entire franchise of shooting experience. Titles like Call of Duty are way way behind this game. I would give 9.5, but giving it 10 will not be a sin.. Fun game to play when you're bored. The community does ****, but there are always servers that will be fun to play on with good communities. There is a very steep learning curve, so it will be hard for newcomers at this time because a lot of current CS:S players are veterans with at least a couple years of CS:S under their belt.. If you think Call of Duty is competitive don't even bother buying this game. This is for the die hard FPS fans. Huge learning curve. It will take a long time to hone your skills. This game is timeless and one of the most intense shooters ever released.. I really liked the transistion from the uncomparable 1.6 to Source; although there is a certain amount of problems: i bought this game to have fun, even though it was already 23 seconds in to the game and i had already been killed. This game is purely for professionals and hardcore gamers, and my only regret was that i bought the game, everybody was pro in it and they wouldn't give a chance to ""n00bs"".. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is by far, one of my personal favorite games of all time. I have over 700 hours invested into this, which to some people is not that much at all, but it gives me the room to talk and have a respected review. First things first, as I read from another review, if you want to get better at aiming and being good at other first person shooters, this is the game for you. A personal experience of mine is that all my friends wonder how I can aim with ease and not miss as much as they would. Well this is the game that taught me. Now there's an updated version of this game that even has stricter aiming rules and everything is absolutely inaccurate when moving, but that's another story. This game provides your normal commodities such as the regular game types that you'd expect, in fact I believe it's safe to say that a lot of game types that you see now such as surf, gun game, and zombie mod (Zombies), could have been deprived from this game. But if you're up for a shooter that actually requires more skill then to hold down the Mouse 1 button, this is the game for you. Give it a try, it's cheap, and it's worth the buy. Cheers. if source i dont know you play in steam or what because i just play a bot but i like a weapon first because its amazing and almost hard to kill but i like the headshot 1 shot 1 kil still interesting source in steam i dont know still good game. I honestly believe that this game owes its success to its simplicity! tha fact that you don't have to spend a lot of hours to upgrade weapons like other shooter games, but you decide to join either counter terrorists or terrorists forces and have fun with other people on-line makes me vote no less than 9/10! Excellent game!. Obviously this game's graphics are out dated. Obviously this game's player base is full of pros. Hell, even I only started playing in 2010. However this game is a diamond in the rough for both casual and hardcore gamers. People complain that good players constantly dominate them. And yes, yes they do. Like myself, new players will always need to rise up and play, play, play to reach the point of these 'pros'. To begin, there is no penalty for loosing. There are no leader boards, there are no K/Ds. In failure, you might get some angry words thrown your way, but this is inevitable in a PC community. Nonetheless, you don't even need to start in a 'Reg' or 'Scrim' server. There are a handful of mods to play, like Minigames, JailBreak, DeathRun, Zombie Escape, Napalm, ZRiot, Bunnyhop, Surf, and more. In the midst of having fun while playing these gametypes, you will find your skills gradually climb upwards. This game defines fun in my eyes, sprouting a huge player base and community to fuel it. New players are actually very welcome, and it's just time to beat, not other players. Definitely a game to recommend to anyone looking to divulge into PC gaming.. This game is terrible,a simply pure bad game,headshot headshot headshot hackers everywhere,walk to a corner,i got headshotted again,the only reason to buy it is the jailbreak mode and the zombie mode,also the gmod textures. this game is great fun to play because it gives you full customisation of your character, weapons and teams and this game also adds in textures for other games such as Garry's mod and many people might disagree with this but it is great for beginners because you also have your teammates their to help you if you aren't doing to well. Stay away from this game ... it will eat your social life like it's nothing. Some may argue that CS 1.6 is better, but to men, this is the purest and ultimate form of Counter Strike ... endless pleasure of headshots .... An ultimate shooter. How you play is dependent *entirely* on your technique! The maps are small enough to offer dynamic, quick engagement, yet still have multiple ways to get to the objective. The Source engine provides great lightning effects and realistic physics. On top of all that, the game can be modded to no end - skins, maps, gameplay type... There's a steep learning curve in the online community, however - but once you've mastered your weapon of choice, the K/D ratio will look pleasant.. I purchased this game about 3 weeks ago. I can for sure say that it is a fun, action-packed FPS. However, there is a much larger emphasis on staying alive than in a COD Free For All or a COD Team Deathmatch, which makes it much more hardcore. Note: these people have been playing it for years. I have spent over 50 hours on the game and I do not even compare to the experts (I can barely break even K/D ratio). CS:GO is a more noob friendly game (albeit not as friendly as something like COD or TF2). Also, CS does not have Free for all mode, so it isn't as chaotic as a small FFA map with 30 players on COD, however GunGame (Arms Race in CS:GO) becomes chaotic as there is no respawn time-- IMO very fun. Honestly I think CSS is better than CS:GO, but it is really personal preference (I think COD fans would like GO better).. Valve has delivered Pure fun. Get your mates. Move your computers to your basement, Install CS Source and play. It´s such a great game! Custom modes are awesome and well made aswell as graphics and physics. It´s a must buy for all shooter fans!. I can't say that it's much better than cs 1.6 , but it's real fun, and if you are new at it or just, want to be better without playing with others, you can play with bots, that is great.. For a title that had massive boots to fill, it sits proudly ontop of the original. The basic gameplay is faithfully recreated with no new quirks or features weighing it down. The game itself fits well into the beautifully designed Source engine. There's nothing new apart from the graphic overhaul, and that's all the fans surely wanted. Well done Valve.. Allright, this comes from a HC Gamer i have bunch of bucnh of games on steam etc im only PC gamer. Yes you see 4/10. One of my first games was cs 1.6 on PC like when i was 8--10 years old. This game is so HC and unforgiving and hard :S! Really way too bad crosshairs etc i dont like it at all. Im tired of many FPS's these days already like BF3. But this is just too HC. Only thing is that with mods or maps it can be fun :)! ze, zm, surf, jb(NotForMe) are good fun ways to chill :)! ze being my favourite and its fun. But normal CSS? Too HC, you need to be crazy player if u want to succeed.. Counter Strike: Source is a very over rated game. It holds nothing special from any other shooter. The only reason I play it is because of surf. The game play is so repetitive and gets boring very quickly. I played it a lot and thought it was fun at first, but after a while it just got boring. There is nothing special to it. The mods are so much more fun than the actual vanilla game. Idiots play the zombie game mode. It's completely unfit for a zombie game mode. Garry's Mod is much better suited for it or an actual ZOMBIE GAME. Jail break is fun, but it gets repetitive. I don't see what's so fun about this game. The only fun parts are created by the users. Without the users, this game would be nothing. There would be hardly any maps, no other game modes, ect. The shotgun is over-powered as hell. It's ridiculous how much damage it does with distance. You can be 20 ft. away from someone and it only takes one shot to kill you at full health. This game is decent at best.. This is an amazing game. The weapons are all real, the maps are detailed, the graphics look good even though they are pretty old. Its easy to learn and its fun to think up weapon combos to fight with. For example, Dual pistols and super shotgun. There is roughly 40-ish weapons in the game. The lack of content is a bit sad. Its shorter than portal, and it has very little single player value.. Amazing game and lots of fun but if you have little or moderate experience with shooters be warned. I have played this game on and off for years, used to be in a bunch of clans which added to the fun. Especially doing scrims against other clans. I would not recommend for the faint of heart due to its competitiveness and the fact that you will get killed alot if your reflexes/hand eye coordination is average.. A fantastic game, anyone who doesn't own it must check it out. There is a large learning curve and many people online are fantastic players. There isn't much room for new players, so get a few friends to get it at the same time.. Still the most effective time waster and the easiest multiplayer experience ever. -1 for incomplete global ranking system. Hopefully CSGO will have the promised global leaderboard done right - and hopefully, just hopefully there will be cross platform gameplay in the future.. Absolutely an amazing game, hardcore and fast-paced, your heart will be rushing as you play on one of these fantastically made maps, plus you have tons of different types of game modes, you have things like Jailbreak, mini games, hide and seek, and many more! I recommend this game to anyone who wants a game where you will be able to hang out with a semi-mature community playing some fantastic games.. Counter Strike Source is epic in many ways, and It's better than the original. It is bloody, fun and strategic (sometimes). Gameplay is extremely fun, graphics are great, but sound effects are mediocre (I know this game is a remake of the original Counter Strike, but they would work more about the sound). So, everything upgraded, except sound. But, anyway, this game is a bla",the best Counter-Strike: Source so far is a special game for me . i can say that it is the best game of the counter series for me . the game is solid and high quality that makes the game a game .
619.Fire Emblem,"This game is a masterpiece in every single sense of the word. It presents a story that stars perfectly simple and lighthearted so you can know the characters and relate to them, and then it becomes much more serious but without being dull or boring, its a great narrative, with great characters and villains. The gameplay s also pretty great, is fun challenging without being unfair.. Out of all the RPGs on the Game Boy Advance, Fire Emblem stands out as easily the best. With an excellent story, great cast of characters and beautiful combat animations, everything about this masterpiece is brilliant.. A classic SRPG with amazing characters, excellent story, good map desing and an incredibly fun gameplay. Easily one of the best GBA of all time.. Played this for the first time on switch online and I wished I had started playing it sooner , it is such a good game and definitely one of if not the best Gameboy games. This game is up there among my favorite Fire Emblem games. The classic GBA sprite art is wonderful, the music is amazing, the story is solid, likable cast of characters, and solid difficulty throughout if you're just playing on Normal Mode. I am aware that Hector Hard Mode is a bit overly brutal, but that is a completely optional mode of play. I will say one gripe I have with this game is that the determinations for getting either alternate versions of levels or gaiden chapters is very arbitrary and, without a guide, you would have zero idea how to get certain gaiden chapters and level variants. I won't knock the score because of this though since you can go through the game without knowing these things and it likely will not hinder your experience. It's definitely no secret as to why this game got a lot of people into Fire Emblem pre-Awakening.. Even though i had started this game a couple of time it wasn't until this year that i actually completed it and i have to say that i was missing out on a great game. It is a bit easier than other games in the franchise but still was a lot of fun. The characters are great and the story is one of the bests. Hector is the highlight of the game to me, stll i love lyn and eliwood too. The music, very similar to FE6, is very good and the sad moments in the story were even sadder thanks to the soundtrack. Also this game has a lot of replayability thanks to Hector mode and Hard mode. Fire Emblem (or FE7 as it's also known) was my introduction to the series post Super Smash Bros Melee, and the game is a classic that will hold up decades to come. It has the best story out of any handheld FE game, aside from maybe Awakening. The cast of characters are all useful, and brimming with personality. Careful planning is the name of the game, as one wrong decision can be life or death for your unit/units. The music will remain iconic to this day. It is, bar none, one of the greatest Game Boy Advance games ever.. I like the sprite animation. For me it is the base line for a Fire emblem game that I will enjoy and look forward to replay.. Turn-based strategy set in a fantasy world of swords and dragons that's a little shallow and repetitive compared to the mighty Advance Wars, but still has enough going for it to please fans of the genre.. I love this game, the first time i played this game was like, this game seems boring and repetitive, but the fact that your characters can die, it gives some vibes of survival, the first fire emblem game to was published in america, is very cool and fun, simple, and the characters are memorable, the graphics are also cool, I so good, seriously.. The best installment of the saga in GBA, a story that has a cast of the best characters of the saga. One of the best games of its generation. Pd: I hate the tutorial. In my opinion this is easily the greatest game for the system by far and one of the best games ever. I put 1000+ hours into it since 2004 and no end in sight. Presentation, replay value, gameplay, strategical depth is top notch. The story, soundtrack and graphics are nothing than epic. Today this is a true classic SRPG, and a must have for any GBA owner.. The first American release of a Fire Emblem game aka ""blazing blade"" in Japan was and still is a phenomenal handheld strategy game. zippity bibbity. This is the best original RPG on GBA. The story is interesting. The gameplay starts simple, but builds the player into a tactical thinker. The presentation also looks phenomenal. Fire Emblem is well known for the series' character animations, and this game holds up. It looks amazing on the original hardware, and even better blown up on modern screens in an emulator.. Being the first Fire Emblem game to be localized outside Japan, it hits the right notes with its challenging tactical RPG elements, likable characters, and just about enough story density to justify its length, if the static & emotionless talking heads don’t do it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game introduced me into the Fire Emblem world - and I'm grateful for that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my favorite strategy and roll game, as soon as it starts to play I got stuck to it, this game can not miss. Easily one of my favorite games ever. Great plot, great design, great visuals, amazing characters, just barely hard enough, all on GBA.. a really good Fire Emblem game but it has a bad habit of being useless enemies at you. A terrific entry point for the Western audience with captivating characters, branching storyline and stylistic animation.. This was my gateway into Fire Emblem, similar to most American gamers I would imagine. This is a great title, and is a really solid strategy game (especially compared to the easy garbage/waifu simulator that Fire Emblem is now). The game has two points it drives home to emphasize the strategic aspects, the first being if a unit dies, they cannot be used again for the duration of the game. They will still appear in cutscenes and plot points, but they are out of commission as far as combat is concerned. The second point is that there is no grinding. You cannot sit and level up every unit, you have to decide which units are worth leveling up and taking to the end, and which ones are not going to be used, as trying to level up everyone along the way will lead you to have an under-performing squad. The art and characters are really well done. The sprites are gorgeous and never get dull to look at. The combat and map design are very solid, and actually encourage some thought to it. Different game play modes available, such as difficulty settings or main character choice in a second play through provide multiple opportunities to enjoy and replay the scenarios. This is what Fire Emblem should aspire to be again.. This is extremely close to perfection. The turn-based gameplay is sharp and ruthlessly difficult. I love the perma-death because it causes you to become more attached to the characters because you know that they can die. This also causes you to try to be the smartest you can because otherwise, you're losing somebody. Strategy games are my favorite game genre, and Fire Emblem the best. Each character is extremely well crafted because they are simultaneously interesting and provide unique strategical advantages.. Excellent strategy game for the Gameboy Advance, an absolute blast to play! maybe my favorite game in the system. Engaging story, memorable characters, catchy soundtrack and fun game-play! Fire Emblem GBA ( A.K.A Blazing Sword ) remains a timeless classic. The absolute best GBA game to date.. Fire Emblem is one of the greatest tactical RPG franchises of all time, and this is one of the best Fire Emblem Games. The story is great, all of the characters are awesome, and the classic Fire Emblem strategy is on full display.. I've played this game just after finishing Awakening and it shows. The characters are all fun and the story is nothing special but here are my 2 bigger complains 1: no support. In FE awakening, I really liked the support system, which is absent in this one 2: The difficulty. I really **** at video games, so I prefered Awakening's choice to turn permadeath on or off. If you like hard games, this one is for you. Amazing strategy game with a great story. Perfect difficulty, it's not too easy or too hard for the average player. This game is in my opinion the best one of the fire emblem series, mainly because of the intruiging story.. Everyone needs to play this game. It wil help you with your life probably. With this game i learned about thinking multiple ways. Now whatever i do i will think more than 1 way easily. BEST RPG SO FAR. A true masterpiece! Really irritating to lose your characters, but that just makes you treasure your characters more and forces you not to make stupid decisions. One of the best gba games ever! Characters are well developed plot is great and music is awesome. Definetly get it.. Yes i am playing in 2014, It's a really fun game, really irritating to lose your characters, but that just makes you treasure your characters more and forces you not to make stupid decisions. So fun, great music. Turn base similar to Pokemon with a but more, but very fun overall and addictive 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I wanted to like this game more, but it gets too long to get started with an endless tutorial trough multiple missions. Characters are not well developed like the Consoles games and few strategic tools, basically just move and attack/heal... still lots of content after the first playtrough if you want to dive into.. Astonishingly good, entertaining, challenging and long game for GBA. FE was unlike anything I played on the handheld so far and most of strategic games for GBA pale in comparison (maybe except Advanced Wars 2).. What a great classic. Story is engaging, characters are very memorable. Very addicting turn based strategy that **** out 35 hours of my life in a weekend!. Really good. I'm not going to say this is the best fire emblem of the lot because after playing this after Sacred Stones,I just prefer Sacred Stones in most aspects.Still a great game though.. Best GBA RPG I've ever played. Sorry Pokémon, but you can't match the characters and the story.. Fire Emblem is easily one of the greatest titles ever created for the Gameboy Advance. This game is a turn-by-turn tactical RPG featuring dozens of unique characters to choose from. Gameplay is simple to understand and its user interface and help system makes it easy to approach, yet it provides great challenges of just the right difficulty. Players will fall in love with this game's diverse cast of characters, each with their own background story to unravel. Because it is not possible to fully mature every character and reveal each of their side stories in a single playthrough, several plays will be necessary to achieve full completion, resulting in unrivaled replay value. Exceptional gameplay added to a deep, rich story, and met with beautiful art and music Fire Emblem a true masterpiece of entertainment. If you have a Gameboy Advance compatible device and enjoy tactics and strategy themed games, Fire Emblem is an absolute must buy for you!","the game is a masterpiece in every single sense of the word . it presents a great narrative, with great characters and villains . the gameplay is also pretty great, is fun challenging without being unfair."
62.Madden NFL 2004,"Madden 2004 deserves the title of being the most iconic game of the franchise & was released during the franchise's peak. The cover athlete Mike Vick is one of the most OP sports game characters of all time & would be a great pick if someone is doing a fantasy draft of sports game characters. The introduction of Owner Mode changed the game forever by allowing the player change the prices of Tickets, Concessions, Merchandise, Parking, & Advertising depending on how well the user's controlled team is doing in Franchise mode. Mini-Camp is great game mode & is the best way to learn the basics of the game. I also like the tiny fact that in Mini-Camp the players wear practice jerseys instead of wearing full game day uniforms. Create-a-Team is one of the best game modes where you choose whatever colors & logos you like. You can even create your own custom stadium with your created team while choosing what you want your team's uniform to look like. The Playmaker Control is one of the best one-and-done features ever where you can flip a run play, change the primary receiver's route on a passing play, change safeties coverage, & determining a defensive blitz or deep pass after the ball is snapped. This isn't the GOAT of the Franchise but it deserves the title of being the most iconic of the Franchise.. Incredible game. Back when Madden had competition and couldn't rest on their laurels. They actually cared. Michael Vick is Tecmo Bowl Bo Jackson levels of broken. 99 speed on a QB lol. Deep franchise mode, the complete football game. Unpopular opinion, Madden 04 isn't the best PS2 Madden. That's Madden 08 btw. While 04 is fun to play, and has a lot of features that are missing from Madden 21, it's just not as good as some of the other Maddens on Ps2. Its still a great game, and has Create a fan, create a team, and create a play.. Amazing perfection absolutely beautiful good game very good game man good good game better than Smash Brothers. Michael Vick is the most over powered player in this game for sure. This changed the game by allowing mobile qbs to bounce to the outside for easy TDS.. One of the best madden games I've ever played but the reason I didn't give it a ten was because the sprint is x and you cant change that in the game. The reason I gave it such a high rating was partly because you can create your own plays which are also in some other old madden games and makes it so fun. The game play is outstanding and there's not much lag in the game. This is in top 3 madden games for me for one more reason: the game modes aren't screwed up like Madden 25 or 15. A peak that as of 2012 the series has yet to reach. (blame that on the lack of comptish.) The gameplay is realistic and much more fun than the current versions of Madden, and the game was well ahead of its time. Throw in the excellent owner mode and you have a game with incredible replay value. The best Madden there ever has been.. This review is late, but I think it means something that I am still playing this game over 8 years later. This game is one of the most addicting football games I have ever played, and I have never been bored with it. Just the fact that I still play it means this game is awesome.","the introduction of Owner Mode changed the game forever by allowing the player change the prices of Tickets, Concessions, Merchandise, Parking, & Advertising . Create-a-Team is one of the best game modes where you choose whatever colors & logos you like ."
620.Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation,"I don't know how much people here were paid to pretend the final part of a 60% complete game was good, but I wasn't paid anything, and I didn't pay anything for this game, and I STILL FELT RIPPED OFF.. I am sorry, but this is breaking the concept of Fates. The inclusion **** route is completely against the idea of Fates. The Story might even be worse than the story of Conquest, it hurts, especially if you enjoyed the other two games. The gameplay is decent, but this is mainly due to the Fire Emblem formula being awesome to begin with. Map design isn't great and you just get way too many (under-leveld) units.. Fails as a game. Fails as a story. It's probably the worst FE experience in the franchise. The gameplay, cast and story are all pathetic. I have no idea what the critics saw in this one. Then again, user reviews are usually more accurate.. I absolutely loved Revelation but was annoyed that it could only be bought on the nintendo eshop. At first i didn't want to buy the third path but i'm glad I did. Refusing to take sides, trying to gather allies to stop an evil threat felt even better here. The low point is that there are too many plotholes here. There were plotholes in Birthright and Conquest but not as much.Fire Emblem Fates was my first game in the series. I enjoyed every path and rated a 10/10 each time because each iteration had a good plot, especially Conquest, had a awesome gameplay each time, each path felt different from the others (with Revelation being even more interesting due to the fact you refuse to take sides) and i never felt bored. All the bashing and hate about this game is a mystery to me.. Maybe i'll find other fire emblem games even better but this one was the first and the one that made me fall in love withe the fire emblem games.. Fire emblem fates revelation and just fire emblem fates as a whole even with the problems is a game I still no matter what, always remember fondly. While it's story could certainly go for some improvements in several areas, everything else from it's gameplay and map design across all 3 pathways are varied, well made and has something for all types of fe fans, to it's top notch soundtrack and voice acting. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and I understand why so many others dislike it but maybe, if you want, give it or at least one pathway a 2nd shot and maybe with all 3 reviews in mind, you might see it in a different light.. Fire Emblem: Fates is, surprisingly, an astonishingly worthy follow-up to its predecessor, Awakening. While it may not appeal to those in the fanbase looking for a hardcore, merciless strategy-RPG, Fates is extremely entertaining. Fates continues Awakening's move towards accessibility and lowering the bar to entry - Casual mode returns, and most weapons no longer break after multiple uses (save for healing staves and rods). Revelation, in comparison to Birthright and Conquest, brings an end to the story those two games began, setting aside the option to explore two divergent paths in favour of a singular, cliché conclusion that is very much the standard for most of the games in the series (an evil dragon god of some sort being at the heart of all the evil in the game). While Fates' story is less compelling than Awakening's increased depth in certain areas (especially some of the game's mechanics) combined with the aforementioned lower bar to entry makes this a great time, and invites multiple playthroughs. If you enjoyed Awakening, I can almost guarantee that Fates will scratch the itch for more Fire Emblem. While it may not always do enough to differentiate itself from its legendary predecessor (even shamelessly aping some of its characters), it is a fantastic game in its own right that continues the upward trajectory that Awakening began for the Fire Emblem series..

Like the rest of the fates games, I like the mechanics. However, the story in this one is really dumb and a lot of the maps are too gimmicky. The other two dates games are much better unless your priority is shipping all the characters from both sides.. Revelation isn't just the worst of the Fates trio, it's the worst Fire Emblem game, period. *The story is a nonsensical journey strung together by one ""shocking"" revelation after another. Worse still, because this is seen as the golden route, Birthright and Conquest are effectively invalidated. *Unit balance is a mess, ranging from flagrantly overpowered units like Ryoma or Xander, to lv.10 unpromoted units that can barely survive the maps they're recruited in, giving you little room for experimentation. *The gimmicky level design and inconsistent enemy strength makes repeated playthroughs a chore. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. second best in the FATES trilogy It has a satisfying ending So buy it !!. This has been a long journey, spanning 3 different games and over 100 hours, but Revelations was by far the best, both in terms of story and gameplay. No deaths that stabbed you in the heart (in the same ways as the previous games at least), earning exp from castle battles, and a massive cast of playable characters were only a few of the things that took their already great game and made it even more amazing. This was a journey worth building up for, and the Finale did not fail to deliver. If you've not gotten into Fire Emblem, there is no better time, I promise you.. I only played Conquest before Revelation and as it turns out I think the later doesn't have the same punishing difficulty but has a decent amount of challenge, that being said, I don't think the story unfolds as interesting as Conquest but I really liked the ""what if"" aspect of it (MINOR SPOILER AHEAD), it's interesting how 2 characters that were enemies before, here they need to tag along or even marry. As far as gameplay goes the thrill is the same as always, in my case I always choose classic mode to feel real tension in battle and to spice things up. In the end is not an outstanding entry of FE series but still gives you a lot of entertainment.. I bought this game due to good reviews. I feel as if I've been duped because it lacks a soul. The story is so generic and bare, and the horrible voice acting sounds just like it's been copied from Pokemon. I may have enjoyed the game if I was 12, but no.. An amazing game and a great finale to the fates trilogy, it basically combine the other two games, which means the story is uneven at times, but the game makes up for it, great game. Really weird maps with tedious gimmicks, awful unit balance where most of the cast joins significantly underleveled to the point where grinding is practically necessary to get them up to speed with enemies let alone your stronger units, and a trash story sets Revelation apart in terms of being the weakest Fates game, and probably weakest overall Fire Emblem game. Even the music was pretty phoned in with a new area for this version of Fates being full of glorified elevator music.. To be sure, there were some mild disappointments with regards to the closing entry in the Fire Emblem Fates series. First of all, I don't think the overall storyline needed to be told throughout three games- having just spent the last six months of my life playing Fire Emblem games, I ask myself if they were really all that different- Birthright and Revelation are so similar that I feel like I shouldn't have spent time on both. Second, I didn't like the way that you were able to get the entire roster of both games in this one game. Given that you're almost guaranteed to use all the royal families from both sides in this game, it means that you have very little room for anyone else in your party- so why even bother giving us these characters? I felt bad knowing that characters I liked from the prior games were just going to be entirely ignored during my playthrough. Not to mention, you spend several levels getting the crew from Birthright together before you even start on Conquest- I was hoping you would get some of each. Then, all at once, the entire Conquest crew joins you in a single level. It was dramatically imbalanced and was something of a shock to my roster. I did not like that. Third, the game's difficulty level is very skewed. The first few levels provide something of a challenge, but then I found myself hideously over-leveled by only the 4th or 5th level, and this was playing on Hard. I played a few of the Skirmish maps just to develop the relationships and weapon skills of some of my characters, but not to level up. Still, I found myself breezing through most of the game without a hitch until the very last level, when the only real challenge showed up. Even then, I beat it on my first try. So, the challenge of the game just isn't there. With that said, I still really like the Fates franchise for the changes that it made to the game- I like the way they revamped the Support/Pair UP system, the way that they removed weapon durability in favor of having more diverse weapon options, the way that you collect and forge weapons and the introduction of ninjas and debuffs. I do not like how the reclass system does not reset your level, meaning that you would have to grind out gold to buy seals to increase your max level if you desired to obtain other special abilities or weapon proficiencies, and I didn't even bother with this feature. I also did not like many of the My Castle features, particularly levelling up Lilith (because it took a lot of unskippable time and didn't serve a purpose outside of the Invasion levels) and inviting others to your home (that also took a lot of unskippable time and offered only a minor bonus). I also didn't like that you accumulated lots of vegetables that you could never really put to good use, outside of buying outfits. That doesn't make any sense. So, overall, I'm pleased with the franchise, but I wish they could've made the story worth being told across three games- then again, this is Fire Emblem. You're not here for the story- in which case, one game would have sufficed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game was very good in my opinion, the plot was a bit uneven but I could accept it. The characters were very fun to have interact. The gameplay made me feel like a god, so I loved that too.. Revelation is, without a single doubt, the worse path of Fire Emblem Fates. Not only that, but it is a solid contender for worse Fire Emblem game ever. The most important feature of the series, i.e. the gameplay, is terribly lacking. Maps are quite weak in terms of strategy, but they are also a hassle to complete, not because of their difficulty, but because they are lengthy on purpose. I stopped at chapter 12 (out of 27).. Fire Emblem is definitely one of my top 5 franchises ever, and I think superior to XCOM as the best turn-based tactical strategy game, and with far better story and character development on top of better tactics. Revelation is a unique take on the story, and not as hard as Conquest, but it is still definitely worthy of your purchase and time. It expands and improves on everything in Awakening and keeps all the good stuff, exactly what a sequel in a long-running game series should do. I really hope they make amiibo for the top 5-6 characters from the trilogy. I would buy them all!. + Great difficulty level, its always fair and rewards tactical thinking, and turning off perma death is great for new players + watching your units relationships with eachother develop is rewarding and fun + Replay value, you can play through any of the campaigns again and have a new experience by favouring different units, trying out different romance paths or upgrading units to different classes + Emotional story with believable characters... - ...Even if the dialogue is stilted at times. As weird as it is to say, Revelation was not as good as Birthright or Conquest. It was fun, but it was easy. Almost too easy. It kind of felt like the developers realized just how stupid hard Conquest was and were trying to apologize with Revelation. Add to that a rather lackluster story that didn't seem to sew any of the pieces from the other two games together and it really felt kinda ""meh."" It's really too bad considering how much they set themselves up with first. It feels like they really just ran out of steam.. Fire emblem Fates revelations is the last of the three fates games to be realized in north America and is supposed to be a mix-up of the other two versions that ties up all loose ends to the stories. I personally am a huge fan of Conquest, having finished it four times and I have not played birthright since it was specifically described as an entry point to newcomers or fans who got into the series with the last entry thanks to the previous game, fire emblem awakening, but I have watched LPs of it. I have purchased revelations and am currently on the tail end of my second play through, and to put it bluntly, I find this game to be quite mediocre compared to both other versions and feel it was very rushed. Revelation is a piece of DLC, which, in our day and age, is overused to the point it feels like the developers are pulling money from your wallet. To justify the existence of DLC, a game should be fully finished, which is somewhat the case for the other fates games, however their story has been intentionally cut and left out many explanations to justify this game's existence. Since this is the DLC game, it is almost guaranteed to be the last path played by the player, so it should therefore bring something fresh to the table. This is not the case at all, as for the first half of the game, the story is a blatant and lazy copy and paste from Birthright. The second half is excruciatingly repetitive to the point where the emotional moments lose all impact. The game also suffers from weak and generic villains who are completely stupid and act very unsubtle. This includes the main antagonist who has the exact same motivations as the villain from this game's predecessor and who's actual interesting backstory is locked between another paywall. The writing is otherwise bad and pays no attention to details, but I won't elaborate to avoid spoilers Out of the three versions, Revelations has definitely the worst game play because of a sheer lack of play testing. It is still a tactical RPG like the other two versions but is significantly less enjoyable due to very bad gimmicks that will slow the game to a crawl in the second half and put terrible and tedious gimmicks in the first chapters. There is a severe lack of character balance, which makes about two thirds of the units fairly worthless unless the player ginds for hours on end. Finally, there is a chapter that does not function well at all, chapter 21, where the special gimmick gets screwed up and stops working, which is another example of how rushed and empty the game feels. This game has the least exclusive content. It only has one unique character, Fuuga, and has only three new supports for each character. It has less unique chapters because this game has no unique paralogue levels. Other than that, the fact you receive units from both sides breaks the balance and allows for an extremely easy late game. This game was made to take more money from your pockets and because it exists, the other two versions have an intentional bad ending. You are better off spending your 20$ on another E-shop title, because this game brings little to the table and had no heart or soul put into it unlike its two sister games. It plays the worst, has the least content and you buying it will encourage Intelligent systems to pursuit such a despicable practice.. This is in my top five games of all time. Revelation is a must own for any 3ds owner. Everything is perfect in this game. The stages are wonderful, the characters are well thought out, and the localization isnt even bad, the deal with localization is people are little brats ( only because i cant curse on here ) and wont accept there are differences between the cultures of the good ol' US of A and the land of the rising sun (Japan). 10/10. There's not much to say about this game. It combine the characters from both Birthright and Conquest. The story somewhat weird. The battle music not as good as Birthright or Conquest. Just play it when you want more of Fire Emblem Fates or after you beat Birthright, because it's difficulty more like Birthright rather than Conquest.. I am not happy to admit that I thoroughly loathe this game. NOW LISTEN- I adore the FE series my favorite being Blazing Sword (known as just Fire Emblem in USA). Which is why I despise this game. Every Fire Emblem game ads something new and meaningfull to the general gameplay of the series- refinements that have 0 downsides. For example- Sacred Stones started the trope of choosing multiple classes- much appreciated. But what does fates offer- the emphasis on player choice. Sounds cool right?It is. but in execution, this game falls flat on its face. selling hardly different endings for 3/4 the price of the game itself. Big mistake on all fronts. not to mention, the different versions offer nothing but different story, no gameplay improvements anywhere. speaking of gameplay, nothing has changed since awakening, meaning its good, but has gone nowhere, not to mention all models and textures are ripped from the last game, and results in this game being a cash grab with, copy-paste anime characters with no interesting characteristics, thus going against one of Fire Emblems concepts, new ,original, and developing characters (Hector for example). this game gets low ratings from me because im attatched to the traditional FE formula of being original and adding new, game- changing concepts. I dont want to hate this game, but in truth... it... *inhales*... ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. First off, I want to start out by saying I'm a big Fire Emblem fan and that I enjoyed Birthright, Conquest, and awakening and would easily consider playing them again. In fact, the whole localization didn't bother me that much and I feel like they did a pretty decent job. Before you write me off or hate me, I have a very good reason behind the score I gave it. In a nutshell, Fire Emblem Fates: Revelations is a very boring game. I'll admit that I stopped playing after chapter 19, but even getting through half the game and it being that much of a struggle is something in and of itself was pretty difficult to do after chapter 14, which is a middle finger for Conquest fans. Anyways, I'll give you my review on why I just couldn't finish this game and why it's almost not worth your 20 dollars. [Warning this part of the review contains spoiler] I'll start off with the story. The premise of the story is actually pretty good in chapter 7 since it decides to explain what's going on and kind of gives you a better idea of the main villain aka Anakos. It's weaker storywise than hidden truths, but it had potential. The deaths are just really stupid in this one, like really, really stupid (Conquest did two of the three deaths better) and it's just very poorly written. Before you point your finger to the treehouse, this is Intelligent Systems. It basically is just chapter 7 then filler to get all the characters...then chapter 7's exact story again in case you forgot it. Most of the Royals are 1-dimensional and they're really the only characters you see. And I'm pretty sure everyone in their right mind can openly admit Izana's **** death can summarize the **** chapter. That reminds me that most of the plot twists are mind-numbingly obvious and that every boss pre chapter 24 is either a boss we fought before or just a generic enemy. I did skim for what happens after I stop and I will say that it looked cool and really good. [End of Spoiler here] Let's talk about the maps now. Fire Emblem was never really big on the main story so I often will forgive a bad plot for really cool and fun maps. Conquest and Birthright did have fun and enjoyable maps with the former having maps up to par with the Fire Emblem franchise. Conquest's maps aren't ""hard"" but they require more strategy to beat which is why I enjoyed that game. If you though anything Birthright threw at you was bad, Revelation somehow figured out a way to be worse than Birthright. Skirmish battles are more enjoyable. I know one part of this hate for Revelation's maps is because I jumped out of Conquest which had excellent AI...like really, really good AI that I'd be excited to see in future installments. The AI in Revelations in the first half will suicide attack one of your units even if they only do no damage (Conquest enemies were smart and knew when to attack and even used skills to be cheap). Btw, you'll be lucky if an enemy even has a skill at all. The IS staff though it'd be super challenging if they used Promoted enemies instead. Other than a 1% crit, these tougher enemies are a complete joke. Now you're looking at me and probably going ""So what, Birthright did a lot of that stuff too."" Well Birthright didn't reuse good maps and make them bad (which is another thing I'm bothered about). Birthright did however allow for a variety of characters to be used without the use of grinding. You could use almost any character and they'd be useful the whole game (bar a few exceptions) which made replayability a lot better. In revelations, 80% of the cast is just bad and shouldn't even be waster on experience for...including Effie and Niles. Revelation was designed for all the Royals to be used, and Royals are OP which makes the game ridiculously easy. The fact that if your unit isn't promoted by 19 and doesn't have an attack over 32, you may as well pitch them as you can only bring 12 units, 10 of which will be royals. It's just a large barrier to use a character who's only half as good since almost all characters come in severely underleveled. That's enough bashing on this path I'm not going to bother finishing. People who are into my castle and all that wireless stuff will definitely want to pick this one up due to having the full cast and giving children new skills. There are also some interesting support convos that can only be done in this poorly designed path. There's a few cool things in the campaign, but honestly I'd say save your money for any other FE game like Sacred Stones which has a much better plot. And if you still think this is a 9 out of 10 game, there's a chapter where you have to slowly break ice blocks to reach the boss who doesn't move. Did I mention enemies drop stat boosting items like dracoshields?. This game is just amazing! I have been a fan of Fire emblem since Sacred stones and I'm very happy with the approach Nintendo is taking with this one, I can´t stop playing the 3 versions, there's just a lot of content, so it's a great time to be a FE fan. Many people are down voting the game because of the bad localization but don't let that to stop you from playing this game, let's be honest if you are playing Fire emblem just because you want to poke anime characters with your stylus then you are playing the wrong genre of game. Yes, sadly the localization is bad and the story is mediocre at best, Corrin is a very bland character, maybe the worst lord in FE games BUT everything else is amazing, the gameplay and the level design (even in Birthright) are a lot better than Awakening and that alone makes this an excellent game. The new characters, while not that memorable as they were in Awakening, are still very charming and likeable, the support conversations sometimes are great, sometimes not that good (mainly because of localization). The OST of the game is easily one of the best in all the saga and the voice acting is Ok, sometimes misses. By the way the few cutscenes of the game are gorgeous, the presentation in general is awesome and full of details. The gameplay is the strongest point of the game, all the new systems that were broken in Awakening were greatly balanced in the game and the level design... I just love the level design, there's so much room for experimenting a lot of strategies, the difficult is just in the exact spot, even in lunatic it feels obviously very hard but fair and there are a lot of memorable levels that you're going to hate/love. Now speaking of Revelations and all the DLC controversy, it's true this game isn't cheap but if you think that you're going to invest $80 dollars for the three campaigns and it's going to take you 100+ hours just to finish the stories, then it's totally worth it. There are others games that cost $90-100 dollars and takes 10-12 hours to finish them so there's no big deal here. Don't forget also that FE let's you play the way you want, even in Conquest the ""hardest"" of the 3 you can play in casual mode if you are intimidated by the hardcore nature of the game or you can play Birthright in hard or lunatic and it's going to be a hardcore experience, so there's no excuse to enjoy Fates. Revelation is the most balanced version and it's very interesting seeing the interactions of all characters, being former enemies. With all that said, Fire emblem fates is not a perfect game, it has big flaws but those flaws are outshined by what was done right, for me the worst wasn't the localization issues but the story, with a better writing this game could have been the greatest FE so far (still I love the silliness of some support conversations). Seriously, don't miss this game, there was a lot of love and work behind Fates, it's a gem of the genre and one of the best 3DS games so far, it holds a very special place in my collection.. TWO IMPORTANT THINGS: Do not be put off by the user score, anti-censorship people are voting this down on purpose without finishing the game! Do not buy this before playing at least one path! Now that we got that outta the way, I'll share my thoughts on this path. Revelations is the path where both Hoshido and Nohr come together; this has the largest amounts of units. Each chapter you'll be gaining like 2-3 units and eventually you will gain all the royal siblings as well. Brand new supports between Nohr and Hoshido units are in this route, making it very funny to watch them interact. All the royal siblings can also support with their opposite royal (e.g Camilla/Hinoka) which is very satisfying if you've played both routes. This also has a lot of new maps with a lot of them having a gimmick; it's a defining feature of Revelation. Most of them are great but there's a few ones that make you very frustrated. It is quite different from Birthright which has simpler rout maps, so keep that in mind. Conquest players will be more in their element here. The only negative thing I can say is that it is less bittersweet than the other two; there's a lot less death and the main theme of 'betrayal' is not really present once you get halfway through the game as everyone joins together in this path. Both Hoshido and Nohr have more dramatic/sad moments while Revelations is the golden path. However I'm sure some people would vastly prefer that and it was nice to see after playing two route with sad-ish endings. Overall it's a 9/10 for me, there is a TON of content and units so you will be playing this for a while. :). Having almost every character from both routes just felt great. The story holds up well enough, the addictive gameplay kept me hooked for hours upon hours, unlocking the vast amount of supports was entertaining, creative map design, good music. All in all just a great game.. The third route, Revelations, fits perfectly with Birthright and Conquest and does it's job of telling the true story of Fates. Wrapping up mysteries not solved in the other two versions. Bringing together the entire cast of characters and seeing certain Hoshido and Nohr characters interacting is one of my favorite parts of the game and it's made better by the infinite opportunities to build supports and train your units. The story is just as compelling as the other two versions and almost does the best job at **** you in, as I've found myself losing track of time while playing through the story to learn the mysteries each chapter offers. All in all, I'm gonna say Revelations is my favorite route of the three and does a great job of telling the whole story of the games.. For me, this isn't a 10. It's a 9.5 As it stands, of the three iterations, Revelation is the one that most closely resembles Awakening, as it brings together every character, weapon, item and mechanic from both versions. This makes for some great support conversations, more customization, and it helps expand the long term value of the game by a lot. While most reviewers agree that Revelation stands in the middle ground when it comes to difficulty, I have to disagree. I think Revelation might just be the easiest of three, for the most part, not entirely. I'd say for newcomers, hard difficulty might be a pretty viable option. For hardcore players, I'd say lunatic on your first run might pretty doable, more than Birthright, and definitely more than Conquest. It may not offer a story as epic as Conquest, but it does present us with its unique take on the story, more characterization, new villains, and some pretty impressive twists. My only negative would be that by the end of the game, the maps start becoming a bit repetitive, but that's about it. The censoring of the game did bother me, but I'm not about to dock off points unfairly for such a great game. TL;DR If you liked Conquest or Birthright, go buy this one. Now","the inclusion **** route is completely against the idea of Fates . the gameplay is decent, but this is due to the Fire Emblem formula being awesome . the low point is that there are too many plotholes here ."
621.Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"The city management and overall gameplay is more complex than its predecessor. I think many people enjoy watching their empire grow, similar to SimCity. The game features are more complex and there's more to learn, but it's still enjoyable and addictive. The problem is that the AIs are poor at managing their empires and are too stupid to engage in rational diplomacy. Their combat is also so pathetic that I almost feel sorry for them. Playing hard by yourself against a bunch of idiots who are dumber than barbarians somehow makes you feel like a child playing with plastic battle toys, and it's childish.. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Voice Acting: AWESOME.. Latest game update broke macos support: the game crushes every15-30 minutes. Unplayable. Otherwise okay game, but I like Civ V better.. The console version crashes late game. The developers have know about the issues for years but have done nothing to resolve it. And they're still selling it without informing costumer. Don't waste your money on the console version and don't trust what the developers say. I won't be buying Civ 7 unless they prove it works properly.. I have 7700 hours of gameplay, I don't think I need to add anything else to this review. I'm playing on PS4. It's a fun game and I've been enjoying it. My biggest issue though is that it doesn't have accessibility options. I'm playing on a tv in my living room and it's really hard to read everything, and that gets tiresome after a while. To put it short: don't buy this game on console if you have bad eyesight, or plays in a tv far from your eyes.. Loved. 200h+ and still learing new things in game. Very good game. When come the VII?!. I like Civilization 6 because it links to history and it is fun but hard and I get board easily and it takes ages to load.. Its an nice Game. If you like strategie and logic games it would be perfect for you. Maybe its a little bit hard at the beginning but if you play it often you would get it very fast. Complex and stimulating, this Grand Strategy title is a beefed up clash of clans with dozens of empires to control and multiple paths to victory, ensuring unique runs every time. I can guarantee that hours will pass while you tell yourself ""only one more round of this ****"".. One of the best strategies out there. Not overcomplicated, just all the important stuff. Only thing that keeps me for making it a 10 is some engaging campaign and more engaging scenarios. Can't wait for Civ7.. It is certainly as addictive as Civ V, but with much worse design. The game runs much nicer, and is worth playing with friends, but in single player it often feels more like struggling against the system than building an empire. The amount of text to read for every decision makes me just want to pick up a book instead, and the lack of explanation for rules just means more reading in the civlopedia. Lastly, the UI is one of the worst I’ve ever seen. I feel it needs a mod or keybinding just to make it playable sometimes. There are definitely elements of the game that I absolutely love, but there are just as many that I can’t stand.. Fun game but if you are new to the genre like me, you need a lot of time to even begin to understand the mechanics of games like this, so have that in mind.. It's a good game, but after 20 hours of playing it is boring and not so fun anymore. And for 59,99 it's overpriced. My tip for buying games is to buy it on MMOGA.. This game is a hard one to review. While being really interesting and fun, it’s really hard to get into. It took me 25 hours to even grasp at least the third of the mechanics and I still don’t get some of the things in this game. If the game had some sort of tutorial, it would be, without a doubt, a 9.. This game did not even start. did try to reinstall the game but no luck. Anyway Civ5 is better by just working.. The legendary simulation/strategy game. Civ 6 is surprisingly deep if you want it to be. Easy to play, very hard to master. Made of many small building blocks that align together in many different ways. Settling is a mini game of its own, managing your territory and beyond to place the cities in the best possible positions. If you master this game, you’re even seeing where your districts will be placed, and how you’ll benefit from adjacency to others. Where you’ll put your wonders, which city will handle what, etc. Technologies and civics are key and varied. It is brutally important to keep short/mid and long term goals in mind when deciding what to research. One moment too late and you’ll be left with a low tier unit against a fierce opponent. One moment too late and someone else will build the wonder you were dreaming of. I absolutely love how the map is built, procedurally from a varied set of presets. The map is built out of hexagons, and every unit pathfinds through them. Each tile may have special features, it can be made of water, dry land, forest… It can contain a specific resource or be ideal for a certain **** you advance in the game, you’ll discover more of the map, and unlock more of its resources to exploit. You’ll witness how your civilization grows from the stone age to the future age, and be instrumental in how it all plays out. Playing online is advised as the AI is limited, so if you have some friends that are up to it play with them. It’s much better online. The game suffers from the classical simulation game issue in late game, where your civ has grown too much and you have too much to micro-manage, so take that into account. I think it lacks more complex endings to decide who wins a game, the default ones are just too straightforward. If you amass science and production you’ll win first, that’s how it is. If you don’t like the other paths, you’ll end up playing similarly unless your opponents force you to adapt.Overall, this is most probably the greatest simulation/strategy game in the market as of now.. I've played civilization games since the first iteration, I'm that old. I started this game, it couldn't detect my configuration so I had to go in the menu to set everything to the max: quite an oddity that a game can't do that these days. Then I started to play: wow, do I have the right resolution? Am I playing in 800x600? Nope, 1080p. Why are the characters have chil-like features? Why is everything so cartoonish? Oh, it crashed at the end of the first turn. Tried a second game, wow, why do I have to make my mouse travel corner to corner so much? Who designed the UI? oh this is clearly not for me. Refund. Let's go back to Civ V.. Maybe one of the most played games by me. Spend a lot of time and each time it was a great experience.. have played this game a lot on my switch - great game and great port for nintendo. Each entry in this strategy series takes a while to gel after release, but then consistently eclipses all prior editions, and Civ VI is no exception. One of the most replayable strategy games ever developed. It would be nice to have even more scenarios that force players to use different play styles than they are used to, however they just started releasing monthly challenges so I hope these fill that gap.. It's a good Game, but I don't like the cartoon view. Few serious and seems like a mobile Game. Civ V was better than this in IA and apparence.. This game is too weird and too complex, with stupid and cartoonish art style. Feels like a manga game for zoomers. Besides, with all DLCs this games costs more the 200 $. I have over 1000 hours of gameplay in Civilization 5, and I could never get used to Civilization 6. Civilization 5 is much better in every way.. It's my first civilazation game. It's hard to pick up, as I gave up this game a few times in the first 1 h try. However when I got it, this is amazing.. (keep in mind, the only other civ game i played was civ 5 for less than 10 hours) a great strategy game, very highly recommend. the game has a lot of content, i have already sunk over 80 hours into it. the different victory types are really fun to experiment with, this is one of the few games where i have actually wanted to become an mega ultra sweat.. This is ps5 in 2023, I should be able to play this online without having to work on port forwarding.. This is honestly a good strategy game with expansive features but is sadly slapped with bad servers, bugs, synchronization issues, and lots of DLCs.. My wife and I both bought this game for playing it together. The multiplayer game hangs itself up after a few rounds into the game at the end of the turn with a message ""waiting for other players"". It seems to be a rather common problem telling by the many reports about this. We spent hours on forums and trying different suggestions for solving this. None of them helped. The developers don't even care about the huge number of people with the same issue. We wasted a lot of money on this completely disfunctional game.. Civilization VI stands as the zenith of the series, marked by vast and sweeping changes that leave no aspect untouched. Every element has been meticulously curated, finding its purpose within the game's intricate framework.. best turn base strategic game at the moment. the AI for diplomatic decisions should be better.. It may not have inherited the fantastic atmosphere of its predecessor, but the systems have improved even more. It's a bit disappointing that the AI doesn't fully utilize these systems.. This game is fun to play with and without friends. I love the art style of this game and the music is fantastic. AI is average at best, diplomatic relations with them are just random. But without DLC's this game turns into a simple turn based strategy game with depth that you can find even in mobile games. If you want to play this game I recommend to get the DLC's, with DLC's this game is 8.5/10, and without them is 6.5/10.. Very good game, more rounded than civ V with the same concept and objetively the best civilization of the saga... But lacks of news to look cool. I spent way too much time on this game, but that time was worth it. The AIs are.. ok at best, but as long as you play with friends, you'll be all right. I do think that the game is running out of stuff to do, but I'm almost certain I'm just missing something, because I somehow tend to miss the fun stuff in games. I am not a reliable source, but I'll give it 8/10 because I like it at the moment of writing the review.. Good game design and better territory logic. After playing this game we must be proud that we have an optimistic in mind and have a good friend. Gameplay: Wonderful AI: Poor Balance: Poor MOD: Wonderful Graphic: Good Optimization: Normal Story: Great Music/Sound Effect : Good Characterization: None. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. It's a pretty good entry in to the series. It does feel a little repetitive, and I found after getting 30 odd hours of fun from it games felt a bit of a chore. It's pretty consistent with the series except a few changes, so fans of previous games will likely enjoy.. Really fun to play with friends. Don't bother playing it alone, the AI is absolutely worthless. Also the graphics are somehow much worse than 5. Districts are a cool idea, but overall its inferior to 5 + Vox Populi.. An enjoyable turn based strategy game. This game lacks depth, and plays like a board game.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 82 IIIIIIIIII====================. SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION VI is a good game. It has good combat and the DLCs are good and make an even better experience.. Great game! Beautiful, music is stunning, gameplay is rich and complex in a satisfying way, with lots of variety. Great value DLC. So daunting. So big. Tutorial barely gives basics, so jump into a real game! But.. A real game takes hours and hours and hours. If you don't know what you're doing, you're gonna struggle. That's okay! Try the scenarios! No, those are really hard too. It's a great game but I have to invest so much time to be good enough to play a game properly.. You simply cannot beat Civilization. Perhaps the greatest strategy series of all time continues its winning streak with Civ 6, with fun new features like districts that add a host of complexities to your gameplay. While I do feel the leader selection is a bit sub-par (France getting stuck with Catherine de Medici and Eleanor of Aquitaine is a travesty), overall, this would be my number one recommendation for anyone wanting to get into strategy gaming.. release turkish langue its been 9 years. other then that game is **** and even with that 1.5 hour tutorial you dont understand how to play the game.. These games arent as complex as they pretend to be, the historic stuff is extremely shallow, but its weirdly addictive, time flies by playing this. Unit movement is slow, the AI turn takes forever and it mostly does nothing, in the apocalypse mode your whole territory will be destroyed by meteors while almost nothing happens to the AI territories. The secret societies adds OP vampires that are just as broken as the legendary units, combat is not satisfying, just about which unit hasnt the highest number.. This is the game that got me into the rts genre i got this for christmas a few years back since my parents know i am interested in history there are some things i dont like about the game like the ai stuff but overall its a good way to kill some time. The best entry on the franchise, my favorite among the II and the II (yup, I'm nostalgic), good gameplay, beautiful graphics (better with mods), my only complain is about the price, the dlcs are too expansive, almost the price of a full game.. The game clearly has its problems (extremely predictable AI, strange difficulty curve) but is nonetheless a ton of fun. The district mechanics are wonderful, warring is great (though a bit easy & too powerful) and the artstyle is satisfying. IMO the game really shines with the different civ/leader abilities which help at making every game unique.. I have more than 2000 playhours. (500 from dlcs). I can say that AI is pretty challenging in this game. But exaggerations are unnecessary. AI is not that clever, they have the starting advantages after all. They added pretty much to CIV 5, playing this game is more smooth than CIV5.. The mods for this game are very creative and fun. Breaking this game is the top of the iceberg.. Amazing game, absolute masterpiece. Civilization is one of my all-time favorite games, and the leap from the fifth to the sixth game is epic. It offers new mechanics, tons of stuff to do and build and a fresh new look over the older games. There is some new and relaxing music, more factions and overall, it is a huge improvement over the previous game. Civilization has always been a turned based game in which you can build, move, attack or improve buildings in your turn. Every faction does their move simultaneously and after that, a new round starts. You win the game by conquering all the capitals, achieve cultural victory, science victory or a religious victory. This means that you are not bound to one specific goal. If your military **** for example, you can try to build as many museums, theaters and zoo’s as possible, to get victorious on tourism and culture. You can trade with other factions/people, build alliances, open your borders, make some shady deals, it is just great. You can play as many different world leaders from the days of old to the modern era. Alexander the Great, Saladin, Queen Victoria, and many more, they are all there. They all have their special bonusses and you should take advantage of them by building your empire accordingly. For example, Saladin is more focused on religion and trade and only in the starting eras, his military is strong. When the modern age arrives, you really struggle to achieve military successes. Every character has a little backstory that is historically accurate and fun to read. The game is meant to be played online against friends or other people but offers some scenarios and a skirmish mode for you to play solo. You can always play against the AI factions, which are really well done. The balance of the AI is great and if you want a challenge, you will surely get it. This installment in the series offer new mechanics like natural disasters, new ways of collecting resources from the map and a new system in which your era score determines if you are entering a golden age or a dark age. With a golden age, you prosper and thrive, with a dark age, you struggle to come around. You earn era score by discovering great inventions, doing research and achieve eureka moments. These new mechanics do require some DLC tough. I really liked the natural disaster mechanic, but sometimes, it got a little over the top. When you see your towns melt away by an active volcano, your harbor washed away by the twelfth million flood and see Darude with his sandstorm, raving over your farmlands, you know, they got no mercy on you. The graphics and animations are beautiful. The map is blooming with life and movement, and I really like that everything is just so colorful and detailed. Many times, I zoom in close on my empire to see all the different quarries, lumber mills and dams spin and turn. The sound effects and music are perfect. They are well designed for this game, and I think this is one of the better sound and music designs I have seen. The ambient music is really relaxing and when your units engage in combat, the shots and hits sound just great. Like usual, Civilization is a hard game. It takes strategy, practice and management to master this game and even then, factors like starting point, barbarians and aggression from other players or states weigh even heavier. However, the game does offer excellent tutorials and gives you a fair chance to learn it. Civilization VI is a game that I play to relax, with or without friends. Just taking my time, slowly building and developing my empire. I feel no stress, no time pressure, just pure joy and chill. It is one of the few games that I can always pick up and play, without it ever boring me. Maybe Civilization VII will be even better, I don’t know, but for now, this is just a masterpiece **** that will always be one of my favorites. Definitely recommend this gem.. I don't understand why theres so many bad reviews? This game is the best strategy game for people to start with, seeing your civlization grow with those graphics and nice modern mechanics, along with the many roads you can take to victory, make this a stellar experience. AI is quite dumb but idk,it never bothered me. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now I hardly play any. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I play on every platform but prefer PlayStation. I love the art design of the new navigation map. I just like playing god in this game and commanding forces. I spend way too much time on this game sometimes. Just one more turn. I do think the AI and the things you can do is a little worse than the previous one but still additive. I also have this on the PS4 and Switch.. That's first CIV i'm playing in and it's interesting and immersive enough. It has it's own problems, bad optimization, some weird menu bugs. Also i have to admit, that my experience was interesting at the start until 60-70% of game, after you get tanks, airplanes and other stuff it's getting boring, maybe it's just me, i don't really know. But overall i would rate it something between 6-7 and if i could i would rate it 6.5, but if i have to pick between 6 and 7 i will go with 6. It's okay but it COULD be better.. at first sight this game is good, great and interesting but when you spend some time, and get used to it civilization become a little one-sided. i played through few days long time lot of hours in a row, finished few full games and it became boring. then after few days break i played lot of time again and it was good again then again boring. Contrary to the reputation I heard, it was a really boring game for me. The game has been running for a while, so it's dizzying to see a lot of information on the screen when you don't use it.. Long time Civ fan since the days of Civ 1. Each version I've played 100s of hours. This and Civ 3 are the only versions I'd give a thumbs down. The good: The graphics are great. There are some new decent tweaks to aspects of the game like culture, civics and golden ages. The bad: movement. The change to movement where trying to move into difficult terrain ends your movement, though it makes sense, sloooows the game down to a snails pace. Even a scout exploring the map is reduced to a tile a turn in diffcult terrain. And roads are practically useless until modern times and/or the railroad. You know roads are useless when your units ignore them when auto-moving across your empire. So moving across your empire in classic times, with roads, can take you 100s of years, I kid you not. 1 unit per tile. They did away with unit stacks in Civ 5 to avoid the doom stacks, and I didn't complain as much there. But here, topped with the slow movement rates, makes the movement worse. Units can't stack with friendly units so city state units are constantly in the way while aimlessly wandering the map, taking it even longer to move across your empire. You can't auto assign a military unit to protect a trade unit. You can't stack non-military units for some reason. I love how you need to remove a unit from a city just to buy or start construction of a new unit. AIs use of religion is just annoying and makes me want to quit everytime they ramp up sending countless missionary units to my empire. You can' t just close your borders to them like you do military units. The UI is disorganized and messy. It's harder to find simple city lists and yields from earlier games like Civ 5. Districts are a coll add but I had to download a mod to delete them if I change my mind and want to build somewhere else. User mods change a lot of simple issues that Firaxis has opted to ignore in favor of more expensive expansions. WE got a new civ every 5 years since Civ1 except we were due for a new one in 2021 but Firaxis added a yearly game-pass like expansion for Civ 6 instead of a new game. God help us if this is the last new Civ game because the core mechanics need a lot of work.. Shadow of former glory. This beloved franchise continues to take steps backward from its origins. What used to be a tactical strategy franchise for teens and adults has been dumbed down s that even a grade schooler can figure it out. This is clearly a desperate move by executives to score a few extra bonuses while they trash the franchise without a care in the world. Though I am all for making games for everyone, this is not a Civilization game any more and they should have called it something else but they knew that if they had, it would have likely flopped. So whats the problem with civ6? Same thing as civ5 and same problem as the old horrible game on the xbox360 calling itself civilizations. They once again chose to go with the single unit per tile approach and very few tactical options as you advance through eras. Combat is straight boring because its too easy and the AI is predictable to the point that the only way they could manage to make the game harder was to give the AI insane types of cheats. This is how you know a game is poorly designed. How bad are the cheats? Well aside from the just pure multipliers to unit strength and economic stuff, they also give the AI double to triple your starting resources. How bad does it cheat? Well even on normal difficulty (Prince) they get a boost to science, culture and faith as well as a big boost to production and economy and a free tech. THATS ON NORMAL and yet, despite the advantage... they are a total joke because they cannot make good choices and that doesnt change with higher difficulty. So how do you overcome horrible design? Give more bonuses which is literally the least fun way to design a tactical game. How bad does it get? You start with 1 settler and 1 warrior but the AI will start with up to 3 settlers, 5 warriors, and 2 builders! LoL. Thats how bad the design is and you know what makes this even sadder? Even on that difficulty it only took 2 tries for me to figure out how to beat them silly. Thats how bad the AI is. Further the 1 unit per tile approach shrinks the map immensely taking away from any sort of feeling of scale. This feels more like a horrible tactical RPG made for 8 year olds more than it does civilizations. Remember Final Fantasy Tactics? That was great right? Well this i FFT with less than half the units and 95% of the spells and abilities removed. Does that sound fun to you? Maybe when I was 2nd grade. I can go into all the other stuff that has been cut from the old games to make this more accessible to the masses but it would just depress me. Civilization the franchise seems to be dead if you are an adult looking for good tactical gameplay. It might be ok if you are super casual or very young. Otherwise skip this and dont bother with civ5 either. The last decent civ game was 4.. Best CIV ever. Incredible in all aspects. If you want a good strategic game this is the best choice.. Absolute wonder game. I have like 1000 hours of playing and I still wants to play. Highly recommended. Great game !!! I haven't played previous version but this one is highly enjoyable. very addictive very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. The game is absolutetly amazing! Multiplayer works fine most of the time, customization is amazing. Overall top CIV game.. a good continuation of the series, but I'm sticking with number five .. Poor english Degenerate ****. Ai is dumb as hell. Therefore game is easily boring. Only fun aspect is the sim city. Thats it. Thats **** for a game. Ai spawns are atrocious, always spawn directly next to player. If an ai spawns by itself on its own continent, the game is lost. Difficulty is the most degenerate **** design of this game. Ai gets cheat bonuses without getting smarter or difficult. Most higher difficulty games are ONLY challenging due to every AI attacking you upon contact. The moral of this game is haha you waste your time loser. A loss feels like a middle finger. A win feels jack shi due to the journey being insanely easy or absurdely stupid. The music is annoying as hell. constant loop for 4-5+ hours sessions which makes u mute it. Garbage game design. This game was released in 2016 and still buggy as hell. such as infinite loading when pressing end turn. constant crashes with updated graphics cards. Civ 6 does its best at telling you to shut the fk up and kill yourself. The leaders themselves are so poorly designed, unbalanced, garbage. Every game ends up either being science or domination victory due to poor ai combat skills and science being way too easy with no way to stop the final stage of science victory. The press conference is by far the most diabolical garbage in this game, dogsht. haven't met half the leaders in the game and expects you to vote for an ideological option.. except its designed to ruin your day as the ai will ALWAYS vote against you such as voting against bonuses against you or diplomatic wins. Its not 1 or 2 leaders. its EVERY leader who votes against you which makes this conference POINTLESS AF. I play on emperor difficulty as deity is full of **** but king is WAY TOO EASY. Half the game is getting rolled by AI and having to spend atleast 4 to 5 hours resetting. If an Ai gets science route and is on the final stage of the victory, YOU LOSE. DOGSHT GAME MECHANICS, Waste OF money and TIME. rant over, **** this gay game. Don't bother. The game's AI is so incredibly stupid it makes playing pointless. I was mindlessly building on Deity, from the get-go knowing that the AI will not be able to challenge in anything. I even installed mods that are supposed to fix this problem, to no avail. For some reason the barbarian AI actually tends to do better and I had games where it wiped out a bunch of civs. I've been playing Civ since Civ 2, and I can say thing the 6th installment is a mindless waste of time.. This is one of my favorite games of all time for Online Co-Op. I don't think the AI is particularly great but depending on settings it can vary from easy to truly difficult. Joining a friend to beat on some computer players is enjoyable and the gameplay mechanics are solid. There is a ton of variety with different civilizations and it is nice and immersive as the game progresses. For me this is about as close to perfect as video games come and definitely one of my top 5 in the last 30 years.. I could go on and on about how horrible the AI is, but I'd pretty much just be going over what's already been mentioned here plenty, the AI is SO awful that it absolutely ruins this game in every way possible, not going to even go into detail on all the AI related issues there are, but if you combine the bad AI with the lack of a well-done online multiplayer because there's no ranking system, no punishment for leaving, no stat tracking, no nothing, it's crazy you can't even explore ANY details of your gameplay history, how can you see if you improve? There's just so much lacking from the core of this game that it's slightly mind boggling how they allocate their development efforts to putting more civs and more features in the game. That's all cool and all, don't get me wrong, I like all the stuff that came out clear into early 2021. but the reality of it is the game is STILL a buggy mess. I've played it with several $2000+ dollar gaming pc's that I've built and my primary playing friend also has a top of the line PC, we've spent MANY HOURS trying all sorts of different things to get this thing to run smoothly, never once did we EVER reach turn 100 with just 2players without one of our games crashing, stalling, freezing, or some sort of issue that caused us to have to reboot the entire client, reload the game lobby, and start from an autosave. Very frustrating, there's so much potential here, just need someone to lead the efforts that can think bigger picture, they needed to tackle all the games ancillary stuff years ago instead of adding new little quirky things to the game. It makes me mad because I do enjoy the game, but it really needs someone running the show that knows what they're doing.. Sid Meier's series continues to dazzle us, history and Turn-Based Strategy addicts, with the 6th installment of the Civilization franchise. I admit I had played the previous ones, starting Civ2, but usually hadn't played more than several maps, usually just one. This time, with Civ6, it made no difference. However, the brightness and amplitude of the Civilization series is again in the front-line of gaming. It isn't a fast paced FPS, nor a MOBA, but if you are keen on building cities, nations and long term careers, this game is for you. I had some pleasant time spent playing Civilization 6 and I may be return to it, sooner or later, for another map with glorious historical leaders and well animated units.. At least it is a Civilization game. When Civ 6 was released, I was skeptical of the ugly cartoonish art style and the district system. After playing on iPad and now on PC (technically Mac), I am still skeptical. Though not as bad as Civ 3, Civ 6 has some of the worst changes in the series. The game kind of looks like Civilization, but instead of playing as some kind of world history, global conflict simulator, the game plays like a board game that has a too few many rules. Instead of government, you have card that you play. Government is essentially mea",the game features are more complex and there's more to learn . the AIs are poor at managing their empires and are too stupid to engage in rational diplomacy . the console version crashes late game .
622.Battlefield 1,"Probably one of the, if not, the greatest Battlefield game in awhile. Gun mechanics are beautiful, not fully realistic, but uses prototype weapons from WW1. Using tanks and planes feel flimsy, but powerful in the hands of good players, rewarding for good positioning and teamwork. Campaign was good, not much to say on it. Maps and atosphere are gorgeous, although coming out in late 2016, its graphics are still able to rival some of the newer FPS games. A timeless, unforgettable masterpiece.. One of the most immerive and beautiful fps games ever. It also has pretty good gameplay if you think tactically. There are many weapons/usables to try to keep you playing too (never played story mode). Great mission design and overall gameplay. I liked the singleplayer missions very much.. Battlefield is my first ever battlefield game, generally the game is worth it, kind off The campaign is a mix bag, from prologue and chapter 1 the campaign seems pretty solid, and then when it reached the final chapter. I think I found a fetish animation has a better story than the final chapter of Battlefield 1 More than that the atmosphere in general are pretty terrifying, not in a way that's ugly, but just grimy, dark, yet at the same time bright. Sound FX, Graphic FX are implemented well. With many attention to details that's just a chef kiss. Multiplayer is a mix bag as well, but generally recommended. It's pretty hard to grip onto it, but once you get used to the flow. You are generally getting better and better. The only thing I don't like it's the leveling up, it would take so many hours to level and get a new weapon. But even then, most are just gonna ended being your collection because you are already used to a flow of a weapon. But that's all just in my sake opinion, even after 8 years from its release. It's still hold up to this day, the campaign is half perfect, the multiplayer is solid.. Definitely the best game visually in recent Battlefields, even better than BF2042. Sniping is very satisfying, & overall very great game! Crazy to think this game released in 2016!. This game had the same hype I had when Battlefield 3 came out. They improved so much from Hardline. The graphics, the physics, the gameplay, the story are all so much better than the previous game. This game is definitely better than all of the games up to Battlefield 2042, I'm not sure about the future games because I can't tell the future.. my favorite online shooter game of all time, super immersive and fun with friends. I love this game just trying to even survive in a basement while you are being gassed by musard gas and grenades. My assessment of this game focuses on the single-player campaign because I couldn’t play online due to a lack of nearby servers and I couldn’t find an ""offline multiplayer against the CPU"" **** setting and graphics of this game are truly outstanding (even in 2024). The developers have achieved an incredible level of immersion with this title in the series. Everything seems very well thought out and consistent with the World War I era. It’s fascinating to see the technologies of the time in action and how they were managed. The campaign follows a ""war stories"" format, where the player can choose any of them to complete in any order they like (ranging from tank battles, airplane combat, desert assaults, and so on…). The characters are convincing and the voice acting is good. The level design mostly follows a ""battlefield"" style but always with elements geared towards a true ""campaign"" experience. I really missed having an offline multiplayer mode against bots for practice and enjoyment (and also to keep the game ""playable"" when the company shuts down the servers at some point). ""The war to end all wars"" ended nothing. This game's campaign mode perfectly represents the gut side of war. War isn't fun. War is hell. This game's campaign mode is the best I ever experienced in a video game. However, the multiplayer is what holding this game back. The servers, the hackers, the imbalanced weapons and maps. However, the imbalance of the map and weapons gave the perfect hopelessness. To watch your base inevitably lose while dying over and over, really got the WW1 vibes. The atmosphere and music perfectly suit the game as well. When the whistle blows, the next will be your head, which I enjoy every second of it.. The best Battlefield hands down, the gun mechanics, the maps and graphic are all well made with a perfect balance to create an amazing multiplayer WW1 experience. If you are a fan of WW1 or not, this game is one of the greatest FPS in the market today.. This is probably the ome game in the series that did everything right. The war stories are all fun, and each provide a different gameplay experience. The game itself is faithful to the historic period. And the multiplayer is definately one of the best in the series, despite being practically drained of players. Highly reccomend this one.. The best battlefield game that still remains the best to experience. Not only does the game offers an exceptional atmospheric experience that allows you to relive the battlefields of World War I, it also supports this with an extremely detail to it's weapons and gadgets that make your arsenal very special.. It's hard not to recognize how good this game is, even today - almost ten years later. I remember playing the beta and instantly falling in love with it. Hell, I remember the hype from the first trailer. Everyone talking about it, theorizing, etc. The graphics were mind-blowing, even on the Xbox One. The atmosphere was - or better... is - unmatched. The OST brings back many memories after all those years. Dude, I miss this game. But that's one of the good parts of having a good campaign. Even if there's no one playing it, you can have an amazing experience. I tried to play the BF4 campaign before and I just quit. Why? After beating it 5 times over years, the flaws became so visible. BF1, on the other hand, after beating a good amount of times either, remains amazing as the first time I played it.. It is honestly the best Battlefield game ever released in this planet. The Graphics and the atmosphere are out of this world. The Soundtrack is breathtaking and gives you feeling about the war and the nations which were included in the 1st WW. Good Job DICE. Started BF with the old but still good Bad company, and finished the franchise with BF 1, that it's, in my opinion, the best BF ever. Graphics are still beautiful, the campagn is very good despite being short, and the multiplayer is one of the best i ever seen in a game. 10/10, this is probably the last BF i'm gonna play, i know BF V have woke agenda, and BF 2042 is bad, so that's it. Goodbye Battlefield!. This is the best Battlefield in my opinion. It’s got amazing graphics, runs smooth, and most importantly, amazing gameplay.. Beautiful game!Last good battlefield game. Very epic battles! Every seconds is epic! Beautiful!. The game was great at almost everything, even though not the best battlefield game but it is the best first-person shooter game we’ve ever played. A unique environment with intense gameplay. Battlefield One's multiplayer shines through its ability to make the player feel that they are directly on the frontlines of the Great War. Gunplay is satisfying and offers a playstyle for anybody.. The best World War 1 game. The atmosphere, the stories, the online is just amazing. This game is still alive in 2024. You knew that feeling when throw gas grenade inside a bunker and the enemy goes out and your whole squad just executes them? OR the pure chaos that this game has? People running up and down in trenches, you rush with 4 other random soldiers, and boom, one of them dead, you 3 then get down on your stomach and just the chills about someone in the no mans zone trying to hunt you down. One time a plane tried to kamikaze me in online and i managed to prone down quickly and he hit the cliff. The secrets in this game! If you want real skins that are beautiful you have to decode real morse that is played in game! When you charge with a bayonet your soldier starts screaming from his soul and his ears starts ringing. Pure chaos. I tried out how many scream voice lines are there and it was a lot. if you buy this game, pick medic, and just while you run and heal people or just revive players and when then they say thank you you really feel like a soldier. I really love the fact that you play ""random soldiers"" in multiplayer. In operations you legit have the WW1 experience. You gain territory then the enemy has to fall back, and they try to defend in the next sector. The sound effects as they scream. really gives you chills. The tanks, the planes, the ships, the behemots, the kits, the freakin weapons are well made. If you just play the story you will get the best WW1 experience. The other is a movie and book called ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". each soldier is talking in his native language, this gives a really good immersion. The only sad thin that we cant play as Hungarian Soldiers.. One of the best multiplayer fps games of all time. The cinematic value of playing this is something I can't relate to with any other game.. Best war fps game of all time. Only cons are weird matchmaking and the lack of moderation.. Additional points cost $9,95 each •Basic bundle, 3 points, cost $25,95 •Premium bundle, 5 points, cost $45,95 •Ultimate bundle, 9 points, cost $75,95 •10/10 Points DLC*, includes review, cost $99,95** *If you bought 10/10 Points DLC, you're not eligible for refund. **note, 10/10 Points DLC requires 9/10 review.. A beautiful game, with a satisfying game sounds, weapons and overall awesome single player stories. The multiplayer has cheaters, but not that many. Still alive in 2024.. One of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s 7 years old now and still looks brand new due to graphics and playstyle. this was my first battlefield game, and i think its great. the ww1 setting really sold me on this game, and it works so well.. This game encapsulates the horrors of the First World War. It mixes historical accuracy with gameplay so the game isn't a waiting simulator inside a trench. The game continues to have the 4 signature classes from 4, each with weapons inspired by the great war. Since this game simply can't add an assault rifle, DICE creatively used prototype weapons, such as the Hellriegel, to fill these roles. There is plenty of variety in the maps, from the trenches of the western front to the mountains of Italy. Each map feels unique. Some maps encapsulate trench warfare, such as the Saint Quentin scar, while others are open fields in the middle east. Overall, the gunplay, graphics, and map variety as well as the limited historical accuracy made this game a 10/10, easily the best battlefield game in history.. A masterpiece from the Battlefield series in terms of both story and gameplay. It's my favorite ahead of the previous titles.. Certainly one of the worst war games out there. Tragic feeling of shooting. Haos. NO logic. Tank guys with flamethrowers. Idiotic AI behavior. Distorting historical facts. It's hard to say anything good about this game except for the graphics, which can also slow down at 144 fps.. It has very functional scenarios and good graphics. The career mode is interesting, where 5 different stories are told. However, the game is not as convincing as its rival Call of Duty WWII.. Ideology filled trash. Battlefield died after 4.. played. I'm late to the reviews...7 years to be exact! This IMHO is the best Battlefield game ever and I've played the majority of them. So many wonderful memories of the time I played non-stop for an entire weekend, and loved every single minute of it. The only thing I liked about the game was the graphics. I'm not interested in the online side. I didn't like the single player mode very much. The story was very boring and repetitive. It was an average game for me. Cod WW2 is definitely much better. BF games have never been able to make games with as deep and detailed cinematic narrative as COD games. BF 1's cinematics were terrible compared to COD WW2.. Battlefield 1 is often considered one of the best games in the Battlefield franchise, and with good reason. DICE has impressively captured the essence of World War I, delivering a level of authenticity and immersion that many players praise. The transition to the World War I era was a bold shift for the series, and the successful execution won over critics and fans **** graphics in ""Battlefield 1"" are truly impressive, featuring a high level of detail in the environments, characters and weapons. Visual fidelity adds depth to the experience and contributes to immersion. From the destroyed battlefields to the stunning scenery, every visual aspect of the game is meticulously crafted.Immersion is one of the great strengths of ""Battlefield 1"". The game immerses players in the trenches, tragic battles and brutality of the First World War. The impactful soundtrack, realistic sound effects, and authentic ambiance create an intense, moving atmosphere that allows players to feel the weight and urgency of the **** game features a single-player campaign divided into different ""War Stories"", each offering a unique perspective on the First World War. These tales, based on real historical events, provide a penetrating look at the different battlefronts and different aspects of the war. This contributes to a deeper appreciation of the history and challenges faced at that time.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. A true masterpiece in its category. The story and narration is great, it gives the feeling of reality and real war.. Battlefield 1 is a great game, I was actually waiting to play it for two reasons, sadly, two reasons which ended up being based around falsehoods. First reason was that I heard the main campaign **** and was tackled on, by the numbers, and boring. Second reason, was that I heard you couldn’t skip the cutscenes in the game, which I personally don’t mind that much for my first playthrough, but this is something that really hurts replayability, as well as the option to ignore the story in case it isn’t for me, or it ends up being, just, plain, bad. Turns out, in the end, the campaign is actually pretty good and done with care, and you sure as hell can skip cutscenes in the game. This is a good thing all things considered, mainly because of how re-playable some of these stages are with a number of collectibles and codex entries to find, as well as because the game features three levels of difficulty and a wonderful game design that prioritizes the player’s freedom on how to tackle their objectives, rather than a guided journey, in which you’re just left to follow directions and/or orders (looking at you Aliens Dark Descent). The story basically follows five different sides of World War 1, focusing on a number of well-known fighters, although some focus more in smaller scale adventures, trying to mystify the journeys of tank commanders and air force pilots, you can play through these missions at your own leisure, but there is an order to follow according to the numbering of each, although the stories don’t really have a continuity between them; for the most part each campaign is evenly paced given that the stories at the most have around five or four missions each, totalling around 30 minutes to an hour for each campaign, depending on your speed and selected level of difficulty. What I really like about these campaigns was the variety as well as the focus of each mission, some are more emphatic in showcasing the motivations behind each soldiers enlisting, while in other cases they’re stories about the brutality of war, or the camaraderie between brothers in arms, is really cool from a narrative perspective because it keeps things going. But this transcends to gameplay as well. For the most part Battlefield’s 1 campaign, remains a shooter, you run around between encounters taking down enemies, but there are some cool mechanics to keep things fresh; for starters, the game added a very simple, but welcomed, stealth system, in which you can get silenced weapons from time to time, or distract enemies for inevitable takedowns, these sequences reminded me to those from the Wolfenstein series of games, essentially serving as a prelude to the actual fight, although there are times in which you can skip through certain fights just by stealthing your way through them, which was highly satisfying as well. There are also weapon tents throughout the levels, these held crates with different types of equipment, like better weapons or better explosives and/or tools, it’s pretty cool, adds variety, and makes it so you’re in the lookout for these things. Taking about explosives, I want to add that Battlefield 1 reintegrated the destructible system from the Bad Company games, in turn, there were numerous times where I had to either change my cover, or found myself in better, more advantageous positions after the enemy shot the roof on which I was standing, sending me crashing down into a house for better cover, to give an example. These missions are also coupled with some vehicle sections which, in my opinion, are the worst aspect of the campaign, is not that they’re bad, but they’re not nearly as dynamic as when you’re on foot, it’s nice that a lot of the times you can use these vehicles in the middle of the battle, like going in an out of a tank, or using horses to travel long distance areas, but it can also get quite tedious if I’m just locked into a tank, or a plane, and about the only highlight of the experience is the destructible systems, this is specially apparent in the airplane campaign in which, because of a tutorial -that I think was highly unnecessary at that-, you’re forced into subsequent plane missions, thankfully these gets better paced after a couple of missions in that campaign but still; I would’ve much rather prefer what they did in the tank encounters, in which you got to be in tank, but there were also sections where you just had to roam around or look after the tank, playing around with the vehicle strengths and weaknesses, all the while affecting the gameplay. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience with Battlefield 1, the plane campaign could’ve been better paced, but generally I really thought it was a fine experience and one that I really, really liked.. Played this in beta and it was a mess, thought I'd try it out again after seeing so many people regard it as one of the best battlefields, it's still not worth your time. Dying simulator with the worst guns, customization and maps of any Battlefield I've played. Based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, I will give it a rating of 7.. Story and gameplay both near perfection, i can't believe how they went from 1 to 5 and 42 they took what made this game so great and didn't include on 5 and 42. Very good game, that presents the setting in a serious manner. Well crafted maps and highly detailed characters and weapons, along with beautiful graphics and sound design make an extremely immersing experience. The battlepack system leaves some to be desired, but the benefit of hindsight shows that it could have been much worse. The last good Battlefield game. Campaign wise I often forget this game has a campaign, as Multiplayer is spectacular and often overshadows the campaign, rightfully so. If I was rating this just for the campaign it would easily be a 5/10.. Battlefield 1 takes players on a thrilling and immersive journey through the harrowing battles of World War I. With its breathtaking visuals, intense multiplayer action, and a well-crafted single-player campaign, the game offers a unique and memorable experience that stands out in the first-person shooter genre. Visually, Battlefield 1 is a masterpiece. The game's stunning graphics and attention to detail bring the war-torn landscapes and iconic battlefields of World War I to life. From the muddy trenches of the Western Front to the vast deserts of the Middle East, every environment feels authentic and meticulously designed. The single-player campaign in Battlefield 1 is a standout feature. Rather than focusing on a single protagonist, the game presents a collection of War Stories, each highlighting a different character and their unique perspective on the war. This approach provides a diverse range of experiences, from pilot dogfights in the skies to gritty infantry combat on the ground. The emotional narratives and immersive storytelling make each War Story engaging and memorable. Multiplayer is where Battlefield 1 truly shines. The large-scale battles featuring up to 64 players create chaotic and adrenaline-fueled gameplay. The variety of maps, modes, and vehicles ensures that no two matches are the same. Whether you're storming the beaches in Conquest mode or engaging in intense close-quarter combat in Operations, the multiplayer experience is exhilarating and addictive. The introduction of Behemoths, massive vehicles that can turn the tide of battle, adds an extra layer of excitement and strategy. Whether you're piloting an armored train or commanding a battleship, the Behemoths provide a unique and dynamic gameplay element that keeps matches interesting. While the gameplay in Battlefield 1 is solid overall, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from reaching perfection. Occasionally, the spawn system can be frustrating, placing players in the line of fire or far away from the action. Additionally, some weapons and gadgets feel unbalanced, requiring further tweaking for optimal gameplay. Despite these minor flaws, Battlefield 1 offers a captivating and immersive experience that pays homage to the sacrifices and heroism of World War I. The game's stunning visuals, engaging single-player campaign, and addictive multiplayer make it a must-play for fans of the first-person shooter genre. Overall, Battlefield 1 earns a well-deserved 8/10 rating. It's a thrilling and immersive journey through one of history's most significant conflicts, delivering an unforgettable gaming experience for both solo players and multiplayer enthusiasts alike.. Battlefield 1 is a wonderful game that does a lot of things right. The multiplayer is very good and many maps are good. The only thing that bothers me is the EA Launcher.. Probably the best Battlefield i played(aside from moded BF2), the gunplay doesnt **** like 1942 and 2; the UI isnt atrocious and full of garbage like 3, 4 and 2042; the maps are small but they make it up by looking good unlike the blandness of Bad Company, and with great performance. The immortal horses, all the automatic weapons and females wokeness might trigger you at first, but you soon ignore it because the game is just fun. I never bothered with the campaign though.. Multiplayer is very fun and the game looks amazing I won't be commenting on the campaign since i haven't played it. Honestly the best game I’ve personally ever played! Game has historical accuracy and amazing attention to detail. The game has so much heart and soul in it it feels like I bought a person instead ****. Never will there be a game that I love as much as BF1.. (Campaign only) + Interesting locations + Still beautiful graphics - Terrible AI behaviour - Rather weak mission design - Very short. It's a much better game than other battlefield games. The fact that the game is fluent, multiplayer and beautiful graphics drew me in. Very average game. The story is neither good nor bad, just like every Battlefield story, and the multiplayer is also nothing special.. Decent game. The story is so --so, scoring is great, visual is amazing, the voice & sound is also amazing. Fine game and a nice change of time period for this franchize. I'd welcome better single-player campaign though.. Game with the best immersion I've ever played. The soundtrack is incredible. Best than BF 5 and 42.. On the surface a pretty solid modern FPS. If you are fan of these type of games there is nothing wrong with it and has good enough gameplay. Where it falls down for me is the branding of it being a WW1 game when it's completely ahistorical and really just a WW2 game with some tweaking.. in my opinion this is the best battlefield there is, I have fun every time I start the game. Great mission design and overall gameplay. I liked the singleplayer missions very much.. The Game has a nice Soundtrack a good Multiplayer and it gives you the feeling to be in this war and it looks good better than Bf 2042. Great game and good storyline, compelled by online mode though. Accurate and fun to play with friends. In scenarios, we cannot experience the feeling of discovery by walking around beautifully designed maps. The game tries to get you to certain goals quickly. I finished all stories in 1 day. And it did not satisfy me in any way. But the game's storytelling is very good.. I used to be a COD fan when I played Modern Warfare 2 back then and I used to buy every COD after that , but they weren't as good. So I decided to try Battlefield for once. Battlefield 1 came out and after some minutes in I realised that Battlefield games were on another level than Call of Duty. I couldn't believe what I had been missing all these years. At first I was like ""oh look at these old weapons, it must be so lame"". But then I fell in love with it. This game is one of the best shooters of all time. Good game, visually stunning, but stupid IA in the single player. 7.5 for me.. I bought this game way after it came out and the graphics still stand up today. The maps are full of detail and there are a variety of weapons. However the snipers are very annoying. But you can run into the b objective building in the argonne forest map with a mine and place it down and blow up 10 people at once so it's pretty good.. Besides the general look of the game graphics, sounds, and whatnot. the game play falls short from the previous titles. played Bad company 2 for 500+ hours, BF3 for 700 hours, and this game for 80 hours and I'm already sick of it. Multiplayer is rage inducing experience nothing will works out the way you think it would. spawn camping seems easier on this one than other ones, and the maps… ExpaBesides the general look of the game graphics, sounds, and whatnot. the game play falls short from the previous titles. played Bad company 2 for 500+ hours, BF3 for 700 hours, and this game for 80 hours and I'm already sick of it.

One of my favourite games of all time, with regard to the superb gunplay, gun and soldier feel, and map design. Love this game, rebought it on PC recently in 2022 - servers are still full of people and its easy to find a game - and am SO glad I did buy this again! If in doubt, 2022 is a brilliant time to buy this on PC. If you have not played many games, this feels a lot like battlefield V, which I also enjoy massively. Highly recommended.. Hackers-infested multiplayer. It would be a great game without the usual hacker problems.. Best Battlefield game since Battlefield 2 possibly the best in the entire series. Worth every penny, DICE can have my first born too. Will be pouring hundreds of hours into this game for sure.. Worst FPS I've ever played and I played a lot of them. The campain is pathetic, it's railroaded without any room for the manouver, and the cutscenes and dialogue are cringe inducing. What's even worse, is the multiplayer. This pathetic excuse **** allows for more cheating than CS. Your skills just don't count in this game, it favors cheaters and hackers. The UI is a hot mess. The options are a million and meaningless. Most of the maps are the opposite of fun, so poorly designed and heavily favor one side over the other. If fails as a fps shooter, it fails as a battlefield simulator, it fails in every aspect. This crap **** isn't worth any money. There are many free shooters better in every aspect than this. Every person who likes this game is either a liar, a crackhead or a cheater.. Head-shot sound is better than watching my son grow up and making me proud.. Mediocre at best, the story isnt that touching its a quite bulky size and the gameplay is subpar. Fps franchises like Call of Duty that offer much better gameplay and story. The disk space isnt worth it, reconsider before buying.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You start off the game directly in the frontlines and die in different ways with no hope of survival which prepares you for the rest of the game. The game is a collection of short stories told from different perspectives. Some stories are very dark and leave you with no hope and show the life of soldiers during WW1. The graphics are jaw-droppingly beautiful and very well optimized. The missions vary a lot giving different playstyles, which gives trying different combat and approach the front-row. Every story ends with amazing music which I loved the most.. Hi fellow gamers, Wanted to review Battlefield 1 since I recently bought it, lunar year sale Origin. Game has very beautiful graphics, map design is ok.. game mechanics, specially gun mechanics are very bad, yet more frustrating. As an experienced player with more then years of gaming experience, my stake on BF1 is barely casual gameplay, tactically nullified experience. Tactics and thinking in this game isnt giving players an edge.. you can take strategic position, see an enemy in an open field, totally flanked start firing with all the recoil compensation as possible and its better if you had run straight at enemy shooting smg from the hip 30-40 meters away, cuz it wont make a difference. Game is basically how much you horde and how much lead you shoot out + revive, its disappointing. From a game that had recoil and spread pattern for every individual weapon of its own you get to play a game where only sniper hits where it actually aims. If you want to do good forget about this game, if you however take it as like to fly around in pieces by overly packed enemies and explosives while enjoying graphics, well this is your game for doing good isnt rewarding, being experienced is even less rewarding. Games arent what they have been, at least FPS shooting is bad, its all hype, so im considering for a long time now to play singleplayer only, its getting on my nerves anyway. BF1 did good in one, to open my eyes and realize that pointing and shooting is different from aiming and shooting, the thing i wont sure forget lol. Its Gorgeous looking... Just... awsome... you need to play this game now!!!!. Game servers with no scope, no shotguns, no machineguns, just with simple bolt action rifle with iron sight are really good, and make sense of WW1. But standard servers are not interesting, Good physics and environment action by the way.. I love the way Battlefield portrays war. In BF1 it was done very very well. The opening sequence where the game puts you in a few different situations, and every time you die you get a full name and the birth and death year. I think the reason they do this is to show you that the people who died are all real, they had life and it ended in an instant. This is one of the most impactful things I think the game does, it really left an impact on me. WW1 was a horror, there are many horrible ways you can die in the game, I think the campaign is very well done. Graphics and level design are unreal. Battlefield does big open battles the best. The map destr","Definitely one of the, if not, the greatest Battlefield game in awhile . campaign was good, not fully realistic, but uses prototype weapons from WW1 . graphics are still able to rival some of the newer fps games ."
623.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door,"I loved this game. I was able to connect with most of the characters mainly due to the depth that the developers put into them. Each section really feels like a separate chapter in a book. The combat can feel repetitive at times but the bosses were each unique.. The humor is great for a Mario game and I also recommend the original even after this one.. I’m really glad this game was rereleased, because Nintendo is finally acknowledging the nostalgia for the GameCube. The Thousand-Year Door is a great game, and one that I’ve been wanting to play for a while due to its reputation. I was also curious to see how I’d look at it compared to The Origami King, which I also enjoyed, and if my opinion on that game would change. One thing TTYD does really well is characterization and writing, as there are lots of great characters Mario will befriend and add to his party. There’s merit to most if not all the characters in battle, and their varied designs and personalities make the adventure feel a little more special. Some villains aren’t just one-offs, either, as many keep resurfacing until the end of the game and it makes them feel like more of a threat. Another thing the game does well is have an actual battle system that gives you more than just coins. Battles are set up like a play, with an active audience that can help or hurt you in a few different ways. They can fill up your star power that allows you to do special moves and they can potentially give you items, but they can also throw things at you and get on stage themselves to create more chaos. It’s just enough to add a little element of surprise from time to time and it’s not intrusive in any way. With the EXP earned from battles you can upgrade your max health, max flower points (which also allow you to do special moves), or max badge points, which allow you to equip a plethora of badges that provide things like more attack or defense, new moves, or new outfits. I will never understand why battle systems were thrown out the window after this game, because Intelligent Systems provided a great formula and then decided that EXP is old news for some reason. This is an obvious win over TOK, but to be honest, I think TOK had better designed environments. In that game, areas were very open ended and it felt great exploring them from top to bottom and uncovering all the secrets; it made that game feel very alive and to me, made up for the useless battle system. This doesn’t mean that the environments in TTYD are bad by a long shot, but they feel a bit more condensed and linear, aiding the overall narrative more. This works well on a first visit, but some environments aren’t particularly fun to explore after you’ve already completed a chapter since there isn’t always much to see. Some chapters are more fun than others, as chapter 3 is spent entirely in an arena and pretty much only consists of battling enemies to get to the top of the ranks, and despite the rather intriguing mystery surrounding it, the gameplay wasn’t exactly stellar. There’s also a moment in chapter 7 that requires you to revisit each previous area to look for a character only to take you back to the current area, which was a bit drawn out. There are certainly highlights, though, such as chapter 4 where you need to defeat a shapeshifting ghost after he took your identity and turned all the villagers into pigs, and the main town and its underground are fun to keep finding new secrets in after getting more abilities. Overall, I think TTYD is the better overall game, and I hope more people buy it to show what kind of future we want for Paper Mario. TOK is still a good game with plenty of its own merits, but I’d rather them commit to a flat out adventure game with no turn based battles or give us another RPG with a competent battle system. I don’t know what to expect, but this game is good and I’m glad I didn’t have to splurge on an original copy. 8.5/10. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a masterclass in blending humor, creativity, and solid RPG mechanics. Its charming storybook world, lovable characters, and innovative gameplay have cemented its place as one of Nintendo’s finest games. Whether you’re a longtime fan or new to the series, this game is an unforgettable adventure that’s as fun today as it was upon release.. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is, for me and many others, the best Paper Mario game. It improved on the things that made the original Paper Mario so great (battle system, story, characters etc.). Although I'm not the biggest Paper Mario fan and I also see the one big problem that the game has, the paths that are sometimes far too long, which have a negative impact on chapters 4 and 7 in particular, I still like this game and definitely recommend playing it. 9,1/10. This should be Looked at as the gold standard for GameCube remasters. I had a smile on my face from start to finish even tho I had already experienced the game years ago. The fresh coat of paint and the quality of life improvements were all that were needed to make this a modern gem.. This is slightly overhyped. I don’t have any nostalgia for this game. Maybe that’s why I didn’t have that great a time with it. It’s okay though.. Overall a good game that kept me entertained enough to reach the end. I just thought the combat and exploration could've had an extra shade of complexity and sometimes the pacing drags a bit.. Simply amazing! This is the game that got my wife and two young kids into game! Love it. A game that meant a lot to me this year for personal reasons…. Can’t think of anything more impactful.. Anyone giving this game a negative review not entirely sure why you're even complaining or bothered to write a review. With that being said this is probably one of my favorite games that I've played this year, especially in a year that in my opinion has been a bit weak in terms of overall variety. I never got to finish this game when it first was released on the gamecube. So I'm glad that this game got remastered for the switch console. Story: Relatively solid story with a few unexpected twists and turns, and a great cast of sidekicks and villains. The humor helps the story too. Music: Good music, and you can use the old music if you want too, but for me the remaster does a great job of updating and making it sound much better. Design: The game is shiny and colorful, I didn't have complaints with the 30fps as it's not really noticeable in a game like this. Only complaint is really the amount of backtracking that you have to do as some of the levels were designed around the idea of backtracking. Ruins the pace of the game at times and thus makes some of the chapters a bit weaker. I think that is a fair complaint of the game, but potentially a product of game design back then. Combat: good variety of enemies, and you have enough movesets/abilities where combat doesn't get stale. It is funny though how this game has such low damage numbers and overall stats, video games today generally don't do this. Overall, a great game. I do hope we get another paper mario game soon.. I owed a GC back in the day but I did not have the chance to play it as a teenager, what a pity. Nowadays I have enjoyed it on Switch, it is so much fun, but I am sure my 14yo me would have really loved it on GC!. The game is amazing; Nintendo did a great job bringing it back to the scene. The only point I didn't enjoy was the sidequests, which sometimes are a bit boring.. Great game all in all. Great Story, great Npcs, great battle system, (mostly) great worlds. The only reason im giving a 9 is that i enjoy the first game a bit more.. This game feels like a 20-year old game. There is a lack of QOL features we're used to in present day and so much bloat and backtracking that I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over. After not liking Mario RPG and this, I think I'm done with Mario rpgs.. All the problems i have with it could be easily solved by fast travel. If the characters had bigger development and as i said fast travel would be there, it would be 10/10 but sadly it is not. Best mario game and its not even close-. This game is still a banger, and I completed it here as well as back on the Gamecube. I genuinely miss the thoughtfully written characters, bonkers story, and slightly anarchic sense of humor the Paper Mario games used to have. How clever of Nintendo to rerelease two of the greatest Mario RPGs on Switch, only to accentuate how terrible the past two decades of Mario RPGs have become.. This game is amazing. Genuenly one the best games ever made. If someon tells you this game is bad, please it isn't. The only problem with this game is the backtracking which is just a tas **** it absolutely isnt enough to make the make the game any less than my second favorite game of all time. Please play it. You wont regret your money or your time.. I played OG, and back then I couldn't say I like it. Thinking that I was not in the right mood, I decided to check the remake. And I could not see why this game is considered to be better than the first Paper Mario, and best of the Mario RPG series. – Graphics in this game are just OK. I'd prefer to see a visual style like in Origami King. And the game falls short in the aspect of art style compared to the first Paper Mario. – Narrative is boring. 80% of dialogues are dull and cliched, making them a chore to read. I stopped bothering with them around 3rd Chapter. Only 4th chapter brought any enjoyment - filled with charm and humor that is proper to the PM. – Battle system is mostly the same as in the first game, but expanded and it's much easier now, which makes it far less engaging. No moments that require you to think hard about how to defeat your enemies and not to lose. I didn't bother to finish it. Made it to the final chapter, and halfway through just gave up.. I want to see more from the developer and this world in particular. But in terms of gameplay, it needs more content, more variation, and a greater sense of affecting the world to be a fully engaging experience.. Best Paper Mario game and by far my favorite RPG. Fun and filled with creative ideas, a great storyline and more! This remake has great graphics and is playable portable. Most underrated game 2024. A turn based 10/10. Greatest mario game in terms of scale, characters, story, and even music tbh. Excellent rpg that proved that mario can be more unique if Nintendo actually tries. Since the gamecube release, I've heard nothing but good things about this game. I figured I'd try it and this turned out to be one of the worst games ever. I just came from Mario RPG, which is one of the best games ever loved the SNES version. So I was beyond disappointed with this. Let's start with combat. Its absolutely terrible. There's no strategy nor is there a challenge. I noticed this when trying original paper mario how bad the combat went from mario RPG to this. The numbering system with HP and damage is ridiculous. now you havelow vales of 1-10 opposed to higher numbers. Numbers aside the combat is just SO boring. I barely used any items whatsoever. Just terrible The story and characters are next on this s*** list. Here's the most aggravating thing about this game; THE DIALOGUE. I have never wanted a skip button so bad in a game. It CONSTANTLY interrupts the flow of the already abysmal game but it never ends. Every few steps huge dialogue scenes. And to top it off with the story is so bad and uninteresting that it really is the worst part. The characters are so forgettable compared to mario RPG. Graphics and music forgettable. Paper theme? i can understand with N64 limits but at this point its not necessary. Backtracking through the setting to get an item was lame. In summary, everything about this game was terrible. I beat it, i was so happy when it ended. I know it's being compared to Mario RPG, however, that is how an RPG is done correctly. Leave it to square to help in that aspect, otherwise this is just a children's boring pop-up book style ""rpg."" If you're like me and kept hearing how great it is do yourself a favor, save $60 and your time don't even bother.. Just finished Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door on Switch. I really enjoyed it. I never played the original so I'm always glad when remakes come around like this. This is my first Paper Mario at all actually. Took me around 36 hours to finish, quite a longer game than I thought for something like this.. A true gem, and my favorite work around the Mario-verse, and even in 2024 this NGC game is still pertinent. The RPG mechanics are not proeminent as each zones brings you a new dimension to explore and unfolds the story in its own way. The artistic direction is cute and clean. The main strengths are concentrated on 2 elements I think : the characters (playable or not) are so colorful and somewhat exotic compared to what Nintendo used us to in most of their works, and the fact that the story is classic but its narration, the way it unfolds just feels great in so many ways. Juste a little cons concerning the sidequests which are somewhat bland and often ask numerous back and forths. A true gem, and it's nice to play without having to pay the awful price of the NGC original version.. This game was such a fun and addictive experience with its engaging turn-based combat that rewards precise button presses when performing an attack/skill/guard along with how it introduces the player to a variety of unique environments, scenarios and characters. Obtaining collectables was also a treat with certain items/areas being initially unobtainable due to us missing a certain skillset/party member that is made available as we progress through the story. The colors were vibrant, art direction and animation with the paper theme was creative, the characters and dialogue were quirky and hilarious to the point where I found myself laughing at certain points in the game and it had so much variety in terms of what you were able to do in the game. Besides the combat & collecting items, there's a badge mechanic which allows you to have extra skills & buffs according to what badge you have equipped, you could even cook up your items to make better items, go play at the ""casino"" to get cool items, go fulfill people's requests which can range from just getting a certain item delivered to using a badge to trick someone, and many more! It was such a fun and exhilarating experience where I was constantly entertained by the new scenarios I got myself into and I recommend that everyone go play it! It is a must play in my book!. Perfection remake of all mario remakes games i love it so much. Good graphics. I didnt play the original game, but I was so impressed by this game on Nintendo Switch. The visual style is amazing, the gameplay is different but may look a little bit slow, but it offers you very different levels and good jokes! P.S. Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise a gamer, but they managed it.. Brought me right back to the good old days. Brought me right back to the good old days.. One of my absolute favorite games of all time got remade. This is Super Goddamn Mario at his peak. A lot of the writing for this game was changed. Normally when this happens for a video game that is remade it is for the worse, however they really nailed it. The original left a couple of gaps in the narrative and the extra bit of effort to rewrite some things for this really pulled it together. Just like the Super Mario RPG remake, every aspect that was changed was a change that I enjoyed. TTYD was one of the first turn-based RPGs that I played that made me fall in love with the genre and honestly it holds up extremely well. The use of smaller numbers really makes it that much more impactful when you see double digits for the first time. One small complaint that I have about this game, and note that this is really only if you are going for 100% completion, is the amount of backtracking required. I should not have to go to Hooktail Castle more than three times. The remake did make travel a lot easier but even with that change I still have to go through nearly the entirety of that damned place 4 separate times. That said though that is small potatoes compared to the feast that is this game. A game I can recommend to nearly everyone.. Now i understand why Paper Mario fans praise this game so much, it really is a masterpiece! The characters are all so fun and creative, the game's humor is really spot on! You really do create a genuine connection between your partners which makes the whole journey worth **** gameplay is what you'd expect from an RPG. Turn-based battles with different attacks that spend your flower points, items that can be used, and special moves that can be used when you gather enough enthusiasm from the audience in your battle. Outside battle, you solve a variety of puzzles with the moves Mario has with his jumps and hammer attacks, plus the ones that his partners can do. In the game, you explore around 7 different places in order to collect Crystal Stars, all of which with different NPCs, bosses, enemies, puzzles, and many more.Overall, the game is a ""must play"" for any Mario fan out there, and it's good to see it being accessible (officially) again with the Nintendo Switch remake, which refurbishes a lot of the original contents of the game with new and improved looks.. Glorious return to form for the old paper Mario games that we as gamers actually loved. I do not know the original. So my opinion is not biased by the ""good old times"". I think they got to close to the original in some cases. More quality of life advancements could have been introduced. My biggest critics here are: - Dialogues can not be skipped - Items are not stackable - Items can only bought one at a time - No fast travel via in-game map - No setting for skipping fight intro and outro exists. You have to watch all that stuff at the beginning and end of an fight. The first 3 times that's quite nice, but after that it's just annoying. - No setting for faster fight animations. I mean, even GameFreak was able to implement that in Pokemon. The game itself is not the best but not the worst either. A lot of backtracking and unnecessary time consuming stuff. It looks quite nice. If this would be a new game and not a remake of a ""classic"", the critics would be more honest. (Sorry for typos and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language and DeepL has some problems right now^^).. Simply put, this is the best Mario RPG ever made! Such rich storylines coupled with an all time battle system for any RPG, this game is everything and more! The remake on the Nintendo Switch of an all time Gamecube original, went above and beyond to faithful remake every aspect of this game from the ground up in level design, new sprites for characters, time saving alterations for backtracking and more. If you love the Paper Mario series for what it truly is supposed to be; Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door on Nintendo Switch is the way to go!. The legend among legends, peak fiction, a masterclass of videogames, the G.O.A.T.. The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a true gem **** that effortlessly weaves together a tapestry of classic adventure with a touch of whimsical magic. With its stunning 2D art style, fluid gameplay, and catchy music, it feels like stepping into a living, breathing world where every pixel is a testament to the power of imagination. Mario's journey through this mystical portal is not just a tale of courage and perseverance, but a celebration of friendship and the indomitable spirit of adventure. It's a masterpiece that has stood the test of time, a beacon of joy and creativity that continues to shine brightly in the hearts of gamers everywhere.. This is the best paper mario game along with paper mario 64, very fun!!!!!!. Although I cannot order my favourites between the Original, TTYD and Origami King, it is easy to understand why TTYD is considered by most the greatest Paper Mario game ever.. I never was a RPG fan, I never experimented RPGs before. I grew up with the Nintendo wii and never had GameCube games to play. Eventually I bought and loved Mario and Luigi, then later Mario RPG. I saw the community get super excited when PMTTYD got a remake announcement. I bought it to see why people loved Paper Mario and I was shocked. The gameplay is phenomenal and the characters have actually have stories and feelings. The bosses are perfectly challenging for where each boss is placed in the story. Only complaints are that certain bosses are a little difficult to find especially after waiting for the in game emails. Also the biggest issue is that Luigi is only a character you can talk to in-between chapters. Luigi books are good though so it is ok. (I was legally required to name my Yoshi Luigi out of sheer respect). Fun RPG shows you that the Gamecube years were reknowned for its games, more so than its console. The remastered version is instantly playable and allows you to experience this modern classic. However, the game does show its age, with a lot of backtracking galore, courtesy of the Gamecube's 'limited' storage capacity. Still a great addition to your collection.. To the surprise of no people, this remake is fantastic just like the original. I loved everything about this, from the charming story, the lovable characters, the catchy music, everything.. This game has in fact stood the test of time and is honestly a great example of how an rpg can be both simple, accessible, and still highly enjoyable. This game did not stand the test of time and did not deserve to be remade. The turn-based combat feels out of place in this game as compared to the original Paper Mario and feels more like it needs the platformer-style used in Super Paper Mario. I find it hard to feel absorbed in the world when you get **** to an alternate dimension every time you look at an enemy. I found myself spamming “Run Away” more than battling as there is no incentive to do so later in the game. Alongside this, much of the story involves walking back and forth and retracing your steps over and over again, making a good 15 minutes of each chapter just walking with no enemies. What’s more is that your power doesn’t scale with the enemies, making battles more tedious than rewarding. Some dialogue is absolutely pointless but are incredibly long, repeat, or are required to hear more than once, and this game, unlike most RPGs with this style of dialogue, doesn’t feature a button to go through dialogue without the long text animation. In addition to this, the bosses are all sub-par. Every boss I encountered, possibly excepting the ones in the early-game, had “powers” that simply made it impossible to battle for several minutes, turning what was anticipated to be a thrilling boss battle to a boring waiting game. This is the matter for most bosses, even including the final boss. This game doesn’t do everything bad, though. Some of the characters are fun and interesting, the music in Twilight Town, that chapter’s battle music, and the “peace returns” music are all very good, even some of the other music in the game isn’t, and the art style is incredible. However, the game never pushes any boundaries and remains bland, changing tone or theme rarely if at all, reminding me more of modern Paper Mario games rather than the other games in the original trilogy. That is why I would rate this game a three out of ten: not worth the wait.. Excellent rpg and one of my absolute favorite Mario games of all time! Highly recommend!. I loved all these unique characters that you’d normally never really see in something safe and recognizable like Mario. Favorite game growing up and still love it after revisiting in this modern age. Fantastic game and as my first ever Mario game, this has set one heck of a bar. I have no nostalgia for this and can say that I can see why people like this game, I however do not see the grand appeal. The start of the game was fun and memorable, towards the end it becomes a slog, since the only things you can upgrade are HP, Flower Points, and Badge Points. There's not much in the way of customization with your adventure and as you get higher in levels the enemies drop less and less xp. Sure you can compensate the lack of attack and defense with badges, but when they cost 6 and 5 BP to equip them means you have to level up 4 times to increase them by one, and that's just for Mario, not his partners. Sure the partners have a different way to get stronger by ranking them us with shine sprites which unlocks new moves, it still is not enough, just like with Mario you'll have to level up 4 times to increase there attack and defense by 1. You do get items that can increases Mario's attacks, but with out badges you'll spend way to long in battles. Then there are enemy attack that do a straight damage regardless of your defenses. The worlds them selves are fun and unique but there are some parts that are really annoying and require you to back track a few times just to move on and some that if you fail will send you back to the beginning of the room your in when you mess up once, this wouldn't bother me as much if the rooms weren't so long. But the worst of all is that you can kind of soft lock yourself is you are not prepared having you redo boss fights if you don't invest your level up paints just right or don't have items, meaning you'll have to reload your save and have to go though the world twice to get items or respect your level points, which I an glade that there is a place you can reassign your points from one stat to another. To some up my opinion of this game, its a fun games during the beginning but towards the later half becomes a slog that feels like it punishes you for not investing your points just right or for not being prepared. if you enjoy this game, good for you but for me the fun ran out somewhat quickly.. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's remake stands tall as one of the series' pinnacles, boasting a visually stunning reimagining of the original art style. However, while the game's charm and ingenuity remain intact, the transition to 30 fps impacts combat responsiveness. Despite this, the title's engaging story, world-building, and clever puzzles consistently delight, though repetitive backtracking, particularly in the second and last dungeons, can dampen the experience. The game's overall length, while filled with captivating content, might overstay its welcome for some.. I lost all hope originally when the new games kept having this bizarre gimmicky play style, but this remake is giving me lots of hope for the future. Contrary to what others might say, I think this is the most unique Mario game that introduced the idea of the games having a more involved story and different environments. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Don't adjust your mirrors, this is really happening guys. The Paper Mario series is finally getting the respect it deserves with a fully fleshed out Nintendo Switch Remake of the Thousand Year Door. It's not Sticker Star and it's beautiful. I'll be honest when Origami King was first released, I was delighted but concerned for the future of this series. The game itself was fun, but its creativity was held back by its limited world building consisting of a legitimate paper universe. I personally didn't enjoy Sticker Star or Color Splash due to its frustrating game design, but because those adventures also lacked engaging stories, it was like the heart of the series was removed. So I'm hoping that following the release of this game, there is a brighter future for the Super Mario Role Playing Game series. Because if there is a better reminder of how awesome these games can be, it's definitely the Thousand Year Door. It's the perfect treasure hunt adventure where Mario and his new friends have to race across the land to gather the mythical Crystal Stars, while butting heads with the sinister forces of Bowser and Sir Grodus. Well at least narratively, because in the original version you were forced to backtrack through multiple levels in order to progress, that personally stopped me from seeing the game as a masterpiece. But with additions such a pipe in Creepy Steeple that can warp you back to Twilight Town and an upgraded sewer fast travel system, annoying backtracking is no longer an issue in this game. And with new sprites to make the cutscenes more engaging and two brand new bosses to fight, this remake is more than worth your time.. The more time that passes, the more I'm coming around to this being one of the greatest games of all time. It feels like the kind of story your parents would read you before bed when you were little. It's so simple yet so captivating at the same time. Everything feels deliberate and has some kind of satisfying payoff. The worldbuilding is phenomenal, with every chapter bringing with it unforgettable locations, characters, and moments that still haven't left my mind. The RPG combat is fun by itself, and even more fun to mess around with when you throw badges and items into the mix. Honestly, the original game ported to Switch would've been more than acceptable, but I adore that they went out of their way to remake it. It looks absolutely gorgeous every step of the way, even if that comes at the cost of a lower and less stable framerate compared to the GameCube original. A remastered soundtrack, quality-of-life improvements, extra content added to this version only, everything you'd want out of a remake is here and well accounted for. If you are at all interested in this game, especially with how much it's been talked up, then I say go for it. You won't be disappointed.. This is one of the best games I played in the last 2 years. It looks amazing, the battles are nice and have a reward for doing them and it improved from the gamecube versions issues.. This is the greatest Mario RPG I have ever played. This is peak Mushroom World lore utilized to perfection. Nintendo should keep expanding its lore on the Mushroom World and make it a habit to introduce new characters from the variety of species that inhabit this world! The art style is this game's greatest asset, I love the idea of how they make every battle like a theatrical show, pretty unique and clever. The real-time reaction gameplay is genius as it keeps the player engaged and alert in battle even if it's a turn-based game, though I think the Mario & Luigi franchise does their battle mechanic better, it's still good enough to consider this game a Masterpiece.. I always heard that this game is the peak of the series, and now that I got the chance to play it I can understand why. It's a very fun adventure with a very fun combat system, very interesting characters to meet with very funny dialogues, and very beautiful locations to visit.. I love everything about this game. The music, the art, the story, the characters, and most importantly, the gameplay. I beat this 40 hour game in just a little over a week, I was playing this game like a full time job, but it never felt like that because I was having fun the whole time.. Money well spent especially when I’ve spent whole weekends trying to complete this. A perfect game to play through all this summer, and with plenty of content to keep you busy!. I absolutely get it now as to why this series is so loved and revered by the Mario community. terrible game awful no good if you lost on health and stuck somewhere to a tavern to refill up on items and health your stuck.. Best rpg I’ve ever played in my life! Such a charming and whimsical story reminiscent of old school adventure books!. Never have I felt more connected to Mario characters than with this very game, Vivian especially. The remake adds new live to this beloved classic, and even refines the traversal making it superior!. this is for the remake, it is a poor effort to redo the original definitely not in the realm of","the combat can feel repetitive at times but the bosses were each unique . with the EXP earned from battles you can upgrade your max health, max flower points (which also allow you to do special moves), or max badge points ."
624.Starcraft II: Legacy of the Void,"Great add-on brings a fantastic campaign, has the courage to conclude a very long story and bring many new features in multiplayer. [Issue #259]. An incredible conclusion to the Starcraft II saga: the new coop works great, and the game has equal appeal for veterans and newcomers alike. If you're even slightly into RTS, this is one you shouldn't really miss.. Best opening cinematic ever. The story is very compelling and inmersive. It's got great character development and a cool new kind of villain and ally. Such great game and the cutscenes and everything is almost perfect. Highly recomend for everyone.. There's really something for everyone in this title regardless of your experience in RTS games, with a great story, heaps of different ways to experience the game's content for all skill levels and for those who want to be the very best, there's a gauntlet of tough opponents just waiting for you.. “No compromises” is the road Blizzard has chosen. Legacy of the Void is not a simpler game than its predecessors, it’s just much faster, and even more skill oriented than it was before. When it comes to the RTS genre Blizzard is still the emperor, and this game demonstrates it once again with an amazing and bulky single-player campaign, a lot of great extra content, and some brilliant changes to the competitive multiplayer structure. It’s not easy playing Starcraft II, but it’s worth it.. It’s just Starcraft, with some new additions here and there, but that’s all we were expecting, and it’s great.. This generous package will sustain and deepen the competitive side, but Legacy Of The Void also does enough not to scare away the casuals once the closing credits role and multiplayer beckons.. Legacy of the Void is hardly a milestone in the RTS genre, but it is a nice bookend to the trilogy. Blizzard has finally fulfilled its promise to StarCraft fans.. Before Blizzard went full diversity. SC2 has it all. A fast action packed gameplay, great complexity and unit variety, responsive controls and custom maps, coop as well as good MMR system.. In some way it feels like StarCraft and just a little bit... rushed? I feel I just lack of something there.. I loved the original Starcraft and Brood war. And while Starcraft 2 is still good gameplay-wise and character-wise, the story is much worse. It feels like they wanted to get rid of the series. Wrap it all up and be done with it. Pretty stale and straight-forward, uninspired. No more twists, betrayals and interesting political situations, like the original story had. The whole Xel'naga and Duran story-line mystery especially has basically been straight up thrown away. That said, with Legacy of the Void they at least tried to make a good story with the new faction showing up and more. This is the only part of Starcraft II with a decent story. Gameplay: 10 Characters: 8 Story: 7","it's not easy playing Starcraft II, but it's worth it . it's hardly a milestone in the RTS genre, but it is a nice bookend to the trilogy . it's hardly a milestone in the genre, but it is a nice bookend ."
625.Diablo III,"So far I am positively surprised: I was worried about the gameplay, but it is not very simplified, in the contrary it is even better than in D2, because you have many skills, you can choose freely and change your build all the time. In addition you still need to decide between the items. You cant choose attributes after level up anymore. The atmosphere is also not that childish and cartoon as I feared, but it is still Diablo and that means evil, demons, epic war between light and darkness. Some characters are indeed childish and annoying, especially the bad characters Bad: You need to be online to play it. Game is still too expensive, because it is so old now. Never forget they tried to implement an auction house, where you could pay real money for much better gear. The game is too easy, even on hard level and you cant raise the difficulty more in the first run. I was not dead in my first campaign run, lol. This game is to cartoonish and less gothic. the art direction have lost their way and the game wont let you be immersed for long. Less Diablo and more World of Diablo.. Diablo 3 stands out for its variety of gameplay options. With numerous classes and builds to experiment with, there’s always something new to discover. The game skillfully introduces new mechanics over time, keeping the experience fresh and exciting. One of the highlights of my time with Diablo 3 has been playing with friends. The cooperative mode is excellently implemented, making the game a great experience. Exploring dungeons together, defeating bosses, and collecting loot significantly enhances the fun factor. The world and boss design in Diablo 3 is impressive. Each area is meticulously crafted, contributing to the dark atmosphere of the game. The bosses are memorable and fun. The storyline features intriguing twists that keep players engaged. The lore of the Diablo universe is skillfully expanded, making it particularly interesting for fans of the series. A major strength of Diablo 3 is its high replay value. With various difficulty levels, seasonal content, and the constant pursuit of better gear, the game remains captivating even after many hours of play. Diablo 3 was quite hardware-intensive, which posed challenges for some players. Note: I started playing after the removal of the real-money auction house.. One of the best isometric RPGs. Good story excellent and deep combat many classes to choose from and high replayability.Music flows perfect with the game tone.Decent graphics nothing special.Good voice acting by excellent **** only bad thing about the game it gets little repetitive and it's only online only even for single-player. I recommend the game if you're into isometric RPGs, totally worth your money you won't regret it.. I did have some hours of fun. Not the best I had hoped for, but the game itself was okay.. blizzard and money , a big love story ,so thats why im leaving a bad review. Really good MMO. Fun and satisfying to play and grind specially with friends. Good graphics and good main story.. Just boring repetitive gameplay. Nothing else to add. The game with repetitive hack and smash 10 000 x times is just not fun.. Holy heck that AH on release. Always online because reasons, unless console haha apparently. So don't play HC. No, just don't do it. I'm serious. Don't bother. No internet connection is 100% and certainly not the average one. It's a great game but once you've done a few seasons and hunted some treasure goblins (great game mechanic addition) and run a Set Dungeon (also good concept) then it's mostly over. The journey and finding something important is the main selling point. Then you figure out a season mechanic and now you have an inventory filled with loot and no desire to sort through it to find whatever that's just not fun. Nor is it fun to be bothered by notifications every few minutes while leveling. New rune new skill new this new that come on. Enabling teleport from literally anywhere to any zone just makes the world seem small, on-demand, and menu driven. No runewords. No use for grey or white or blue items. ""Rare"" items are literally the most common item type in the game not joking. No more Cruel prefix. No more ethereal socket items. So many things cluttering the game world and the UI that you can't get rid of. Asterisks over people's heads in the hub towns. Advertising in the launcher. Advertising in the start game screen. Oh ffs no way to stop the follower from saying the same tired old voice line in town while I'm standing there trying to figure out loot. Keep that Ctrl+S shortcut handy. Incentive to play on fast-clear very easy difficulty b/c you will run into dramatic difficulty spikes and the screen just explodes in explosions and dying monsters that you don't even bother looking at. It was fun and good but it's not really fun anymore. Except HC but right there's the no-offline-mode problem.. An amazing experience compared to D4. Hope they move dev resources and really expand upon this game. The build diversity, fun co-op, and variety of gear and end-game far surpass D4 in every way.. It is hard from me to understand how in today's age of advanced technology and with Blizzard's experience + money, they have failed to deliver a game at least half as good as Diablo 2.. A simplistic skinner box with uncharacteristically bad for Blizzard presentation and voice acting, even after many major improvements over the years.. One of the best games you can play in between. It's fun on so many levels. You really can't take the negative reviews here seriously. There are actually people who give a 0 or a 1. A 0 or 1 would be an alpha game with broken mechanics where development was not finished and where the players were scammed. These negative reviews can be neglected. Anything less than a 6 is a rating from a frustrated child Original Version: Eines der besten Spiele die man zwischendurch spielen kann. Es macht auf so vielen Ebenen Spaß. Die negativen Reviews hier kann man echt nicht ernst nehmen. Da gibt es tatsächlich Leute die geben eine 0 oder 1. Eine 1 wäre ein Alpha Spiel mit kaputter mechanik wo nicht zu ende entwickelt wurde und wo die Spieler gescamt wurden. Diese negativen Bewertungen kann man vernachlässigen. I remember that when it came out they put the shop in, but then they realised that they didn't even have to make money on a masterpiece of the Diablo series, so they took it out. DLC yes, but I reject the shop. The game is fun and there's a lot to do and explore, but... after 1 year it gets boring, and why? Because the seasons make the game recycle and recycle and recycle, always the same old thing. You get the chance to experiment with various sets and sets of armour, but that's the game in the end.... I can't give Diablo III a 8, but a pulled 7 it deserves.. Copying and pasting item tables from Diablo 2 is too hard. Heres 17 more ch. Cute for a weekend when a new season comes out, but they didn't even try to match the basic end game systems PoE has so there's not much to do after you finish a character. I'm not gonna grind forever for perfect rolls on my gear since they're just 1s and 0s in a game.. Probably the worst iteration of the Diablo-franchise, to date: Real life-money auction house, stupidly steep difficulty curve (With only 2 classes being able to cheese (And there by survive) the inferno-difficulty, at launch), no Magic Find-stat, horrendous story, way too much focus on action and none what so ever on roleplaying, forced cutscenes, recycling of old bosses like the Butcher and the Skeleton King, no Horadrim Cube but instead useless artisans, error 37, terrible plot, Cain dying in a cutscene to a butterfly lady we were just introduced to, dumbed down skill system, worst design of Diablo himself to date, awful itemization, useless items dropping 99.9% of the time, stripping us of the badass that was the Archangel Tyrael, and an underwhelming Heaven. Diablo III vanilla was confused about what it should be. It was an ARPG that tried to be an MMO, and failed at being both. Fewer kinds of gems than the predecessor, a clear defined endgame, boring copy-paste builds, no depth in gameplay, and a downright broken class balance.. Average game for premium price. Gameplay is really good. I like new art style. Rest of systems: loot mechanics, end game content, skill trees need reworking. 120 repetetive dungeons which are rifts from diablo 3. Only 3 world bosses, each can be killed in 3 minutes. No guilds/clans content, no challenging raids. Game made by multibillion company..... no comments. Meh.. i played D3 since the beginning and all seasons since 4. I still think today that it is an excellent Hack&Slash for casuals. You can have fun in a few hours of games. And you can have a challenge if you want to reach gr 150 solo. the design, well, we like it or not. Personally I like it reminds me of Wow and it suits me. At least he has his own identity.. lack of offline mode is a dealbreaker. if this was playable offline, we'd have lots of mods. modders could fix this mess ****.. I bought this on a whim packaged with Diablo 2 Resurrected. I found the Necromancer to be really boring, so I switched to Barbarian and had a wonderful time. I did notice that there was a whole lot of streamlining compared to the previous games but I was havin fun. Then I started a new game and saw it was not just streamlined, it was simplified to such a degree that it almost feels like a mobile game. I had fun once, but there was no replay value at all, and the fun I did have was more due to the basic Diablo elements, and not from any particular thing that is new to Diablo 3. Basically, every class has an identical skill loadout now. They're all even labelled with the same categories, with Left Click being ""weak attack/spell"", Right Click being ""stronger attack/spell"", etcetera. Number 4 being big huge special skill with the longest cooldown timer. There's a lot fewer skills overall, but they have variations on them with ""runes"" which are just sub-settings for the skill. The whole of the gameplay revolves around these skills. There aren't any more attacks with weapons, so to speak; you can put a sword or spear on a necromancer or a wizard but they will never actually use them, unlike Diablo 1 and 2. They're just numbers adding to the damage done by the skills. The whole game is like this, all ground down to a bland numbers game. And the game absolutely loves its frigging numbers. In Diablo 1 and 2, you were using weapons generally that did damages like 2 to 6 damage, 8 to 20, 100 to 200 for highest levels, hundreds of HP, hundreds of armor. In this game, the numbers literally go into the millions and billions. Number pop-ups when you deal damage show when your attacks do damage, going up to literally hundreds of thousands by mid-high level, and HP going into the tens of millions or hundreds of millions for highest level bosses. What's the point of this huge number inflation other than to waste screen space? Actual combat overall has basically been cut down to just one specific style. Every single group of enemies is a pack of dozens. Almost all the skills you get are area of effect damage skills. Combat always amounts to ""use the skill that does the most splash damage"". You get XP boosts for combo kills, which very easily go into the dozens in just a single encounter. It almost cheapens the combat experience as you're no longer actually clicking on enemies to try to kill them, but just mashing the clicker wherever you can hit the most number of enemies at once. If it were a zombie movie, Diablo 1/2 would be more like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead and Diablo 3 would be like World War Z. Virtually everything that previously served a purpose in D1/D2 returns in D3, but not to actually serve a purpose but just as nostalgia bait. ""Remember potions?"" There's no potions anymore, BUT there is a health potion button you can press for free health and a 30 second cooldown. ""Remember runes and gems and the horadric cube recipes?"" Some of that is here, but you have to spend gold to upgrade, spend gold to upgrade gems, and the gems effects have been simplified, with only chest armor and weapon sockets havin unique boosts. ""Remember unidentified weapons and scrolls of identify?"" There's still unidentified weapons, but they are extremely rare, and you can identify them for free in town. ""Remember the town portal scrolls?"" Town portal is now free and available to you at any time with no cooldown. Worse, there's also waypoints but you can use them literally anywhere and at any time. They're no longer like waypoints of D2 but just permanent town portals you can access from anywhere. As well, there is no real Singleplayer mode. You have to be connected at all times, even if you want to play by yourself. And you will be playing by yourself, in 2023, because there's so many different game modes, all subdivided by difficulty (of which there's literally like 12 or more difficulty levels) and by level, and almost no way of keeping track of other players outside ****, so you can spend a hundred hours in a public game and literally never see another person ever. If you've never played a Diablo game before, this would be a fun enough one-time single player experience. If you've played Diablo 2, all you can really focus on is how much everything has been streamlined, to such a degree that you barely feel like you're playing a full fledged AAA game, instead of a quick, cheap mobile or arcade game to bang around in while on the toilet or waiting for the dentist.. Unfortunately the majority of negative reviews are ancient and about poor server performance and issues that have been fixed long ago. The game right now still have a fun and exciting story, the gameplay is extremely fun and rewarding. Although I would admit the power creep has been excessive the past 2 years, it's still a very fun game to play.. The game could be good, but the people making the game keeps making it worse with new patches. Blizzard is not the same it once was, the people working at Blizzard ain't same and I think everyone can see this. They only makes the game worse instead of better with patches. Other companies i prove the game, but Blizzard are fifferent and make it worse... I am a huge Diablo fan. I absolutely loved the D3 beta. I also enjoy playing Diablo **** in the long run, it's become stale an repetitive in a way D2 never was (I played that from 2000 until D3 came out. But it is overall enjoyable.. The worst diablo game in the **** as fun and not as good of a story as diablo I or diablo II. Playing a sorcerer… was not much fun before patch 1.1 - is no fun at all with patch 1.1. Endgame is boring as hell… I’ll go back to POE…. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is still in Alpha. It's not fun, it's buggy as heck, wildly unbalanced, the graphics are dark and brooding everywhere. The dungeons all look the same, the rewards that drop are pretty crappy even by diablo standards. ****'s just not fun. Go back to Diablo 3 or POE. Diablo 3 is one of my favorite games. It’s not perfect, but it’s pretty close. If only blizzard actually used Diablo 3 in the making of Diablo 4, then Diablo 4 wouldn’t be the dumpster fire it is today. The release was horrible. With later addons they fixed the game and it was actually good and fun. In the end they were just dragging it out, only making minor changes and it just ended up being a dead game.. Still great after all this time. Best return on investment I've ever seen entertainment-wise.. This is the greatest letdown. To regress this badly, proves that Blizzard once again can and will kill their game in a single patch, just like WoW Dragonflight 10.1.5, similar treatment. Immediately uninstalled.. Worst update ever due to their lack of end game content, they prefer to nerf everything to the ground!. Blizzard looked at all the advances that ARPG's made in the last 20 years. Ignored all of it. And decided to start from Square 1 again. This is like playing a 2009 game released in 2023.. I have been enjoying the game since launch. The disaster with D4 has shown me how good D3 actually is. Seasons have kept the game alive - quick leveling, fun new builds to try, interesting new seasonal content. You can set up a build quickly (and switch it if you don't like it), then spend as much time as you want to slowly optimize gear to do harder content. Gear gives you actual power unlike garbage ""plus one digit percent"" stats in D4.. This is the worst Diablo game I have ever played, the developers are tone def, and believe that making the game take longer is ""adding content"".. They made changes to builds that took hundred of hours to farm, without reducing the cost to switch. There where no quality of life changes, I.E. larger storage, gem tabs, etc etc. This game was designed to sell seasons, the nerfs where designed to make them last longer, and its catering to hardcore players and content creators NOT a casual player.. When you thought they could not butcher their own game more with the new season.. They sure did.... Kind of a shallow game. Not bad for playing it once and forgetting about it but no way near what another ARPG like PoE or Last Epoch can offer you (100+ hours high quality gaming experience). what's the point of reviewing this game in the tail-end of 2023? well, just to add my voice to the choir after what seems to be another lesson not learned by Blizzard. When this game came out, I was excited! I loved D1 & D2. they were iconic and impactful in their day and then comes along D3 which changes the feel and style of the game to some kind of cartoon. I loved the cinematics; Blizzard seems to have nailed those down to perfection. the story was a bit weak and not very interesting but hey... it's Diablo. that wasn't the strong suit anyway though it would've been nice to get something more out of this game aside from the lottery hook & sinker. there's no one glaring reason why Diablo 3 isn't as popular or good as D2 or even remembered as D1. it's a combination of poor decisions and ignoring players. As a hardcore player I was very dismayed at launch and didn't actually finish or play the game for more than a day at launch due to the numerous issues plaguing it. the always online BS especially. I have dipped my toes in from time until a few months after launch when I started playing more and have since sunk a lot of hours into it. but as any HC player my Hall of fallen heroes is filled more by HC characters dying to server issues and game balancing issues than any 'real' death and in my opinion this very big issue for HC was never fixed. Apart from that, it's very clear they didn't think about post campaign gameplay as there is none. you just do the same things over and over. without going into the details and why their additions to the game didn't really work just know you'll essentially be doing the same thing, exact same, over and over. combat is mostly unchanged from previous titles and it's all about the numbers and little else. sadly, by this time at 2023 we know Blizzard learned nothing.. NOT D2 :( guess there won't be a D2 anytime soon, judging how D4 reviews go, maybe we should just move on till company like old blizzard will give us what we want.... An unmitigated disaster. I've tried evaluating the game on its own merits, though doing so is merely an exercise in reality denial for etiquette's sake. On that level, it lacks very basic RPG replayability features like skipping through dialogue, story variation, meaningful choices, environment randomization, and bosses more difficult than trash packs. On the plus side, Diablo has boobs. If this were brand new IP, I'd consider giving it 2 or 3 out of 10 for the fine graphic detail if nothing else. As a chapter in the hallowed Diablo franchise, it goes from bad to unquestionably the biggest disappointment in the history of gaming. And I'm not even one of those who holds up D1 or D2 as the greatest games ever. Both had many flaws I considered gamebreaking and exasperating. But they both had that ""it"" factor. D3 has a variation of that... prefixed by ""sh"". The eerieness and danger of the previous games is completely absent. Godlike demons mock the player using taunts befitting a third grade playground. The whole experience feels cheap and rushed, especially the inane dialogue and awful voice acting. The only thing I can truthfully call an improvement over the prequels would be the cutscenes... too bad you have swim thirty laps through an olympic size pool full of raw sewage to get two minutes of fresh air. I won't go so far as to cast aspersions on the pro reviewers over there regarding whether they were paid for that 88 metascore, but I do highly doubt they bothered playing the game more than a few hours before rendering their verdict. Indeed, D3 seems designed to let a reviewer check items off their rubric in Act 1, intentionally obscuring the fetid fecal matter lurking beneath. Act 1 even occasionally drops some useful, well-itemized loot, hinting that the rest of the game will follow suit. If only it were so. What about that ""Blizzard polish""? Wasted... on a micro transaction system of all things. I mean, if you're going to bollucks up something this badly, at least go for broke trying to innovate something people actually want. If you screw up trying to make it work with gesture control, or make too many abilities to choose from, or introduce a never before seen game mechanic, that's forgivable. But using paying customers and your most beloved brand to focus group test Bobby Kotick's microtransaction wet dream is just despicable on all levels. So the game has just enough of that Blizzard polish to make it distinguishable from a Chinese F2P translated into broken English... great job team. Unfortunately the polish was spread unevenly, and it is abundantly clear that the lion's share of the development effort in this game went toward driving people to the RMAH after selling them a title undeservedly bearing the Diablo franchise name at full retail price. Not that it matters; the game is terrible with or without the RMAH. No amount of polish will bail you out if the core product is lacking the fundamentals. Ask the FFXIV developers... whose first attempt was still many orders of magnitude better than D3 and they were all fired. I would be remiss if I did not address the always online DRM, the icing on this failcake. Those with satellite internet, rural DSL, or basically anyone outside of big cities in the first world with sub-50ms latency need not apply. Sounds like a good business plan to me. No, let's let everyone lag to hell because it's easier to not have to actually fix exploits and regulate the online community. But yeah, let's still have hardcore mode... nothing says skill like a reliable internet connection and dodging lag spikes. D3's sole innovation in the genre... showing the world to what extreme DRM brute force can be taken and still sell games on name recognition alone. So let's pretend for one minute that the game isn't terrible. Let's pretend that it is the most awe-inspiring artwork **** ever created or ever even imagined. Guess what... it still gets an F. A Ferrari gets an F as a car, no matter how pretty it is or how fast it can theoretically go, if it won't bloody start. No one, and I mean no one, will ever make a single player RPG so good that they get to dictate how I play it or require that I let them watch my activity, lest I might try to steal something, AFTER I GODDAMN WELL PAID FOR IT. Arrogant, authoritarian nonsense like this makes me want to START botting and hacking just to piss them off, and I have never been even mildly tempted to do either. D3 has succeeded in one thing however: converting a formerly wide-eyed, kid-in-a-candy-store, diehard fan of Blizzard's game craftmanship into a ""never again"" cynic, instantly suspicious of anything Activision (let's face facts... there is no Blizzard any more) will ever produce. TLDR: You can polish a turd, but it's still a turd.. This is a good, enjoyable game, but with flaws. They got a lot right - the music, the endgame content, the replayability of the procedurally generated content, and the depth. However, it lacks character customisation and lacks the depth of D2.. The story is nice, albeit short. However, it's not a hack 'n slash. I didn't pay for an old MMO like WoW. It's not worth buying the game if you don't have it already.. Took everything I loved about the original Diablo away, but added always-on as a mandatory requirement. That was really a sad day for the Diablo franchise.. And it's not just the best game in the series, it's the best game of all time. I think these graphics are easier to take, and it also has the best builds in the series. It's worthy of a ten.. They didn't complete this game. They smashed Diablo IP. The game has many problems.. Great Diablo game. Really upgrade from D3 and a good reimagination of D2 and D1, making a great and more updated vision of the game. As always the campaign is great and killing the spawn of prime evils never feel so good, a mix between the great gameplay from D3 and the more in-depth customization we have on D2 and even PoE. Besides we already have DLCs on the way to extend the great campaign and new season to bring and test more and more new systems in the future. As a fan of Diablo since D1, and ARPGs in general, it is great to have a new great arpg game to rotate between the actual one seasons. Great job Diablo team!. My first game (ever) i fell asleep playing and still killed every boss cause of automatic spells and minions. With addon 5 hours of story gameplay on hardest difficulty.. highly entertaining game, thanks blizzard. difficult times to be a game developer.. The game is soul-less and an absolute slog to play through. I work as a marketing financial analyst for a large casino and can say without question, that there are many systems put in place by the developers to monopolize and increase retention artificially. While the graphics and sound are a pleasure to experience -- the overall game is hindered by slow boring combat, mobile game UI, and developers that care more about predatory marketing strategies than making a game worthy of your $70 that is being asked.... DRM was a horrible horrible decision to make. Seems Activision finally got their tainted and dirty hands around the hearts of Blizzard employees, starting with that real money auction house. Launch day was a disaster, completely and utterly. Servers down constantly or you can't log in at all. DRM requires that you be logged in and online to be able to play the single player version.....wait unti it goes on sale.. this aint diablo, this is Lost Ark 2: The normie milker. ""Arpg"" with 3 skills and 4 classes like what deee heeeeell is this garbage. 70 bucks btw, + mtx for a single class that costs 30 bucks my god. I ratę it for 4,becouse diablo 4 showed me, that diablo 3 was not that bad. But still garbage. I hate you Blizzard. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it was bad graphicly espcialy the no paladin and dlc with paladin same price base game.. I have played the singleplayer campaign (Act 1 to 4). It was actually fun but the game is much shallower than D2R. D3 does not have this mysterious, dark atmosphere that D2R has. It is more like an Arcade game. Graphics are very good for a 2012 game, but too colorful for my taste. Looks like WoW. Gameplay is fun, there's tons of skills to choose from. But overall, quite shallow, I liked D2R more.. While the *game* is as enjoyable as it has always been *on its own*... Blizzard continues to absolutely bollocks up the issue of servers. They cannot maintain a stable environment every since they decided ""always online"" was the way to deal with cheaters...when cheaters (item duplication, max skills) have absolutely no impact on a non-PvP game. Of course, they were likely worried the ""item duplication"" cheats would break their Real Money Auction House. But that was one of the worst possible ideas they could've had from conception, so no points there. And now, they're going to release an always-online Diablo 4. Blizzard will fiddle while Rome burns around them.. D2 best game ever, D3 is just for kids who want to live in a fairytail lifestyle.. items are not worth it every boss dropps like 3 legendaries.. boring ****. So, Blizzard ditched what made Diablo 1 & 2 so fascinating: the dark fantasy atmosphere and replaced it with a cartoony look. They also simplified the RPG elements to near non-existence. There are no skill trees, no personalization, all Monks get access to all skills that can be slotted and changed on the fly. The difficulty was also significantly dropped. Bosses of Diablo 1 make a comeback in the most cringe way. The Butcher pops into an arena-like boss room in cleaned-up kiddie-friendly way, looking all cuddly like a Saturday morning cartoon. The boss room is sterile and devoid of any blood - nothing like when you met him in the far superior Diablo 1. The classes are lackluster as well. Of the base game only the Wizard was good. The Add-on at least gave us the Crusader which I found to be the only class worth playing. If you want the Diablo 2 favorite Necromancer be prepared to fork out more $ for an add-on that only gives you that class and nothing else. Diablo 3 has zero identity. Everything that made D1 & D2 so great is gone. Then D3 recycles the entire 2nd Act of D2 in Act 2 of D3. The new art style is terrible and Blizzard just mocked fans for complaining about it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Had this game since release in 2012. I am a huge Diablo fan, honestly besides the nonsense with real money auction house that plagued this game for a few months after launch, this is a solid, smooth fun ARPG. The story was not as grim as I would have liked it to be but playing on adventure mode in the seasons has kept me entertained for years. The quality of graphics, gameplay and finish is excellent.. Its like a clicking simulator. Maybe it even it. The Story is really boring for me, i skip everything, after 2 hours of the game. Then i was suprised on how easy this game is... so i put it on expert and... its just boring. There is a boss, i click on him, dont need to move, and hes dead after 1 min. I think Lost Ark is even kinda better than this.... Blizzard just want your money, they spend millions on advertisement and game-trailers to make you buy the game, once you get it? BAM! All the things they advertised on is gone, and now they have another DLC to drain more of your money, just get Path of Exile if you like A-RPGs and want to enjoy it without dumb pay to win and boring storytelling grinds. Diablo 3 is a great game. Blizzard set out to make all builds viable and did a great job of it. The game is fun to play, relaxing and very rewarding.. It's amazing how Blizzard was capable of getting a good game like Diablo 2 and turning it into this. Diablo 3 is a bag of disappointments and boring gameplay. Skip this and pray that ActivisionBlizzard will not repeat the same mistakes on Diablo 4.. Sadly, it just isn't a Diablo game. If you've played D1 and D2 and are looking for more of the same, look elsewhere.. They will never put the soul back into Diablo after this. These **** need to sell the series.. Great game, over 5000 hours played. It's a pity the game was abandoned and not developed.. My wife likes it better than I do. I barely remembers the feeling of playing it. Maybe I am just older.. Honestly, i do not understand all this arrogance from human beings, who gives this game 0 rating. I've been playing this game on Hardcore since 2013, over 700+ hours, this game gives you everything you was hoping for. This is a great game, great sequel, and, as i can see now, last! good product from Blizz","the atmosphere is not that childish and cartoon as i feared, but it is still Diablo . the game is too easy, even on hard level and you cant raise the difficulty more in the first run . the cooperative mode is excellently implemented, making the game a great experience ."
626.Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways,"Thanks Capcom! This dlc is so amazing. I can't stop playing this game. You must have to play it. a very well-built DLC with Ada who is a very well-built character as well, recommended to play it as soon as you finish the main game.. One of the best DLCs ever made, and just perfect when you keep the original game in mind.. Thanks Capcom for let us play this Masterpiece! I've really enjoyed this dlc.. One of the best dlcs of Made by Capcom And my best dlc You are great, Capcom. it was nice to play with Ada and it was satisfying to see it from this side. 4-5 hours of fun dlc. I gradually increased my rating for the game as it kept improving. The addition of U3 and the boss fight against Sadler were excellent. It’s a shame that the iconic boss fight against Krauser wasn’t included. The laser room, now featuring a monster to confront, added a new dynamic to the game. It’s a great setup for the Resident Evil 5 remake.. One thing fans immediately noted when the 2023 remake came out was the absence of any of Ada's campaigns, like the 2005 game. Of course, this lead to one central question when the DLC was released: Is Separate Ways worth its price tag? Ada's character model and environments ( both in-game and cutscenes) are stunning, and it was worthwhile to see the developers remove the slight grainy effect of faces in the main game. Additionally, the crisp audio remains an immersive addition to these reimagined events. Rather than merely retracing Leon's footsteps like the original, Separate Ways ( 2023) retakes the loose plot thread of Ada's events ( and even, in some ways, Assignment Ada) to explore what was happening behind the scenes entirely. Streamlined into fleshed-out chapters, the DLC offers more significant insights into Ada's mission, reintroducing a vital antagonist of the series and offering this unlikely heroine a moment to shine. As for gameplay, Separate Ways goes above and beyond to appeal to new and old fans in a way which is both a love letter and attains an element of freshness. From the offset, the DLC reintroduces familiar sections and bosses ( including the fan-favourite U-3) from the original. The game even plays around with an unusual concept from Resident Evil 3.5 ( the early scrapped beta version of the 2005 game, which was much more psychological) and reincorporates it innovatively into the storyline's events. It could have been easy for many of these boss and enemy fights to feel clunky and enforced in the DLC. Still, Separate Ways can do it in a way that doesn’t feel too out of place, even with more complex difficulties. (Alongside Ada's puzzles.) Ada's combat is finally given a significant upgrade, and the subtle difference in fighting styles between Ada and Leon is highlighted here. The grappling hook now plays a substantial role in close combat, and its ability to allow the player to zipline across major areas adds to the espionage element of Ada's character. While Ada mostly unlocks the same weapons as Leon (and stealth), the ability to upgrade via the Merchant and acquire unique charms adds to a noticeable difference in gameplay. Her unique I.R.I.S. system to complete puzzles was also welcomed (Although it was used less than it could have in chapters.) Of course, the game does have a few hiccups, one of the most apparent being rushed writing. It is a short game, and there is much to fit in. Still, there are a few times, such as with Ada’s central boss, who is teased to be a prominent stalker throughout ( instead being surprisingly short-lived) and Luis's presence and interaction with Ada onscreen, which could have been drawn upon slightly more. Much like the main game, the infamous island section is where the DLC comes across a few snags. While the laser section was a personal favourite in its renditioning of the infamous laser room from 2005, the heavy reliance on QTEs brought in a reminder of this DLC being based on a slightly old-fashioned system of clunky button pressing. ( Although the final boss fight with Saddler was not only more challenging than the main game but equally required careful attention.) Another slight gripe is some of the voice acting and dialogue. While I do not condone the spiteful responses given to Ada Wong's voice actress, from a critical perspective, her performance sometimes felt a little too stilted. Going for a more stoic portrayal of a femme-fatale character is understandable, and Gao shows she can sometimes hit the mark. Unfortunately, the problem is that (alongside Wesker's voice acting), the delivery sometimes fails to meet the passion you expect for these characters' personalities. Another minor gripe ( more with the writing department) is that the voice prompts are sometimes too "" on the nose,"" which, while offering to "" help"" players, sometimes takes away from the suspense and mystery you would encounter in the main game. On the other hand, Ada has a few lines of unique dialogue, which adds a more wry sense of comic relief to her character. Overall Thoughts: Although much shorter than the main game ( and with a few pacing and dialogue issues here and there), Separate Ways in no way skimps on fleshed-out and innovative content. Its familiar and new combat system, fights, and insights into Ada Wong's character and narrative allow the DLC to be very replayable. In many ways, Separate Ways surpasses its predecessor side game while still feeling as though it had a lot of love and thought put into paying homage to the 2005 game. For the same development team that made RE3R (2020), Separate Ways felt as though it was a necessary component to completing Resident Evil 4's storyline. Is it worth the price tag? For the number of content riches, you get from gameplay, graphics and the story, then most certainly, yes. This is easily one of the best DLCs in recent years.. AWESOME DLC. It's crazy that this has more content then all of Resident Evil 3 combined!. I can't recommend this since it is only dlc that was in the original game at launch suggest picking this up on discount since the resident evil games go on sale relatively quickly and for decent prices at that.. This game is just dlc that should've been in the game at launch like the original.. Nice DLC and best part of the game, I really enjoy the play through and DLC price also worth. This dlc completes the Resident Evil 4. With this the game as whole is PERFECT. Ada's campaign brings new mechanisms along with new locations and bosses. The only negative is that sometime it ends......... Unveliable Game, piece of Art. Fully recommended for all the fan zombies!!!!. One of the best DLCs not just in the Resident Evil franchise but in all of gaming. It is nearly as good as the base game and in some ways it exceeds it. Extremely good DLC. About 6h long gameplay. A good way to go deeper into the story of this wonderful game. Best dlc of all time tbh, need more of that type of stuff, 10/10, masterpiece!!!. a wonderful addition to a wonderful game, the only thing I didn’t have enough of were some new locations (possibly new enemies, etc.), but it’s great p.s ada wong is damn amazing man!. The DLC ensures Ada's story doesn't merely serve as a supplement to Leon's, providing climactic moments, including a satisfying solo boss fight. The behind-the-scenes race to assist Leon's showdown with Saddler adds depth to Ada's character. The ending offers added context, leaving players intrigued about future developments.. Ada Wong looks fantastic and sounds good. Thank you Capcom for not westernizing your games into ugly woke slop. Great piece of DLC & worth the money.. A very nice reason to revisit Resident Evil 4. This time, experiencing the story from Ada Wong's perspective, we get a shorter version of the main campaign with additional gameplay mechanics and new weapons, almost something like a New Game+ playthrough. I don't have much to say other than the fact that this is a very fun yet short expansion, with some new boss fights, encounters and areas to explore. It's worth playing if you crave more of the same, and it's also very cheap. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. Terrific; Capcom shows once again how DLC oughta be. The grapple mechanic is a lot of fun, different methods to accomplish the mission, and it ties the storyline together. Bravo!! 10/10. Ada is a fantastic character to play and this dlc brings another view on the full history of the game. A must have.. I love the game and graphic amazing and also control haptic feedback and u feel you game and music good and I recommend pick the one local store and good day. One of the best DLCs ever made. You get 3 or 4 more hours of one of the best games ever made in resent years but giving it more stuff so you have a new experience. I still believe this should've been in the main game but the price was surprisingly cheap for basically an entire new game. Amazing Capcom, you really outdone yourself. This game excels in survival experience and resource management, requiring careful weapon and ammo planning during battles, which keeps players consistently deliberating their choices. The story is fantastic with dual protagonist and perspective storytelling, elevating the narrative to a new height.. Good- A fun, sufficiently engaging story; Combat is still a ton of fun, thanks to the core mechanics; Excellently designed combat encounters; Grappling gun is a great addition, especially from a combat perspective; Great pacing. Bad- More of the same, for the most part. Thoughts- In the end, Separate Ways is a much better and more significant facelift of its original version than I had thought it would be. Where the original felt like a quickly cobbled together asset flip, the remake DLC feels like a proper mini-campaign of its own, one that not only adds important narrative context to the base experience, but one that also consistently excels on the gameplay front in all the ways that the RE4 remake itself does. If, since its launch earlier this year, you’ve played the remake and enjoyed it, there’s little chance of you not also finding plenty of enjoyment with Separate Ways. By its very nature, it’s obviously a much more condensed and much shorter experience – it’s still only an expansion, after all – but across its relatively brief runtime, it consistently delivers in all the right ways, just as the base game did earlier this year.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best DLC ever made. Anybody claiming that this DLC is a copy of the same game have never played the OG Separate Ways.What did you expect?! Great gameplay from the main game, only extended to a DLC. You must not be smart if you think Capcom would deviate from the gameplay of the main game. Also, the areas are primarily the same but you go different routes as Ada. Also, the stealth elements are way more plentiful in the DLC than the main game, which makes sense because Ada being a spy and all, and she's way more inconspicuous than Leon. 10/10. With the release of the ""Separate Ways"" DLC for Resident Evil 4, the franchise takes a bold step in enriching the narrative by offering a fresh perspective on a beloved classic. Seeing the events of Resident Evil 4 through the eyes of the enigmatic Ada Wong is nothing short of a revelation. For long-time fans of the series, Ada has always been a character shrouded in mystery, her motives and actions often hidden in the shadows. ""Separate Ways"" pulls back the curtain, allowing players to step into her shoes and experience the events that transpired parallel to Leon's desperate quest to save Ashley. Revisiting familiar locales from the main game is a nostalgic treat, but it's the introduction of new, unexplored areas that truly elevates the experience. These fresh environments not only add depth to the game world but also present unique challenges and puzzles tailored to Ada's distinct skill set. The narrative strength of ""Separate Ways"" lies in its ability to fill in the gaps of the main story. Moments that might have seemed inconsequential or confusing in Leon's journey are given new context and meaning. This DLC doesn't just retread old ground; it enhances and expands upon the original narrative, making the overall story richer and more cohesive.. Best DLC for any Resident Evil games ever. Everybody loves mommy Ada.. the best dlc in2023. Amazing.Great story about Ada. I want more. The best resident evil dlc since shadows of rose.. OK, this was unexpectedly fun. Being that I'm of the original resident evil generation and Re4 back in my younger years didn't appeal to me(I liked the slow paced horror and tank controls) bc it was too actiony that says something. These new gen RE games(other than re3) are really well done. I'm not even through the dlc yet and am having a blast. There are levels of strategy going on here where you have to tactically position yourself for fights and not just go in there guns blazing... Lest you run your mags dry. This is great! Makes me want to re-play the base game. Also makes me want an RE:1 re-re-re-make? I have no idea how many times that thing has been remade or mastered but I want it. That and code veronica bc I never got to play it as a kid.. Great dlc i was waiting for this for a long time. i'm a hardcore fan of Resident evils and back in the days Capcom was best .complete story unlock unlimited ammo but now you have to do the hardest difficulty with a S+ rank to. any real gamers know games are for fun not to ""tryhard"" at most you should have EVERYTHING unlocked by completing normal with a S+ for real gamers who play for fun again not ""tryharding"" as the saying goes. ""if it isn't broken don't try to fix it"" games from Capcom are great outstanding 10/10 like 95% but lately i have huge issues to unlock everything complete the game on hardest difficulty with a S+ nah. it's because of this issue i feel i'm missing out on like half the games content and i'm slowly hating the games and turning away please sort it Capcom. put different unlocks behind rank NOT the difficulty. Story: 9 Graphics: 9 Sound: 8 Gameplay: 8 Playtime: 7 Hours (Main Story + Extra). I Should Thank CAPCOMall My Life For this Remake DLC Just Wow ! They bring Me back The passion of Gaming again I Played the DLC For 8Houres Without getting bored CAPCOM IS The only Studio who Makeus Happy among All Those Bad Studios those days I recommend this DLC With Only 10$ enjoy Gamers. I gave it a 9 at first, but then I cant find a single flaw. The only things I didnt like of R4make was cut content, virtually every single cut content made it into this DLC. I finished it in 6 hours ( taking my time) now having done a few playthroughs on S+, NG+, like always lots of replayability.. The separate ways dlc completes Léon's adventure wonderfully and I really had the feeling of playing a beautiful resident evil adventure, varied, long, intense and beautiful, separate ways and a great success, again Capcom your fans love it!. Great DLC, worths every penny. It seems to me a great complement of enough extension. It is all that we wanted, for us who whete expecting a bit more of RE4 remake.. Separate Ways is an outstanding DLC expansion that is easily worth the $10 even if you only intend on playing through this 4-5 hour adventure once for the sake of learning Ada's side of the story. This piece of content revives a lot of areas that were initially scrapped in the remake as well as bringing back a certain special boss many fans have missed. It is rather easy, however, until out of nowhere it spikes at the end, so difficulty is a little unbalanced. Even with that in mind, it's still the best DLC of the year and a must-play.. perfect. literally perfect.. In order to play Separate Ways if you owned the original Game Cube version of Resident Evil 4, you had to buy a PS2 and another copy of the game, so I’m not particularly moved by the arguments that Separate Ways should of been included for free in the remake. In the age of charging full price for broken games on release that takes months if not years to fix, RE4R and it’s DLC worked out of the gate and is quality. I easily would of paid 20$ for this, and like the base game there’s challenges and unlockables to encourage replaying it, not to mention the free content added to the Mercenaries mode. If like me, RE4 and it’s remake are two of your favorite games of all time, this is a no brainer and a steal at 10$. Best DLC Thank you capcom. This DLC was great, half of the important parts of the game were removed. It was really great to come back. Thank you Capcom for releasing this DLC اBut I don't care about the voice actor, I didn't care about the environment of the boss fight U3 either, the classic version was better than that, the only flaws of this DLC, the rest is great. Just needs a proper physical disc release to be perfect.. Ada Wong is without a doubt my favourite Resident Evil character, so getting to finally play through Separate Ways on the REmake of RE4 brought me so much joy. Whilst a lot of the DLC is a retread of previous locations from the main game, the direction you're going in or the context is switched around and it's all given a more 3D perspective thanks to Ada's ability to zip around the map with her iconic grappling hook. A lot of what was taken out of the main game (i.e. U-3, gondola section etc.) has been re-purposed here for Ada, opening up the game and expanding on the original Separate Ways. Her fights against the Black Robe and Saddler are genuinely exhilarating and feel like firsts for the franchise and it's so cool to hear Leon or Ashley while you're in the shadows as Ada. She feels different in combat than Leon too, with the ability to grapple enemies to close distance and a cross bow that feels similar to her weapon in RE6 too! Only downsides for me are: - The length feels a tiny bit on the shorter side for me. - Lack of really any new enemy designs or map areas. - At times it feels choppy moving from one scene to another, feels like we're still missing some of the story. Overall, a fantastic update to an already fantastic additional mode. The best RE DLC since Lost in Nightmares.. It's best DLS for Resident Evil (Must Play). Not even in our wildest imaginations could Resident Evil fans have expected a Separate Ways expansion with this level of excellence. Trust me when I say this expansion that is ONLY BEING SOLD FOR 10$ has enough content to be considered a standalone game. The story is beautifully synergized with the main game and brilliantly fills in the unanswered questions. Just buy it and have fun. Buy it to support Capcom. Buy it to support good games. Buy it for Ada's sexy, tight ass if nothing else!. Terrible DLC , Lacks Resident Evil feeling , it's just cat woman with terrible voice actor and personality based on horror environment , it's only deserve 4 for me.. Probably the best Resident Evil DLC since RE5’s Lost in Nightmares. Well paced, fun, and has great replay value. Very much worth the $10.. Incredible. Separate Ways offers about four hours of additional content to an already outstanding game, while also giving players a whole new point of view on the main story. With it´s extended mechanics and a really likeable heroine, there isn´t much of a better way to spend ten bucks.. It’s best DLC of the year <3. The best DLC of the year.. As of this review I have beaten the DLC 1 time, and RE4 Remake 100% Separate Ways is paid DLC, as such I think it's fair to have slightly elevated expectations, beyond just more of RE4. As such, it is a pretty good DLC but felt quite inferior compared to RE4 Remake. Liked: + More of what I would consider a near perfect game in RE4 Remake + Rounds out and completes the story for the most part Disliked: - Ada's gadgets felt mostly arbitrary and in some ways even pointless. Grapple hook has 1 niche utility but cannot be used beyond cutscenes - I did not want to include story, but there's 1 cutscene near the halfway mark that absolutely did not make sense in context - Levels were quite small, strictly linear with significant segments empty, and forces progression unexpectedly and forcing the player to miss loot they could not pick up yet due to combat. This is one of the best dlcs of all time. Thid dlc does not only show us different look on the story but also enhance gameplay and offer epic boss fights as Ada. Final Thoughts: Let's face the elephant in the room first off: Separate Ways does a much better job of allowing actress Lily Gao to showcase a more complex Ada Wong. The delivery doesn't always hit and I still think better direction was needed, but a serviceable performance in this expanded look at Ada's journey bolsters the character's conflicted adventure. On the story side, it's action-horror meets goofy espionage. Wicked fun and full of fan service, Separate Ways smoothly takes what it cut from RE4: Remake and puts it to better use with the more apt Ada. As for the future, it's undoubtedly assured at this point that Code: Veronica or RE5 is next in line to be introduced to the absolutely gorgeous RE Engine. Gameplay also features some nifty little additions, with the grapple hook melee and shield pull being fantastic mechanics that set Ada's campaign apart. What she lacks in brute strength she more than makes up with intelligence and acrobatics. All-in-all, Separate Ways is a decent DLC that tastefully expands on the core game's slickness and more than justifies the reasonable price of admission.

[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best DLC ever, in the entire franchise, very surprising turn of events, didn't expect it to be this good and this soon. Thank you Capcom, really Thank you.. really enjoyable expansion that makes re4 an even more complete package. it's kinda funny that this dlc is packed with more content than the entirety of re3r.","a very well-built DLC with Ada who is a very well-built character as well, recommended to play it as soon as you finish the main game . Rather than merely retracing Leon's footsteps like the original, Separate Ways retakes the loose plot thread of Ada's events ."
627.Diablo III: Eternal Collection,"I grew up playing Diablo and Diablo 2 on the computer. I have played Diablo 3 on PC, PS4 and Switch now. They have made a lot of improvements to this game over the years and I think the switch version is one of the better ones. It's great to be able to play this handheld anywhere I want. The UI has a little learning curve but also has a lot of quality of life improvements when it comes to inventory.. I love this near perfect port on the Switch! Hacking and slashing has never been so much fun!. Back in the day, I loved playing Diablo I and II, but after +50 hours playing Diablo III: Eternal Collection, it has been one of the most disapointment experiences ever. Although you can increase the difficulty, there's no interesting progression in the gameplay. Enemies are too easy to kill, and there are too many of them. Too many things happening on the screen but they are at most, barely enjoyable.. Diablo 3 being portable, makes the Switch version the definitive one. Whether you like to play. Very overrated, the game is awful , it has a lot of game play problems, they just did copy paste for everything !!. I give it a 2 because its over 10 years old but still better than d4 actually. I will never play d3 again after all blizzard has done this times, its a fun game but you know.... metrics. A jam packed adventure filled video game. Fun and extraordinarily repayable. Very worth it and a true highlight in Nintendo's catalog. This game provides everything you need to simply have a good time.. An astonishingly refined, accessible and lengthy video game that is possibly the best ARPG I have ever played. Diablo 3 on the Switch benefits immensely from the years of effort put into fixing the issues that initially prevented it from meeting its full potential as an isometric ARPG. Add in the fact that this game is now portable, and you have a recipe for sheer excellence. Blasphemous as may be to say, I enjoy Diablo 3 more than its predecessor - the game is entirely focused on making repetitious tasks tons of fun. And unlike many other games in the genre, Diablo 3 provides all of its fun within this base game - item transmogrification is packaged within the game, and does not demand you shell out more money for the sake of aesthetics. Diablo 3 on Switch is nothing short of amazing. It is not only worthy of the franchise's storied legacy; it also manages to surpass its original 2012 incarnation by way of its newfound portability, its post-release improvements, and its dedication to balancing new and engaging mechanics with the addictive gameplay loop that made Diablo 2 as beloved as it is. Despite what began as a rocky release on PC in 2012, this game has become something very special, even a decade later, and I cannot recommend it enough to any Switch owner.. Good game ruined by stupid decisions. Why make the switch version so much harder?. This game runs super well on the Switch, and the game itself is quite entertaining. The endgame can get a bit old, as it essentially involves limited repeatable tasks, though the different seasons that are periodically released keeps things fresh. It is an easy game to enjoy in short bursts and return to after various breaks.. Truly a amazing port to a switch. Even though the game is heavily criticized on other platforms it really feels like it was made for switch. Considering that you can run end game rifts usually in few minutes makes it perfect for short session during work and the loop is satisfying as ever. Only issue is there so much you can do in the game before it gets boring and the necro class was definitely not made for this hardware as it will make the switch sweat when playing it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Solid game. It has a lot of extras. One of the best sagas in history that continues to dazzle. Very recommended.. Just a perfect port for Nintendo **** game is a little bit repetitive but you should know it before you buy it.Very fun to play online with your friends and very important that seasons keep coming for the hardcore funs.. Oddly enough, this game is the prefect match for the switch console. Do a bit of dungeon crawling turn it off and continue whenever you have the time, absolutely fantastic match. Although Torchlight 2 does some things better, Diablo III feels much more polished and still gets regular updates and seasons - 10 years later. I can definitely recommend getting this title on the switch, especially since you can play 100% offline and there's no online requirement like on pc.. Can't comprehend how magazines have it higher than D2. D2 is soooo much better. D3 has worse looting, character building and general gameplay. Still decent for people how just want to play through the game once. Nothing good for people who want to enjoy it longer in comparison to D2.. I love this game, and I've put more hours into it than I should have. So much replayability! Love the seasons and the multiplayer on switch, I've got my dad playing it with me now. Just wish there was cross-platform play so I could play with my friends who play on PC. But holy crap, this is just a great game.. This is a shining light on the way a hack and slash game should be made. You can play with friends and its very entertaining. This game is not locked behind progression paywalls, progression is based purely on skill and gear build. If Blizzard's mobile game that also has the Diablo title had the ability to progress in game with skill instead of ""how much money you spend"", it wouldn't have as low of a score. Please learn the difference Blizzard.. This game is the perfect example of everything wrong with the mobile and triple A development industry right now. It embodies all the negatives agressively mediocre, extremely pay 2 win and anti consumer design not to mention the complete disregard of what fans want.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Well for me its the BEST action rpg playable and it will be for a long period of time, because it still gets a lot of support by blizzard. Still worth it after all these years.. not perfect but fun to play and can spend much time grinding play like every 2nd 3rd Season. Best way to play this game really. The only downside is that online is kinda dead, but otherwise the gamepad controls and Switch portability make for the best Diablo 3 experience ever.. Played it on ps4 with sister couple years ago. Back then was kinda scary, but really fun, plus gave me momories of us playing together. About the game necromancer us op lmao. At first I used mage but he was meh. Gameplay story and megabucks are all good, graphics too. I really liked the idea of customising your loot. Yes it costs gold but finding random piece of equipment with higher level dosnt mean you will ruin your look. You can just change it to suit you. Overall I think its a nice game. I would recommend buying on some sale tho.. Best switch port to date. Great graphics, performance, and UI, the story is meh, but it's mostly just about the game-play which is fantastic. It's just is a really fun game to play. Runs wonderfully on the Switch!. This is actually an amazing port and runs very well on the Switch (surprisingly). Don't expect to try to be competitive though as Blizzard doesn't moderate the leaderboards and it's full of cheaters (not a big deal imo) as it's fun if you play it legit and test yourself or with a group of friends. The game itself is very solid and it feels good mowing down hordes of undead demons. A big downside is the lack of any chat features on the switch as nintendo still refuses to get with the times, but it's not really a big deal in this day in age as you can easily join the Diablo 3 discord and find some friends to play with.. My most played game on Switch so far. The renewed seasons keep me coming back and back to keep making new classes and characters. It is an addicting loop that rewards the player through its deep loot and gear system. I do think to make this game fun you do need to look up some guides and tutorials for min/maxing, but if you put in the time, I believe the reward is worth it.. Pretty well ported game to console. The problem is the missing Multiplayer capabilities compared to PC.. Like to play on switch! Cool game, also stable on this console. The game is really good and suggest to take.. Well the gameplay was fun but not extraordinary. The graphics are so and so not great not terrible. It's a bit easy. The kill-loot rewarding system has never felt better. And it's not just grinding. It is a true RPG regarding story and so many stats to get lost into. Different characters with completely different play stiles will make you sink tens of hours if you live ARPGs.. This is a game i rated a 9 back when i played it on the ps4, but now they have updated it so much that you get legendary items every minute, so getting items feels completely meaningless and there's no aura of surprise anymore They have updated this game to hell. I got a legendary item belonging to the first boss before I even got to him..... god this is lifeless. You can stand still without taking damage, it feels like a dead MMO. I knew from the moment I played this on PC when it first came out it would be better as a console game. So much to do and play that you’ll never get bored with it. Blizzard usually knocks it out of the park for me.. My scoring for this game differs vastly between console and PC versions. Console version score: 7 (PS4) A reasonably entertaining laid-back brainless couch-based game play experience with a controller. A strong seasonal character build can eventually get a mediocre player like myself up to greater rift level 100 - 105 and paragon 800+ before I start to lose interest. PC version score: 3 The screen clutter of enemy hordes makes keyboard/mouse game play more difficult, even with the enlarged pointer option enabled. Also older less dexterous hands like mine find keyboard game play further challenging in terms of hand/finger fatigue (I'm a generation-X gamer). As for the game play itself in my experience I find the legendary item drop-rate statistics to be broken on PC compared to the console version. Getting the same legendary item five times in a row from a rare upgrade is nothing out of the ordinary, sometimes even more. For this reason I seldom find myself going beyond a fresh level 70 character before getting absolutely bored and frustrated. At best I may reach paragon level 100 on PC.. I played this game for over a thousand hours on my switch. Any complaints I may have are far overshadowed by this fact. This game is really fun, and there is a good community on discord that makes finding groups easy for end-game content. The game is constantly updated each season too.. As a newcomer to the series and after playing around 10 hours or so of the game co-op with my son I have to say that I was pretty underwhelmed by Diablo 3 and it's bland brainless gameplay. We started the campaign in the standard difficulty setting and after a few hours of pretty much getting through every encounter and the first few bosses without so much as a scratch, we bumped up the difficulty hoping it would add a little challenge but it really did nothing other than to turn every enemy into an unsufferable bullet sponge. Unlocking abilities and leveling up didn't feel very satisfying as most enemies were always easy to defeat regardless of the character progression. The combat itself amounts to nothing but pressing every button in no particular sequence to unleash each of the different abilities, wait for cooldown, and repeat. That's literally it. Story, world, design etc. were all standard cookie-cutter dark fantasy fare, while graphics and level design are fine but equally mediocre and uninspired, which is basically what the entire game amounts to be. I will say that my 10 years old enjoyed himself A LOT more putting in around 50 hours of gameplay time and finishing the campaign and leveling up several different characters, so maybe he is the intended demographic for this type of game, but personally as a 34 year old who has grown up playing all types of RPGs, from JRPGs to western-style RPGs and a big fan of fighting games and hack'n slash games like Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta, having to endure this cliche world and puddle deep combat was often mind-numbing. I've read the game gets better post-game but the idea of playing it enough to get to that stage is completely outside of the realm of what I'm willing to endure as a gamer with a massive back-log of fantastic games I want to play and very little time to play them.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is all about LOOT! If you’re into RPGs then check it out. If you d played Diablo before, Check it out. If you want to put in 100 hrs into a game, check it out. You know what you’re getting yourself into when playing a diablo game so try it out if you’ve got the time. The game is fun, graphics are ok, and replay ability is very high.. One of the high replay value games on Switch. For me, this port port on Switch is very good. Diablo III on PC had a rough launch. It wasn't until it's expansion Reaper of Souls that the game ended up feeling more robust. It introduced features like adventure mode, rifts, and transmorgification. All of these went a long way towards increasing the replay value and extending that core gameplay loop. Some like myself wondered how the game would fare on console but Blizzard managed to rework the UI to feel intuitive and comfortable. Fast forward and the Diablo 3 comes to the Switch complete with expansion and a few Nintendo specific easter eggs. It's a surprisingly competent port that plays and performs well. It is just as satisfying to play on Switch as it is on PC and now you can slay the minions of hell and protect Sanctuary at home or on the go. The adventure no longer needs to be confined by the walls of your house. The upside is the game doesn't need a persistent online connection. I only wish that the game featured crossplay and a way to link to your **** account and use cloud saves like some other Switch games like Witcher 3 or Divinity Original Sin 2.. Wow, this game rocks. I played it a little bit when it was re-released on Xbox One, but only for an hour or so and I thought it was super cool. But I just never had the urge to play it again. It's one of those games that's just a lot more fun when you have human players to play with you. Fast Forward 5 years later and I end up buying it on Switch as a part of a Black Friday deal. I basically just wanted to own a copy of the game and since I primarily play Switch it was the console I wanted it on. Fast Forward 6 months later and I am finally playing the game after playing through my HUGE backlog of new Switch games. I am in love! I love loot and level up games and this is perfect for the platform, the graphics are gorgeous even on Switch and the frame rate is soooo smoooothhhh. The sound is amazing too, it's so cool when you are in a dungeon and you can hear all of the noises surrounding you, it's super clear sounding, no signs of compression! (I have a Denon 5.1 receiver) I love the destruction engine too, things just crumble around you and enemies explode into glorious blood and gore. Well done game, well done port. Looking forward to Diablo 4, but I am taking my time with this one, so no rush. Final verdict, definitely a visual upgrade over 360 and PS3, along with a solid frame rate, the game itself is entertaining and addicting. I would recommend it over the One and PS4 due to it being portable and still looking so good in docked mode. Oh, and most importantly, it is all on the cart!. I don't understand the good reviews for this game. Yes the graphics and sound are nice, but the gameplay is just awful. There is no challenge at all! I just walk up to enemies and hold down the attack button. No dodging or blocking necessary - as soon as my health drops a bit it fills right back up thanks to some magic items I am wearing. This is not fun, it's boring as hell. Yes, there are higher difficulty levels, but those are locked for some reason until I level up my character. I really enjoyed the first Diablo game way back in 1997 or whenever it was released. I think Blizzard severely dumbed this game down for the consoles. I wish I could get a refund but Nintendo doesn't allow that.. To be clear: I give Diablo III an 8, because I had fun playing it for hours over hours with friends online. However, your mileage may definitely vary. It might well be your favorite game on the Switch. And on the contrary, it might be a big shiny waste of money. Once thing is for sure: it's a flawless conversion of an unashamedly tripe-A game, with a very addictive game loop and enough content to keep you busy for hundreds of hours before you even begin to see the last of it. That extreme triple-A-ness, however, is also the reason why Diablo III feels ultimately like a shallow time sink backed by stellar production values. From the comically cliched story (complete with the campiest dialog this side of a direct-to-video movie) to the stubborn refusal to test the skill of the player, this game is very careful never to take any risk of any kind. The story mode is mind-numbingly boring: hour after hour of pressing mostly the same button or two, to wipe out a huge variety of enemies that all feel the same, and barely present any challenge even at the highest difficulty levels. Admittedly, the story mode is just bait for the more meaty ""adventure"" mode: an endless loop of collecting more and more powerful items to unlock your way to higher and higher difficulty levels. There is a lot to Diablo III's addictive ""spreadsheets in a fantasy world"" approach. It can actually be fun to study and then assemble the best build for your character, collect information on the Internet, turn a puny level 1 mage into walking death for the hapless minions of hell. Especially with friends, it's fun to live the power fantasy of wiping out thousands of big democ baddies before they even become visible on the screen. That same power fantasy, however, ultimately feels slightly draining, like one of those aimless free-to-play games. Like a Marvel megaproduction, Diablo III is fun while it lasts, but it ultimately feels like a colossal pile of pointless content content that's too big to fail.. I had never played Diablo before getting this Switch version, and I really enjoyed it. The best part of Diablo is certainly its lore and very dark, Gothic atmosphere. It creates a certain fascination for the characters and especially the villains, whose artistic design and staging make them the highlights of the story. Each scenery brings one new facet of the darkness of hell, and conveys a convincing feeling of desolation. Gameplay-wise I found the game quite accessible, with standard RPG features like the customization of the equipment, spells and a lot of loot. I have only tried three classes (sorcerer, necromancer and witch-doctor) and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Although one could - rightfully - argue they all represent different playstyles, the core of the gameplay is still fast-paced, hit-and-dodge style, with a slight variation for the necromancer that I found tankier and also protected by its minions. The levels of difficulty are quite different. It is pointless to play in difficulty easy/normal where you just go from area to area killing monsters without fearing any of them really. After realizing this, I restarted the game in the fourth level of difficulty (don't remember the name). After one or two first painful hours where I could really feel that the base equipment was harsh for a start in this mode, the game became enjoyable: not too hard, but not too easy either. I found the graphical quality to be excellent for the Switch. No framerate drop whatsoever, even in handheld mode, and even when the screen if filled with 50 or more monsters. Very enjoyable. The best part of this Switch version is probably the possibility to play the full story in coop up to four players, and each with a single Joy-con if you don't have additional controllers. The single Joy-con play is definitely less comfortable than the pro/double joy-con controls (especially for dodges for which you have to hold the stick down and tilt it), but after a few minutes of practice it is really no problem. Quite an achievement to put all these controls on such a controller and still make it rather comfortable. The quality of the cutscenes makes me regret not to have more of them though. There are like 5 of them in the whole game and they are of excellent quality, perfectly immersing the player in the dark atmosphere of the game. Highly recommended.. Good performing game, but the game reloading the entire session because someone leaves? And pairing me with people with dialup internet with 10k Ms? Brings down the rating hard for me... Works perfectly on the Switch Lite. If you use your Switch for travel mode and plan on playing the endgame properly I would recommend choosing one of the easier builds like Whirlwind Barbarian because being so small, it's hard to see your buff icons drop off.. A wonderful port that captured me for more than a dozen hours. However, replaying me does not pull even six months later. However, the port is beautiful - probably this game should be with almost any owner of the Nintendo switch. Portable Diablo was a great idea. Diablo III itself is amazing and on the Switch it is even more so. The ability to seamlessly play between online mode and local play is great. Allows you to play with people who don't pay for Nintendo's online service (locally). Also it's great if you travel a lot like I do. Can still play even if you're going from terminal to plane to terminal and so on. If you're not familiar with the Diablo franchise this is an action adventure style RPG where you fight Diablo and the minions of hell. The campaign is great especially the first couple times I played through it (it's even better if you have friends/family to play with). Adventure mode is very addicting. I have a good number of characters with full sets/builds and have somewhere around 600 hours put into the game. I do notice an odd glitch now and again. They're rare but they're there. Like I had a greater rift guardian that spawned but wasn't on the map so I had no choice but to quit out. Also I have experienced a few times where enemy projectile animations don't show. All-in-all the number of times I have experienced bugs is less than 20. For how many hours I have put in that's minor but it's there.. Good game, good gameplay after pc and ps4, comfortable and good ported. But price is hi, must be low for so old game. It is fun playing Diablo on the port. I enjoyed it very much. Overall this is a good adaption, except occasionally the screen becomes frozen when I relaunch from sleep and have to restart the game. That's the only bug I have noticed, happened about three or four times during my entire gameplay period. Great game. No much surprise but pleasant gameplay About 20 hours with the expension. Story is not the best though. As someone who never played D3 on PC I just gave it a try once I had the chance to buy it in the Nintendo e-Shop and I never regret it. It is fun to play it on the go or with friends on your TV. It sure is good but sadly it can't reach up to the standards D1 and D2 have set. So if you are completely new to the Diablo franchise you will have many great gaming hours but if you played and enjoyed the old games, you will miss some depth along your journey. If you are into good story telling this game is also not for you i guess. I mean it has some story elements but well the writing is just not that amazing.. Off the bat, don't even consider Stamantha's review because it's completely false in every way. He states that ""this has been done a million times better in other games"", which is a completely innacurate statement seeing that Diablo is the all time most popular and greatest dungeon crawler franchise in gaming history. The only 2 games that have come close to being in Diablo's shadow are Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile. But neither of those is on Diablo 3's level. This game is still addicting to this day, and with the addition of the awesome necromancer it's now better. D3 provides countless hours of monster slaying for that next best item you're looking for. Diablo was never about story, so if you go into these types of games for the story you will be let down. Dungeon crawlers are NEVER about story. They are about slaying tons of monsters on screen and getting as much loot as possible. It is mindless yet fun. You have to play for more than 20 minutes if you want any kind of variety in any **** please ignore Stamantha's 5 rating, because it gives very false information. This game is great, and it's a very good thing Nintendo finally gets some Blizzard love.. I never thought a Diablo game would come on the Nintendo Switch, but the 3rd game is amazing, it has pure graphics, a wonderful gameplay, and also a Diablo amiibo which i am baffled enough to say it looks good, it's functionally is great, and I bet it works on SSBU. Also Ganandorf from TLOZ is in the game, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!. The game is more fun to play with your friends at the Switch. The Diablo 3's mechanics are perfectly suited to the Switch. BUT Playing the game on the small screen can strain your eyes :D. AS A RESULT, If you are a big fan of Diablo and want to have Diablo 3 with you at any time, I recommend that you get the Switch version of the game.. I don't have much to say about this game other than it was a fun experience with friends hacking things to death again and again. The gameplay was fun enough but did get old after awhile, and the story was solid but just was very difficult to handle in a multiplayer format where one wrong button click or one player moving a bit too fast could ruin the experience for the other players. It was a bit rudimentary all and all, but still a fun time, and I'd definitely consider playing Diablo 4 should they ever make it.. I played on the computer and now I'm playing this portable version. And it's a good version, the same good experience I had on PC, with good graphics, good music, nice quests, and a important feature: a lot of languages - subtitled and dubbed - you can download for free from e-shop.. A truly great game made even better by being portable. I often play this in the car, at work or in hotels etc. The combat is smooth and satisfying, the graphics are gorgeous and the challenge to always push higher and into more and more difficult rifts is awesome. The only downside is the lack of single player content, I think a company the size of blizzard could easily make a fresh slice of single player story content every year. (and I heard they had some ready but cancelled it). Another downside is the lack of PvP, I understand that direct PvP wouldn't be possible, but imagine something similar to both being put in an identical dungeon but starting from opposite ends. Whoever kills the most enemies wins. I can definitely see that being fun and an interesting concept to expand on.. Absolutely brilliant port of D3 over to the switch. Performs brilliantly on the console in either portable or docked mode. In my opinion this is another must have game due to the endless content and ease of pickupability. The offline play is super handy and makes this game exceptionally versatile. As a very long term PC player of the franchise, I am somewhat stunned at how well it plays on the Switch.. If you have not played for a decade since burning out on D1 and D2 like me, this is a fantastic return to Sanctuary. I travel for work and to have this portable on the Switch is the perfect solution! If you've never played it is great 'leveling' fun. If you have had a lot of time away from the Diablo universe, D3 on Switch may scratch that 'one more Rift' itch. It may be described as repetitive by some, but for those of us that 'get it', this is a great solution. Seasons and endless Rifts add to the replay value, if you are into that as well.. If you’ve never played a diablo game before, get ready for hours of incredible combat, looting, and character progression. When beginning the game you choose from one of 7 classes, each with very different play styles. As you play through the campaign your unlock new skills as you level up. Each skill having five modifiers that you can use to your advantage depending on your play style. The customization only goes deeper as you collect loot throughout the game to upgrade your skill set, until five minutes later when you find something better and better, and that loop continues until you are one badass demon slayer. Blasting through hordes of enemies in Diablo 3 has never felt better. Such a grindy game is perfect for this portable system. Leveling my character up for hours during my daily commute then plugging in the same character to run rifts with my buddies when I get home, is the what the Switch was made for. Finding a perfect balance of online and offline gameplay, which I have been dying for since the Switch was released. Especially playing a seasonal character, if you create the character and begin playing online, you can grind that character when offline and on the go, earning that coveted seasonal loot all the faster. Diablo 3: Eternal Collection on Switch has non-wifi required couch co-op and some special Zelda loot, including Ganondorf’s armor. Which is only cosmetic and quite expensive, allowing you to change the look of your existing armor, not acquire a special set. When playing D3 in handheld mode it looks fantastic and it certainly takes its toll as just under two hours of gameplay had my Switch at 30%, so make sure to pack your charger. Before playing handheld I was a bit worried that given the nature of the game, with so much going on, that it would be overwhelming, but that was quickly laid to rest. It feels great grinding through cave after cave of monster mayhem on the go. Even with enemies filling up my entire screen the frame rate didn’t drop, not once. Diablo 3: Eternal Collection is absolutely incredible on the Nintendo Switch. If you’ve never played Diablo 3 before, this is the perfect chance to jump into a game that will give you hundreds of hours of gameplay. With the amazing postgame, seasonal support, and addictive polished gameplay it's well worth the buy.. The best description for this game is: basic and dumb. I passed the first hours of the game going from one boring place to another, holding the attack button down till all the dumb cannon-fodder enemies were killed, gathering the loot, equipping the new items, watching some uninteresting badly-written dialogue about the return of evil and basic dark fantasy stuff and repeat. Most of the time you don't even have to dodge anything or make any planning about how to tackle large enemy groups, what items or skills to equip, it's just so brainless and bland altogether. I will raise the difficulty to extra hard to see if that improves anything but even if it makes the game more challenging i doubt it will become any more interesting because the setting is just meh, been there, done that, million times better in other games.. Really comes out nice on Switch. A bit old content otherwise 10. Looking forward to Diabolo 4 on switch!. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. I am addicted to this game on switch. It's something about being able to play it undocked late at night smashing all the enemies and feeling glorious. Also adventure mode is unlocked from the start and it makes the game even more awesome! Must buy. Simply Tight controls, slick visuals, and engaging combat systems. Overall 10/10 Hidd","i have played Diablo 3 on PC, PS4 and Switch now . it's great to be able to play this handheld anywhere . i love this near perfect port on the Switch!"
