437.Max Payne,"Very over the top and fun gameplay, but the story and jokes had me rolling my eyes constantly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After finishing the game, I now understand why it was brought to legendary status. Because when this game was advertised (I'm talking about the old manuals), bullet time and realism were the two anchor points. However, one of the important elements that makes this game beautiful is that its psychologically suppressive side stands out. Unfortunately, some deficiencies in the artificial intelligence weakened this suppressive effect. After discovering those gaps, you have extra solutions at every point of the game. Now let me explain what I said:The story in the game is roughly as follows: We have a character named Max Payne, a former NYPD detective. One day, a few men raid Max Payne's house and kill his wife and child. Max Payne starts tracking for revenge. Since he doesn't have a solid track, most of the work he does goes in vain. We have a guy wandering around here and there for almost two chapters. Around the end of the second chapter and the beginning of the third chapter, he goes after the Aesir Corporation, which is offering the drug Valkyr to the market. While continuing this investigation, he collects information about the murders of his wife and child, and determines his target towards the leaders of the Aesir. Max Payne spends the last part of the game hunting his target. As soon as he hunts his target, the police take him into custody right there with the accumulation of the murders he left **** can be seen from the summary, there is a recovery in the 3rd part. Now let me tell you why this recovery occurred: Max, who started the adventure without a strong trace, immediately kills an important person. For this reason, the police follow Max and follow him closely. In other words, Max must be constantly on the move, and at the same time, he must understand his own case. This is not where he has a problem, though. Because this man is a very talented gunfighter. Since he cannot connect the data around him to anything, he often finds out-of-context things in irrelevant places. The tension that the police make him feel from behind also makes the character feel even more empty. In this context, Max Payne, as we have seen in graphic novels, seems to be extremely hopeless and continues only because he can (i.e. because he is not dead yet). The peak of this is the compositions in the 2nd and 3rd prologues. Those are really awesome. It's like the game blames Max for not being able to figure things out. It almost gives the character a ""failed messiah"" accessory there. As for the recovery, we encounter a Max Payne who has decided what to do after the second half of the 3rd part. Even though what he is trying to do is something that poses extreme risks for him.They have adapted this recovery segment to the part where we fight against the soldiers with Colt Commando, the most powerful weapon in the game. You might seriously stop and think at that moment if a mod has been added to the game. It gets so serious that the conflicts really challenge most players there. The level of aggression of the enemy, the repetition of the enemies waiting in ambush, the tight pockets, most of the guys have Colt Commando anyway. The processing of what I am talking about here on both thematic and mechanical levels has created a magnificent design pattern. This is the trademark of this series, if you ask the truth.. Awesome for it's time, but I like the second game's atmoshpere better. Max Payne 2 is really immersive, while first game is beyond it's time, bad sound design and the lack of smooth animations is pretty noticable.. Max Payne is a milestone that challenges the moral standard of acceptable violence and secrecy through storytelling. Discover the endless conspiracy of atrocities absent of both justice and accountability. It is atmospheric, dramatic, grimy, and symbolic. Expect disgusting crime, unholy sin, and absolute corruption to the maximum pain for the unsuspecting innocent.. An epic, action-packed shooter game with a really great story. Truly a classic.. It holds up well but there are some improvements gameplay-wise that the remake can do. None of them are actually in the shooting but more of the 'puzzle' scenarios that while pivotal to the game are just not fun. Incredible atmosphere, really great gameplay, a hell of a charismatic main character and just fun all around. Cheesy dialogue, but still so much fun. Our monotonous protagonist really should get a next gen reboot (that’ll turn into an HBO Max series - everybody knows the rules). Love this story. Can’t wait to play the next two!. Max Payne, in its original iteration running on Windows 98, is a real bloody masterpiece that seamlessly blends the gritty storytelling of Pulp Fiction with the stylish action of The Matrix. Although I didn't manage to complete it when it was first released, now in 2024, after 23 years since the game's launch, I've been playing and completing all the stories, cherishing every moment of this timeless classic.. Fun, there are some parts that aren't as fun but the campiness pulls it through.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Let's be honest, Max Payne is a classic. That means we have to take a small correction on it's age. With that out of the way, I can with clear conscience say that Max Payne is a great classic, deserving it's title. I have played this game 23 years after its release and enjoyed it fully. The story was gripping the storytelling with the comic book pages and the brooding atmosphere was great. The gameplay was enjoyable as well, several guns and moves. Negatives: sometimes looks funny and outdated of course and there is an annoying bug of getting stuck onto walls, especially in the dream sequences but with a bit of patience I could get out of it.. It was the best action game of its time, you are a legendary game with its unique storytelling technique and everything, you are Max Payne :). Let's be honest, Max Payne is a classic. That means we have to take a small correction on it's age. With that out of the way, I can with clear conscience say that Max Payne is a great classic, deserving it's title.. Firstly, I want to say that's the oldest video game I have ever played, and despite its age, I was shocked at how good this game was. So the best part of the game is the story and characters. Being the first story-based game from Remedy, it had its unique style that can be recognized in their newest games such as Alan Wake 1 & 2, Control, Quantum Break. The story of the first game masterfully mixes genres and clichés into an amazing thrill ride. Playing this game, I have experienced a lot of emotions—from sadness to joy, from laughter to shock, and so on. The most unique thing in this story (and the story of the second chapter) is comic book scenes; I have never seen such a way to tell a story in a video game. Not only do comic books have fabulous looks, but also every page was voiced masterfully. Also, one of the greatest details of this story for me was references to my favorite movies like Pulp Fiction, Usual Suspects, and some John Woo movies. The best part of this story is, of course, Max Payne; his character, charm, voice, and arc are incredible. I loved this character since I saw his familiar-looking face. Also, I would like to add the funniest part of the game for me—prologue 3—when Max, in his trip, finds out that he is in a graphic novel, and then finds out that he is in a video game. That is a prime example of breaking the fourth wall. And for those little parts, I truly love Sam Lake's way to write stories. Gameplay is also the strong part of this game (for its time). Not only is the shooting very pleasant even for our time, but also its companion piece—Bullet time—enhances the whole badass gameplay. A huge variety of weapons, bosses, arenas create a really exciting experience for TPS arena shooter. Then, why did I say that this was amazing for its time? Because the game won't offer you new mechanics and won't enhance its previous mechanics. For games today, it's vital to keep enhancing mechanics throughout the game to keep the player interested. But in this case, a masterfully created story and character saved the day, and for me, the gameplay was a bit boring in the end when there were really irritating arenas. And also the biggest downside of this game is some arenas without enemies that could be more of a pain in the ass. For me, the level in an exploding restaurant and all of the trip mazes were annoying and really felt like a piece of **** thrown in my face. But besides that, it is a perfect game for its time and even now, a game that has a really memorable story and characters, accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack and music. 9/10.. I just completed my first playthrough of the game and I plan on playing it through again on the modes I unlocked, this game is 10/10.. Max Payne. The American dream is destroyed. An excellent third-person shooter with a very interesting plot, as well as an unusual presentation of this very plot. The locations are interesting, and snowy New York will forever remain in my heart.. Grew up with this game love the story loved the gameplay this game is and was a masterpiece that got me hooked on the ps2 I easily recommend this game to anyone. Absolutely thrilling gameplay, nice graphics, and immersive storytelling make this game a must-play! 10 outta 10!. Noir icon.I got acquainted with this game recently. And for 2001, this is a brilliant game! And personally, I liked this game more than GTA 3.This is an exciting game with a serious story. About revenge, loss of loved ones and absorbing depression. Creating an atmosphere of unrest and tension was achieved thanks to an excellent script, high-quality dialogue and an impressive soundtrack. This music is still a symbol of noir.Interesting gameplay. And a very creative time-stopping mechanic. This innovative system allows the player to slow down time, creating the effect of maximum concentration of events in a very short period of time. This mechanic not only makes the game more dynamic, but also adds an element of strategy and tactics to it, making ""Max Payne 1"" particularly interesting and memorable.""Max Payne 1"" is a classic that remains relevant and exciting even after years. It is a must for everyone who appreciates exciting adventures and unparalleled action.. Max Payne 1: A Noir Masterpiece that Redefined Action Gaming. Max Payne 1, released in 2001, remains a timeless classic in the realm of action gaming, and for good reason. This noir-inspired masterpiece from Remedy Entertainment delivers an unforgettable experience that seamlessly blends gripping storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, and a distinctive visual style.. A spectacular game that captures our attention and activates our curiosity, balancing action and horror, very good, without a doubt, a work of art thank you very much. A masterpiece with a gripping **** gameplay is quite fun with the mechanic called ""Bullet Time"".. One of the best action games ever made with thrilling story. Its an old game, but definitely play it if you havent played it yet.. One of the most popular games in 2001. That was incredible, so atmosphere and dark. Classic shooter, like one peace of movie.. The best Max Payne game. I can't even remember. how many times have I played it. greatest series i have ever played in my life. i love this game. i feel lucky because i could play them all.. An impressive story! It's been 22 years since its release date, but it still plays fluently. It is a game that you will not get tired of for hours with its long gameplay. Needless to say, it is definitely one of the masterpieces.. Remedy is on another level when it comes to develop good games. Until now, Max Payne is one of the most unique and iconic third-person shooters ever made.. ""Max Payne"" is an absolute gem that left me utterly impressed. Playing through this game was an experience like no other. I haven't had this much fun in ages while completing a game. The fact that it's aged so well is truly mind-boggling. Every aspect of ""Max Payne"" contributed to its captivating allure. The storyline is a work of art, intricately woven to keep players engaged. The acting and character development are top-notch, making the virtual world come alive. The game's cutscenes are a sight to behold, showcasing a level of craftsmanship that truly elevates the experience. What sets ""Max Payne"" apart is its dark and thrilling atmosphere. It's a true masterpiece that seamlessly combines elements of suspense and drama. The game's ability to immerse players in its noir-style narrative is a testament to the developers' skill. As I played through the game, I found myself constantly amazed by how well it has held up over the years. The quality of ""Max Payne"" goes beyond its age, proving that a well-crafted story, remarkable characters, and skillful execution are timeless. This game is a must-play for any fan of intense thrillers and unforgettable gaming experiences.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 6/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 7/10. For its time and still today a great game. With innovative combat and a memorable story with tons of humor but still, emotional moments.. A childhood masterpiece the dark vibes it gives are unforgettable.Tried to play it recently didnt have much fun but the memories it brings are exquist. Besides a very dated save system and limited graphics settings that make it hard to make the game look anything but terrible, Max Payne holds up in every conceivable way you’d hope it would. It’s difficult to think **** series more primed (and deserving) of a modern day face lift.. I played this game back when it came out on PC, and I was blown away in 2001, but I never published any reviews for it, nor its sequel. Never too late, I guess : ) This game is a timeless masterpiece, and that's how it is. It marks the beginning of an incredible journey for Remedy (well, their first game was Death Rally, also good in its own way) but, looking back at this game now, where it ""all began"", I can see the seeds being planted, the ideas, the intention to do a lot more with the franchise, and with everything. Without Max Payne, we wouldn't have Alan Wake, or Quantum Break, or Control, and we wouldn't be waiting in anticipation for Alan Wake II. Now that the Remake for this game, and the sequel, have been officially announced, I can't wait to see those two games merged into one and running on the amazing Northlight Engine. These days, in order to play Max Payne on modern PCs, we need some fixes but, fortunately, they're easy to get and they work amazingly well, still a perfectly playable experience from beginning to end, despite the game having some issues when FPS are uncapped; on my most recent playthrough, I had no issues at 120 FPS running on a 240 Hz screen, though, but YMMV so, if you see any issues, best to cap those frame-rates at 60.. One of the best, timeless classic that will go down as one of the ultimate action games of all time. Luckily for us there are 3 installments on this series.. The first Max Payne is a groundbreaking noir thriller with cinematic storytelling, bullet-time action, and unforgettable characters. A true classic.. ""Max Payne"" is a stylish third-person shooter that remains Remedy's best creation. The game is a blend of The Punisher, Film Noir and John Woo movies. It also borrows Bullet Time from ""The Matrix"". While ""Max"" is now very dated, it was ranked by critics as one of 2001's best PC titles. Action movie fans will love it. I would rate this with a **** of 10.. solid story line. enjoyed making ""whoosh"" noises while going slomo. 9/10. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Perfect for it's time. Mechanics are great. The story telling is awesome. It's amazing. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 8. One of the best .. Lot of conspiracy, good and dark humor, great story-telling and cool game mechanics.. Max Payne has fascinating noire atmosphere. The feeling of the game is timeless. Bullet time is still enjoyable on 2022. The only problem that I faced is the dream episodes which are technically problematic and boring.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A tragic story with noir aesthetic and revolutionary gameplay with an iconic menu music.. This is one of the best FPS single player games EVER created ! Combined with an amazing story and funny things it is 100% a 10. A great introduction to ""bullet time"" also when the Matrix was ""new"". Cool simple story and just lots of addictive shooting in slow-mo :). It is a legendary game with police and noir themes. When I was a kid I used to jump around like Max Payne :D. A **** game mechanics are innovative. It's obviously a little bit difficult,but it's an old game,it's obviously more difficult than the modern ones. The Storyline it's incredibile the voice acting too. You have to play this. NOW,. This game know how to use time bullet, its an amazing game which give us cool mix between the fun and the darkness. This Is Good Game This Is 1 of The Most Iconic Games This Game Is A Great Game. It is a very old game made by Remedy and if they are good at something, they are good at giving an engaging character with great monologues. The gameplay is just shooting clunky animated bad guys, which was a new thing for that era but what holds it still in this era is the story-telling and the constant twists that keep coming as you progress through the game. The painkiller chewing sound that regenerates health feels great for some reason.. One of the best games ever! An amazing story that made you think and empathize with Max every second. Great noir atmosphere. Revolutionary slow motion gameplay. How beautiful it was. Absolutely everything is good in this game and I can't even remember any shortcomings. This is a masterpiece that has made a huge contribution to the gaming industry.. An astonishing game. A true masterpiece with an incredible story and gameplay.. 2022 review: They don't make 'em like this anymore. A maturely written noir story. I struggle to think of better written games. Also the art style really holds up due to the realistic environments the game is set in. Incredible that this was released over two decades ago.. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 8 Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 9 Fun Factor : 7 Environment interaction : 4 Sound effects : 8 Overall Immersion : 8 There's no such thing as a perfect game. nice story nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. One of the most atmospheric and unique games I've ever played. Remedy are gods!. Jenny Leclue is practically a story in game form, it tells the story of a writer who has the Jenny Leclue book series, and we'll play this ""story"" that he's writing. It's a game to de-stress, play calmly, as if you wanted to read a book. The characters are interesting and the mysteries are intriguing. The only problem, which made me go down the game a lot, is that it leaves more open ends for a sequel than answers, really, the company bet on the game's sale because without a sequel everything would be open in the game. I recommend waiting for the sequence before buying, so you don't get frustrated.. There is a game that not like another **** a film,its a game,its a romance story, its an action.I think this game is unbelievable whenever you learn how to save the game :).. Impossible to deny the impact 'Max Payne' had on game industry (and mostly on FPS games) when it first came out back in 2001. It was just insane. The storytelling was gorgeous, the story interesting, bullet time was just insane, AI was great, boss fights were intense, dialogues were really cool, environment and weapons varied, the humor was awesome and the gameplay was terrific amongst others. Now we all have to admit that 'Maw Payne' didn't age well. Like not at all. Controls are pretty bad and rigid (speaking on PC), gameplay is really linear, soundtrack is unnoticeable, opponents shoot you through walls and all benefits from a sixth mysterious sense (generating a crazy difficulty), weapons are not that numerous, lighting is quite bad and some event triggers are really hard to find by yourself. This makes the game way less pleasant to play but still remains interesting to try.. I will stand by this forever as the best game I've ever played! An astonishing masterpiece that is frequently ripped off but will never be topped.. This game was really revolutionary, with the bullet time and all. With great story I consider it as one of the best shooter games Ive ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. With a protagonist reading poetry inside his head while having slow-motion gunfights, Max Payne is an amazing gaming experience that unfortunately aged not as well with a lot of cheap enemy placements.. It is by far the best action game in the Max Payne series. So what makes this game the best? - Gorgeous graphics by year of construction - It does not suffocate the player with its fluent narration technique. - Although the producers are not a strong company, the voiceovers are masterful - Its story makes you play with breathless and it's never a simple story, you can't even guess what will happen while playing. And I praise this game with many more items. I can say that the most important factor that makes Max Payne so good is the episode designs and the character's endless desire for revenge and determination. In addition, although the game was released in 2001, I did not encounter any bugs, so you can play it very easily today, don't be fooled by it's old age. You will miss the main soundtrack after the game is over. I'll leave it to the curious ****/watch?v=Cv0y0On8ZGQ. Even though it's been 20 years, Max Payne is still satisfying to play as it was back then when I played it on my old computer. Max Payne changed the gaming industry by popularizing the bullet time effect from the Matrix, which still remains a fantastic addition to the game. The gameplay is so addicting and it keeps you coming back for more. The story was engaging, not too complicated, but not too simple, as it utilizes the graphic novel to tell its story and is clearly inspired by Hong Kong action films and neo-noir films. The only downsides to the game is that the graphics look dated by today standards and the enemies can very repetitive. Overall, a great action game that stands the test of time for the most part and still remains very nostalgic to me. I want to thank Remedy and Sam Lake for bringing this incredible game to life and blowing our minds.. Summary: Classic. The Good: + The famous ""bullet time"" effect makes the action even more stylish. + The graphics of Max Payne are a sheer beauty; the engine is powerful and smooth, and the levels are quite detailed (for that time). + Max Payne kicks in on a very personal note. The Bad: - Max Payne is a very simple, linear game, almost to the point of turning into an ""on-rails"" shooter. - The gameplay is very basic, going back to the old days of shooters when problems were solved with blasting everything you see to pieces. - The game's heavily scripted AI and its reliance on simplistic setpieces make it feel even more restrictive, filled with situations where you are forced to do things a certain way. - Max's colorful comments may not fit everyone's taste; some of them try to be too sophisticated, making a strange expression.. This game is a legend. Very fun and very enjoyable. It's technically a legend for its year of release. Some said it was difficult, but I think it's average. And it is still played.. The story and gameplay are great. You will enjoy playing, you will be happy.. Impressive storyline and original gameplay makes this game timeless. Plays well in 2021. I enjoyed it.. Very unique game play, basically a legend. Good in any way for its time. Missing something like this.. I really like this game plot, style, these grimaces sound, narration through comics. In general, the Remedy are great. A good third person shooter. I don't know why, but Max's face always makes me laugh.. Classic Max Payne. Not much to say. Play it immediately if you still didn't play.. This game is rather decent atmospheric shooter with an interesting story. This game will makes your involved till the end of the story. Just believe me try it & you will remember your positive experience for ages.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story: 9/10 The Way story is given: 20/20 Gameplay: 25/30 Design: 9/10 Feelings left after playing: 18/20 Playability(Bugs and optimization): 9/10 AVARAGE: 90/100. I recommend Max payne is a very nice action game that still doesn't get old because the story and gameplay are very good.. Pretty decent game, and even holds up pretty well today. The only reason I give it a below average score is the bugs. Sounds during cutscenes don't play 90% of the time, and the music never plays. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my game specifically or with the PC port as a whole, but some other people have also had these issues. Besides that, the game is pretty fun. The shooting mechanics and slow motion are really fun additions, although it can be unfair, because enemies are placed behind walls with shotguns, and one hit kill you before you have time to react.. Max Payne has it all: Engaging story. One of the best Gameplay to date. Replayability. It is badass. Definitely in my top 10 games ever played!. It's 2012, and I'm still impressed. Pros: - Great story. Max Payne is on a journey to take a down a big hierarchy starting from the bottom. - Very fun gameplay. Bullet-time ability is well implemented. - Intuitive shootdodge mechanics. There is this one part where you have no ammo, and enemies are right around the corner. What you have to do is jump out in matrix style, grab the pistol, and shoot them, all in one action. It is very epic. - Reasonable difficulty - Good placement of cover objects - Interesting graphic comic cutscenes - Good voice acting - Intense and poetically dark dialogue - Good graphics for its time - Interesting characters - Nice array of weapons - Good replay value with additional difficulty and a time attack mode Cons: - Saving anytime you want gives the player too much power. Frequent checkpoints would have been better.. A Cult Classic from the gaming history... I loved its ambiance and style..... Max Payne an excellent game for that time which was released. A story with good immersion and good jobability.. Fantastic game. The story is fantastic, the graphics are very good for the time. The 80's thriller movie atmosphere is amazing, Max's poetic comments makes everything even more perfect. The combat is fun and the voice acting is top notch.. an certified classic , I mean every game with Bullet Time has this in they DNA, A game where you have to quick save every few step because it is f****** crazy difficult and I love it, I almost can't describe how fun it is to nail every bastard in this game , The story is so many cliffy's roll and each other that it works you can really feel the 90 start of 2000 in this one. Max Payne is one of the games that I played in my childhood and still play sometimes after so many years and it's still playable, you don't feel like this is a 19 years game (Well, actually you feel it but not that much). The story is good, the combat is so fun (BULLET TIME). It's a masterpiece.. A great classic game. With a great story and gameplay. But I really prefer the second one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible atmosphere, cool music, Incredible atmosphere, cool music, lots of weapons One of the best noir!!!. Max Payne has an amazing **** breaks 4th wall for many times,and this makes the game very interesting.Also the game has amazing controls for PC.Graphics are so good for a 2001 **** today,it can be playable.Easter Eggs,many guns,good gun **** there is a little **** game has a dark atmosphere.I loved the atmosphere but there is some haters for Max Payne because of this.Very amazing game,most enjoyable game,I've ever played... I've started playing action games with Max Payne and of course I'm happy about that. In my opinion MP is one of the best games so far and every gamer should play it first and then calls himself/herself a ""gamer"".. It was an amazing game! One of the best stories in video game history! 12hrs on record.. Max Payne is easily one of the best games ever made and even nearly 20 years later that fact still stands in my view. I have played many games since this came out but it still ranks up there for me. The story is a masterpiece that fits together wonderfully. The voice acting is fantastic, James McCaffrey was a perfect choice for Max. The soundtrack fit well and set the mood. The game play itself was a thing of beauty. No game allowed you to be in a John Woo movie before and until Stranglehold years later none who tried to emulate it did it well. For me one of the things I loved was the little details. When you walk in the snow you leave footprints. After a gunfight there are shell casings on the floor and your discarded magazines. There are bullet holes in the walls left by you and your enemies. All adds to the game and sadly are things many games still don’t do for whatever reason. The games comic book style way of telling the story was awesome and fit well with the FMV cut scenes. The news reports in the background and on the televisions was also an ingenious way to add to the story. The cast of characters are memorable. Even after all this time I still remembered them, all the way from Mona; Max; Bravura; Lupino; Gogniti; etc. There isn’t a wasted character or bad one in the bunch. The variety of weapons and ability to dual wield most of them made for a kid in a candy shop during gunfights. I did feel that the shotgun was a little under powered sometimes as even point blank it took 2-3 shots to put basic enemies down. It also didn’t make sense why Lupino needed so many bullets to go down despite not being superhuman, V or no V. These were minor things though that didn’t stop my enjoyment one bit. I played Max Payne on Linux using Steam’s Proton. It never crashed on em and I didn’t notice any bugs or glitches. There are 3 settings for AA; 3 settings for AF; and 13 other graphic settings. The game allows you to manually save whenever you want and gives 10 slots for that. There are auto saves for those who prefer. Alt-Tab worked. You can pause FMV cut scenes but not skip them. You can skip the comic book cut scenes. Performance was fantastic. The game certainly is no spring chicken visually but n it’s time it was top notch. A few times the FPS dropped from 144 but only dropped to 130 and 119 and only for a split second so it wasn’t an issue. I played version 1.05 of the game. Disk Usage: 792 MB VRAM Usage: 706-797 MB CPU Usage: 10-14 % RAM Usage: 2.4-3.3 GB Frame Rate: 119-144 FPS If by some chance you haven’t had the pleasure of playing Max Payne and enjoy shooters then rush out and get this now. I finished the first play through on the fugitive difficulty and it took me 7 hours and 10 minutes. I forget what I paid for my physical copy years back but for this Steam version I paid $2.55 and it is worth so much more. Even the full price of $10.99 doesn’t do it justice. One of the few games worth $50. My Score: 9/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 5700 XT 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 20.0.5 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 19.0.2 | Mate 1.24 | Kernel 5.6.7-1-MANJARO | Proton 5.0.6. Good story, good gameplay, excellent addition to bullet time, tons of fun. Nothing more","the story is roughly as follows: a character named Max Payne, a former nypd detective . he spends the last part of the game hunting his target towards the leaders of the aesir ."
438.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,"Even though I’m not a fan of turn-based RPGs, the original Final Fantasy VII is one of the most iconic video games of all time, and for good reason. Even though the narrative can be a bit convoluted at moments, the selling point of that game for me was the characters, their interactions, and their development. Not to mention all of the big impactful moments that keep this story so iconic and memorable. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a game that has a lot of things holding it back from true greatness in my eyes, but it still has exceptional things about it. It’s beautiful visually, Midgar has so much detail put into it, the soundtrack is phenomenal, there are plenty of funny moments kept from the original game, the combat is extremely fun and innovative, and my favorite part of the game is the characters, their interactions, and development throughout the story. For the original FF7, the English translation for the game wasn’t completely accurate, so the way characters are portrayed in it isn’t exactly accurate to how they are. For Remake, however, the writing of the characters was handled with so much love and care, and it’s awesome to see them being brought to life in this remake and see their growth with one another by the end of the game, especially Cloud. Cloud went from being a snobby, selfish **** at the beginning of the game to a more caring, heroic, and compassionate man who ends up genuinely caring about others. It’s great to see how much care was put into the character writing in this game, but many flaws are a drawback for me. For starters, there are some extremely weird and pace breaking segments of this game, like the part where you have to move the handles on these machines at the same time and direction as Tifa. It wasn’t that bad at first, but what makes it worse is that you have to do it three times, and each time it gets more annoying than the last. I also hated the mechanic where you have to move the claws around to traverse Aerith through the area, which was so extremely sluggish, tedious, and made me not want to play anymore after it. Some of the chapters in this game are also slow and not very fun, like the one that's more puzzle focused and you have to help these child spirits. It was the most slow and boring chapter of the adventure, and it’s stuff like this that makes me not want to replay this game. I also don’t like how the game doesn’t tell you things, the mostly optional side quests (thankfully), and its bloated length, taking me 24 hours just to finish the main campaign. All of these things make it sound like I didn’t like the game, but I do, it just has a lot holding it back from me loving it. Still, if you love Final Fantasy and have played the original FF7, then I highly recommend this title. And as for the Intergrade DLC, it’s alright, I don’t have much to say about it. I love Yuffie and she must be protected no matter what.. I... don't really know how I feel about FFVII Remake in general. I do believe that it was in need of a Remake, and that this represents the visuals and spruces up the gameplay SO well, but I also think that it feels like the most ""modern gaming"" take on the franchise, and makes changes in the most bizarre of places. There are a lot of unnecessary gameplay segments that disturb the pacing of the game, and every single one feels so bloated now. I guess that's to make better use of the HD environments and all, but it makes the game feel much less cohesive. The story changes were also so strange, because they have these stupid Harry Potter dementor-looking things that pop up everytime your character tries to do something that isn't a canon event. I thought the point of a Remake was to... remake the game? This should be a way to re-experience the story for modern audiences, not provide a new take on the story that some audiences may not have wanted to play thanks to the dated nature of the original game. I heard a lot of complaints about the voice acting being too cartoonish, and while that's valid, that's probably the least of this game's issues. I don't think this was the remake that we deserved after all this time, and the fact that the full experience will end up costing about $200 kind of hurts even more.. Some good parts but in general it feels really dragged out, completely ruining the game, you're constantly slowed down for no reason, some chapters just go on and on with nothing happening. The endless slow walking parts, corridors, ladders, crawling and soulless side quests take the flow out of the game. Could be good if it was 10 hours long, but they dragged it out by adding all these tedious, boring parts turning it into a 30+ hour game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. In its genere, probably the best jrpg I have ever played till the date, not to mention the best remake. There are certain games I keep in my heart such as RDR2, The Witcher 3, ZBOTW, Souls in the last decade, this one is now added to the list. These guys put their soul, heart and budget in FFVII Remake. Astonishing production in every single aspect, from Direction, Music, scripts, amazing dynamic/complex battle design, artistic design.. it's a 10. 2 points for those who did not play it yet, don't play it thinking in the old FFVII version, this one is an extended version of it, with much more Lore thus detail oriented, some few history differences from the Original, embrace it and you will see it surpassed it, this is an improved and longer version. And 2nd, if possible, get a nice screen with nice pixel density, colours and nits. The art is spectacular, worth to enjoy it in the best possible way.. my top 1 game, i really love it from the bottem of my heart, the characters and relationships specially. This game is linear and there is a lot of boring filler content that simply exists to stretch the lenght of the Midgar section from the original FF VII into a full game. Even so, a lot of content was cut from the original, including in the Shinra Building and Wall Market sections. Frankly, this game is only a must play for those people who never played the original for PS1 and want to experience the whole trilogy of remakes, since it introduces key characters and sets the story in motion; otherwise you might skip straight to Rebirth which is a much better game.. What an intro to a legendary franchise. The GOATs of the RPG. Hall of famer. what a wonderful game. Bring on part 2 and 3. Stunningly translates a classic to an entirely new and current-generation format. Tweaks the story in new and exciting ways. Combat and RPG elements are crisp and easy to use. A success in every way imaginable.. It would be a 10/10 if only they removed the wishper’s, the strange and twisted ""ending,"" and how Sephiroth was treated/handled.. A master piece and I think everyone is agree. The story is really well-written, the characters are all interesting and the combat system is a really pleasure (it can be easy if you want to chill or very precise if you want optimization and challenge). The only bad point for me is the mobility of our character: it is a corridor game, yes, but it feels like you are moving a 3 tonnes semi-trailer. You cannot jump or slipped on the ground, just walk slowly, step by step. It lacks a bit of freedom of movement, to feel comfortable and agile with the controller in hand.. Cool game, there's something so nice about it, but it's not perfect. The characters at first were incomprehensible, but the further the better they were revealed and I fell in love with them. Combat system is cool, the first time I see turn-based action game, interesting, although not always perfect feels good, especially the hill is uncomfortable, but although it looks spectacular, but the impact is not enough, enemies sometimes directly magnetize to me, it is impossible to dodge, the block also works terribly, no parry, + flying enemies are annoying and uncomfortable because there is no jump, in fact the game wants me to constantly take damage and hit, the ideal victory is difficult to achieve. Beat bottle necks, stupidly the whole game in them, these long animation climbing, ladders, etc., and the main thing that it is on a small location in one place, when even load nothing to do. Glabal plot is poorly understood, well fun with a living planet, MAKO and eco-terrorists, but these Ancients, ghosts of Destiny, paralelnymi dimensions are generally incomprehensible. Siferoth is also incomprehensible, it's necessary to go through other games to understand. The section in sector 6 with a semi cyberpunk city is the best part of the game. But despite all the negative aspects I love this game.. Gameplay 7/10: Can't really feel any difference from the PS4 version. So, Just for the Yuffie expansion and not the full game. It's ok but nothing really new compared to remake. Nice moves, Yuffie is fun to play but game doesn't give you much time to enjoy her. Side quests and mini games are also nothing special to add but that doesn't mean that they are bad. Graphics 10/10: Still perfect with great details. Yuffie skills looks cool and are made nice. World 7/10: More of the same we already had. It's great but it doesn't seem they work that much on that compared to the main game. Story & Characters 7/10: Yuffie story is short. Of course it's not the main game but still it's too short with just 2 chapters in it that doesn't offer something to the story.. This Game is perfect. This is a remake from the FF7 Original from 1997 and this game comes to 2020, but this version improves graphics and includes a DLC called intermenssions. This game is gonna get a trilogy. Also there's FF7 Rebirth. But I recommend to play this game when you're done with FF7 Crisis core reunion First. Then FF7 Remake Integrade andthen Rebirth. This game is a perfect open World.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love the game and it’s amazing graphics. Only downside is lack of side quests. Only in some chapters there are sidequests.. A truly great game that only falls short due to it's ending and the direction these remakes are taking opposed to the original.. Never played the original as I was a Nintendo kid. But I have to say I really enjoyed this game.. Gorgeous, lots of fun, great story. Can't wait to see how things continue to unfold!. The game is highly enjoyable, with beautifully designed characters. The storyline is full of suspense and keeps players on the edge of their seats. The combat system is incredibly satisfying.. Good content on Yuffie's story. The whole DLC is a bit short tho but still, I love it.. (Forgot to review at the time) Been seeing this game for quite some time while I was studying at the university, but I didn't have money nor the console to play it. That changed when I got my first job and my first PS5. After God of War: Ragnarok and The Last of Us: Part One, I finally bought this game and it was the most worthy game I have ever played. The game is beautiful. Amazing story and action. The characters have so much life in them that I got really immersed. I felt all kinds of emotions. This was the start of my obsession for the entire FF7 franchise and I couldn't wait for the rest of the trilogy and to explore the FF7 universe.. One of my favorite PlayStation games because it shows how much a game can grow from what it was.. This game improves a lot of things from the original one. We see a lot more of characters development even from the secondary ones. They mixed the old style per turn gameplay with the action genre we usually have today, it's a little awkward at first but as soon you get used to it, it's not bad. The only thing I did'nt liked was how this game only covers the first hour or two of the original game, they could've advanced a little more of the story but they did a wonderful job with what they covered here. What a treat from Square Enix! Looks great music is good too no complaint there!. Runs smooth at 60fps.....that's the positive. The game is a tedious over long borefest. Absolutely terrible pacing in order for the game to be split into 3 parts. The very sound of Barrets over the top voice made me want to throw the Dualsense through the TV screen. The combat initially seems okay, but by the time you have encountered the same enemy types a few times it becomes a chore. I've never wanted a game to end so badly as this. Amazed that this game is considered a 'masterpiece' , it is anything but.. Ultimate masterpiece the game that is absolutely 10/10 I dont get it why someone will rate it lower amazing game. I just finished playing this and I have to say it's a pure masterpiece. They nailed every single aspect of the original and the characters are voice acted perfectly. The original was a pure work of art but this hits you right in the feels like no other game. 20 years later and the emotional connection to the characters and world is stronger than ever! I really hope they nail the next 2 parts of the series. I'd really love to see them remake X & X2 as well as VIII. They also have exceptional potential!. I like it alot is my child hood game ps1 i play alot hours same characters and i really like the Voices. I'm one of those people, who haven't played the original FFVII. Before I started playing this Remake, I've played the Final Fantasy XV as my first FF and completely loved it. So I got into this game with really high expectations and got heavily disappointed. Main and side characters: First, the characters in your group are really annoying. Jessie literally screaming at you every second to ""not go there, go right"" in one of the beginning main story quests already got me being annoyed so hard at her and her annoying character in front of Cloud just made it worse. Characters, including Cloud, are also VERY naive, walking into buildings full of enemys thinking they don't get caught etc. In addition to that, the conversations are so... Flat and boring it's ridiculous. Fighting / control system: The fighting system is just weird. I've never played a game before where you have to attack with square - and also can't even change it. Items in combat can only be used when you have ATB - so if you are almost dead you can't use vita magic nor items when your ATB is low?! Also, when walking around normally, you can't even jump or roll around the world. Like literally Cloud can't jump the most little rock. In some places, he randomly can't walk faster and you have to walk slow just because someone behind you talks to you. Fast Travelling: Fast Travelling is introduced so late that you don't even need it anymore. Before that, you literally have to run through the same miles long streets 2-3 Times so you are already bored and annoyed. Also, Fast Travelling is so much more expensive (300 Gil in a game where you have little amount if items to sell) than in XV (literally 5 Gil and you can get rich so fast). Story: I don't know if it's because of I haven't played the original game but I don't understand anything of the story. There is no introduction to the world with Mako, reactors etc nor whats exactly the problem with it, it's like everything is lacking of information. Same for the SOLDIER thing (1000 times they said to Cloud ""Oh you're a SOLDIER!"" but NO explanation of what this is.). You get a few more information really late in the game but they still don't answer the questions and just come way too late. Because of this, I lost track of the story in game really fast even more and also got heavily bored by it. If you can't explain it so I at least rarely understand it, then don't make a game. I also had the feeling that there were soo many Cutscenes which where just unnecessary or way to long for what they wanted to tell me. Bosses and Fights: Too repetitve. There is a scene where you fight on a motorcycle for example. The first time it's cool and something different. Why doing the exact same thing again in Chapter 17? Also, there are 2 or 3 bosses you have to fight two times in the main story and there is almost no variation in enemys around the world / game. Side quests: I don't even want to say much to this. The side quests are so damn boring and unnecessary that I just did the ones I was ""forced"" to. Graphics: the only thing that was really positive on this game. Liked the graphics, especially the look of the cutscenes. Some other positive things: Liked the idea of items in sale in a few places. Also, the map is pretty ""linear"" and you never have huge problems to find out where exactly you have to go for the main story. I like the fact we can control the other characters in fights too, as some of them are way more effective against some enemies than Cloud. Overall, I will definietly not play Rebirth, most probably not even when it's free in PS Plus one day.. I played FF7 rebirth first. The graphics were good. So I was worried that going into FF7 RI is going to look worse since its 2.5 years older. I was wrong. The game looks and runs beautiful. A real Joy to play. I really like this Game, best storytelling, Good Characters and I really care about the characters in the game it is one of the best ps4 and ps5 games.. This game was largely defined by its writing, and it had great writing except for the very end (don't worry, I won't spoil the stupid ending), and the voice acting was some of the best I've ever heard, to the point where the voice acting itself really added to the experience. The best part, however, was how well they brought Midgar to life. The world-building in Final Fantasy 7 was always great, and for the remake they filled the game world with so many dynamic little details and npcs (all also well voice-acted) that it just felt so wonderfully alive and lived-in. The gameplay, however, was a little meh. The system they used to combine the real-time action and the old ATB system was very creative, original, and well-executed, but the real-time action component itself was severely lacking in any form of interesting gameplay design. The game is very story-focused, and has a surprisingly small amount of combat relative to story, but on the rare occasion that I found myself engaged in combat for a significant duration between story beats the combat got old pretty fast. In summary, the game is a wonderful story skillfully told in a beautifully built world, occasionally briefly interrupted by somewhat bad gameplay, and concluding with a stupid, nonsense-filled ending.. It’s my first final fantasy game ever and I am so like it. I recommend it for everyone who didn’t play any final fantasy game. Worst combat system in any game ever. The combat is so bad you will constantly want to install the game. No way developers played this and thought it was okay. Just imagine worst of strategy elements and worst of action elements. You combine these two together get this combat.. One of the best games I have ever played and one of the best combat systems I have ever played.. As a DLC, it is a pefect game. there are not so much volume, but you can enjoy it. If you like FF7, it is a must play.. This is not a remake, just a fanfic that is disrespectful to the original material and the fans of the compilation. Ghosts of fate? Time travel? Multiverse? This is not Final Fantasy VII and this game is not a Remake, it is a bad joke.. This was an amazing and beautiful experience. Wether you've played the original or this is your first experience it will be a breath of fresh air. The combat system is pretty simplistic but still fun when switching up materia and gear. Having such an in depth and visual upgrade to the original has been long awaited.. I started playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth without knowing absolutely anything about the previous games, or anything about Final Fantasy in general. Since I was loving the game, halfway through the story I decided to buy the previous games in ps5 (Crisis Core, FF7 Remake) to be able to enjoy Rebirth more. I must say that this game is AMAZING. I'm fascinated. The story, the characters, the main problem, the villain, the depth of each character, how much I enjoy each music, each battle, the minigames. It's not a perfect game, by the time this one is released, I'd like that we already have a totally open world, for example, but with all the fascinating things mentioned above, I feel compensated. I'm in love with Final Fantasy VII.. Prefer the original turn-based combat to the action rpg in the remake. Story was decent but lacks some charm of the original. I think the old midi quality music gives the original charm that is lost in a remake. Voice acting was good, production obviously great.. Incredible combat and builds, Flashy and Wavy. Marvelous Soundtrack Ethereal Atmosphere and feeling. Quick review: - bad gameplay - bad linear maps - bad fetch quests - bad story changes - bad technical issues (textures popup and framerates drop) These are the main issues I've found in this disappointing Remake of a classic like FF7. I suggest you to don't waste your money in this incomplete and boring reboot.. Sadly another bad joke produced by Nomura with the Square Enix money. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a fanfiction story that was inspired by the original game story just for changing all the chain points of the whole plot. Also adding a horrible action gameplay, and a bunch of atrocious fetch quests in the corridor maps. One of the most disappointing FF games ever. Pros - the gameplay is fun and feels crisp - build variety is quite robust thanks to myriad weapons and materia combinations - all playable characters feel distinct from each other in gameplay - great dialogue with amazing voice acting - the music is just perfect - the world feels extraordinarily immersive // Cons - Chapters 5, 6, 10 (because of 14) and 15 feel like filler that would have been better left on the cutting room floor - aerial combat in the main game is undercooked (Yuffie in Intermission fixes it) // This game is fantastic beyond measure, reimagining a classic for modern audiences. While there are things to complain about, it is a masterpiece despite its flaws. From the beginning to the end, the presentation, the characters and the dialogue feel fun and grounded. There is not a second in this game where I doubt anyone saying anything at all thanks to the wonderful script writers and voice actors. Then they hit you with the combat. Fast paced, dynamic, and fun action made deeper with the myriad of choices you make before you engage with it. Weapon upgrades, materia builds, character unique abilities, limit breaks, summons and more. All of the choices you make feel good. The difference between defeat and victory often stems from your preparation beforehand. What blew me away was the devs evolving the gameplay between the main game and the Intermission dlc. In the main game, aerial combat is undercooked and feels really bad. You have no defense in the air and you are often there for only three attacks that do almost nothing. The dlc fixes it, giving Yuffie an actual way to stick to aerial enemies and giving her a defense option with Brumal Form. The dlc also adds an incentive to perfect block showing that the devs are not afraid to evolve and improve their own gameplay, which gives me a lot of hope for the future installments. My other complaint stems from Chapters 5, 6, 10 and 15. Every single one of these feels like filler. If these specific chapters were cut the game would lose nothing and it would help the pacing considerably. Chapter 10 especially since in Chapter 14 you retrace the same area and fight the same boss. Overall, my experience with FFVII Remake is extraordinarily good. The couple of blemishes I mentioned did not stop me from getting a platinum for both the PS4 and PS5 version of the game so that should speak volumes to the quality of the experience. Can't wait to play the sequel.. 11 hours in, I've had enough, don't want to play anymore. The amount of unfun minigames are excessive and very boring, from picking up flowers to picking up boxes with loot crates. the story is cheesy and follows japanese anime tropes. the english dialogue audio is awful and is more bearable in japanese audio. much of the game feels like filler, there's decent boss fights but also many moments when theres nothing really happening, it feels like they're taking up time for nothing. the combat is fun-ish, its modern but theres few complex or meaningful decisions to be made. the gameplay outside of the combat is mainly corridor-to-corridor, extremely linear. It's just too boring to keep going, I can't handle another lame puzzle or more cheesy dialogue and filler-level events. it is alrighty.. a very good foundation for the series to move forward in future trilogy. It was the first jRPG I played and it was a great option to start with the genre. The game is absolutely fascinating. The story is a bit outdated (because the original game took place in the last century) but the storytelling is on the Last of Us level so one of the best in the industry. Of course it doesn't provoke such emotions as TLOU but up to 4-6h of good-written cutscenes are in place. The fighting system is great. I understood it fully about the end of the game which means it's so flexible and it allows to beat enemies in many ways including case when player doesn't give a **** what he's doing :) I've already bought next chapter - ""Rebirth"" and is looking forward to start with it.. The second half of this game is a mess and is written in a way that only people who played the OG will understand - literally every character acts like they understand what happened, but it's just confusing. What's the point of playing a game if it doesn't tell you what to fight for? After finishing the ending I was scared to play Rebirth.Still, it has a pretty decent play through the middle. The character's acting is awkward and fairly boring.. My Retroactive Review, This game was fantastic, most of the people complaining about it did not like some story elements. It is true the game is set in Midgar and makes you backtrack through a few area's but the combat is top notch and the voice cast knocked it out of the park. I enjoyed how they expanded this part of the story it is a well made game even if you did not like the Stuff with the Whispers. This game also kept me sane during the pandemic.. A very nice free update to PS4 owners. Little combat tweaks here and there makes the best version to play. INTERmission DLC is super fun. Fort Condor was a welcomed miningame.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Im gaming for over 35 years and been there through each gaming generation so **** game is a solid 10/10 in any aspect.I loved both the original back in 1997 and the remake that is apparently 90-95% similar to its original story. I feel bad for few of its fans who felt ""betrayed"" for the minimal changes in story while unleashing hate in a nonsensical manner. The developers were clear since beginning. This a Re-make! Expect some changes.I get its hard to please everyone nowadays and there will always be someone who will complain just for the sake of complaining, but it would be really great if we all could just enjoy the games while having fun and make all these wonderful memories for the future. Just how we did back in the day. The developers are extremelly aware of what they doing and as long as they deliver the game is a pure success and a legendary Final fantasy game. They cant ruin it as this game means a lot. The vast majority loved what they did including new and old fans like me. I wish more jrpgs would be like **** absolute must play for every jrpg fan and not only! Congratulations Square for your hard and dedicated work and im looking forward for the other 2 parts. Im sure they will score even higher!. Disappointing game. Sure you can push the graphics with all the cinematics CG cutscenes you want, but if the game end up to be repetitive and shallow as hell (because of the excessive linear map design) the whole game became just a chore to complete. Reaching the ridiculous new ending created just to build a fanfiction trilogy. Adding the exclusive DLC just for PS5 and the low res textures... I hade a lot of fun with this game! Combat is great, story is great... However there's just one problem now, the latest update regarding Tifa. The censorship is completely uncalled for and now the game is unplayable for me. One of my favourite RPGs of all time. The revamped combat system brings action to the table without sacrificing the strategic elements (unlike you FFXVI), the characters have more depth and the music/cinematic presentation is chef's kiss. Pretentious, mediocre game that relies on nostalgia and world-building to prop up otherwise irredeemable game elements: insufferable character tropes and dialogue, an empty world on rails, a severely downgraded version of Square's action/tac hybrid combat, and sluggish and awkward story pacing. FFXVI was a much better modern entry to the franchise, in my opinion.. Final Fantasy VII is without question a masterpiece in story telling. The Remake took the original and scaled the plot, scope, and size to astronomical levels. Even knowing what was coming next nostalgia doesn’t not prevent you from being pleasantly surprised by new details, plot points, and characters. The combat system is by far the best combat system in a squarenix game. Most notably being the later Intergrade release hinting toward the possibility of future games having synergy attacks. The character designs are flawless and almost life like. Whatever part of the gaming experience you might consider art; well this is indicatively it, especially in crisp 4k resolution! While some quirks with environmental items do pop up now and again and remind me this is a video game it never really ruined my immersion because the important things are there the characters are flawless, so is the combat, and a stellar story told again in 4k.. The best final fantasy game I ever play I can't stop play I can't wait for rebirth. This game is still a realization of a dream with a fleshed out story and an amount and love and care that I never though I'd live to see.. Worst battle system I’ve ever seen. The hybrid turn based/action thing they did manages to be the worst of both worlds. Dodging is completely useless, and special attacks are picked from a menu but can still miss?? What is the point of having a menu at all then? The pacing of the game is awful. It should have been about 10 hours but it was stretched out to an agonizing 40 hours of pain.. The original game is one of my best games ever. Remake was also really good :D. Never played the original game but this one is a masterpiece. Wow!!!!!!!!!!. This game is generally a gigantic disappointment for me. Final Fantasy VII already felt pretty overhyped to me, but what a mistake it was to give this game the chance to be my first impression of that universe. The characters are great, and there are some great moments in the story of this game. But I have never experience more terrible gameplay than in this game, and even the story falls apart with a terrible ending that makes no sense and is just boring. I don't get the hype behind this game at all.. Played it a few months and years ago so this is a late review, Love this game in its entirety. Its not perfect but its definitely excellent and essential. The main game coupled with the yuffie dlc is wow. Totally love the combat system as its a hybrid upgrade towards both turn based and action combat. If i have to give a con it would be the whisper and the slightly controversial ending. Hoping rebirth will be more grounded.. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a sure bet from SquareEnix for the future of the franchise.Even though it is a Remake proposal, its system and mechanics present improvements compared to Final Fantasy XV and giving value to situations using strategies.. The game is amazing, has every thing done right from music to story the c","Final Fantasy VII Remake is a game that has a lot of things holding it back from true greatness in my eyes, but it still has exceptional things about it . it's beautiful visually, Midgar has so much detail put into it, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and there are plenty of funny moments kept from the original game . the writing of the characters was handled with so much love and care, and it's awesome to see them being brought to life in"
439.Hollow Knight: Voidheart Edition,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A masterpiece. Simply as that. The more you play the more you are intrigued about what will happen next.. Its the best game i Ever Played the Detail, leanght and difficulty Are perfekt. And that everything has a dark meaning behind it is very cool just like the suprises and Extras.. It is a very creative game with beautiful graphics and cool gameplay - however I do not this it is as mindblowingly good as everyone is telling it is. One of the greatest games ever made. Incredible combat and boss fights, beautiful soundtrack, and punishing yet addictive gameplay.. Hollow knight is one of the best games I have ever played HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.. This game is very very very good if you like exploring caves and fighting hard bosses the only problem is mods you cant download them! RECCOMEND. Very good game, but too hard for me.. I had to stop the game in the middle of it... The experience that Holloe Knight offers you is unique, at first it can be a little overwhelming because of how big the map is, or how surprisingly difficult it is at times, but it is undoubtedly a magnificent game. The gameplay is challenging, it has good mechanics, good characters, the atmosphere it offers is unique and its soundtracks are one of my favorites. I only found out about the story after watching a video on YouTube, but otherwise it's a great game. The only bad thing is that hornet never gets naked.. Wow. just WOW. This ""game"" does nothing new or innovative or anything to push this genre forward. The only point for this ""game"" existing is for the devs to say that they can copy other peoples work. Everything single thing in this ""game"", from the ost to the art style has all been done before and done better. Now the devs are using the Silksong hype to sell more copies of this ""game"". Silksong is never going to happen but they dont want you to know the ugly truth.. Best game in the world 60 hours in and no funny cats or bad times 100 percent recommend this game it's is the only thing I love in this world. Perfect. Masterpiece in a games world. No mistakes. It’s my favorite game ever. Congratulations Team Cherry. A masterpiece. At the beginning may be a little disappointed, but a couple of hours later you will want not to end!. One of the top games I ever played, if not the best. I dare saying this game is completely flawless. I acknowledge at the start it may be overwhelming not knowing a thing about yourself or the world, but I guarantee you that if you care to do the true ending and put all the puzzle pieces together, it is absolutely dazzling how good this game's lore is; actually, this is the only 2d game that ever made me care abot its story, and it is one of the best in the whole videogame industry. The music, besides being just plain excellent, is likely the one that fits its enviroments the best out of any videogame. I could probably imagine the place on which the music takes place without haven't even seen it. Much how I already mentioned, it is also very good to listen on its own. Platforming is secondary, but it's really just intended to be this way. Combat, on the other hand, is absolutely flawless. It's as simple as it could be: swing your weapon foward, up, or down and gain ""soul"" to cast spells and heal on the process, but the enemies are so well designed and fit so thightly into the system that it feels like the most complex thing in the world. You also unlock a variety of mobility abilities thoughout the game in the classic metroidvania fashion, none of which I""ll spoil, but they also play a crucial role in combat and flashing it out even further. The game is punishing, but I didn't find it nearly as hard as some people claim it to be; casual players can easily beat the game without much trouble. For hardcore players, there are some absolutely soul crushing challenges like the Pantheon of Hallownest (which is essentially a boss rush) and the steel soul mode, in which you can't die or you lose your progress. The game doesn't hold your hand, like metroidvanias usually don't; you will need to care about it enough to feel where to go at the right moment, and I don't know how, but this game exceeds at this so much... the graphics are also very underestimated. Alongside with the music, they can make you feel whatever they want whenever they want. The game also features 4 free DLCs, two of which added an astoundishing amount of content, with as much quality as what came before. And do I even need to talk about the bossfights; in this game, they are either very good or as good as a bossfight could even possibly get. This game is just too masterful for every single person on the planet not to at least try it.. Great game with great graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack.. Is the best game metroidvenia. This game is perfect, with great environments, gorgeous gameplay, gorgeous art style, and the audio is phenomenal too. The exploration is a lot of fun, all of this stuffed with intricate and exciting lore. A great metroidvania.. Hollow Knight Review:Hollow Knight is definitively a masterpiece and arguably the single greatest metroidvania ever made. From discovering Dirtmouth at the start to fighting the final boss and receiving one of the many endings to the game. Every new area you discover feels vibrant and unique. The Fungal Wastes are toxic and dangerous, whilst the Ancient Basin is very ominous. On top of that, almost every NPC that you can encounter has an interesting character and an interesting story. Every time you stumble upon one of them in the world, it feels natural, and not like they were placed there to be found. On top of this, every boss fight in the game is unique and interesting. For example, the False Knight, which you fight at the beginning of the game, only opens itself up to real damage when you stun it. Every boss has its own interesting attacks to learn and master. Additionally, every boss has an incredible theme to accompany its fight. Hallownest feels lived in. From the enemies patrolling their respective rooms, to the NPCs just trying to get by in this harsh world. Each area of the game has its own ecosystem and its own dangers. Moreover, the way that the game leads you in the right direction is incredible. Every obstacle blocking your path feels natural and like something that could genuinely happen in the world. The art design is creepy and unique. Not to mention the length of the game. Hollow Knight took me over 70 hours to finish the game and beat all the DLC, including the Godmaster boss rush, which adds an extra level of challenge for anyone who needs it. With no cutscenes and no obvious story to follow blindly, the game’s plot still managed to keep me hooked right up until the very end and past it. I did everything possible in the game and fought the final boss at least 4 times to get every ending, just because I didn’t yet want to leave the world of Hallownest. My one very slight criticism is that, whilst playing on pc, the controls are initially counterintuitive, and some controls aren’t even bound. I had to set all the controls when I started the game. Other than this slight critique, Hollow Knight is the perfect 2d soulslike metroidvania and that’s why it gets a 10/10.. This game rocks so goddamn hard, the characters and enemies are charming, the exploring and the Metroidvania aspects are perfected, and the combat is so fine tuned. BUT the beginning is kinda a slog to get through, ridding new people who don't have enough patience, but other than that this is a must play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Combats understandable and difficult and platforming is unique replay is awesome and valuable exploration is plentiful and story is detailed all great in this masterpiece ****. Considering it's an indie game made by only five people, the quality is incredible, the strokes seem to be handcrafted, the difficulty is average, in summary, it's a wonderful game, if you think about playing it, don't hesitate, play it! Note: Does this version not support mods?. For me this is a game with middle rating. I waiting that this game will be similar of Ori, but its different games. I dont saw story in the start of this game. I dont saw story in the end of this game. Very difficult fight with boss and no monitoring of current target+very small explain about fight details and amulet's. A treasure in the gamepass, I launched it because I saw the game in a twitch stream and loved it. Wonderful level design, music, gameplay, lore, this game has everything.. The most perfect style game of the decade and the best gaming experience I've had lately.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super challenging metroidvania, I´ve spend countless hours, a masterpiece of the genre, can´t wait for Hornet on Silks Song!!.. This is my second time through Hallownest (first time on PC), and, although just as daunting the second time, also just as beautiful. It's atmospheres that truly express the beauty of the bugs below, but there's also an acute melancholy to it all. Darkness in the City of Tears doesn't get illuminated by the Radiance, and that's okay; here the light is the antagonist, let us blend into the shadows. Team Cherry pulls out a fantastic metroidvania that not only reinvigorates the genre, but sells an entirely new generation on the older games too. Masterful.. Gaming perfection! If you like running around and exploring different environments, you'll love this. The story and characters are intriguing, the combat is tough (especially on your first run before you figure things out). Similar to the Ori games, but better imo.. Hollow Knight is a masterpiece, what initially appears to be just a decent metroidvania, ends up being an amazing game, with a beautiful soundtrack, with incredibly detailed scenarios, interesting characters, and a good story that is subtly told throughout the game, really worth playing.. Such a great game, would recommended, I feel bad for people that give this game bad review because they can't play it, because they playing game like journalist. Anyway this game have good gameplay, great music, and great art, and I'm surprised that this game made by 3 person, thanks team cherry for this great game, even this game 2d and metroidvania type I feels immersive playing this game, 10/10. This is literally the best game I’ve ever played. It’s forever changed my life.. A vast world with hidden lore. Wandering through this world you will learn of its wonders hidden but one must search hard or you may miss it. Strong and emotional music echoes as you go through this journey as a small bug. But not with out your trusty nail by your side. One must have patience and timing to play a game like this. If you decide to go through it. It will be hard and very hard like WTF hard but it's well worth it .. This game is just near perfect! You can play by hours and hours and not be tired because all of the universe in Hollow Knight is a Masterpiece.. Simply perfect! This game is a masterpiece. Can’t wait for the second chapter .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. platform was meh, graphic rigid and uninteresting. There are way better metroidvania out there, this is overhyped.. HOLLOW KNIGHT Hollow knight is the most visually pleasing 2d game, that I have ever seen. The mystery of the world and the characters is interesting and exiting. The best indie game of the decade.. This game is the most fun I have had in a game in 2 years. It is challenging but fair, and the upgrade system is fair. It is the perfect Perfect Metroid Vania.. Hollow Knight is that kind of easy to learn, hard to master game. It starts out as a simple Zelda alttp / Ori and the blind forest and it turns out to be even harder than Salt and Sanctuary, Ghouls n Ghosts and Dark Souls, but as a metroidvania it delivers more. This is a masterpiece title. It feels like Silent Hill 2, Ori, Super Metroid, supermeatboy, dark souls and castlevania are held together to offer you a metroidvania 2.0 exploration system. By far, the best metroidvania ever made.. Masterpiece. I ran around lost in this game figuring everything out. It took me 75 hours to unlock the first ending. I prioritized all the mapping tools like the map and quill, wayward compass, pins, and map markers. Bought every map. When I started new games I was surprised how high the replayability was. Aside from unlocking other endings and beating the TRUE final boss of the game, I was also able to speedrun the game and beat it in under 5 hours. This game can be very challenging and confusing. I like difficult games so that works for me. The controls are flawless. The gradual character development is great, it actually goes by very quickly once you know where you are supposed to be going. After all the time running around in the Hollow Nest my favorite setup involved making my nail as long as possible (longnail + mark of pride) along with quickslash and fragile/unbreakable strength. Plus collecting all the pale ores and fully upgrading my nail at the blacksmith... it's just a lot of fun to run around with that setup. I highly recommend running around lost in this game for a long time. Don't memorize the path by watching it on YouTube first. My first run through was my favorite. If you liked games like super metroid you will love this game.. Hollow Knight takes you to a vast and alive world of insects inmersed in a creepy but beautiful darkness. This game made me fell in love with its way for creating an atmosphere that encouraging to you to explore and discover all secrets includes. Beautiful Story, universe and heady soundtrack. My respetcs to Team Cherry and Christopher Larkin.. Finally got to play it and its good from start to end. I recomend the game, if you have a taste for little dungeon like adventures with simple but charming art styles.. In terms of content the game has a huge amount for you to get to grips with and without a doubt the many secrets the content has will keep you coming back for more. The presentation side of the game is absolutely fantastic in all areas and both the visuals and sound design bring the game to life in every way possible. I really enjoyed the boss fights in the game because they actually felt like they mattered and they were thrilling from start to finish. Technically the game holds up really well throughout and I was very pleased to find that the controls remained tight and responsive at all times. Exploration is rewarded handsomly because there’s so much to find and finding something always gave me a great sense of achievement. Every mechanic in the game feels extremely polished and it makes the game an absolute joy to play. It can be a little too difficult at times which can cause you to be a bit frustrated every now and then. Hollow Knight is an absolute gem **** and without a doubt one of my favourite game’s of all time because everything about it oozes class and charm and it takes you on an unforgettable journey that you won’t forget for a very long time. Everything about the game just seems to click from the fantastic boss fights to the excellent platforming elements and you’ll definitely be more than satisfied with what the game throws at you. You’ll be pleased to know then that the game throws a lot at you because in terms of content the game has a huge amount for you to sink your teeth into. This content also has a huge amount of variety present in it as well and exploring the various amount of content delivers a lot of secrets to you as well which means the game has a lot of replaybility and you’ll find it very difficult to put down. At the end of the day I can’t recommend Hollow Knight enough because it just gets so much right and it really doesn’t have any problems so I urge everybody to add this game to their game library.",the more you play the more you are intrigued about what will happen next . the more you play the more you are intrigued about what will happen next . the more you play the more you are intrigued about what will happen next .
44.The Last of Us,"The last of Us probably has one of the best action/horror game ever. it has one of the best stories in a game. And also has some of the best characters ever in a video game. it's is a bit overrated. To be honest with you it gets boring real quick so that's why it's a 7/10. IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME YET THEN PLAY IT BEFORE YOU DIE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SINGLE GAME LIKE THIS IN THE WORLD THAT COULD RIVAL IT IS A MASTERPIECE. I DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.. It was the only reason I purchased a PS4 back then, and this game made it entirely worth the $400. Never could stand zombie games, but this is my only exception. I can never pass up phenomenal story telling. It made me think so much, it made me feel depressed so much, and it grounded me and immersed me into a world so devastating so much...... I ended up getting the game twice, for the remastered version I played first and the PS3 one I got later on. And its a goofy, consumerist fact about me, but I don't care, it was very important for me. and I also felt like I needed to respect the roots of gaming so I got it twice. and they are still two proud pieces of gaming history I carry on my shelf I still feel Loving to go back and play.. one of the most beautiful stories you'll ever experience pulling you into its world and making you feel every moment of its events. The gameplay masterfully combines stealth and action, creating an experience that's nothing short of legendary and unforgettable. And let's not forget the soundtrack—it's so hauntingly beautiful that you'll find yourself listening to it even outside the game.. 9.4/10. This game is almost not even enjoyable to play in some ways, but that's what makes it so great. I didn't want to face the infected or hunters. I wanted Joel and Elle to make it through their Journey safely. And that goes to show how immersive and real this game can feel.. Unfortunately, it's overrated. It definitely feels like a game for non-gamers or new/casual gamers. It tries too hard to be a movie, which results in a lack of gameplay. The levels are basically corridor-like rectangles and squares with overly detailed environments, making looting a chore. The way back is magically sealed off very often, which can be annoying when you're looking for a secret room. There's no option to turn off the adaptive difficulty, and the game lowers the enemy count very quickly after deaths. The environmental puzzles are too easy, repetitive, and can feel unnecessary. The story and characters are good. The combat and stealth mechanics are definitely the best part of the game, and can be a lot of fun.. A somewhat compelling story with a game attached. The gameplay is serviceable, nothing revolutionary, sometimes tedious. The worship this game gets is beyond me. The legacy that this game left is in many ways worse than it is, leading to the rise of these long & drawn-out scripted wannabe movie games, that put gameplay second. Perfect for the normie masses to sink their teeth into. 5/10. The game that ruined all other games for **** other game had come close to this one. I compare every banger to this one as a standard. I didn’t think a video game could be perfect but this one to me is. Story gameplay, smart enemies, voice acting…just everything is perfect; and I’m blown away naughty dog was able to do this.. Best game ever created, recomented to everyone. The best history ever made in video game history.. Greatest game I've ever played. Flawless in every aspect. Life changing game. The Last of Us for PS3 has often been hailed as a masterpiece, but after attwmpts at playing through this game, I found it to be a largely overrated experience. What should have been an engaging post-apocalyptic journey felt like a predictable slog, with little to keep me invested beyond the surface-level plot. One of the major problems is how the game leans into standard apocalyptic tropes without bringing anything fresh to the table. The world is overrun by infected, civilization has collapsed, and survivors have turned into ruthless scavengers. It's the same setup we've seen countless times before, and The Last of Us doesn't do much to elevate it beyond that. Additionally, the AI in the game is frustratingly predictable and, frankly, dumb. Enemies and allies alike often act in absurd ways. Whether it’s companions loudly running around without consequence or enemies getting stuck in basic patterns, the AI lacks the intelligence needed to make encounters feel tense or challenging. This predictability makes stealth and combat feel more like a chore than a thrilling survival experience. As for the gameplay itself, it’s a slow burn that borders on boring, so much so that it took me 6 attempts to complete this game as I would give up due to boredom (I fell asleep during gameplay during one attempt). The pacing drags, especially during long stretches of exploration where there’s little to do but walk around dilapidated environments. The moments of action are often too spread out, leaving a lot of downtime that feels padded just to stretch out the playtime. Overall, while The Last of Us does feature decent visuals and a solid emotional narrative, the actual experience was underwhelming. The predictable story, repetitive combat, and uninspired AI make it hard to justify the high praise.. There are many great video games like the RDR, GOW and the ghost of tsushima but the only best game of all time is ""TLOU"". Best history-based game of all time. The quality of the plot is comparable to some top films and all of the characters are highly charismatic.. Wow, just wow. The Last of Us is like the ultimate emotional rollercoaster—except instead of a fun ride, you get a gut punch every five minutes! Joel and Ellie’s journey through a post-apocalyptic world makes me feel all the feelings. The clickers are terrifying, but nothing compares to the horror of losing your favorite character (no spoilers, don’t worry!). The graphics are gorgeous, and the storytelling is top-notch. Just grab some tissues before you dive in. 10/10 would take a road trip through the apocalypse again—just maybe not with a toddler in tow!. Very good game I played this on ps3 after I finished this on my Ps4 prolike 2 or 3 times. And recently I finished this game with my pc on remake version. Very good story game strongly recomend to play. The last of us my favorite game ever, the story is amazing. I originally played this game on PS3 and the graphics were amazing, probably the best in his generation. The music and the scenarios were terrific.. Released in 2013, ""The Last of Us"" isn't just a video game; it's a masterpiece that was far ahead of its time and remains a benchmark for narrative depth and emotional storytelling in the gaming industry. At a time when many games were still focusing on action-packed sequences and straightforward plots, ""The Last of Us"" brought an unexpected and impressive level of depth to the action-adventure **** story of Ellie and Joel is gripping, heart-wrenching, and unforgettable. From their first encounter to the final scene, the game takes players on an emotional journey that goes far beyond what one would expect from a video game. It's the portrayal of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world that makes ""The Last of Us"" so unique. The relationship between the two main characters develops authentically and touchingly as they navigate through a ruined and dangerous world.What sets this game apart is the way it captures mood and atmosphere. Every environment, every detail of the decimated cities, and every sound in the derelict buildings contributes to the oppressive yet captivating atmosphere. Often, players feel lonely, depressed, and hopeless—but this is precisely what makes the experience so intense and engaging.Another aspect that elevates ""The Last of Us"" above other games of its time is the unwavering tension. Despite the relatively slow-paced narrative and moments of calm, the game never becomes boring. The story unfolds with a steady but compelling rhythm that continually drives the player forward. Every moment feels significant, every encounter with other survivors or infected is a new challenge that emotionally involves the player and often pushes them to their moral limits.Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a groundbreaking game that, through its complex, emotional story and perfectly captured atmosphere, not only surpasses other games of its era but also stands today as one of the most outstanding and influential works in video game history. It is an experience that lingers—a journey shared with Ellie and Joel that stays with you long after the game is over.. The greatest game in the history of the world. I've finished it 10 times etc only play. 10/10, first game that I finished and it was completely worth it, absolutely a masterpiece, best game ever.. The first game to make me cry. I was 22 years old. A epic and unforgettable history. At the time I was surprised with the emotions this game proposed. Legendary.. Despite the fact that the game was released in 2013 (11 years ago), the game is wonderful even today, the plot, gameplay, atmosphere, everything in this game is perfect. I played through the game 6 times and each time I received many different emotions, the plot of this game will never get boring, it perfectly conveys the experiences and emotions of the characters. Before this game, I didn’t like stories about post-apocalypse and zombies, but this game changed my opinion. To all those who ever get their hands on a Playstation, they are obliged to go through this masterpiece, thank Naughty Dog for such a masterpiece game!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Last of Us is a landmark in video game storytelling and design. Its compelling narrative, well-developed characters, and atmospheric world combine to create an unforgettable experience. Despite some linearity and repetitive elements, the game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The emotional journey of Joel and Ellie is one that resonates deeply, making The Last of Us a must-play for fans of narrative-driven games. It stands as a testament to the power of video games as a medium for storytelling, offering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Beautiful story of a burly father and his surrogate daughter filling the hole left behind by his old family. Gameplay is very fun although short lived. A perfect amount of stealth or brute force involved and attention to detail is amazing. Naughty dog did an amazing job of constructing a realistic fun story.. The rare one that is 10/10 for me. Dont miss this one if you are a single player guy/gal. Literally the best game for me so far. I think “The Last of Us” has only one drawback - it ends. Great story, memorable characters, interesting gameplay are only a small part that makes TLOU a masterpiece. Must played!. Got this game not knowing what it was a few years ago but I bought one of my favorite games. One of the most overrated games of all time and nothing but a poor mans Resident Evil 4 with trash gameplay as well and below average story telling.. The best ps4 games were mostly amazing because of their stories, and they are nothing without this one. Masterclass in storytelling, stunning graphics, great gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, Joel and Ellie are really good characters, great pacing, very realistic and detailed to make the story more engaging.. My favourite game ever. Everything is well made. Story is simple but good, narration is top tier, as well as music. Visuals were at the top at it's release time, and are still standing at a very high level nowadays. Gameplay is also very solid and not over complicated for nothing, a bit simple but it works. So many emotions playing this. I recommend 100%. One of the best games released,the fact that this game came out for PS3 with those graphics is hilarious. This is a masterpiece. When it came out in 2013 there just wasn't a game like this, that was almost perfect in every aspect. Obviously the writing and characters (perfectly built) lead the experience, but other elements like the aesthetic, the shooting, the tecnical performance, and the AI of the enemies, make of this game an entertainment of top quality. Special mention for the OST and sounds, Gustavo Santaolalla is such and incredible artist, and fortunately he found the right opera to canalize his art into. This is a game that start and finish in a way that could be stand alone, and still be a magnificent product, but ironically, because Part 2 is so unbelievably unreachable, you could take this one as just an introduction, because the real magic happens in Part 2. Still the chemistry that take place between Ellie and Joel here is marvelous, and alone a good reason to play this game. Pure art.. Honestly the best plot in all of gaming. Like alot of Sony's ""movie games"" the gameplay is lacking which they fixed in Part 2. However the story is so good youjust don't notice it.. I've played this game three times. Two of them are on ps4, the latest one is on **** game has a powerful and sophisticated story, focusing on the grey moral area after the apocalypse while the main characters all are fighting their human emotions. It has one of the best performances, which makes you have a emotion rollercoaster constantly. However, this game does not have a phenomenal gameplay like the story. And I blame this for many sony movielike video games afterwards, just lack of fun gameplay. The story is a lighting in a bottle, indeed, but this is a not flawless game.. Amazing game and story, gameplay is alright (not outstanding, but serviceable), but the game doesn't drag on too long for it to get stale. Hard to believe it was a PS3 title as it still holds up (there is the remastered version on ps4 which I did play, but don't feel that it was a huge upgrade, and I don't feel the need to play the ""remake"" as it doesn't really add much more for it to be worth the cost to me). Also, factions man. That was fun (though I **** at it).. One of the best games in the last and next 10 years. Story best. Gameplay is the best.. Undeniably one of the best games ever created! I find myself replaying this game every year just to experience the captivating story one more time. The linear story, level design and character development are in a league of their own compared to any other video game to date.. Cant get much better than this story and pacing wise and the graphics are beautiful. Gameplay was occasionally dull in certain areas though.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is just what a lineal game should be fun, short, great story, good gameplay, replayable the only bad thing about TLOU is that there's no chapter select but it came out in 2013 and i dont know if chapter select was a thing back then. Awesome game every one must test the Story 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Weapons&zombie 10/10. One of my absolute favorite games. Couldn’t put it down. It’s one of those games I revisit every few years.. Loved the game and the immersion. It's not that much to say about it, it's just a fantastic game.. What I'd do to erase this game from my mind just to play it all over again for the first time.. Incredible game, pushing the PS3 to it's limits. I recently plugged the console to my 4KTV, and I was even more impressed. Crisp graphics, like it was made last year. Immersive gameplay, where I got instantly hooked.. Unpopular oppinion but i dont like this game I have played for 4 or 5 hours and try it out a few years later bu - No i dont like such kind of (filmy games). Got no idea why people love this game so much, plot is mid, gameplay is mediocre.. One of the best ones of it generation, great gameplay, great story. It's very excited play this game.. Absolutely remarkable in every way. Unbelievable graphics, atmosphere, voice acting, storytelling, worldbuilding, everything. This is a story you just have to experience. I'm a grown man and it made me cry. It's utterly devastating and worthy of consideration as real prose. I cannot believe it took me this long to find this game. This is as close to a perfect game as it gets, and its enduring legacy will live on forever.. This is an amazing game, a captivating story, and set of characters, amazing graphics and gameplay mechanics, it's a beautiful game.. simply perfect, the soundtrack, the gameplay, everything was perfect, I spent a while afterwards thinking I was done but in summary it's all very good, 10. Naughty dog at his peak. One of the most emotional and entertaining stories ever told.. It just amazing nothing more……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………………... Played this game on the first day of release. It was soooooo good and refreshing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. first of all, this game is not the greatest at all) its just decent game with pretty interesting plot and very bad level design, it so bad that i cant tell how much guys its terrible). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game, I can only say the best game, great story, great gameplay ️. A Successful PlayStation First Party Game, shows us PlayStation can also make the top game.. The Last of Us is the BEST Video Game I have ever played, the story and characters make this game an absolute Masterpiece and Naughty Dog's finest work. Another walking game ""buy"" Sony boring, when are they going to take a chance like they used to and make good games?. I played this game all the way back in 2014, one of the first games I ever played in fact. The greatness of TLOU is widely known even a full decade post it's original release. The storytelling, world building, characters and atmosphere are still to this date unmatched and will probably stay that way in the near future. The gameplay is no less breathtaking, the stealth sequences are some of the best in gaming, even beating some of the games that focus solely on that aspect. Overall a must play for anyone who wants to go through a once in a lifetime story.. It’s December 2023 and this is my most played game on PlayStation. It was the Multiplayer that made this happen. I have 1575 hour and I’ve been playing this game sense 2014. It’s very sad to see that Factions 2 has been cancelled. Yes this game is no longer supported & sometimes people cheat with glitches shooting through walls, but this is my Favorite multiplayer and I will still play this game. I'm very disappointed with Naughty Dog not giving us multiplayer for Part 2 or the Standalone MP that was promised.. A big cheer for the graphics. A massive woo hoo for the storyline (a cross between Silent Hill, Homefront and I am Omega). However, these are the only two plus points as far as I am concerned. First of all, the very long **** time are a kick up the rear end each time you load the game...after 3-5 minuutesit then decides to tell you its **** it takes a further 2-3 minutes for anything to come on screen! I mean, what era are we living in?!? Even Spectrum Sinclair games were quicker to load 30-40 years ago! And then there is the clunky gameplay to mate your eyes water. The character/enemy movements are real and pleasing to watch, but when it comes to combat, it feels really awkward...quite generic, been there, done that methodology. And whats with this getting hit and being shoved backwards with bullets? And if you are shot or injured, you dont just wrap your wrist in bandages now do you?!!? If only there was a healing system akin to Alone in the Dark (2008). So whilst I respect the fact that Naughty Dog tried to produce a fab game, and many like it regardless of the negative points, I feel there are far better and more absorbing games out there, third person or FPS's, that do the job well overall.. Good story, good characters, decent gameplay. So, overall its a good game held back by lackluster gameplay and I can't help but feel the game is slightly overrated. It didn't wow me in 2013, and doesn't wow me now.. This game is a masterpiece! Deserved of all the hype, after 10 years I have finally played and it is worth every minute. First of it all, the gameplay is fun and very rewarding as you progress, the action has great animations and the crafting system really makes you think before using it. The level designs are smart and challenging, always allowing for multiple ways to progress, either by stealth or fighting. I also appreciate how believable the worldbuilding is, and the art design of every city and the scenario are just stellar even after 10 years! Most importantly, the story is amazing, probably the best ever in any videogame, from its deep thoughtful themes, precise pacing and smart and grounded characters, and on top of it all you have by far the best acting in the industry, with performances worthy of an oscar. In conclusion, this game is the benchmark to the industry to follow even to this day, and specially regarding the post apocalyptic genre, its a game that delivers in every aspect and has NO FLAWS, its clear that a lot of effort and attention to detail was necessary to achive such quality. Oh, and the soundtrack is the perfect tone to this game, everyone involved in this game should be very, very proud!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The greatest ever game I have ever played and till this very moment Nov 20, 2023, I still hold that view. Rdr2 a close second. Love this game, but did not manage to finish it yet. So advanced for its year of release. 9.7⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣/10. See German Version below. Siehe deutsche Version unten. ---------- I played through the game when it was released and was impressed by the story. I remember the graphics and gameplay as contemporary. The graphics were even slightly above average. I still think the story is one of the best I've ever played. However, I wouldn't give it a complete 10,00 because I had to deal with a few minor bugs. I also don't like the fact that it's an exclusive title that hasn't been made available for other platforms over the years and the servers were shut down too early. Rating 9.5 rounded up to a 10. ---------- Ich habe das Game damals bei Release durchgespielt und war beeindruckt von der Story. Die Grafik und das Gameplay habe ich als zeitgemäß in Erinnerung. Die Grafik sogar leicht überdurchschnittlich. Ich finde die Story immer noch eine der Besten, die ich je gespielt habe. Eine glatte 10,00 würde ich dennoch nicht vergeben, da ich mit einigen kleineren Bug zu kämpfen hatte. Ebenso finde ich es nicht gut, dass es ein Exclusivtitel ist, der auch über die Jahre hinweg nicht für andere Plattformen vefügbar gemacht wurde. und die Server wurden viel zu früh abgeschaltet. Bewertung 9,5 aufgerundet knapp eine 10.. This Game Is Much Better Than This Garbage Sequel 10 Out Of 10.. Best Game IMO, a must play for everyone, crazy good experience.. A masterpiece which changed my vision of gaming, incredible characters, great storytelling and great gameplay.. The Last of Us certainly helps prove a point that gaming media is a different experience compared to movies or books. The combat may not get up there with the likes of Halo or Metroid, nor get to the stealthiness of Thief or Metal Gear, but for what it is, it accomplishes it well enough. Really though, I encourage anyone with an interest in gaming to at least play this game, its certainly something worth experiencing.. The story in this game is one of the most well-crafted I've ever seen. The relationship between Joel and Ellie will always mean something to me, regardless of the idiotic sequel that made it all amount to nothing.. Theres only one word to describe this game: Masterpiece. Top 3 games of all time. Speechless and heartfelt Story. One of the most realistic stories of what a world-ending epidemic would look like, in my opinion. Mix in with that the human story, with Joel & Ellie as your characters, and it's enough to make a grown man cry. If you don't like TLOU, you're sorely missing out.. Amazing game great story!very engaging and will leave you wanting to come back for more.. The best plot ever. except left behind.. After ten years, the game has not become outdated and plays very cheerfully. The game has a great story, environments and gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. pallet and ladder moving simulator... hated it, wouldn't play it again if you paid me.. I still remember the hype over this game. Finished it in a couple of days. One of the best story driven games in history.. The GOAT game.. Based on my 10-Point System, I have concluded that the game deserves a rating of 9/10. Graphics - The Last Of Us really is something special in the world that it created. Graphically it's very impressive. An extreme amount of detail was put into this game. 2 Points. Sound/Music - This game really knows how to draw out emotion through sound and music alone. From the opening sounds to the really softly played guitar strings, this game nails sound. Hearing a clicker might forever be one of the most terrifying sounds you can hear in a dark room. 2 Points. Level/Map Design - Perfect! This game both entices you to stay and makes you want to get out as fast as possible. I loved getting to see all the overgrown areas and getting a feel for what seems like the most real post apocalyptic world you could live in. 2 Points. Performance - A little bumpy at times. This might be the worst part of this game. It doesn't always feel super smooth. There are several options for how you can play this game and that's the best part about how it plays. I liked that I could go in guns blazing or I could move through the entire environment without making a single sound or claiming a single life. 1 Point. Enjoyment - This game asks a lot of the player. It asks you to take an emotional journey and really care about the characters you play. At times it can be hard to watch and get through as it tackles some very sensitive subjects. Front beginning to end I was into this world. I lived with these characters. I wanted the misery to end, but loved getting to know every part of this world. 2 Points.. Best game of all world. Best game of the generation by a considerable amount. Thank you Naughty Dog for this game.. Super immersive with an amazing story. You feel so much for the characters. Loved this game.. I love all kind of video games, but even with that love the are few games I can say are perfect. This game is a masterpiece and I can remember was one of the first Platinums I got on the ps3. I played so many hours and it was perfect. This video game arrives to demonstrate that video games can also tell stories on par with major cinematic productions. Its entire narrative, character development, and charisma of each character border on perfection, with a completely immersive world design filled with details that showcase the care put into the game. Regarding gameplay, it's quite enjoyable, though at times it feels a bit clunky and challenging to handle, but you eventually get used to it. Its soundtrack is truly outstanding; every piece of music is genuinely excellent and conveys the emotions the game's developer intended. In summary, it's a tremendous work of art in the form of a video game that every person with a PS4 should at least try.. gameplay 10/10 music 10/10 graphics 10/10 story 10/10 characters 10/10 master piece. The crudest story, and one of the games with the best exponents of 2013. The interaction with the characters is quite endearing, the gameplay forces you to be smart, but also too approachable. A must have game for the Playstation bookstore.. This is one of the best games I ever played.Thanks to the company that created it for all the emotions.. If there ever was a way for a system to go out with a bang, this is the game to do it. Incredible story and characters with an emotionally gripping narrative and mature themes are handled very well. The show is quite good as well.. Definitely one of the best story games of all time, just got it for my PS3 and it's great.. One of the best games I've ever played. Polished to maximum, it gets everything that PS3 has to offer, with emotional, deep story. It has only one flaw: you can play it for the first time only once.. Pure masterpiece of gaming. Will be my favorite for a long long Time. The game have an incredible story and you get attached to the characters very quickly.. Quite possibly one of the most overrated games of all time. Boring story, lackluster gameplay, a crafting mechanic stolen from Resident Evil, and a generic, forgettable ending.. This game is incredible and without a doubt it is the best game that addresses a zombie apocalypse, its narrative is incredible, its gameplay is great until the present day.. Gameplay 7/10 Story 10/10 Performance 10/10 Characters 10/10 Music 10/10 Content 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is worth being a gamer to play games like this. The best world created in video games you want to come back to over and over. 10/10. All I can say is that this is easily top 10 of one of the best games I have ever played!! This is also my favorite PS3 game and I am thankful to Neil Druckman and Naughty Dog for creating another Masterpiece! I also wanna thank Ashley Johnson (Ellie) and Troy Baker (Joel) for playing their characters fantastic and incredible!!. Great game with amazing graphics, story, and voice acting. The controls are sluggish and the framerate inconsistent, which does result in some frustrating aiming mechanics (especially when enemies get close), but I will forgive those issues as everything else is perfect and it is really the PS3 holding back performance and not any issue with the game itself.. a MUST play. I played this when It first came out and still playing IT, The characters, The story, The music, The atomosphere, Everything In general Is prefection. Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 10/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 10/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: 9/10. A beautiful game with a beautiful story and characters in it. There is barely anything to criticize.. I love it! One of the best game all of time!! Reaction Joel and Ellie is the best how is changed in game from old bad guy and cursed teenager to reaction Father and daughter. One of the best video game stories ever. Amazing & responsive gameplay. Difficulty level was spot-on. Easily one of the best games of the 2010's.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. randomly picked up the last of us on a video game store in 2014 without knowing anything about it at all besides the critical acclaim, thinking oh maybe this might be okay. best decision of my life. first half story of the story was slow and boring, i almost even dropped this midway, then when it got to the winter section that's where it suddenly picks up. it got even more compelling as the seasons goes by. just when i thought it was amazing, that ending blew me away, yup this is a masterpiece, and never in my life i ever expected anything like it for a mere video game. i was totally wrong about my first impression of tlou. i just stood still while the ending credits rolled, i already miss joel and ellie, i have to replay the game again, and never in my whole gaming experience did i ever felt something like that. then, i played it a hundred more times again after the first time. literally the best video game ever. perfect plot, soundtrack, characters, dialogue, gameplay, voice acting. everything is just perfect. i wouldn't change anything about it.. This game has aged like a fine wine. Every time I play it, it moves farther up my ratings. The zombie game has been over done forever, but no game does it as well as The Last of Us. It is hard to even call it just a zombie game. The remarkable","the last of us probably has one of the best action/horror game ever. it has one of the best stories in a game. and also has some of the best characters ever in a video game. to be honest, it gets boring real quick so that's why it's a 7/10."
440.Streets of Rage 2,"A classic is always magical. It's refreshing to enjoy a masterpiece like this when you're weary of AAA games.. One of the greatest Genesis games of all time and it's on the 3DS. Still playable to this day. Incredibly fun game, with one of the best soundtracks ever! Highly recommended. streets of rage is the best 2 player beat em up game the fighting sfx were solid and so is this game, anytime you hit an opponent the impact is felt through the sfx the music is among the best beats and sounds from the 16 bit era and for good reason Yuzo Koshiro is one of the best music composers of the 90s and he still churns out awesome sounds to this day overall a solid game even now.. Masterpiece, definitive version by far. The new features for example like 4 lives games (one for each character) is pretty cool, in a death match knockout sort of way. Mapping the buttons is helpful, but makes it easier especially to throw weapons for example. Making all weapons effect as both melee and projectile quickly and decisively, The one hit one kill mode is also interesting if a little pointless. Nice now to see you can select a level too. Shame there are no leader-boards like the xbox360 version and the graphics is exactly the same visually when not using 3D, Overall I would say this is the definitive Streets of rage 2 package in all it's glory. I have no idea hope to play multi-player though! not got that far yet. definitely worth a ""stab"" as it were. Well worth under the £5 they are asking for it. I traded in a 2DS especially for this game, it is that important a rage reliever.. The Genesis is my retro console of choice, the 3DS is my handheld of choice, and Streets Of Rage 2 is my side scrolling beat-em-up of choice. M2's adaptations of Genesis games to the 3D classics series have been nothing short of spectacular. So it's a no-brainier that this game is a must-have for me. If you don't like retro games, this won't change your mind. If you're a SNES fan who never crawled out of the trenches of the 16 Bit Wars, you may not like anything Genesis/Megadrive related. But, if you're open to a Genesis classic, this just may be gaming heaven for you. The already sharp graphics shine in this translation, and the music is phenomenal. Unless you're just not gonna be open to it, I heartily recommend this timeless game.. I have been waiting for this one for quite some time. I knew this whas going to be great, as i played the Megadrive/Genesis version to deaht! So here we go: - Graphics: They lend themselves perfectly to this game. The bright color pallate, the great animation, and not to forget the depth due to the 3D effect being very good. The small screen makes for a razor sharp image. - Sound: This whas one of the first games that showed me the Megadrive/Genesis could do awesome serious music just as well as it could do happy music for platformers like Sonic. Lots of differend sounds and samples make for a great treat. - Gameplay: At first i had to get used to the smaller D pad, but before you know it youll be playing just as smooth as you did on the Megadrive/Genesis. With all the dificulty settings, everyone can have a good time, from novice to pro players. - Extras: I love the extras, especially the mode where you have to swap fighters, so in the long run, you get to be good with all of them. Still i have my favorite fighter, but i have gotten a lot better with the rest also. Some other good points are you are now able to save everywhere within the game, so you can pick it up as soon as you have the time. Also when i start playing, i can't put the game down quickly, so i end up playing a hour or so! Playing coop with friends is a blast! For such a small price, and such a great perfect port with extra bells and whistles on, you will have the fighting time of your life. Don't pass this by!","streets of rage 2 is one of the greatest Genesis games of all time and it's on the 3DS . the music is among the best beats and sounds from the 16 bit era . if you don't like retro games, this won't change your mind ."
441.Out of the Park Baseball 15,"Best Baseball Simulation game on the market right now. If you are looking for a baseball simulator that is deep and flexible OOTP 15 is the game to get. If you want replay history you can. If you want to play along with the current MLB setup you can. If you want to set up a league using teams from your area you can. Almost anything you can think of creating in regards to baseball you can and then watch the rich history of what you have made grow the more you play. As a fan of baseball...this game never gets old for me. Great game, Im a Football Manager 2009-2014 junke and this game has competed quite nicely for my gaming time. My gaming day dreams have definitely drifted towards OOTP. If your into baseball, into sports management or sports simulations, this will nicely surprise you and generally available at reasonable pricing. I wont give the game a ten because their are bugs and its definitely not perfect but as far as sport simulations Ill add it into the evolutionary chain and say its a great addition.. I have played every version since v1. OOTP 15 is another solid home run. My only complaint is the 3D Stadium Model is very much a first attempt and is not on par with the rest of the game. Having said that and based upon prior experience with the franchise I do like the concept and I think eventually (probably around 16 or 17) it should be very good.. The ultimate baseball management sim. Incredible depth and options for the baseball stat geek. If you love the numbers and intricacies of the game of baseball this is for you. If you love pouring over box scores and stat lines this is for you. Play it solo or, for what I feel is the real challenge, join one (or more) of the many free online leagues and compete against 20 or more other baseball aficionados. If you want a baseball video game like The Show or want to be the next Babe Ruth, both at bat and on the mound, this isn't the game for you. This isn't for you to swing the bat or throw the pitch, this game is for the person who thinks he can be a major league manager or general manager. Evaluate players, build your organization, set the strategy, make draft picks and trades to try to build your dynasty, cut the veteran when he his bat is more detrimental than his experience is a plus or promote that hot rookie straight from AA ball to the big leagues. Again, this is a management sim and one of the best of it's kind regardless of the sport. Is it perfect? No but it is as close as any game can be. The support from OOTPD is superb. They listen to their customers including adding features suggested in their forums. They will work with you on any issues you have and with any game this complex there may be some issues. When there is an issue found they work with you to get it fixed and issues patches when they are needed. This is the total package: Great responsive support and the ultimate Baseball Management Game. I have been playing it since OOTP9 and every year it just gets better. If management simulation is what you are looking for then you have found it. If you love Football Manager and either love baseball or want to learn about the game then OOTP15 is the next natural step for you.. This is an excellent baseball management sim game. If you're not familiar, you control all of the GM and Manager duties, and have the capability to manage the games real time if you're so inclined. You don't actually hit or pitch the ball, but if you're the type to pick up a console sports game and sim the games while acting as the GM you absolutely need to buy this game now.. If you are looking for a management sim where the sky is the limit, look no further than Out of the Park Baseball 15. Year after year, OOTP Developments puts out a premier product. The scope of this game is amazing. You can manage teams from the Major Leagues through the minor leagues to international ball. I have had a blast playing this game. Highly recommended.. Amazing game. The possibilities are endless with the ability to create your own league from scratch. Any true baseball fan will appreciate the in-depth features of this game. The staff on the OOTP team are very active in their forums and also listen to their gaming community. This game is a must have for anyone who enjoys managing a ball club.. OOTP Baseball is great because there is just so much you can do. You can create your own fictional league and follow along. You can replay the history of the MLB. You can create a league in your home state. You can add yourself to the draft pool and follow your career. The list goes on and on. Online leagues enhance the fun by allowing players to write articles. On the OOTP forums you can find the perfect league for you. If you are a baseball fan in any way the OOTP Baseball is for you.. I've purchased OOTP several times, and always loved it. Yes, it can be like playing a spreadsheet, but there are times that's exactly what I want to do. (My 9 back to back championships in the European Baseball League with the Paris Blues attest to that fact.) OOTP 15 gets a lot of points for its baseball simulation, which is excellent. It immediately loses them because it crashes all the time! Literally more than any game I have ever seen, including ArmA 2 (which was a disaster at launch). Normally, my procedure is to start a fictional league and simulate a hundred years or so of history to give the league some ""meat"" (hall of fame players, records to break, historical dynasties, and so on). Typically, that takes a few hours. OOTP 15 seems to crash at least every three or four seasons, meaning that before I finally gave up it had taken me hours of running the thing to get from 1900 to 1930. I hate to say it, but until it's fixed, the game simply isn't worth its price.. I have been playing OOTP since version 3 and this game just gets better and better each year. If you are a baseball nut then this game is for you. The depth and customization are completely unmatched by any other game on the market today. I usually find myself getting tired of playing sports games after a while, but with OOTP I keep playing right up to the release of the next version. So if you are looking for a baseball simulator, this is the game for you!. Out of the Park Baseball is the best baseball game I have ever played. It's not an arcade title, but rather it puts you in the driver's seat of your favorite baseball franchise. Trade players, draft the next superstars, scout foreign countries, call all the shots from dugout, watch how your players develop in the minor leagues and play into the infinite future. The game comes with real players & teams (full MLB 2014 Opening Day rosters plus complete minor leagues, and also 7 international leagues with real players / teams) and also every season in MLB history (1871-2013) which you can replay or start your alternate history with. On top of that, you can create fictional leagues or combine any type of league in your own baseball universe. The possibilities are endless!. Best computer sim sports game out there. The depth of the game is absolutely amazing, and you can customize literally everything. A must-purchase for baseball fans.. You could not find a better sports simulation game for baseball, anywhere. This game gives you so much for the small amount that you pay. Can be difficult for new players because there is so many options but the forum they have is amazing for help and ideas. One of the best games I have ever purchased.. If you are looking for a baseball simulator that is deep and flexible OOTP 15 is the game to get. If you want replay history you can. If you want to play along with the current MLB setup you can. If you want to set up a league using teams from your area you can. Almost anything you can think of creating in regards to baseball you can and then watch the rich history of what you have made grow the more you play. As a fan of baseball...this game never gets old for me.. OOTP keeps getting better year on year. The only reason I didn't give it 9 is because the 3D graphics system is till very much a work in progress, but that will apparently improve next year, and maybe before through a patch. The sheer depth of customisation options is what makes this game for me, and I find myself getting annoyed with other sports games - both text sims and otherwise - that don't match it.","OOTP 15 is the best baseball simulation game on the market right now . if you love the numbers and intricacies of the game of baseball this is for you . if you want to be the next Babe Ruth, both at bat and on the mound this isn't for you ."
443.Fire Emblem: Three Houses,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses, where do I begin, this game has awesome characters, awesome design, and an awesome appearance of Anna, the only thing I dislike about the game is that weapons rust instead of being destroyed completely when they lose all their durability, but otherwise it’s fine.. Pretty good game, however beign a game made for Nintendo, took a toil.. I took 39 hours to finish the Edelgard route, and I am not even interested on the other routes, at least not while this game is still on Switch. The Ending was lackluster, no answers at all, whole story was somewhat lacking, even the romance is weird at end the MC just *here take this ring like a piece of bread* and this is it, not even a hug or brush.. I loved the strategy and game setting, however the schedule was quite annoying, liked the characters, but this game needed more time.. shame on Nintendo.. I really liked the social aspects of the game. Dialogues between characters were sometimes naive and childish, but I liked the story regardless. I wish the romance was more fleshed out. What is definitely the flaw of this game is that it’s built to be replayed (4 routes), but not much changes on replay. We got different perspective and a lot of small info but battle locations were the same (I played lions and deers). Combat was great. The design was really good, it felt like medieval fantasy (design felt realistic in most part). In the end I had a great time and I wish new fire emblem games will contain mature story with toned down design and rewarding combat, just like three houses.. SO much content that it would be normal to think this is 3 games in one Pros: -In the beginning you will join one out of 3 houses each has different plot and cast of characters so yes you could treat this as a 3 game in 1 deal its so good -Gameplay is a chesslike tactical turn based game where each unit has a specific move patterns and such, easy to learn hard to master i personally love it -look at the first pro and how about if i tell you EVERY SINGLE character is unique and has distinct personalities most you could romance as well if you like -for me the story is unpredictable and really good -i play on english dub and the voice acting delivers Cons: -gameplay cycle can be a bit repetitive towards the end -my waifu became a racist near the end?? could become a plus if you're into that im just bewildered at it. One of my personal favorites alongside with Awakening. These game brings so much to the table, raising exponentially the quality of the franchise. Spent a hundred hours or so to see each path the story had, and all of them were outstanding. I highly encourage people to give it a try, one of the best switch game hands down.. Interesting story, gameplay that does not distort what has been seen in the series, well-characterized characters and excellent replayability, highly recommended.. Persona mechanics and similarities aside, Fire Emblem: Three Houses more than stands on its own as a fantastic entry in the series. I particularly enjoyed how customizable your units are, making combat super dynamic and interesting. The tactical aspect of the game makes difficulty level a nice sweet spot for me, not really having to worry about grinding. The option to make the game harder with the ""classic"" mode is appreciated, but it is something that I will probably never touch since I seriously struggled to complete the older titles. I am actually rather lukewarm on the social aspect of this game, which surprised me since that was the aspect that I found most intriguing about Persona's mechanics, but it just never really connected with me. I didn't necessarily hate it, but while I liked the characters enough, a lot of the tasks and conversations just ended up not really being too interesting to me. But I think the game's storyline is alright, being able to experience events from three different perspectives. I still think Golden Deer is the best one to be honest. Finally, the game has a great soundtrack, but it's honestly pretty ugly at times, mostly the backgrounds and set pieces, but I find that it never distracts from the game, it just doesn't really put forth the most flattering image.. Yeah! This game rocks. I enjoy the tactical combat in this one, it's such a welcome change from the typical JRPG romp. Not only that, the social sim makes sense and isn't completely stupid so plus points for that. I wish they went further, though. More characters. More interesting interactions. More odd, first-person dinners with side characters. If they lean more into this social sim, it could turn from good to great :). didnt think I would like it as much as I did, different enough from the rest of the series that I wanted more. This was my first fire emblem game, everything about it was excellent. The gameplay was phenomenal, the story was amazing, the graphics were great. I have no complaints, it got me hooked on Fire emblem and I have since played most of them. My only complaint is about how the future titles such as engage weren't even close to being as good as this one.. After playing for over 100 hours and finishing only the WV route, here are my thoughts after playing for so long. I enjoy Three Houses, the option to customize units to any is a good idea and I like the exploration and enjoy the gameplay as it has some good ideas. However there are also some big issues that I don't like on the game. First is The grey and grey morailty. I really don't like it. The grey and grey morailty is the biggest problem for me as because 2 of the main lords can get dirty and ruthless, it can get too bleak to the point that there is no one to root for. And I just don't like nor enjoy its story as it's just too dark. I do not like grey and grey morailty and it's not for me. The support system is another thing with me, some of the supports like the C ones is very badly written to the point that I wish some of the characters were more friendlier because they left a very bad impression. I really do not like the calendar system, because you have to start over upon finishing the game and I don't like that at all. Overall while I enjoyed Three Houses, the grey and grey morailty, along with other issues, I just find it to be a good game.. I have played through this game nine times; it is the most played game in my entire library. I have to hold myself back from playing it again because it's so addicting. I love the characters and relationships; every playthrough I find new dynamics to get excited about. I love the commentary and branching narratives, and Blue Lions never fails to make me cry. The tactical gameplay is fun and satisfying. I think it's a very good game overall.. i said that i think final fantasy 16 is bad (you might know it as reddit fantasy) and then this guy who is my ex-friend called larry starts getting mad at fire emblem for some reason! i don't even know this game before, but now i play it and see that it is actually turnBASED KINO! 9.95/10 (10/10 roundedup). A perfect game... Perfect story with choices... Perfect social interactions...good gameplay. Really good tactical RPG. As a fan of the previous Fire Emblem games, I think the added ""Persona-like"" stuff of upgrading you and your units' stats through social and time-management mechanics works great. The story isn't really the main driver, it's pretty typical for what FE games tend to be, and most characters are very one dimensional or have a 180 twist, but it's enjoyable if you aren't looking for actually smart political drama (this is definitely not FFT or Vagrant Story). And if you find RNG to be a major issue, you need to learn how these games are played. Playing around RNG is the main way this games challenge you, knowing when to take each action and how much of the enemy's attack will you be able to withstand. Also learning that losing units every now and then is fine.. Engage is the worst... at least it offers a great and deep story for us that makes sense. The design of characters is amazing.. Story - 8.5/10 ( Very good story with really well written characters, could've been better if they gave more time and attention to the 2nd half of the story ) Gameplay - 9.5/10 ( Persona like relationship building with characters and how it impacts combat is really awesome , and the hogwarts like school setup and school activities are really fun ) Combat - 9.5/10 ( Combat is really addictive , this is my first trpg and it got me interested in playing more tactical rpgs , that says something ). My favorite in the series! Game is so much fun and smart, VERY memorable characters too!. Fire Emblem: Three Houses offers a deep and engaging story that unfolds from the unique perspectives of each of the different classes. The game is meticulously designed to be replayed multiple times, ensuring a fresh experience with each playthrough. Additionally, it features a cast of interesting and well-developed characters that enhance the overall narrative.. My first game in this series, thanks to which I fell in love with Fire Emblem. I completed it three times and this rarely happens. Each house in the game is unique, there are a huge number of characters, but at the same time they are not just dolls, each has their own character and personality and each takes part in the plot. Lots of beautiful female characters, lots of humor, but also some drama. Excellent combat tactical system. I hope that all subsequent games in the series will be similar to Three Houses.. Characters are deep, interesting and progressive. Simple yet quite adequate class system. Story and cinematics are beautiful and really liked the combat because it's challenging.. How can Final Fantasy Tactics continue to be the best strategy game 27 years later? Seriously, the history in this is just like a bad theatre play, the unavoidable chores are like being forced to play Tamagotchi between battles.. Don't give the Time Control Mechanic a use limit if you're going to make RNG this unfair to the player. Anyone who played this game and liked it played on easy mode and didn't notice how bad the RNG is.. Fun combat, not the greatest. Social aspects are fun at first but burn out on it 2/3rds in. Story weak. And my gameplay was ruined by selecting normal and halfway through it becoming way too easy and game doesn't allow you to change difficulty.. It's a good game, but not good enough to give it a 9 or 10. The game has some annoying issues that were less present in previous Fire Emblem games, such as the design of the battle maps and the unbalanced difficulty level. Additionally, the side activities in the game are very boring, especially the side quests, whether it's in their execution or their stories. Overall, the side activities are repetitive throughout the game and are not interesting or motivating enough to complete. On the other hand, the story and characters were not up to par in the first half of the game, but there was a significant improvement in the second half. The truth is, the story and characters in the game are its biggest positives. While the combat is enjoyable, it lacks challenge, and the design of the battle maps does not encourage strategic thinking and planning.. I had no idea fire emblem was THIS GOOD. a compelling very strong three route story with solid gameplay, great conflict and story, great characters, classes, style and execution. Its sytems lead to a very satisfying loop that keeps you hooked at least one house in and more beyond. It sucessfully makes multiple battes and units feel impactful and causes tons of varied conversation of main antagonist and plot, leaving an impact. Whole im sure older games with weapon triangle have more to battle systems, this game stands out for its character social link like systems making every character feel important and involved and this doubles when they do well in combat rewarding the players efforts really well. My only issue would be the drag on part 1 on repeat playthroughs. The music is amazing just amazing. Wow. This game is SO good!. Really enjoyed this one, the character evolution is very compelling and the battle system is very fun. The replay ability is pretty wild, I spent about 50 hours on the first track and was ready to go into a new replay pretty much instantly. My only gripes are that the monastery sections get a little repetitive as the game goes on and that the battles can sometimes be a little too predictable.. Amazing game that has incredible replay value. The monastery system has a steep learning curve but is incredible fun and rewarding once you figure it out. Game is an appropriate challenge on Maddening, very difficult and requires some planning, but not unfair. I deduct one point because the game occasionally rewards grinding, such as fishing providing prof exp. Also not a big fan of tea parties rewarding you with charm, since they become important later on and are incredibly random and boring.. This games gets a 10 not because of the first playthrough but because of the 4 different playthroughs that all feel like different games. It was a great twist. The game added many things to keep all of the playthroughs fresh as well.. Highly overrated game that introduced some of the worst persona like systems to fire emblem when the systems introduced from Geneology of the holy war were muchhhhh better!. It's a perfect FE game. The devs use the formula and pretty much perfected it.. The relationship and character building that this game presents brings it beyond the typical turn based strategy for me personally. As someone who isn't typically interested in this genre, it has broke the mold and (for me) presented itself as a perfect game worthy of multiple playthroughs. The possibilities are endless.. Nice game, i like **** Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup.. Easily one of the top Contenders for game of the year for me! I have already beaten this game twice, and I love how character interactions play more of a role when it comes to down time. Add that on top of an easy to understand class and weapon system finally takes a lot of guess/ hard work that has held back the Fire Emblem series all this time! This is the only Fire Emblem game I actually recommend to anyone interested in the series.Also Edelgard did nothing wrong.. I have only played the Golden Deer route and I plan on updating my review once I play all the other campaigns, but good god this game is really good, the sim aspects got old when part 2 started because I already got whoever I wanted and had max support with everyone, so I'd just rush to the cafeteria to get my units to be motivated and the greenhouse so I could get my permanent stat up's. The story was pretty neat? I'd give the story an 8, didn't really like how some characters just die off-screen, the gameplay is not as satisfying as Awakening or Fates but it's still very enjoyable due to the fact that everyone can just use whatever I want them to. Oh and when you had to choose to go to battle, it was only worth it when it was a paralogue because it had story and the maps were fairly different, the ones with ""rare monsters"" who just give you a rusted weapon and it turns out it's a silver weapon and the other normal ones were honestly a waste of time in part 2.. It's a perfect FE game. The devs use the formula perfected in FE Fates and elevate it to a new level. The story is so deep and interesting. Character design makes you want to romance everyone. The battles feel epic, and you can feel the mood changes after each arc. The only downside is the difficulty levels of each route are not the same. Still, it is a perfect game.. Great game - provides the typical Fire Emblem tactical challenge, but mixes in some new systems. Some of these are more welcome than others; the main thing to understand is that you will have significantly more downtime in the game in comparison to other Fire Emblem games. One of my biggest complaints is the lack of diversity for the highest levels of character classes - seemingly all of them are horse-riding, lance-wielding tanks or spell-casters. Not a lot of options for swords-wielders, axe-wielders, pegasus knights, or archers, etc.. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the best in terms of character design and world-building. However, The gameplay has a lot of things to offer and plummet the challenge in tactical games. The best feature I love in this game is roster building, where all your main rosters will be immediately available from early chapters and you can recruit another one optionally. This feature gives you the freedom to build your skills to your favorite characters as much as you plan in the early game. However, I found out that they give too many utility skills, and gambits in this game, especially the foresight line that lets you know how enemies will attack you are really breaking the game, combined with how AI is dumb. All of this makes the game too easy. Speaking of value this game is really great, you can play up to 200 hours with 3-4 playthroughs to know everything in the game. However, I found out that after I cleared the first house, it was really hard to replay in the second house, especially the first part which is almost the same, so I have mixed feelings about over content of this game. Overall, I feel like this game is done well to balance between crew management and tactics game. However, I think it would be better if they nerfed some utilities in this game, and made the game more challenging. As well as make the first arc of the game more concise. I personally give this 7 due to how our crews are OP and how AIs are dumb in gameplay..However, It still can be a weak 8 due to how contents they give us.. The first time I played it, I liked it, but it is a nightmare to replay and it shows its rough edges really quickly. (version 1.0.0). I love tactical games, but in this one the most important will be building your team and being lucky in battle (crits + misses). I loved it at the beginning but then realised that I needed to spend more time to build my team or I would have to rely on luck, this is not what I expect when I'm playing a tactical game. Good strategy gameplay. Amazing music. Interesting characters. More than serviceable stories.. It doesn't excel in any area particularly, but Three Houses was an enjoyable tactical experience with a decent story and some interesting characters.. On the opposite side of the more recent Fire Emblem: Engage; Fire Emblem: Three Houses excels at storytelling, but absolutely falls apart at gameplay mechanics and graphics. The game is bogged down by tedious new mechanics, an unintuitive method of completing quests/paralogues, and a headache-inducing academy to traverse at the end of every battle. The graphics are painfully average, with horrible sharpness to character portraits and very ugly-looking battle animations. Credit where credit is due, however, the story is great, it does a great job at enthralling you into the world, and that is where this game does shine.. This was my 4th Fire Emblem game, and it removed any desire I had to replay any other entry in the series. It is a huge step forward for the franchise in basically every direction, and it removed any desire I had to replay other FE games. The story is compelling, and is easily the best writing in a Fire Emblem game. The cast of characters is top notch, with only a few duds. It also introduced the most controversial and talked-about lord in the entire series. So that must count for something. The gameplay added new mechanics like battalions and monster battles, and removed some things that I really did not enjoy (like the weapon triangle). The class and tutoring system is flexible and gives you a lot of choice in how you build characters. Speaking of which, New Game+, combined with this flexibility, gives the game a lot of replayability. Plus, there's multiple routes giving you ample reason to go back.. Literal masterpiece and there is no argument against it. While the story can get kinda boring (only in silver snow no, and azure moon) the gameplay is more then enough to keep me playing for hours on end.. Brilliant !!! I loved it. The best Fire Emblem game. Great story, great art, great characters, great world building, great gameplay though not quite as polished as some other titles on the latter front. The life sim stuff can drag on a bit too long if you've a completionist (Must talk to everyone) mindset.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ignoring politics, this game is very good. Great combat, great slice of life gameplay on the monastery and fantastic cast of characters. The story is good, tho it could be better.. 3 Houses is my first FE game, and fortunately I kinda like it. Despite its various shortcomings in terms of storytelling and gameplay, I had a lot of fun playing all 4 routes. Most characters are memorable and multi-dimensional (except you-know-who) even though they are still cliché.. Very solid gameplay and interesting well written characters, Fódlan is one of the most fleshed out worlds in Fire Emblem, the overall atmosphere is just great. Replay value is also very high, but not all the routs got the same amount of attention (altough that never really bothered me.). Another 10/10 game in the fire emblem franchise. The different branches are mostly done very well. 2 of them are weaker but still done well. Characters are great and a good chunk of them are memorable. The art design is great but visuals are rough. Especially after the visual spectacle done in FE Engage. Gameplay is great but I do wish maps were bigger overall. The persona like week by week schedule compliments the game well but can be repetitive after multiple playthroughs. Music is top notch as well. For the first HD Fire Emblem game it was done amazing for an already prestigious franchise. Also, BLUE LIONS GANG. Fire Emblem Three Houses was everything I wanted in a game that I didn't know I did before I actually played it. It's the game I've put more hours in on Nintendo Switch and the one where every playthrough offered something fresh and my knowledge about the game was steadily improved. It also helped to steer away from internet guides and opinions about the characters and their intentions, as well as interpretations of the overall story. Almost every question will be answered by playing and exploring the game from all perspectives, and thinking over newly acquired knowledge. It was a personal journey to me, where I had my favorites, my least favorites, the ones I straight up disliked and a very small but meaningful pool of romantic interests. The characters/lore were extremely well written and thought out to accommodate broader notions than good/bad. The combat, well, it's Fire Emblem, so we are always in for one of the most fun and engaging battle systems in all of strategy rpgs. I'm a big fan of the series and even thought the game doesn't focus more on the combat side of things it never felt lacking in content. There's many battles to fight, places to go and people to see. Honestly, the biggest challenge about this game is letting it go, picking another game and moving on.. this game is a very good game but i have one question: why does rhea angry, is she stupid?. Fire Emblem Three Houses will forever hold a very special place in my heart. Fire Emblem is one of, if not my favorite series of all time, and Three Houses is my favorite of all of them, There's nothing to say about it that hasn't already been said.. There are very few games that I can return to and enjoy one more playthrough. This game is one of them. Great world-building, memorable characters, engaging combat system, phenomenal music. Shame that they dropped the ball with Engage after this masterpiece.. Worst Fire emblem experience ever and I’ve played revelations and **** romhacks 70% of the game is social sim filler, avoid at all cost unless you’re into that The gameplay is awful by FE standards, and for a strategy game the mechanics don’t add up to each other and most combat arts/gambits are irrelevant outside of them few busted ones. Forget about any difficulty higher than normal since hard is only hard in the 1/5 of the game and maddening is some random unfair **** because the dev are simply incapable. And all that isn’t mentionning bad map design and absolutely terrible balance People keep mentioning a good story but that’s just not true only 2/4 routes have good story and one of the good ones is a secret route which is unfinished and unpolished,The only good story you will probably get is White Clouds in the first half of the game before the route split afterwards the story is mediocre on paper but bad when you consider that gameplay/story dissonance is very high, it’s like the gameplay is trying to contradict the story at every possible occasion(ex: crest as a whole) I’ve seen many claim that characters are at their best in the series but that’s just wrong many are insufferable and the practically all boil down to « I HAVE TRAUMA » also unlike any other FE you CANNOT just pick your favorites and have fun, you are stuck with who you got whether you like them or not. And sure you can recruit students but it’s too long, at the cost of training your main character and they join without any class mastery if not with terrible base stats for some adults Im giving it a two and not a 0 because white clouds is still a great story even if I am absolutely disappointed every time I want to absolutely continue the story only to end up in the awfully long, boring and repetitive social sim part Unit building is fun even it’s ultimately worthless to try to optimise your team since the difficulty will never hold up and the game is keen on never putting the player at any disadvantage (exactly how to NOT design a strategy game) Three houses is an SRPG in a series of TRPG I’ll reiterate my warning: avoid at all cost unless you’re into social sim and if you usually play FE for the gameplay. The game is full of memorable characters, each with their own unique personalities and stories. Players will grow attached to their students and be invested in their success. The gameplay is addictive and challenging, with a variety of maps and enemies to keep players on their toes. The game also features a deep customization system, allowing players to create their own unique units.. The best strategy RPG game and this is the game was creat this type of game. Fire Emblem Three Houses is an absolutely amazing game. I've played all 4 routes at least twice and sunk 800 hours into it. A huge majority of characters have a compelling depth to them and the story is very enjoyabe! You can choose between one of four routes in each playthrough and thanks to that, the game has a lot of replayability. Since all characters, to some extent, are ""unrelable narrators"" in their respective routes, it is on the player to uncover the truth of the story by playing all four of them. There's so much to discover and so much to discuss about. Highly recommend this game!. My favorite Nintendo Switch game. As a lover of the genre and the saga, it seems to me a sublime game. The story is explained from three points of view and you choose which house to live it with. Very good script twists and decisions to make that influence the course of this. Being a teacher and making your perfect team is very entertaining. Between battle and battle it is appreciated to be able to spend some time with your students and manage them at will. As a negative aspect, the map design is not one of the best in the series.. Actual score: 6.5/10. Wow, what a lovely game coupled with a horse **** excuse for a final boss. Fire Emblem Three Houses is a wonderful game to play, Wii style 2007 graphics aside, to be fair, as is expected with most Switch games, this game was a blast. This game is everything we loved about the 3DS Fire Emblem Games, while not as good as them in my opinion, Intelligent Systems tried their best to modernize Fire Emblem. They tried to up the graphics, but they failed miserably, the open world aspect of the school and army fighting alongside the characters was a nice use of more powerful hardware. I chose Black Eagles, and up till a very specific point in the play through was splendid, however, unbeknownst to me, there was a very specific thing you had to do to get the Crimson Flower path, if you didn't know on your first play through like me, you were stuck with Silver Snow. While Silver Snow was fun, the final boss was absolute freaking horse **** Holy **** was that final boss was bad, they throw you against multiple different White Beasts which you have to beat to get to Rhea. This as a miserable, monotonous time and was a constant fight to keep playing, I got my ass handed to me on a silver platter the first time I fought them. I had to spend a couple hours grinding up with battles and building my team up to the task, this meanwhile I had no issues with previous missions. This was the most pathetic piss poor design of a final battle, having the final boss be leagues harder than previous missions, forcing you to grind up. After beating the final boss, the whole vibe was ruined for me, what felt like a strong, fun game became a chore to play because of this pathetic finale. Sleazy game design that forces you know what to do to get specific pathways are an abhorrent mess and should be abolished. Intelligent Systems, you failed to deliver, go back to the 3DS.. By far the most overrated Fire Emblem ever to be released, and one that tries so hard to give that ‘high school’ experience of Persona, but ultimately falls flat due to it’s uninspiring characters, lame dialogue, and the games insistence that a Fire Emblem game should have users spend 70% of their game playing a Persona knockoff. Worst is that if you are an old fire emblem fan, you will find the combat maps extremely uninspiring and uncreative. A lot of maps were flat with no restrictions and enemies were randomly scattered through the map. I got bored and stopped this game 3 times. I wanted to like this, but ultimately this game is just mediocre and i don’t like the direction that this series is going so this will most likely be my last fire emblem game for a while. Game mechanics were great, but really hated the hypocrisy for some of the characters that I wouldn't name for spoiler. I would give it 9.5 for golden deer, 8.5 for blue lion, but the other route was just terrible.. Very well presented story about perspective with developed lore and characters, highly recomend playing all routes. Fire Emblem Three Houses is an excellent video game , one of the best Nintendo Switch Exclusive Game and my favorite tactical role-playing video game i have ever played in my life. The characters with exceptional personality , the magnificent soundtrack and wonderful story of this game are the 3 best things about this game for me. It took me 27 hours to complete the game in my first play through.. Top tier turn based strategy game with a huge amount of interesting and engaging characters to get to know and train up. Highly replayable.. I was really looking forward to a strategy or tactics game, like an Advanced Wars. This was my first Fire Emblem title. I knew about the school aspects beforehand and though they did make me hesitate, I played the game anyway. The first few hours went well, when everything was new, but then... that just stopped. It all turned into tedious work, leveling up, speaking to charakters that weren't all that interesting, each with their own sequences for bonding, and side quest too boot. But all the battles felt the same, or I would have liked to try other things, but didn't want to put in the time to grind to finally get to play some different classes. TL;DR: Okay Combat, way too boring rest of the game.. Such an amazing game, both the story and characters are great! Especially how they develop throughout the story, you reall","the ending was lackluster, no answers at all, whole story was somewhat lacking, even the romance is weird at end the MC just *here take this ring like a piece of bread* and this is it, not even a hug or brush . combat was great. the design was really good, it felt like medieval fantasy (design felt realistic in most part)"
444.World in Conflict,"At the time when this game was relevant and online services were working, it was simply a masterpiece game where everyone could show their full level of play. Great maps. Graphic. Destructions. Variety of military branches. It was simply the best time that I will never forget Thank you Massive Entertainment <3 You are forever in my heart. The game is quite topical at the moment, apart from that, the game play is an example of what a more combat focused rts can be, this title is high quality and at a very low price, you should 100% check it out. Back when games were more simplistic and still challenging. This game offers what you look for in an action pack RTS without the huge learning curve. The story is what most imagine a story would be if they wrote one up themselves to be as realistic as possible. This game NEEDS a 2021 remaster or a V2.0. I am amazed at the user reviews being so low yet stating this is ""THE BEST GAME EVER"". We need some more backing for it to get out of these current gen titles. They trash. This is not.. Best RTT game ever. First strategy game that ever got me anxious about my in-game situation. Would recommend. i spent hundred of hours playing WIC. there really hasn't been a good substitute since, particularly in the voice channel integration arena. possibly the best co-operative game ever made. i miss it very much :(. Its a true masterpiece, still one of the funnyies multiplayer PC games. Love the teamplay part, love the action, the destruction ,the grafics, the story. Its a 10 of 10 until the universe collapse.. Score: 9.5/10 Story: World in Conflict takes place during cold war era but in alternate reality. Negotiations fail and World War 3 starts. NATO soldiers including Americans invade Soviet Union. While Americans are fighting Russians in Europe, Russian ships invade America disguised as Cargo ships. Due to surprise attack and lack of enough forces to defend borders, Russians successfully invade City of Seattle. You play as Lieutenant Parker, tasked by Captain Banon to help civilians escape and leave the city to regroup in early hours of the game. As time goes by you meet some very interesting characters with great personalities. Unlike most other war games, here characters aren't one dimensional. Instead they have their own good and bad sides. The game shows good and bad people on both sides ,and how both nations are lead by brave soldiers who are not willing to fight each other but they are forced to do so due to politics. Design: World in Conflict is an Action RTS. The Single Player Campaign can easily last over 10 hours and contains 14 missions. There are 6 extra missions in Complete Edition where you play as Russian. Both Russian and American missions are part of the same campaign and after every few American missions, you switch sides and see everything through the perspective of Russian army. Missions are beautifully crafted. There is always some sort of twist in every mission that makes it different than the last one. In some missions, you are only given control of a small group that is used for hit and run tactics. Objectives in the game are based on story of the game and everything works perfectly. Nothing feels tacked on or forced. Multiplayer supports 16 players and can be played via LAN or Internet. Three types of maps are featured: domination maps, where players must control command points to win the game, assault maps, where one team defends a series of command points which the other teams assaults, and tug of war maps, where teams must fight to capture a series of command points on the front line, whereupon the line shifts towards a new set of points closer to the losing team. It's basically NATO vs Soviet Union and everything is well balanced. Gameplay: There is no base building and instead of controlling the entire battlefield, you control small squad and play your part in the war while things go boom around you when other soldiers are fighting each other. You are given Command Points. These points act as resources. Different units cast different Command Points. After deploying units, there is a brief cool down period. When someone in your squad dies, his points are slowly added back to your inventory which means you can call that or another type of unit again once enough points are restored. This forces you to carefully plan your strategy before sending your troops to be killed. You move camera with WASD keys and order or select troops with Mouse. You can also assign them to different groups for quick selection (Ctrl + Number Key). World in Conflict offers a lot of freedom. You can order you rifle squad to enter a building and attack from there or you can order them sit inside a vehicle for faster travel before ordering them to leave the vehicle and engage in combat. You can call for Air Support as long as you have enough points to call them or you are not in the middle of cool down. To get more points for reinforcements and Air Support you'll have to complete different primary and secondary objectives that reward you with more points and in some cases, unlock new units and new kind of Air Support. Presentation: World in Conflict looks great till this day. The game has a lot of cutscenes and scripted moments, that are used to tell the story or explain objectives. Gameplay animations and cutscenes are done by motion capturing which makes everything feel more real. Acting in this game is really really good and almost everything is destructible. You can zoom in and see troops running around, shouting at each other while fighting enemies. Everything looks great even when you take a closer look. When tanks fire, the sound effects and smoke effects that you experience are top of the line. Vehicles have real physics as well. And when you are not engaged in the battle, you can even hear small conversations between soldiers. These small things really immerse you, and make you feel like you are part of an Action movie. Voice Acting in the game is top notch and narration is done by Hollywood Actor, Alec Baldwin. You can hear him telling the story while the game loads a new level in the background. Meanwhile, you look at series of different pictures that show location of current objectives. Just like everything else, soundtracks in the game are beautiful and memorable. Sound effects could use a bit more punch in some scenes but other than that everything in this game is beautifully crafted. Verdict: World in Conflict is a Masterpiece and one of the greatest games ever made.. Corny but once you start carpet bombing, you'll never look back......................................................................................... 10/10 Best RTS of all times: best graphics, best balances, best music tracks (separate spasibo for an Ola Strandh), best animations, variety units appearances, very good users maps, diversity maps. Unusual strategy - you dont build structures and fortifications at one spot - you move, attack and maneuver your enemies.. I myself am a fan of the real-time tactics genre and though Cold War is not really my favorite setting for a video game, I still have to say this game is great, fantastic even in many ways. It has one of the most innovative tactical aid systems I've ever seen in any video game featuring a real tactical aid systems. Visuals are really great, especially when using a kick-ass tactical aid like carpet bombing or better yet, a nuke! The tactics are well implemented, the ranges of weaponry are pretty realistic or in anyway, perfectly scaled to fit the map, and the map is freaking huge even for a genre that should include big-size maps like RTS or RTT. And the combat is off the hook! It's always intense and full of action at any given minute, heck, second. And this game also emphasizes the TEAMWORK, which is the first time I've ever experienced and it's well done. Also, this game has almost zero bug which is one of the many great things this title has to offer. The only downside I could find is that out of the campaign, there really is no skirmish section to enjoy the mechanics even more. Too bad there's no further project for the sequel which is really bad cause this game set a really shining example to all RTT and even RTS games out there. I'm gonna give a 9 to this excellent display of RTT, minus 1 point cause there's no SP skirmish mode but all in all, this is a must buy for RTT and even RTS fans out there. It's just excellent.. I have played and finished this game 3 times. It's an outstanding game, which deserves 11/10 . Some aspects of it could probably be done a little bit better, but overall it delivers an experience which no other game has managed to give me. Only MW 1 and MW 2 come close to it in terms of gaming experience, but they are a different gender altogether. If you are a PC gamer and appreciate great games, this game is a must in your collection.. I give it a 10/10 not because it's perfect, but because of the dedication made to this game. There are no bugs or glitches of any kind. It is a hidden gem. Anyone who is an RTS fan should buy this. Heck, EVERYONE should buy this, because you're really missing out if you don't. Sure there is no resource gathering, but don't think this makes the game any easier, the enemy doesn't need resources either, and you need tactics to defeat them. The story is really, really strong. Need I say more?. As a russian, i don't like games where russia attacks the US. Here, again, this happens, and there is no reason, no explanation except that russians are just generally bad. That said, the game itself starts idiotic. There is plenty of cutscenes, the controls are constantly taken from you. It's not like a strategy game anymore but like some dumbed down RPG or something. Surely, the animations are great, the graphics are amazing, there are special effects and it's generally visible that the project was done on a high budget. But this doesn't make a good game. It's a dumb RTS catered for some idiots how adore hollywood blockbusters.. I love war games, I love explosions and I love RTS games, so this was a game I was highly interested in. While it did not really meet my lofty expectations, I thought it was good enough for a playthrough. The graphics are excellent, with amazing model detailing. Great battles abound! The gameplay is more fun than some people say it is. Yes, all you do is call in your units and they appear after a short period and then boom you can deploy them. Yes, you'll often call on the same units after playing this for a while. No more base building. No more resource gathering. Just pure combat essentially not too much strategy involved since everything is given straight to you and the only real strategic element is in choosing how you use up your unit quota based on which units you deploy. Obviously, this semi-RTS isn't for everyone, but I thought it was worth it to play it. Why is this not a 9? I wish that it was bigger; would have been a lot more fun with more units/increased unit cap and even bigger environments. Story and characters could have been much better, cinematics graphics did not match the level of detail during gameplay (which I found weird), and the. Excellent game. It lacks some of the strategic depth of some other games in the RTS genre, but I have a feeling that really isn't what they were going for. I found it unique and refreshing that instead of being placed in control of all forces on the map, you were a subordinate to a commander and had to work in tandem with your team-mates. The single player campaign is well told and beautifully realized, though I have yet to test out multiplayer.. If you are into strategy games, you have to try this game. Excellent Story, Graphics, Gameplay and Presentation. There is an overall polish to this game compared to the recent strategy games out there. Highly recommended to try it out.. Excellent single player RTS experience. Since I like strategy games for the single player experience, I've lost interest in games like Warcraft 3 that require you to be able to press 10 buttons per second. This game feels more like a strategy game, and less like a frantic button-pressing competition. The story's amazing, really, and really draws you in (with the expansion, it gets even better, as you see the conflict from both sides). The battles are truly gorgeous, and the gameplay is simply awesome. Since this game's a bit old, it can be bought real cheap, and its worth it. A 9, since it is indeed a bit short. As for multiplayer, who cares?. This is how a strategy game is supposed to be like. A story that makes you feel like immersed like you're in the middle **** movie as well as a fun and addictive game. Bear in mind though that this review is written by someone that had Soviet Assault as well installed. It seems that the expansion adds alot of dimension to the story as well as fixes some minor but annoying things. Get this game if you enjoy strategy games.. Too bad the servers aren't as busy any more......................................................................................................................... The best competitive tactical RTS on the market , only game that can compare with it in terms of pro gaming support is Starcraft 2. Great game, great support from developers (Massive) ,but still nobody bought WiC.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While not perfect World in Conflict has a gripping single player experience that while a tad unbelievable is highly entertaining and a fantastically challenging multiplayer mode that puts your ability to think fast to the test. People who claim this game does not require thought or strategy are totally in a state of tunnel vision about what an RTS is. World in conflict is a real time strategy game who ever says otherwise is an idiot, RTS games don't need base building or resource mining and what not, that's just added. At its heart and RTS is a game that requires the ability to manage multiple units effectively the person who's is the best at that wins (as compared to a shooter where you manage yourself), resources add a different level but don't change the base concept. This game requires immense skill and teamwork when played multiplayer and the learning curve is a bit steep but anyone who wants to play a game that requires a brain as well and dexterity should try it out since if you don't like multiplayer the single player and skirmish mode (which exists I don't know what people are talking about) are well worth the money.",world in conflict takes place during cold war era but in alternate reality . the story is what most imagine a story would be if they wrote one up themselves . the story is what most imagine a story would be if they wrote one up themselves .
445.NieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition,"Probably the best story in a video game ever. There is so much content and characters to explore.. So I had heard for years about the fascinating series that is the DrakeNier series and how insane Yoko Taro is. And when Nier Automata came out, I heard nothing but great things about the game, and after seeing 2B, I can tell you I was hooked on checking out the game. However, I never had a PS4 so I went years unable to play it. Thankfully, unbeknownst to me, the game got a Switch port a few years ago and when I discovered that, I immediately bought the game. I even did my homework, watching playthroughs of Drakengard 1, 3, and Nier (I know I would've hated playing those games myself) so I could better appreciate Nier Automata's but also get acquainted with the insane lore of the Yoko Taro-verse, which I found to be endlessly fascinating. I even indulged in the Nier-related side content like reading the novellas, listening to the audio dramas, and watching a stage play, that's how deep I got in there. Needless to say, once I finally started to play Nier Automata, I instantly fell in love with the game, being a huge Platinum Games fan, the game was just so damn fun to play. I was enthralled by the super depressing story and learning about the events of post-Nier, which the game had a ton of great callbacks to, making my investment in familiarizing myself with Nier specifically all worth it. One of my favorite characters from Nier returns just to show how even more painfully tragic his life has gotten, making me feel so bad for them. It's great! Do I even need to mention how this has some of the best music in all of gaming, which isn't surprising since Nier did as well, but they really went out to make some immaculate music that is art at its finest. I spent over 50 hours doing tons of side content and upgrading my weapons before finally reaching Ending E, and I won't spoil anything, but that was such an amazing moment that signified Nier Automata as one the best games ever made. I would say this is a perfect game with good graphics, tragic characters, a gripping narrative, immaculate music, and incredibly enjoyable action gameplay. However, my only gripes are the aerial battles going on for too long and becoming boring at times, and a few hacking puzzles being infuriating at times. But I would say those are minor nitpicks when looking at the game as an overall package, and like I said before, this is one the greatest games I have ever played. I applaud Yoko Taro and Platinum Games for delivering a masterpiece like this.. This game doesn’t deserve the universal praise that it gets. The combat is incredibly bland snd the characters are about as interesting as an anime OC.. NieR: Automata is the rare gaming experience in which narrative, aesthetics, and gameplay all complement each other to form a perfect storm of master class game design. A truly exemplary example of what video games are capable of as an art form, and a new personal favorite.. Interesting ideas, cool visuals, beautiful music... Would make a good comic or anime series. But as the game... Its bad. RPG elements are not meaningful, no character progress, mostly just stupid button mashing with very bad camera, counter-intuitive level design, and worst map that I ever experienced in a video game. Simply overhyped. Very few games have managed to bring the philosophical depth of the story of Nier: Automata. The way the story is built and the weight of the narrative that changes throughout the journey provide a unique plot experience where, while the game delivers the raw material in terms of information to reflect and draw conclusions, nothing is overly obvious. As downsides, I can say that the gameplay is enjoyable but sometimes quite repetitive, and the level design leaves much to be desired with sparsely detailed maps and a structure where you constantly find yourself lost, not knowing where to go or what to do. Nonetheless, these details improve throughout the game and can be overshadowed by the magnitude of the story being told.. This is indeed a once in a lifetime experience and can have a huge impact in your life. Please, play this game, fellow gamer!. Once in a lifetime gaming experience. Every human being must taste this masterpiece.. I mean its not perfect. The combat is okay, the story basically starts after 15 hours but is ok, the open world is **** is a good game but it is overrated.. The story is quite interesting. The ending unexpected (an experience you may not get in another game). Combat system, thanks to its variety of customization, is dynamic and fast and super engaging but feels a little bit repetitive at times (despite the large variety of customization with the pods ability and androids skills). Boss battles are all fantastic, and sometimes in a surprising way. Music is unforgettable. As for the playthrough, 9S route adds really nothing special after 2B route, is redundant yet you have to play it entirely to unlock the final route. Furthermore, 9S gimmick (the hacking) is not very exciting to use after a while because it's simplistic and generic, I believe it needs more depth to make it interesting enough. However, A2 route was simply fantastic and makes you want to replay it. Finally, a few areas are very annoying to explore (such as the desert) since it's very difficult to navigate and find the items required in some of the side quests.. A masterpiece from Platinum Games. Played about 30 hours. The game gave unforgettable emotions. It was an exciting journey. I gave it a 9 only for performance issues in some big battles. But if Switch is your only platform and gameplay comes first, this is a must have/play game.. I've been trying to figure out why all the other versions of this game have great reviews except this one. None of the written reviews explain what they think is wrong with this particular version. They're all from people who don't like the game overall, which is fair. This port doesn't have any more issues than the other platforms'. Yes, if you can, it's preferable to play any other version, but this version is more than acceptable if you want or have to play it on Switch, and it's SURPRISINGLY close to the PS4 version. They really pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this port. It's solid 30fps, even in combat. I played over 100 hours using joycons. Get this with confidence. My other guess is that players from other platforms were angry because this version offers costumes that are exclusive to this version and came to brigade the reviews, or Nintendo's childish audience really doesn't like how gloomy and mature this game is idk.. I'm not sure i can describe this game adequately and how powerful it is. I feel like the word ""masterpiece"" is honestly fair to use. Its story is unbelievable and emotional making me cry and experience so many emotions. Its characters and world are amazing and fun. The combat is crazy and flashy with multiple options and weapons dodges and options showing off the amazing tough of platinum games that propelled this game. This game crafts something special though the endings, multiple routes, events and sequences. Its gameplay even supports the narrative and android/ humanity existential themes through purposeful moments, repetition and in game events. So much of this port is amazingly brought forward and helps it run wonderfully. This games narrative is something i cant stop thinking about, and it presents an amazing player decision that really highlights its themes and makes you understand giving up for others in a new way, Nier A goes beyond the medium in ways few games do and is just special to the point where i feel like every gamer/ person should try to experience it.. A great game, with good gameplay and a great story. I would really recommend this game to everyone, but there are some slight issues in docked mode sometimes the performance gets a bit worse and I encountered a clip through walls glitch that is easy to perform, but it generally works really smoothly. And at last I don’t know if that’s a me thing but the game feels a bit like semi open world Bayonetta with a sword, I think that’s a bit of wasted potential, but since the Bayonetta gameplay is great I don’t mind it. The main story also ends abruptly, but the story is finished in the postgame. It is a great game that I recommend for everyone.. its would be 10/10 but the multyple endings ****. its still worth it, but if you can, buy it to pc or ps, but if you can't its still amazing in switch too. One of the greatest games story wise I've ever played. Gameplay is always changing up and leaving you surprised. Late to the game with the Switch version but so glad I got to experience this. Glory to Mankind.. Don't waste yours hours with this trash. I am stuck in the B route because of a bug that does not allow me to progress, and I have spent already 20+ hours.. a must play, another great game by Platinum Games, great price, good port, maybe a bit unbalanced with the amount of items you can manage. One of the BEST JRPG TO EXIST FINALLY ON THE SWITCH AND THE PORT IS GOOD AT THAT. as far as switch ports go, this one is solid! coming from PC i gotta say i was nervous about this port.. but surprise, surprise! my worry was quickly put to rest. the game runs smooth and looks alright for the most part. you can definitely tell where they cut corners for this port. BUT if you have no other way of playing the game, or just enjoy playing on the go. this is a must!. amazing port of one of the best action jrpgs that ever. It baffels me they can manage to run this masterpiece ojn switch but square refuses to make actual kingdom hearts ports.. If you were hesitant trying this game on Switch, be reassured. This is one of the best Switch port I played. The graphics hold up very well compared to the PS4 version and the framerate is pretty stable. I got a few hiccups in some areas (mostly in route B), but it didn't make the game unplayable. As for the game itself, it is truly a great game. Great combat mechanics, characters and story.. I don't get this game at all. Maybe I'm missing something. The story has some interesting things going for it and the machines are an interesting enemy. But other than that the whole thing feels decidedly meh. The combat plays like an ersatz version of Devil May Cry, with far less aerial combat and enemy juggling and worse player and camera controls. Enemy encounters often turn into a frustrating bullet hell, with a wonky camera that at times feels like an extra opponent. Combat also suffers from a lack of verticality and options for fast traversal, and enemies feel kind of same-y. I died quite often, I'd say more or less as frequently as when I play dark souls. The difference is that the deaths in Nier: Automata never once felt fair, and beating the harder enemies never once felt satisfying. Maybe there's depth to be found here, but I sure haven't been able to find any. This is not helped by the fact that the game's plethora of systems are hardly explained. How do you play the fishing mini game, and what's the point of it? Who knows! How does one use the various installable module thingies? No idea, the game never tells me. What are the various resources and random things I collect? Can I use them for something? Is there crafting? Beats me. Heck, I didn't even know there were healing potions for a good several hours because the game never explained that this was a thing. Lastly, the aethethics are a mixed bag. Graphics are okay for it being a switch game, and the enemies are generally well designed. The world is also generally beautiful, albeit not that exciting. Our heroine, however… I get that it's a thing they're going for, but the bleak and sombre tone of the story is rather at odds with the fact that the protagonist – supposedly a rugged soldier – runs around in some kind of maid outfit that gratuitously displays her naked butt whenever the camera is at a low angle. Had they gone for a comedic ecchi vibe, or a tone similar to e.g. Bayonetta, it would have been at least consistent. But in this game it just makes for a weird cognitive dissonance.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Changing my score from a 9 to a 10 after sitting down and getting through my 3rd playthrough and seeing the true ending. This game was just incredible. I've never experienced anything like this for a finale and am so glad i continued on after I thought I saw most of everything on my first 2 endings. I sorta thought the 3rd ending was a short epilogue and nearly skipped it. Its definitely not an epilogue but a continuation to what the story actually is, you're not even half way through if you just got 2 endings. The combination of game play mechanics, story, well written characters and customization that is available to play how you like is just amazing. That ending though, the lead up, the final battles toward that, i just didn't see any of that coming and never would I have imagined the delivery to be like that. I got goosebumps and cried. One of those experiences that will definitely stick with me forever.. Very nice Game a purchase recommendation who has no PS4 only a Nintendo switch then is a must. This is one of the most amazing games of all time. Thank you so much Nintendo, you are the best in whole wide world.. Never got around to playing this one when it originally came out. Boy, what a mistake! This is BOTW, Mario Odyssey, MGS5 level great! I've played a few Platinum games, Wonderful 101 and Astral Chain, both which I really loved. Digging Nier so so much. It has everything you want in a game. I can't compare this port to the original but it runs pretty damn good to me, big props to Virtuos for a fantastic job, from what I understand, it was a Herculean task and I'm glad I now have the opportunity to experience this Masterpiece. I've loved the Switch since the minute I bought it 5+ years ago, it is by far my favorite console of all time. Getting some of these older games ported over that I never had a chance to play is just icing on the cake of probably the greatest all-around console of all time. Looking forward to the future of Nintendo, although the present pretty awesome! Game on, gamers.. Just beat the game. Only bother rating on MC when it's a 10-worthy game, and this is most definitely that. Extremely sharp, smooth framerate, and the HD rumble really sets it off, on top of being an insanely great game.. Despite the system limitations of the Switch, it doesn't have the graphical and performance issues that I was so concerned that it might have. I already had this for the PC and the PS4 but, I wanted one I could just play in bed or travel with. I would highly recommend this as it by far one of the best games ever. It's not an overstatement to say it's a masterpiece with the music (awesome) to the story, it's definitely worth it.. I've played Nier automata on game pass but never really had a chance to finish it but finally I came back to it on switch. Port is excellent and I really didn't feel like I was losing something... definitely one of the best games available on switch without a doubt. Game is real masterpiece, story is amazing and gameplay is really engaging. It's amazingly rewarding game it could be relaxing as well as tense in atmosphere. Music, dialogs and graphics are top quality. There's a lot of memorable moments and I highly recommend this game to every good stories enjoyers.. I somehow went all this time not hearing anything about this game besides the fact that is was good. And yes it is very good. Probably the best execution of a story I’ve seen from a Videogame. and the fact that they put the effort in to make a native port on switch for this makes it so much better.. Best game on the switch since Zelda! God tier music and design! The sadness is surreal as well lol. One of my all-time favorites. First played it on a PS 4 Pro back in the day, but the switch port seems extremely competent. If you haven't played it, but you're searching for an intelligent and deep story-game, with versatile, action-packed game-play, you shouldn't miss on this modern classic.. A beautiful game. In docked mode it beats the ps4 and xbox one since it has 1080p. It looks great and it has a great gameplay. Recomended.. One of the best Switch ports ever made (rock solid 30FPS without any major compromise) for one of the best videogames the industry has ever seen. P.S: great pricing too! (40$). Loved the game and especially the music. Probably the best nintendo switch game 2022 so far, waiting for bayonetta 3!. Best version of this masterpiece. Playable both docked (at 1080p which is higher than its PS4 counterpart) and in Portable mode, features HD Rumble, Motion controls and exclusive DLC items. Highly recommended!. This is an art. Story-soundtrack-art style-game play-game menu-dialogue choice, everything is connected with each other. This game's story can't be easily adapted or as-is copied by movie or show. Just like people can't copy masterpiece arts.. Vary Good Port ! Good Graphics ! So Cool gameplay with This Controllers I Love It !. Almost exactly how it is on every other console...which is pretty insane for a handheld console.. Amazing port of an amazing game! Runs excellently. Amazing Soundtrack and Gameplay, Fantastic Story amazing characters and boss fights! Platinum Games, Square Enix and Virtuos have done an excellent job porting this amazing game to switch. A very great port of a very amazing game! Nier Automata is one of the best games to release from last gen. Amazing music, great gameplay, superb characters and story! It's one of the better 3rd party switch ports and titles in general. A must buy for people who never experienced the game before!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nier Automata is one among the handful of titles that I cite in example to describe what the medium can achieve when all the components **** gel into a cohesive experience. Story focused games sometimes forget their first mandate, the gameplay. Other times it’s masterful mechanics wasted on a game that struggles to give a proper motivation and context to the player. Sometimes it’s a lackluster art direction that robs the game of its full potential. Nier Automata doesn’t have any of these problems. It’s an unforgettable experience told in a very clever and unique way, supported by satisfying action, meaningful progression, and superb production values. Usually I’m not one for praising the story in a game, but in this case I must mention the compelling, sometimes downright touching characters (in particular among the machines), and the emotional impact of their story, which is told with economy, suggested at times, and certainly never hamfisted. The game isn’t burried under useless dialogue. Every character interaction is meaningful and concise, a fact quite rare among JRPGs. I also want to salute the unusual structure of the game, where the full experience is distilled though several play throughs. This ensures enjoyable replay value, devoid of grind, and a system that keeps peeling new layers, and rewards the most dedicated player. I could go on for a long time, telling you about the impeccable mechanics, the atmospheric art direction, the powerful music. But I want to adress the port. In fact, it’s the quality of the Switch port that compelled me to write a review. I’ve played the game on PS4, and of course if you own one, it’s a better way to experience the game. But with a solid 30 fps most of the time and clever graphical compromises, this port is as good as they get. I think we need to encourage developers to treat the Switch with respect, and boycott shameless cash grab half baked ports. They’re an insult both to the platform and the game. But rest assured that if you can only play Nier Automata on the Switch, the core of the experience remains intact, and the few concessions the developer made are quite reasonable. The only questionable choice for me is how much more saturated the game is on Switch. I have nothing against colorful games, but I think that the somewhat subdued palette on PS4 felt more appropriate. I’m not sure if this was a conscious choice, but to me it cheapens the art, and gives the game an unwanted peppy look. However this is a minor concern, especially if you’ve never played the game on any other platform. But if like me you’re sensitive to this kind of thing, it’s a bit of an issue. For my part, I’ll play Nier Automata again, because it’s a true testament to how wonderful videogames can be, both for their entertainment and artistic value. And I suggest that you do the same.. Great port, i dont see a reason not to vote 10. One if the greatest games of all time. Something new is always happening, it never gets boring.. The best port ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. i played this masterpiece on the PS4 before, but when i played this switch port i enjoyed the game even more, they really managed to create the impossible port and they managed to make it a perfect one, so it's a 10 out of 10 for me.. MANNNNN... stop listening to these lames. Best game on the switch since Zelda hands down. 10/10. I see a lot of people love the Nier games, but they're just not my jam, too much nihilism and mindless button mashing. I just started this version. Haven’t gotten too far into it. But it seems good. The user response is probably review bombing, but for good measures, I’m writing this.. A surprisingly great port, courtesy of Virtuous yet again. What they did here is mind boggling, reducing a 50Gb game into 10.5Gb and creating a seamless experience in comparison to its bigger cousins. Nier: Automata is always been a classic and one of the best console game of the last generation, but alas, I have never really completed through all of its endings. By going portable, I can simply go through it at my own pace, and it is a brilliant game that should be played by Switch owners everywhere.. this game is not good, the gameplay is very easy and the battles is so boring.. Wonderful game, and a wonderful Port. They really did it again with Nier on the Switch. Played the PS4 a couple years back and loved what i played but i am loving this more. Great story, great graphics and great gameplay. If you love action/RPG's or love Pantinum **** will love Nier Automata on the Switch.","the game has some of the best music in all of gaming . it's a perfect game with good graphics, tragic characters, and great music . it's a great way to explore the world of yoko Taro, but it's not perfect ."
446.Quake II - Enhanced Edition,"I can Always come back to this game, with timeless gameplay, balanced weapons and great levels.. Quake 2 has aged well and will continue to age well as a defining FPS of its time. It sets a high standard using one of the finest game engines for the genre. The gameplay is smooth from the movement to the weapons to the physics. The music, sound effects, and ambiance sounds are top-notch and complement the theme to fit in with the environment. Although Quake 2 may lack some elements of character development and deeper story explanation, it allows the player to imagine while focusing on the instant action aspect. The level designs are creative and elegant but sometimes feel repetitive and confusing to navigate. Some of the included mission packs are decent, but do not exceed expectations of the base game: Q64 - Very linear, enclosed, and short. Overall it was OK, however, it has a bland level design. 7/10 Call of the Machine - Some parts were hectic and difficult. It was OK. 7/10 The Reckoning - Lots of water stuff, traps, and backtracking in a boring dull environment. Not many weapons early on. Overall it's not great and very boring. 6/10 Ground Zero - Good weapons and a fast pace. Decent and fun. 8/10. Best single player Quake ever made, secons only to Quake 3 in a overall comparison. The classic is great, and I really like how they've enhanced the enhanced edition.. An addictive and beautiful game with balanced difficulty Although the Remaster of the game is not strong, the foundation of the game makes it better. It's Quake. The masterpiece I played when I was a teenager and so many years later it is back even better. I'm gonna finish it once more, here I go Stroggs.. Definitely a solid core game and port. Been playing it and its a definite improvement and worth picking up. I played quake 3 team arena for along time and I was never really a fan of original boomer shooters like quake 1 or Wolfenstein and as quake 2 was my first game in the genre and series on a demo disc from a magazine and I never got to play it again till now. It’s pretty good stuff. Always wanted a chance to play this again and see what it was I liked so much about it. The multiplayer is junk though. Pretty sure its an original base game problem with balancing and when it comes down to it I shouldn’t be point blank with a super shotgun and not be able to take them down. For realsies its like 10 hits point blank with the super shotgun to kill someone. And its really laggy. Cant compete with cross play when the person hosting has 90ms and everyone else has 230. Its almost like they time travel 2-3 seconds in the future and just pick people away with a rail gun.. Masterpiece, it doesn't matter how old this game is or how the graphics looks compared to recent days, this game is absolutely superb. It looks incredible, shooting feels amazing, excellent design and atmosphere. This is without a single doubt whatsoever one of the best FPS games of all time.. The classic game returns with enhanced graphics, the gameplay is still great.. Fantastic remaster, one of the best I've ever seen. It feels exactly like I'm playing it on the ps1 again.. Quake 2 is better than Quake 1. It is a amazing game with pretty decent graphics, amazing guns, cool enemies and so on.. Quake lives in my blood. Amazing remastered version from a classic FPS in the late 90s. Improved graphics, menus, DLCs and nostalgia.. Even without beeing reviewed through vintage lenses, Quake II Remastered impresses in almost every way. The gameplay delivers as much straightforward fun as it did in it´s original days while managing to keep it´s visual style without feeling too outdated. With a fully working multiplayer component and besides every official expansion, there is even a completely new campaign to discover. Containing lots of extras like an also overhauled port of Quake II 64, Bethesda offers more content for a mere ten bucks than most AAA-companies do for a full price these days.. The original game was great already and somehow it got even better. The extra episode created by Machine Games really shows what the engine is capable of. The best episode released to date for Quake II (only the ending could be a bit better ;) ). Enhances the cg with the old style, i'm 20 hours in and is still kicking!!! I suggest every gamer plays this at least once!. This takes me way back to my Quake 2 days. Had lots of fun with friends back then and it's still fun now, it seems. Very nice enhanced edition. with campaigns, etc.. Gameplay 2/2 Music 2/2 Story 2/2 Level design 2/2 Graphic 2/2 This game is so nostalgic for me and with this game I travel too 20 years ago thank to Id software and Bethesda and Microsoft!!!. A lifetime classic game. Nice step from ID to give younger players to experience it. Great remaster of one of the best fps games of all time. Now I hope people will stop hating this game.. The other red reviews are definitely trolling (if you couldn't tell) but I assure you this remaster is mediocre at best. As usual, NDS couldn't help but take license with everything like they've ever designed a decent game in their lives, and as such the railgun damage was reduced by 1/3, enemy behaviors that were cut for quality reasons were re-introduced like that's a good thing, menus are tacked on like always, they just had to go and mess with nightmare-difficulty balance, and so on. The KEX engine renders everything as competently as the other source ports, which is to say there's no reason not to play the other source ports, and accessibility options may be helpful for a tiny minority of the tiny minority that are even going to play this. Four points for not being a total travesty at release like the Quake KEX port.. Why would you give them money for a eye cancer game from 1997 (addons and console, special versions excluded). I read its a free upgrade if you own the original, well at least I have to give them that. You can tickle your nostalgia with it in 120 FPS sure, but actually seriously playing it. The games size is not even 5 gigs. With all the campaigns the stuffed into it! That tells you it s **** lazy eye cancer game without even good res textures. And this gets praised as a ""the definition **** remaster"" by Ron in the reviews? Seriously they do not even call it a remaster themselves because its NOT it. It looks better but it still looks incredibly bad and not in any way comparable to any decent looking game, it does not have to be ""modern"" looking but this is just painful to look at. They did the minimum amount of work and just stuffed everything that was already made with one new campaign into the game. This is not a nice looking remake/remaster with DOOM Eternal style graphics and modern gameplay. Its a nostalgia eye cancer game with outdated everything. Outdated graphics, outdated boring gameplay. I can not imagine anyone having actually fun playing though all the campains it offers, as its the same boring AF gameplay from AGES ago. Maybe in coop 1 point for that. I am also pretty sure there are open source versions of various quakes out there that feature better graphics, raytracing and stuff out there.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Quake 2 classic one of best fps of all times ,revolutionary game engine ,with new improved graphic easy to play with new compass mode ,new expansions multiplayer improved ,must play classic .. This is one of the favorite games of my youth. So many fond memories... A living classic in a new form. Maybe more new players will join and see where the cool shooters started from. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As an old-school gamer (get off my lawn! lol) it is disappointing to find out that this is actually Quake 2, the second game in the Quake trilogy, and not Quake 4 the best one. It's a very ugly game from the 90s but it looks like a Playstation graphics which is an immediate ""thumbs down"" even for a fan of retro games like me. The art direction is basically like if James Carmack said: ""make everything brown and then light it with the most garish colors and particle effects you can find... pronto!"" The music was pretty cool though it was on the CD-ROM and you could put it in any stereo to play it, though since this is a digital download I guess you can't do that. but it's probably on you tube. Enhances the visuals while keeping faithful to the original art style. Adds a ton of extra content and features, including a whole new campaign and a port of Quake 64. This is how you bring old games into the modern age! Absolutely beautiful!. Q2 was first Quake I've ever played. I had a demo disc. At the time it was visually ground breaking game. I only had P133 with no accelerator card, so I run it in 360. But after the demo my mates and I started playing Q2 deathmatches at Internet Caffee's for over a year and a half ( and depending on the machine in 640 or 800! ), and that was best part of this game. BUT I can't tell you exactly when I've played full Q2 campaign for the first time - I think it was around the time I've got Voodoo 1 but I've got to a certain point and didn't complete it. Certainly I've completed it a decade later when I've got my hands on the full game disc at a second hand store. Regardless, that's the problem with this game's SP campaign: it's forgettable. Not only forgettable, but already few maps in it starts dragging. It felt exactly the same playing it all those years ago as I am feeling right now about it. It's hard to put finger on what it exactly is: is it a map layouts? Connected levels? Enemy placement? Environment design? Weak weapon impact? Maybe it is a combination of all of these elements. The level layout just doesn't stick, and everything feels samy. Enemies placement feels like a pattern. Got to say, first time I've played Q1 was after playing Q2, and although visually poorer, the level layouts are much more memorable, weapons feel stronger, enemies placement seams more thought-out, and in general Q1 feels like a much more precise design, even thought creating it was probably much more hectic. Although the soundtrack in this one still rocks socks off ( crank that volume knob up! ) The Enhancement looks really cool. Added new effects and lightening make it much more atmospheric, there are 2 og expansions plus brand new one, and N64 port, which is a very nice package and a job well done. But because the game itself just isn't that great I am giving it a fair score of 6. For anyone who never played it, it's worth getting it at current price to experience it and make up their own mind.. The definition **** remaster. Once again steered safely to harbor by the remaster masters at Nightdive Studios. Quality enhancements that respect the source material and heaps and heaps of rare and restored material for us to peruse. The original campaign is in there. The expansions are in there. A new amazing campaign by MachineGames is in there. And the Nintendo 64 Quake 2 campaign as well.. Good- Solid visual enhancements that improve the overall mood of the classic without diminishing its aesthetic. Restored soundtrack is incredible. Excellent quality-of-life and accessibility features. Better game feel, with tougher AI that have new tactics. The id Vault offers some nice behind the scenes assets and demos. Stellar value for money. Bad- The quality of the mission packs doesn't quite match up to the base game. Call of the Machine is a decent addition overall but nothing too crazy. No auto save, which means abusing the Quick Save button constantly. Thoughts- Quake 2’s remaster isn’t just an incredible visual improvement to a classic game. It’s a love letter to fans that includes all past content while accommodating new players with functions like the compass and accessibility features. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at several assets while addressing one of the biggest omissions – the soundtrack, which is still incredible, even after all these decades. While the mission packs aren’t on the same level as the base game, the overall package is appealing to fans of old-school shooters. As the best way to experience one of id Software’s most iconic games (especially given its price), it’s also a strong benchmark for remasters in general.. PC version crashes quite a bit at the moment. Here's hoping there will be patches for stability... otherwise my PS5 review transfers over here.. Amazing game for the fps players, if you couldn't play the original quake 2 , it's your time now. They didn't have to go this hard with the remaster, but they did, and I'm grateful. It has a new campaign, co-op, splitscreen co-op, and now you can finally play the N64 version of the game on PC. Did I mention it's a free upgrade if you own the original version?. The Original Quake 2 from 1997 is one of the best FPS of its time, since despite not having anything to do with its predecessor beyond the title, it improved Quake's mechanics and gave us a more complete and fun game. which served as inspiration for great future titles like Half-Life and Unreal Tournament. The connection between the levels of the game make it a fun and labyrinthine experience that can be very striking even almost 30 years after its launch. The incredible music of Sonic Mayhem can easily be considered one of the best soundtracks id Software has and the gameplay follows the standard set by the original Quake, fast-paced and frenetic combat that results in a rewarding experience for players new and old alike. equal. As a Remaster, the game meets expectations and even exceeds them, since not only the graphics has been massively improved, but also the behavior of the enemies and their artificial intelligence has been improved, the levels have been modified and updated, the enemies have new attacks and If you are a returning veteran player, I assure you that it will feel like this is a new game without losing the essence of what Quake 2 was originally. The game also contains a bonus section showing the game's development process, concept art, never-before-seen development documents, and deleted content, a welcome extra for fans of the series and id Software. Without a doubt, a remaster that is worth playing, whether you are new to the series or a veteran, since we are in the presence of one of the most innovative shooters of its time and I dare say that one of the best in history due to its influence on modern shooters.","i can always come back to this game, with timeless gameplay, balanced weapons and great levels . the music, sound effects, and ambiance sounds are top-notch and complement the theme to fit in with the environment . although the level designs are creative and elegant but sometimes feel repetitive and confusing to navigate ."
447.Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow,"The sequel to Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow builds upon what made its predecessor great to make an arguably even better game. The Tactical Souls from the previous game are back, and they're just as cool. The map is also well designed and I appreciated that the setting wasn't the usual Dracula's Castle (though it basically looks the same and has the usual Castlevania enemies in it). The supporting cast from Aria is back and it's nice to see the characters fleshed out a bit more. I thought the writing in this game was a great improvement over its predecessor and made me appreciate the characters more. I especially liked the optional dialogue from Yoko and Hammer. The bosses are all really fun and somehow seem to ""fit"" with where you fight them in the castle. There's a cool weapon upgrade system and even a story-relevant alternate mode. One point of contention with the fanbase seems to be the switch-up to a more generic anime art style, though I personally liked the new art style. Some people also don't like the seals. Basically you are required to draw a glyph with the stylus (or input a button sequence in the Dominus Collection) like a QTE to defeat bosses. However, since Castlevania bosses are more about learning attack cycles and timings, it's not too punishing to miss a seal in my opinion, and it feels quite rewarding to perfectly execute a seal when on your first try of a boss. My only complaint is that the character moves a bit slow sometimes, and some aspects later in the game are a bit grindy. On a final note, Castlevania soundtracks are often great, but this game's soundtrack was exceptionally good.. An unfun experience, the artstyle has been drastically hit from what was expected in previous games, the characters are flandarized here even by the standards of the previous game, and the main character specifically makes some weird and stupid decisions. I can't recommend.. It feels like it plays a lot slower than Aria. Also, it's basically a 'more of the same' entry. I always get bored within a couple hours of starting, regardless of playing vanilla or a ROMhack. Exploration Action (sometimes called Metroidvanias) really need to have a compelling map to explore - and this one didn't. It felt like nothing more than a rehash of older, popular entries. It also unfortunately released on the gimmick console, the Nintendo DS, so it had to use touchscreen crap wherever possible and it felt utterly unnecessary.. Dawn of Sorrow left a far bigger impression on me than Aria of Sorrow, and I don’t think it’s because I played it last. No, Dawn of Sorrow actually builds on the characters while still delivering the same fast paced gameplay and exploration I have come to know and love about this series.. Enjoyable entry to the Castlevania series that maintains its look and feel while adding bells and whistles such as non-linear levels to explore, item shops and equipment that gives your character new abilities - very much in the vein of the GBA Metroid games. Not as good as those classics, but a good, solid addition to the franchise.. One of the best games in the entire series, it has everything a good Castlevania game needs to have. Using the Nintendo DS touch screen isn't very comfortable, but it's less annoying than it sounds.. What hellish atrocity did they with Aria of Sorrow art style? Played through probably 3 to 4 areas of the castle and dropped in a puzzle where you have to literally rearrange the map to progress because I'm not choosing Castlevania to think, just to kill monsters and became powerful. Seems stupid, but that's my reason. Probably giving it a 0 because I liked Aria of Sorrow so much, and this game is a steep downgrade in comparison.. Alucard and soma have to be like police girl from hellsing credo and cerezita especially soma and trevor and julius have to be like the werewolf boy in hellsing and nero and jeanne when she was a child especially juluis. Soma is acully the son of alucard which means he has to be more like v from devil may cry vergil human half he also has to be more like police girl in hellsing and bayonetta daughter gohan and superboy remember that soma is only a semi vampire i love his soul powers it would have been cool if more people had it. It was as good a game as Aria and I think I can say that I liked it more than Aria. I think it's my favorite Castlevania game I've played so far. (I played 1-2-3-4 SOTN and Aria). I really liked the story. Dialogues between Yoko and Hammer. Find clues and hidden information with dialogue. Weapon upgrade system. Various skills. Level design. Nice boss battles. The things we do with the touchscreen. Magic Seals. It was fun. Music is great. I finished the game in 8 hours and 98% of it. I enjoyed every minute of it.. Score would be an 8 or 9 if it weren't for farming/grinding and the dreaded Seal System (having to use the stylus to draw increasingly intricate shapes to defeat bosses when they're about to die and if you mess up you have to fight the boss again). Playing Soma over-all is fun and the soul-absorbing 'Power of Dominance' feature is back. Pixel art is good, the anime character portraits are generic and lack the personality seen in Aria, the music is amazing which is to be expected from this series. Julius mode, that you unlock if you get the bad ending, is actually quite good. You get to play as Julius and Yoko and Alucard join your team. A really refreshing alternative game mode actually worth playing. It also eliminates the seal system! It's a shame that they added the Seal System and made it a little grind-heavy. It really does take away from an otherwise great experience.. Not good as Aria of Sorrow Bad weapon system. Force you farming soul to upgrade weapon Farming soul is stupid thing too And seal, whats wrong?! Max stupid !. Dawn of Sorrow is a solid game but I'm not sure how I feel about a solar eclipse in Japan being the best setting for the game. As ridiculous as I find some of the story, it's still Castlevania at heart. Sticking to the Metroidvania SOTN style it did an amazing job. I also heard from many of my friends that Hard is pretty dang hard. However I didn't have any problems. I actually thought this was pretty easy overall. That or it's because I'm well established in these types of games. One thing I will admit though, Julius Mode's final boss was actually pretty tough but once you learn the patterns, it gets easy. Just gotta be very careful on placement. Characters are great and returners are always awesome, soundtrack as always is amazing and you can find them on spotify and graphics for a DS game, not too shabby. It's a solid title just for the Castlevania experience but to me, it didn't feel like it was much new. If you want to play better, play Aria of Sorrow.. The best Castlevania games on the DS and one of the best in general, especially gameplay wise. The touch-screen mechanics are a bit annoying but I can't take seriously anyone who says they ruin the game. Not a bad game, but quite a copy-paste from Aria of Sorrow. Graphics seems to have been made for GBA globally. The most interesting point is the Julius mode which is quite good and offers a challenge.. The wonderful score made the game memorable for me. The soul harvest system is a good retain from previous entry.. Not as good as Aria of Sorrow, but a good game on its own right. I preferred the art style of the original game rather than the anime style used on the sequel. The soundtrack has many great tunes, including many references to old games in the series. Normal mode is a bit too easy, especially if you try to collect items and souls. Most bosses were a breeze to kill with the proper souls and weapons equipped. The game relied upon a bit too much into grinding in order to achieve 100% completion. Julius mode, on the other hand, was very fun and quite challenging. The lack of an inventory where you could carry healing potions made boss fights a matter of skill and survivability. The gameplay where you switch between Julius, Yoko, and Alucard is reminiscent from Castlevania III and still works quite well. Each character is useful in different scenarios. Great game, was a pleasure to play.. It is the first Castlevania that I had, but not the first that I played, because the first one was SOTN. If you have already played the SOTN (Symphony of the Night), you may see similarities with Dos (Dawn of Sorrow). The difference is that is another history, a completely different castle and also better graphics. You can see the evolution of Konami developing the Castlevania games. You may play it if you enjoy a good 2 game and if you enjoy searching secrets rooms and stealing rares souls.. To me, this is the best Castlevania game and is in my top 10 all time favorites. It's a perfectly executed side-scroller with beautiful parallaxing effects to bring the environments to life. Literally hundreds of monsters, weapons, and abilities each with additional power increase possibilities. You combine weapons and souls of monsters you defeat to create unbelievable combinations. Each one of these has a challenging/fun learning curve to master. The music is as beautiful as always and the gorgeous art style adds to the overall epic ness of this game. Not to mention, the anime style animatics are an awesome touch to this gens delivery. Easily a 10/10!. This game is really fun. It's Castlevania with RPG elements. You can play it however you like, and explore the castle, but there is a story line to follow. If you like Castlevania you will definitely like this. This is one of the best Castlevania games of all time. There are a few problems with it, which is why I gave it a 9 rather than a 10, but overall it's pretty much a complete package. You won't get bored with this. The Good: - It's classic Castlevania but with RPG elements. - There are so many things to collect, but they really add to the experience. All the souls, weapons, crafting, etc, are really just a nice time waster. - Lots of exploration to be done, and mystery. - The story is basic but it motivates you onward. - Killing monsters is very satisfying. There are a ton of enemies. You'll never get bored with all the creatures. - The game is not too easy, and not too hard. It has the right level of difficulty. - The music is nice. - Despite console limitations the graphics are well done, other than the winter scenes, which just look washed out. The art is good. The Bad: - The game displays the action on the lower screen instead of the upper screen. It's a bizarre choice to make. Clearly, the menu, and map belong on the bottom. It would have been really handy if you could tap the screen, and look closer on the map (which is rather small). - There is one section of the game where you have to do some type of sliding puzzle. It was confusing. Not really fun if I have to say so myself. - The characters walks kind of slow. I would have liked it if he could walk a bit faster. But there is a method for fast travel, so this isn't a huge issue. - The teleport, and save areas really should be right beside each other. They are close to each other but not beside. - When you die you go back to the start up point of the game, like you resetted your console. Instead the game should ask you if you want to begin again from your save point. Yes or no? Simple, right? - A lot of grinding is required to get souls. It would be nice if acquiring souls was just little bit easier. I don't want it to be too easy, but sometimes it's frustrating. One character I killed literally a hundred plus times, and yet got no soul. I was just thinking, ""C'mon now!"" - I don't like those medusa heads! The ones that turn your into stone are just terrible.. I apologise for the username i just needed to type something quik, Castlevania DoS was so horrible, it made me scared to buy another game on the nintendo ds... the plot is stale and recycled, the gameplay, it just throws in monsters and enemies from sotn and remasterd versions of Aos... And this is comming from a HARDCORE CASTLEVANIA FAN !!! honest to god , i got bored of this game after i was halfway through it i'm sorry to tell you... but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to ruin the ENTIRE castelvania series for you i'm telling you... i talked up this game to my mom , and when i got it , i wanted to kill myself becasue it ruined castelvania for me..... Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow: What a Horrible Night to Love a Game/ I hadn’t played Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow before playing Dawn of Sorrow, but the game does a good job of catching one up to speed on what they need to know. There will be some light spoilers for Aria of Sorrow here. Set in the year 2036, one year after Aria of Sorrow, you play as Soma Cruz, the reincarnation of the dark lord, Dracula. While hanging out with the love interest, Mina (both of them insist that they’re just friends), Soma is suddenly attacked by a woman named Celia. Celia retreats after you receive aid from Genya Arikado, a government agent who also holds another significant identity in the Castlevania universe. Arikado explains to Soma that Celia is the leader of a religious movement that believes that in order for there to be a God, the perfect embodiment of light, there must be a dark lord, the perfect embodiment of darkness, so they are trying to resurrect the dark lord. With the help of his friend, Hammer, the shop keeper, Soma infiltrates Celia’s castle. Along the way, Soma also runs into his friends, Julius Belmont, descendant of the Belmont clan that fought Dracula for hundreds of years, and Yoko Belnades, partner to Julius. The plot is just an excuse to keep the game going, but it’s still pretty interesting and I’ve always loved a villain that is driven by some sort of religious belief. There are a few surprising twists and even multiple endings. While I did enjoy the game’s story, the way the game plays is really where it shines bright./ The moment I started playing Dawn of Sorrow I fell in love with it. I loved exploring the castle with tight platforming, interesting and varied enemies, and snappy but satisfying combat. You will see as you play the game that there are areas that you won’t be able to access right away. You’ll have to come back later with new abilities in order to explore the enemy’s stronghold to the fullest. Speaking of abilities, there are so many abilities available to you to customize Soma with. Soma has what is called the Power of Dominance, which lets him sometimes absorb the soul of an enemy he has defeated, and almost every enemy has a soul he can absorb. These souls are abilities you earn from that specific enemy type that can then be equipped to Soma in order to give him new powers. These include throwing axes like in classic Castlevania games, turning into a bat to fly around the area, summoning a creature to assist you in battle, or a simple stat increase. Dawn of Sorrow is an RPG and the soul drops are random, so you may need to grind if you’re looking for a specific soul, but combat is fun enough that it is not too much of an inconvenience. Being an RPG, you can also improve Soma with by leveling up or by equipping him with different armor or weapons. There are many different weapon types that each feel different from each other and every weapon can be upgraded to become more powerful. Perhaps you will like the power given to you by the broadsword or maybe the range of a handgun. This, combined with the large amount of souls, provides you with an amount of options even larger than the castle that is such a joy to explore. Speaking of which, the world around you excels almost as much as the gameplay./ The ambiance of Dawn of Sorrow is truly impressive. It is, as said before, a Metroidvania style game. With such a sense of exploration to the game, each area should be able to feel unique but still very much connected. The game’s Gothic environment does this quite well while inside the castle. You’ll find yourself going from a small village, to an elegant dance hall, to a mysterious lab, to a spike filled torture chamber while fighting your way through hoards of nefarious demons. Speaking of which, I love the character designs in this game. I’ve heard some people complain about the character portraits not being as stylized as the previous games, which doesn’t bother me since I didn’t play the previous game. The greatest designs go to the enemies, however. The enemy design mostly takes inspiration from classic horror figures and iconic creatures of lore. You’ll be coming up against Frankenstein’s monster, unsuspecting witches, howling werewolves, and giant suits of armor trying to hurl axes at you. Of course, there are some more creative enemies too, like one of the bosses being a giant, rotting, zombie dinosaur. While you run into the occasional goofy enemy, like a blue haired maid named Persephone, the enemies give the game a disturbing, horrific tint about it, which makes fighting them all the more fun. Not only do the enemies look good, but the soundtrack is exciting too. I enjoyed listening to every track in the game, including one or two Castlevania classics, like Bloody Tears. The art design and music were great to experience from beginning to end.. The GBA games were close to perfect. This tips it over into completely perfect. My favourite of all the metroidvania games this has a fun story, great graphics, tight controls and plenty to see and do. It's on the easy side compared to some of the series, but that doesn't harm it in my eyes.. This game is awesome!!!!! I love every single TRUE Castlevania game, i mean the sidescroller titles! I don't like lord of shadows or that 3d's awful titles. Castlevania Dawn Of sorrow can be defined as one of the best Castlevania games ever made! Of Course it took the famous ""Metroidvania"" style. originated in Symphony of the night, but that's fine, because that style just fits very well in this kind of games. The music is a masterpiece, what a wonderful songs this game has. The argument and characters are simply great, very interesting things happens while you play, and that keeps you interested the whole game. Some enemies are new, there's some improved things, this game has much fun to offer, there's some puzzles also, like a door that you can open if the number match you gold, or if you buy a newspaper, it gives you some clues about certain creatures you can find. This game is really excellent, i am glad to be one of the gamers that LOVE CASTLEVANIA series. Sadly, this is one of the last Castlevania games that are actually good. hope in the near future we receive games like this one. Positive(+): + Excellent storyline + Wonderful music + Very good and innovative gameplay mechanics, like touch the screen to break the ice. + The characters are very cool, each one has a very interesting personality. + A new mode in wich you can create your own list of enemies to defeat. + This game retains all the good elements that made the Castlevania series so great. + Some good puzzles and secrets to discover, this game rewards the exploration. + Wireless mode has been imrpoved Negative(-): - Some combat elements are exactly the same as the previous Castlevania games. - Some enemies are too easy to defeat.. The first game I bought for my DS besides Pokemon and FIFA. An amazing Platformer/ Adventure/ RPG/ Action game with an awesome level of weapon/ ability customization. It has great visuals and an awesome, humorous dialogue. On the downside it can get repetitive when exploring to find new things and ways to get to some places, and if you are unlucky you can end up just scanning through everything to find what you are looking for which gets a bit boring. Also there is an element of grinding that can get annoying as well. Still a great game which deserves a 9 out of 10.. Tight gameplay, compelling construction, and satisfying story aesthetic. I came into this as a first time Castlevania player, so I can not speak for long time fans, but I love this game. Scratches the same itch as Super Metroid.. Is not a bad game but somehow i cant get hyped about dawn of sorrow.. *REVIEW EDITED* Sequel to Aria of Sorrow which was on GBA, Dawn of Sorrow takes place a year later with the player getting to control Soma Cruz once again and to explore the entire castle, dominate monster souls, experience breathtaking boss fights, and to find a variety of weapons and armor. I must say I was really impressed with the storyline in Dawn of Sorrow. As well as the awesome characters from Aria, there were some new interesting characters too, as well as some nice twists. The game is simply beautiful. The stages are designed exceptionally well, with lovely 3D views on the background, and the soundtrack is just mindblowing, perhaps even surpassing Aria's. The game's difficulty is also somewhat moderately high, but not frustrating like Circle of the Moon. Most of the game can be played without the need to level grind. Only near the end of the game, when going towards the good ending, some grinding is greatly beneficial. The only feature I sort of disliked in Dawn of Sorrow was the magic seal system. Although the idea is good, the punishment for failing to draw a magic seal correctly is too extreme, i.e. the boss you. Epic game. As almost every Castlevania ever released. The game is very fun to play through, and collecting souls is less boring than it sounds. The only issues are the dated graphics, which resemble too much it's prequel, and the somewhat boring and unbalanced alternative game mode. As that's gimmicky anyway and doesn't affect the basic gameplay, still a solid 9.. I personally haven't played the old Castlevania games, dawn of sorrow was the second (due to rarity) Castlevania I've ever played and the best of the other Castlevania titles on the DS. Though the story was a little edgy here and there, the combat is excellent!. If you love Castlevania, you'll love Dawn of Sorrow. Not a whole lot has changed since the switch to 'Metroidvania' in Symphony of the Night- but how is that a bad thing? Dracula's castle is as exciting as ever, with some impressive DS visuals presenting players with a wide variety of different areas to explore. It's possible to level up and equip a wide array of different weaponry and armour, giving players a perfect amount of customisation for their character. The classic Castlevania formula works flawlessly on DS and will be sure to have you coming back for more.",the artstyle has been drastically hit from what was expected in previous games . the characters are flandarized here even by the standards of the previous game . it's basically a 'more of the same' entry .
448.Destiny 2: The Final Shape,"This is the first time using this site MTCGAME and experience was fantastic, even after reaching out for online assistance. Destiny 2: The Final Shape successfully concludes the Light and Darkness saga with a compelling and immersive campaign. The Pale Heart, a new linear destination, offers a mix of beauty and horror, making exploration a rewarding experience. The story, filled with emotional moments, complements the action, focusing on character development. Endgame content, including new subclasses and missions, provides solid challenges and rewards. Despite a delayed launch, The Final Shape proves to be a satisfying expansion that revitalizes player interest with its intense narrative and gameplay improvements. If I reviewed everything beyond final shape and game's general course then the score wouldn't be even half of that, but I'm glad that bungie managed to make this game everything we wanted for at least a single campaign, that surely deserves a 10. Right after that they obviously and sadly returned to actively making this game worse and worse.. *The Final Shape* is the highly anticipated final expansion of the *Destiny* saga, bringing the epic battle between Light and Darkness to its climactic end. Centered around a decisive confrontation with the Witness—the greatest enemy in the *Destiny* universe—this expansion promises to close the story arc that began over a decade ago with a narrative more epic and intricate than ever. Guardians will venture into a mysterious new area known as the *Plane of Shape*, a psychedelic and unsettling realm that embodies the warped reality crafted by the **** of the key features of *The Final Shape* is the return of iconic allies like Cayde-6, who reappears in a mysterious form to aid the Guardians in their ultimate showdown. The storyline is expected to be full of twists, offering long-awaited answers to questions surrounding the true motives of the Witness and the deeper meaning of Light and Darkness in the *Destiny* universe.Beyond the story, *The Final Shape* will introduce new powers and abilities for Guardians, though specific details on new subclasses or adjustments to existing abilities remain under wraps. Bungie has hinted that players can expect innovative mechanics that will shift approaches to combat in both PvE and **** expansion will feature an epic new raid set within the *Plane of Shape*, promising to be one of the most intense and intricate challenges ever crafted in *Destiny*. Players will need peak cooperation and strategy, facing surreal environments and memorable bosses that will capitalize on the unique mechanics of the Witness’s **** summary, *The Final Shape* is poised to deliver a grand, story-rich conclusion with fresh powers, groundbreaking mechanics, and an unforgettable raid, setting the stage for a powerful finale to the *Destiny* saga.. The Final Shape was without a doubt the best expansion Destiny has had. The story was beautifully put together, and the raid furthering the story and unlocking the final mission was an amazing idea. The final mission brought a tear to my eyes as I realized that the story I've been following for a majority of my life, with the characters I've come to love/hate, has finally come to a satisfying conclusion. The raid was my favorite in the series, with 2 of my favorite encounters in the game. Prismatic was an amazing inclusion that takes build crafting to another level. Looking forward to the future of the game with this new era of Destiny we're entering.. Other than some of the bosses being disgusting and the gameplay being made to be disgusting, it's not bad. The Final Shape concludes Destiny's 10 year Light and Darkness saga in a satisfactory way. Story landed with the player base as well as gameplay and loot chase to keep players engaged and having fun. While the expansion is solid it fails to take risks and doesn't evolve the standard looter shooter experience beyond what players have become accustomed to over the years. Fun experience 7/10. Trash game massive cash grab don’t waste your time playing this garbage. Try out Elden ring or something thats actually a game. Destiny 2: The Final ShapeDestiny 2 greets new and returning players with a lengthy montage of the history of the game and then dumps them into a world with no direction as to what they should do and why they should do it. Even for someone who has played all the story missions from each expansion, there is a lot of confusing story that comes from the seasonal pass that Bungie sells. I felt a sense of regret about buying into this game again but also a sense of relief that I can finally put this game to rest and never play it again. The star of The Final Shape is not you the player, Cayde-6, or the big bad guy. The star is the online store. The first tab on the “director” screen is the store. You can buy rewards to make your player character look like less of a space hobo, season passes that come with better weapons, and tiny increments of story to keep this hamster wheel turning. If you have fully accepted out dystopian world of live service gaming, you might say this expansion is fantastic. But if you are like me and see all of this monetization as garbage that ruins a game, you will say that no matter how good this expansion could be, it is saddled by garbage. (It also hurts that everything you worked for in prior games is meaningless. Your guns and the clothing you liked are all obsolete, again, so you have the incentive to keep buying more.) The limits of live service is no better shown in the inability to pause the game. If you need to stop and help your kid or take a phone call, you’ll have to replay the mission from the start. Ten years into Destiny and this is still a problem. The story of The Final Shape starts off in a confusing way. The setup occurs off screen unless you also bought all of the prior season content. You cant buy that seasonal content now. If you missed this part of the story, the best you can do is watch it on YouTube. There is a lot of talk about “paracausal” things and other gobbledygook. The main point is that there is one bad guy who wants to use “the light” to turn the universe into an abstract painting. The campaign ends with a title card that says “THE FINAL BATTLE WITH THE WITNESS APPROACHES”. What a ridiculous ending for the end of a 10 year saga. I’m sure this means the story won’t really be resolved unless you grind levels for the 6 player raid and buy more season passes. My first thought about the gameplay is that we are ten years into this game and nothing much has changed. In fact, I would love to go back to the original Destiny when my player character could revive himself from death and hammer enemies with a sniper rifle that generated its own ammo. The new mechanic for The Final Shape is pressing down on the joysticks (L3 + R3) when a meter bar fills up. This gives you “chromatic” power. Although that sounds amazing, what it really means is that you can now damage “chromatic”. It’s not near as fun as blasting enemies with a black hole or zapping them with lightning. The Final Shape has some rough edges. One early mission required me to collect some kind of psionic dropping to open a lock. I couldn’t find them anywhere. Looking up the issue, certain enemies where supposed to leave paionic droppings when you shoot them, but it wasn’t working for me. Aside of game breaking bugs like this, a lot of encounters appear to made for groups of players and not solo players like me. Some enemies knock you off cliffs to your death. Others, like the “Tormentor” can insta-kill you. And because the game still has enemies that teleport everywhere, you can’t play this tactically. This still isn’t Halo. I’m glad this is The Final Shape, because this will be the last of Destiny that I will ever play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i can't say much except that it is better than square enix games that always disappoint and even crashed the stock market.. The best DLC ever, the campain is immersive,the prismatic is the best thing this game deserved. It was an okay DlC. Plenty of activities to do and new areas that look gorgeous but feels like another copy and paste formula for Destiny DlCs I would rate this higher, but a lot of people forget how expensive this DLC is. The base price is expensive enough but vetrans never mention the running cost of all other DLC, du geon keys etc to lead up to this. I mention this because everyone says it's the ultimate 10 year conclusion. So after dropping over £250 for this final showdown I do expect more and its a realistic factor that no one talks about. This was not worth the overall price tag even though it was a fitting end. It was ok, really didn’t enjoy the final boss of the campaign. Avoid this while shooting this, but don’t stay here too long as you have to shoot the floating orbs, got cover no you don’t lets string you up while the other guy one shots you so you start the whole 20 minute process again the first part of which you have to repeat every single time. It just was not fun at all there was no elation on finally downing him just relief it was over. I love a good shooter, love me some hard shooting mechanics like Doom Eternal. But in its 7 year destiny 2s mechanics don’t play well together they feel bolted together rather than complementary and it just made for a bit of a slog through some admittedly pretty levels. Veterans may love it but I didn’t find much great about the package at all.. Played for 10 years to end up back at square 1 Stupid story, light grinding, FOMO game events, time locked content ****. Think about it... they got rid of light grinding only to bring it back in a worse way!!! They get rid of 1 resource we gather just to add 3 new ones.... They've proven they are stuck in a rut they have no idea how to get out of and it's ruined the game!. I think it's one of the best expansion I have played. The raid is a great challenge. Can't wait to see how the rest of Act 1 plays out.. People be rating this lower than a 10 cuz of server issues grow up the game is the best it has been for a while it’s great. The Final Shape is a decent expansion, but not great. The Final Shape offers very little from ""expanding"" the game besides adding new content. Unlike previous Destiny expansions, The Final Shape does not rework fundamental systems in the game, nor does it add PvP or Gambit maps, and only 1 strike. So after the campaign, the game feels like a lot like the same game before the DLC released. For example, Lightfall introduced Guardian Ranks, Loadouts, Mods 2.0, Armor mods no longer energy specific, simplified crafting materials, and many more. But most people that buy the expansion pretty much only play the campaign. So how is it? The Final Shape is heavily marketed as the closing chapter to the Light and Dark saga where we go inside the Traveler to defeat the Witness after the events of the previous expansion, Lightfall, which was considered a ""bad"" campaign. Compared to Lightfall, the Final Shape campaign is a lot better. But compared to past expansions, the Final Shape's campaign has an average story, although great gameplay. The first half or 4 missions of the campaign is spent getting the Vanguard crew back together. During this, the narrative progresses at a snail pace that's tugging at nostalgia. You spend the next mission and three lost sectors chasing a lead to the Witness, that turn up empty. So now it's been 5 missions and 3 lost sectors, and the story has not progressed significantly. In the strike and last two missions, Zavala goes on his own, disobeying advice from everyone around him, even his own ghost. Zavala receives a a hint on how to defeat the Witness. Then it's the final mission. So the narrative does not move the needle until the strike and last two missions, then it's over. Unlike previous expansions, the villain is not ""defeated"" at the end of the campaign. At the end of the campaign, you only ""scratch"" the Witness. The Witness is saved later for the raid. Many people will not experience the raid, so it will feel very disconnected that in one minute you scratched the Witness. The next minute, someone else weakened the Witness so much that now ""we"" can land the final blow. As an activity, Excision is just meant to be an epilogue, and feels like D-Day with 12 players. Narratively, it's just meant to be ""good vibes"" and triumphant that you're reaching the end. The way we defeat the Witness is by channeling light through our Ghost to form beams that defeat the Witness. Which is such a mickey mouse way of defeating the supervillain of the franchise. The Witness, which is supposed to be like Destiny's version of Thanos, feels like a 1-dimensional character that's only motivation is to destroy life in every universe. Throughout the campaign, the Witness does not get any development, and has one of the least threatening auras ever. The Witness does not even look cool either and feels harmless. Although Prismatic is a new subclass, it does not feel like anything new because it's just a combination of the existing subclasses, and made very strong. The Dread is a cool and different faction, but does not get enough of the spotlight because many of the enemies present in the campaign are still the Taken, Scorn, and Shadow Legion. As a backdrop for the campaign, the Pale Heart captures the aesthetic gradual change of the Traveler's influence to the Witness's influence perfectly. As a patrol zone, The Pale Heart is one of the least enjoyable ones. There are very few secrets, Overthrow is a terrible activity that mashed every public event together with only 3 players instead of 9. And the normal public events types are completely gone/replaced. Doing cysts for the first time is cool, but the gameplay loop of doing Cysts and Overthrow for ""Alone In the Dark"" is a slog, and might be one of the worst things I've ever played. The Pale Heart does not come close to the Dreaming City, the Dreadnaught, or Savathun's Throne World Compared to some of the best Destiny expansions, the older expansions would also have a good story, but with an exciting villain. It would also have a great patrol space (maybe even 2) with many secrets, a fun 9 player public patrol zone activity, multiple strikes, multiple pvp maps, a dungeon, and massive quality of life changes, and fundamental system reworks that significantly improve the game. Making it feel like the game got ""expanded/upgraded"". The Final Shape gives us a rushed conclusion to the light and dark saga. As an overall package, The Final Shape does not come close to some of Destiny's best expansions like The Taken King, Forsaken, or Witch Queen. Somehow, the community is willing to blind themselves into thinking an average expansion is the best expansion ever in Destiny history. After Lightfall and Bungie layoffs, the Destiny community was in such low morale and had so much negative sentiment. People probably don't want to reexperience that and cause their favorite franchise to fail from bad reviews. Also the Witness final boss mechanics are so mid.. It's a must play, especially for veteran players but new players are not left behind either. The story hits hard, the raid is awesome. Adding all the quality of life changes like account power level, fireteam finder etc. made the game so much better. Been playing since D1, this expansion is one of the best things Bungie has created. Ever.. As a veteran player since d1 beta days, I must say that this expansion is a must play! The campaign was epic 10/10 and with the new prismatic subclass the whole game feels different! There is too many activities with is very good!. Honestly, Bungie did very well with this expansion.There have already been efforts regarding the campaign missions: No more linear quests where no one thinks, I really appreciated the little puzzles during the **** story was very good and The Pale Heart is frankly magnificent and seeing all the environments only separated by caves is very cool.Exploring areas is more interesting, Reversal activities are much better than simple public events without thought or **** side quests are much more interesting and once again, I really like the desire to put puzzles, it makes the quests less linear and diversified (a little thought of the mission of Kyst, which are really fun to do).Regarding the episode format, I'm super excited to finally see what Bungie has come up with that isn't directly related to darkness.Echoes finally seem to provide a good story for the Vex, finally developing **** finally, the prismatic subclass is a good idea, which brings together everything we know and combines them, I really like the idea and its **** example, I use the Pathway system which is much more motivating than contracts, for **** for the negative points, there are always a lot of bugs, often which slow down progress and it's frustrating. In addition, there are still a lot of optimization problems on some PCs (even newer ones) and this should not be the case.Finally, server problems are recurring for multiplayer games but for the release of the extension, this deprived some people of the cutscenes, and that should not happen either, not to this **** me, The Final Shape can stand alongside Renegades without problems. Amazing expansion and I can't wait to see what Bungie has in store for the seasons.. Hard to believe, but Bungie really cooked, and it seems they'll be cooking in future episodes.. This is honestly the best expansion to date. Do yourself a favor and play this now!. reall well crafted version, a magnific conclusion to the light adn darkness saga. If you love shooters, sci-fi and loot, then give it a try. If you are new, the community is really friendly to explain the things to you as long as you say it. Of course it would be better to have a friend to explain a few things. And the raids arereally nice, the last one is a blast.. After fumbling with Lightfall,the latest release in Bungie's epic saga shows us why Destiny 2 is the definitive FPS looter shooter. The Final Shape is near perfection in narrative, gameplay, art, design, and replayability. Well done, Bungie. The Final Shape is everything I love about Destiny and more. The campaign had an extremely solid story and was a very enjoyable experience, combining the best parts of gameplay and story from prior expansions. The new raid was extremely tough as I and my team attempted the day 1 raid and we didnt even pass the first encounter and the worlds first became the longest in Destiny history. All the new exotics and returning favorites feel fresh and the sandbox has never felt better, genuinely the best time to be a Destiny player right now, everything The Final Shape has added has been a positive and had no drawbacks minus servers on day 1. I cannot recommend playing it enough.. This is what i wanted! Great story and even better gameplay. Didn't think i would be so back to destiny 2.. This what Destiny 2 deserves. The perfect DLC that we are waiting for as a player. The ending is crazy cool and has a heart full meaning of what are characters has gone through from beginning to end. A great Expansion and the end of the light-dark saga. My favourite game off time gets a great expansion....what else is there to say!. Perfect ending, for one of my favorite game. Graphics are insane and the story is very good. I recommend!!. The story is recycled, as is most of the content. I do not feel that we achieved anything significant during the 10-year journey. The good part is the boss battles this time. They are challenging and mixed with cool mechanics.. These day 1 reviews are just complete crap. For a soap opera story that is crap 2/10. There's is no real threat or purpose. To spice up Destiny the devs just add stupid timers so you have to repeat something more times and hate it more. Everything that gets put into destiny is just a thing appears without any prompt so you go clear some overthrows and then randomly you get something that unlocks a quest that you have to repeat several times on a timer. Who asked for timers? It's not hard other than contest stuff and it's just annoying how often quests are like go do 50 lost sectors and we'll give you a skiff. The only thing that is good so far is the excision. If you are a youtuber, sure destiny can be your job. If not it's only going to bring you misery with terrible drop rates and devs that don't care about their community, only their youtubers.. Bungie created a masterpiece to end the light and dark saga. The final cut scene is an emotional end to a stellar campaign that will be remembered for years to come. No matter your expectations, they will be exceeded.. The best expansion so far. Destiny finally tells the story as it deserves and is accompanied by a perfect gameplay.Bungie needs to continue trusting its dev team and not let the company's commercial pressures affect Destiny again. Content rich expantion, good story, art and level design. Insane raid and duo missions, i love it.. Best dlc ever great raid great story. i liked the story and gameplay is quite nice now. Day 1 raid salvations edge was a banger, very difficult could not complete day 1 but still i respect the raid.. I honestly love what they've done with this DLC. It was executed well and it hits in all the correct spots. However, I feel like they should have had something to replace Legendary Shards rather than just remove them completely, it feels like Glimmer is almost impossible to earn at the moment. And with it being a new season AND new LL, a lot of players are going to be spending a lot of Glimmer on either upgrading their weapons and armour to buying the 10 Threader Bounties from ADA which are 10k alone.. Incredible DLC, the new subclass is more than just fun, it allows players to think differently when making a build, were not forced to use one element for our weapons, the story is not What I Was expecting, it was better,PvP and gameplay change are moah **chef kiss**. This is THE game to be played with friends and have a fun time. I've been playing this game since beyond light and it's epic how much this game keeps changing. As a person who plays a lot of competitive shooters this game is a breath of fresh air.... Just one word bungie loves what it creates despite it all. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Challenging and rich gameplay conveys a profound, moving storyline, rounded out with fantastic graphics & soundtrack. A loveletter to the game and the fans that makes me extremely hopeful for its future. Simply Bungie's best work so far.. You'd have to be a destiny player to understand how impactful and great this DLC is, it is packed with content, and there's more to come with the episodes. Bungie absolutely cooked up something great! An amazing raid. New subclass that combines light and dark subclasses, new exciting exotic weapons and armor, new easier leveling systems, cross character power, fireteam power, better UI, amazing story, and the pale heart which is full of fun mechanics from raids and dungeons... players wants and needs have been recognized by Bungie and they delivered us a complete package.. As someone who has played this game for nearly a decade, this is the expansion Bungie has gotten right at every level. Enjoy it guardians.. Bungie makes their best content when they have their backs against the wall and this DLC was no different. After Lightfall's weak launch the story of Final Shape has a well built narrative with actual emotional moments. In terms of content this DLC also has a vast array of things to do, from the normal expected campaign and raid - to multiple exotic missions, a two player ""mini-raid"" type mission, a new patrol zone with new activities and collectibles - and so much more. Hopefully Bungie can keep their momentum and build the next DLC with the same level of quality (they tend to go back and forth). Or even a Destiny 3 ;). Don't listen to the trolls who gave this a 0/10. This entire DLC is a literal banger!. Most bad reviews are about the game servers being bad on day one. It’s an MMO mate. That happens on day 1. The best story ever from Bungie. The new subclass is very good and gives plenty of options to create a lot of builds. The raid is very hard but i understand because its the end of the saga. Believe me, its better than The Taken King, Forsaken and even The Witch Queen! If you are curious to play Destiny 2, alone or with friends, now its time to do that.. The best way that Bungie could complete the Destiny saga taking into account all the retcons and nonsense added over the years through scam expansions. They did a great job and you have to admit it, the level of art direction is off the charts, the level of challenge is quite high, in legend difficulty you swear a lot and the gimmicks during the campaign is quite varied. If you're a fan of destiny from the first hour, you can't miss this content.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best dlc best raid great ending to the saga to put my review: wedf0okwetkorpg. TFS delivers on a satisfying conclusion to the first 10 years of Destiny's story. Gameplay builds off the success of Witch Queen and even the overall subpar Lightfall, with the introduction of the prismatic subclass spicing up the combat in the most brilliant campaign we've had to date. Iconic characters such as Cayde, Zavala and Ikora get a lot of time in the spotlight for the campaign, and their individual struggles assist in pushing the narrative forward in meaningful ways throughout. Veteran and more experienced players of the game have plenty of hard content to sink their teeth into, with the excellent-as-always legend campaign followed by the most difficult raid Bungie has ever created. New players on the other hand have a low barrier to entry in the current state of the game, with quality of life improvements having been implemented in the previous content update with Into the Light. However, with the culmination of the Light and Darkness saga coming to a close, the amount of context needed to experience this concluding expansion in its full glory can be intimidating to anyone new to the game or coming back from a long hiatus. The state of the game may be far from perfection given a rocky past year, but this is definitely the best piece of content Destiny has ever had in its 10 year saga.. I've played since D1 and told myself to wait for a sale. Picked the game up since a couple of my friends seemed to be enjoying it and I should have trusted my wait for a sale philosophy. I've never played a expansion to a game with such little NEW content. How are people not noticing every asset was reused. The campaign used the mechanics from previous raids so nothing new there. The prismatic subclass had to be Sony telling them to get the game out the door so they can work on Marathon. I've never played a Destiny expansion where the love for the game by the devs felt so dead as it does in the final shape. I honestly believe every positive review is just a sigh of relief from that player so they can move on and giving it a bad review or not enjoying it, wouldn't let them have the closure they need to move on. I would put money that we will see the player base drop harder and faster than any other expansion once the excitement of finishing the light and dark saga has passed. I also think this expansions reviews will drop a lot over time as the rose tent glasses fade.. Simply put the best expansion they have ever released. Somehow against expectations they have landed a satisfiying finale to a 10 year long saga. Also ignore the 0 point trolls who. I guess the review bombing is their way of coping with a sad life. Igonore those haters. This is Destiny. Best story, Best gameplay. New abilities are powerful and contents are worth to buy.. incredible story, lots of changes in gameplay, ambiance of the new location is incredible and simply the best raid in D2. Simply awesome, storytelling is great, graphics are good, new exotics and weapons are excellent. Amazing!. Why is the game so difficult and stuffy? Why pumping at all? Who is this game aimed at now? a waste of time and money... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Average. They sort of concluded the story, but in typical fashion didn't really because they want you to keep playing for more years. It's just another typical Destiny expansion though. Lot of tedious quests. Pointless leveling. Mindless grinding. But now with no greater purpose it feels like. Wait for a sale if you can. Wasn't that impressed. Don't buy into the hype.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game has only gotten worse, stupid difficulty and tedious tasks that you could farm before and now you get tired to do it at least once... the prismatic is just a trigger for you to buy this dlc but it is useless!! everyone was nerfed before this so that ( just a business. I just couldn’t play this add-on due to the servers being down all day and issued a refund, I don’t think I’ll return to this game again!. who is this game aimed at now? why has it become complicated and incomprehensible, you will have to spend even more time getting anything in this game, nothing new, just a reuse of all the mechanics and weapons that were in the game but they were taken away from us... I don’t I can't have any more fun in this game, you are literally not allowed!!! I'm tired of having to take too long to do anything... it's not fun and it takes away from the game... I'm upset with almost all the changes in this game.. Bungie seems to finally learn from it's mistakes right as they end the 10 year long journey in the 'light and dark saga' of Destiny. Let me be clear, they haven't reinvented the wheel, it's very much still Destiny in it's core. The high-budget cutscenes are a welcome addition to the narrative even if the story doesn't set a new standard in gaming. This is a nicely paced, emotional and intriguing end of this chapter, combined with the silky smooth gameplay and abundance of activities (I'd even say the most we've ever seen in Destiny) the franchise has been known for. If they decide to continue the story and make a third game, this should be the bar they set themselves.. bungie unfortunately keeps reintroducing the shadowkeep-style mini-expansion formula... clearly they can't make it + keep up, clearly they left a group of junior devs to update the project, clearly they didn't leave destiny in the hands of junior devs to do marathon... at this point I can only hope that they abbadon destiny as soon as possible before unveiling their new mmo.... The best dls in the history of Destiny 2. It brought a lot of new developments to the gameplay, added a ton of content. Separately, it is worth praising the high-quality plot in the supplement, which completed the confrontation of the saga of light with darkness. Best expansion ever. Story, new loot, new powers, Raid and destination are all amazing!. This is, bar none, the best expansion Bungie has ever created and one of the best experiences I've ever had in gaming. The story is nothing short of perfect. Characters are fully fleshed out and masterfully voiced (RIP Lance, thank you Keith), the destination is beautifully rendered, and the plot threads all wrap up into an ending that rips your heart out and then puts it back together with the Light. On the gameplay side, Prismatic is a whimsical subclass that enables buildcrafting that you've never even considered before, and the weapons have fun and diverse perk pools. The healing auto rifle and the rocket sidearm are particularly notable. The exotics aren't anything game-breaking, but they buff Prismatic in dynamic ways that expand buildcrafting even further. All-in-all, a masterpiece from start to finish. Thank you for everything,","despite a delayed launch, Destiny 2: The Final Shape proves to be a satisfying expansion . the story, filled with emotional moments, complements the action, focusing on character development . endgame content, including new subclasses and missions, provides solid challenges and rewards ."
45.The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"I keep forgetting this game exists. I have only played it on the Wii which might be part of the problem. I had fun playing through and 100%ing it but really only thought it was a mediocre game. I also don't really care for story in games and the constant cutscenes really just aggravated me if anything. I should probably learn the lore since I was really confused about Midna through the whole thing. (she's definitely one of my least favorite Zelda characters). Fantastic Zelda experience and fully of atmosphere but dungeons can be overly simplistic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If someone were to ask me one day “what do you think is the best example of art in video games?”, I'd answer without the slightest hint of doubt The legend f Zelda Twillight Princess. This game is the quintessence not only of the Zelda series, but of video games as a whole. Personally, this game is flawless. Whether it's the music itself, melodious, melancholy, harmonious, depressive, joyful or terrifying, it all has an energy and a desire to be perfect. Then there's the world building, simple but effective and instantly recognizable; the arid, mystical Gerudo desert, the icy mountains of the White Peaks, the life of the town of Hyrule, the vast plains of Hyrule or the peaceful forests of Firone... Not to mention the temples, iconic to the Zelda series. Not since the prodigious Ocarina of Time have we had such well-constructed temples, in terms of puzzle design, the beauty of the rooms or the lore of each of these dungeons. The Tower of Judgment, the Abyssal Temple, the Goron Mines or the legendary Hyrule Castle, never has a temple been so imposing, exciting to explore and epic in its design or combat (the climb up to the castle's throne room while battling Darknut will forever be remembered as one of the game's best). And what can I say about the terrible monsters to be found deep within these temples? I'm repeating myself once again, but never have the bosses been so terrifying or so accomplished. What's more, this game also marks the return of one of the video game's most illustrious antagonists, Ganondorf, in his human guise. It's also in this game that we realize just how much the dark style of the game fits the character: the mature air of Link and Zelda, the terror inspired by Ganondorf, even secondary characters like Rutela the Queen of the Zora or the Yetis are **** end this review, which is already far too long lmao, I'd simply say that Zelda Twillight Princess is not only a pillar of the series, but also a video game icon alongside its ancestor OCarina of Time. PS: If you read all of that, well first thank you very much to take time to do it and secondly, if you havent play this game, buy a wii just for it (or a wiiu idc) its here that Zelda peaked for the second time. My all time favorite Zelda game. The story is great. the music is absolutely amazing and Midna is very funny. the controls do **** but are easily passable the character designs for Link Zelda and Midna are especially good. So if you can look passed the controls and graphics you are going to love this one. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is easily top 3 zelda games, the gameplay is so much fun, the story is arguably the best in the zelda series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A colossal disappointment dressed up as a game. Let’s start with the aesthetic: it attempts to be ‘dark,’ but all it delivers is a blur of browns and grays. Nintendo completely lost its way trying to create something 'mature,' and the result is a world that feels lifeless. The game is dead inside!And Midna? Oh, the supposed great ally of Link! She’s just an unbearable version of Navi, filled with annoying dialogue and a character arc that goes nowhere. Instead of being helpful, she only brings frustration, turning every interaction into a true chore!If you thought the story was going to innovate, think again! It's the same tired formula from Ocarina of Time. Saving the princess again? Seriously? Ganondorf shows up like it’s something fresh, but it’s just another cliché! This repetition got old a long time ago!And Hyrule Field? What should be a vibrant space turns out to be an empty desert, devoid of interesting NPCs or activities. It feels like the world was cut in half! There’s nothing that makes you feel like part of the adventure!If you genuinely believe Twilight Princess is a masterpiece, you’re mistaken. It’s a collection of frustrations, clichés, and a soulless world that makes the franchise feel like an echo of what it once was.. Taking the Ocarina of Time formula and enhancing it above and beyond to be bigger, darker, harder, and more cinematically dazzling, Twilight Princess ranks among the finest Zelda entries even to this day, but the almost lack of Zelda herself is kind of a bummer, plus the Wii version's forced motion control over the sword swings can get tedious with time, even with the pointer controls turned off.. Perhaps my favorite game ever made, this is what I consider to be the ultimate Zelda experience. It's literally Ocarina of Time but better in every way. I cannot think of any flaws. 11/10. Twilight Princess is an excellent game with darker themes and designs with a compelling story and fun **** Zelda team should definitely make more games like this.. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a masterpiece that brilliantly combines captivating storytelling, rich world-building, and engaging gameplay. Its darker, more mature tone sets it apart, while the beautifully designed dungeons and challenging puzzles offer a satisfying experience. With stunning graphics, memorable characters, and an epic soundtrack, Twilight Princess is a must-play for any Zelda fan or lover of adventure games.. The Zelda formula at its greatest. Epic story, great gameplay. Play it. You won't regret it.. This is what The Legend of Zelda should be like. The soundtrack is super good and always fits when you are in Faron Woods relaxing ominous music plays when you are fighting a bunch of bokoblins that has taken over a hidden village an epic cowboy-like music plays. The start of the game is very slow but I don't think it's that bad, the slow start lets you get known with the characters and care about them. All the dungeons are awesome, you need to actually think you can't, just look at a puzzle and know what the solution is. None of the dungeons are bad. All of the bosses are easy but good, there is one time when you fight a dragon, dragon fights have been done a lot of times in other games but Nintendo nailed that one, Nintendo nailed all of the boss fights but that one was very memorable to me. Midna has a lot of personality and is easily the best Zelda companian. People say that Link is too edgy in this game and I can see what they are talking about but it is not that bad, I also want to call him cool and i shall call him cool Link is cool but he is every game he appears in I love this game so much i bought Wind Waker and thought this game was the best but after I played Twilight Princess I think of this game as the superior Gamecube Zelda. I love Wind Waker just like any other Zelda game but Twilight Princess is better and longer... in my opinion. Twilight Princess is the definition of Epic. I wanted to finish the review now but there are a few things that i want to add. They should've added the ability to skip to day or night or just speed up time, many things are only available in the daytime, and waiting for day takes forever. The graphics of Wind Waker are cool but Nintendo has just abandoned Zelda with realistic graphics, without cel-shading. I would definitely not be sad if the next Zelda does not have cel-shading.. I FREAKING HATE THIS GAME, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL, WHY COULDNT THEY HAVE JUST MADE WIND WAKER 2. This game is the first of the class, it doesn't bring something huge as the new era like Ocarina of Time, but everything he does, it's doing it over the top, every thing it tryna do it's done more than perfectly.This is an OoT copycat but its copying it so much better that it forgets to be less good. Twilight Princess is just pure gold, this game is such a good Zelda. Big recommendation, and Midna is the best companion in any video game ever by the way.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even if this game could be described as crimping off the success of ocarina of time, I still think Twilight Princess is one of my personal franchise favorites. I know people hated the dark tone of this game, claiming it makes the game feel weirdly edgy. Personally I loved the dark atmosphere and thought it added an interesting spice to the experience. Story wise this game is the same formula with a delusion twinge. I will note the side kick character is infinitely better in this game than the ones in the other games. She has a full blown backstory that is well explored and even plays a great part in the games narrative. I will say I was absolutely disappointed with what they did with the villains in this story. The new antagonist is pretty creepy and threatening, perfectly matching this games tone; which makes it extremely unfortunate that near the end of the game he gets sidewinded in favor for Gannondorf. To this day I still think they should have had the more interesting villain be the main one. This game is A-grade in its dungeon design with the way you combine item uses to solve puzzles. This is where the atmosphere of the game shines like a bright star, creating excellent environments and memorable moments. The boss fights are an extremely mixed bag unfortunately. Some a really cool, whilst others are painfully forgettable. But if you cut out the cruddy boss fights and re arranged the stories villains, then Twilight Princess could have very well been the perfect 3D Zelda game.. Easily the best game to ever game of all time. Dungeons, story and exploration is all peak. I want to eat this game.. First Zelda game. Good story back in the days, though like every other Zelda games, it did not live up to “95” standard.. My favorite Zelda game no doubt in my mind. It has (in my opinion) the best boss fights, combat, end credits and art style to name a few. PLEASE BRING THIS TO THE SWITCH.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Honestly, Twilight Princess is the most underrated game of the entire franchise, and in my opinion it's the best one. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Overrated zelda game: story got ruined at the end because they had to shove in ganon, overworld is garbage, so many boring fetch quests in the main story and super toxic community.. A Cinematic Masterpiece! The Character Developement of Midna is Fantastic as well as the story is fantastic! A True Masterpiece. best videogame of all time for me! Great story with one fo the best companies of all time (midna) and one of the best villains (zant). One of the best games I ever played. The graphics are the perfect balance between dark and beautiful, the sound/nunchuk effects are really on point with the scenes, and the bgm doesn't disappoint in comparison to other tloz games. The story is really emotional, and the way the characters change with you makes you fall in love with them. Personally, I like how the Triforce is portrayed here, and it's connection with TLOZ Ocarina Of Time. Kinda wished we could see how the Twilight people ended up, but that's okay. First game of the series I played, I highly recommend it if you never played TLOZ!. Using the wolf's sense to see the Twilight Realm is a ghastly, beautiful effect to be sure, but contributes little to the player's sense of discovery, save for a few holes to dig or making a few jumps that would otherwise be impossible.. Amazing story and very good dungeons. Graphics don't hold up as well but not so terrible.. Perfect, every single bit of this Game is perfect from an Interesting and Immersive Story to the absolutely fantastic Gameplay. This Game has everything I would want from a Zelda and I played through it multiple Times. It never gets boring and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess definitely my favorite Game of All Time.. One of my first video game ever. I love the dungeons, the story is great, characters are amazing and the gameplay was revolutionary for it's time. Clearly one of the bests Zelda games.. God tier Zelda game! I still have deciding which is my favorite between this and Majora’s Mask.. Brilliant game. If I could, I'd give it around 8.5 points. The design wasn't quite to my taste.. The atmosphere is really different from the norm the series has established. The characters are really well developped and this game has left me with a strong feeling of emptyness after finishing it.. Music goes hard. One of my favorite games of all time, the legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an incredible experience with heart warming story, amazing combat and tricky puzzles, i love this game and will play it over and over again forever.. An absolute masterpiece. This game is truly exceptional, providing hours of engrossing gameplay in the main story alone. It ranks as my second favorite Zelda game, right behind Majora's Mask. It excels in delivering both emotion and action, making it a superb action-adventure experience.. An excellent follow up to the Wind Waker. This game has excellent gameplay with a good story and engaging characters, to incredible exploration, to solid combat, another great Zelda title.. Now that we are in 2023, this one is one of the better Zelda games compared to TOTK, BOTW, and Skyward Sword, however it wasn't as good as the Zelda games that came before and replaying the remastered version had some nostaligic value but reminded me of how it didn't capture the old magic. The combat is a little clunky, the new characters like Midna are decent at best, but overall the dungeons are nice to explore, there is plenty to do and it feels like a Zelda game.. My favorite Zelda game, quite possibly my favorite game of all time. The darker tone and dramatic story work amazing, and the graphics are stellar for a wii Launch title. It has some of the most interesting dungeons and Items that don't reappear in the series. Even the motion controls work well.. This to me is simply the greatest game of all time. Allow me to explain why: To get the obvious out of the way… YES of course nostalgia bias is going to play some small part towards my feelings. That is only natural, this was my first 3D Zelda experience way back when it launched for the Wii. I was just a kid, that had no idea that a game could even be structured outside of level progression, let alone probe my emotions. What I would say to counter this nostalgia bias is that I have played a lot of games throughout my life, many of which when I was young. I have fond memories of several of them and still consider some among my favourites to this day. But none, absolutely none come close to Twilight Princess. Each and every time I have replayed this masterpiece as I’ve grown older, it has only reaffirmed its illustrious status in my mind; only getting better and more layered with each revisit. The story is just… wow. I’ve never felt so invested in a narrative before. What they are able to do with Link here is staggering. Work is cut out for making a silent protagonist work in a dramatic story, and it is handled with such care and nuance here that I almost forgot that he was a mute. Every expression on his face tells a story, in every context he finds himself in. It is never in question what he is motivated by and how his perception of those around him changes as his responsibility grows in scale. Midna is the true front runner here though. Such a mischievous, self serving character that becomes so much more. It’s not a new phenomenon of character writing, but I’ve never seen it done so carefully and effectively as it is here. The way her and Link’s relationship blooms from a means to each others ends to an unbreakable bond of trust is such a wonderful journey to watch unfold. It feels so human and natural. Zelda as a consequence does take a back seat, but even her scarce few appearances are wholly impactful and necessary to the greater narrative. Link’s relationship with his fellow villagers is set up so nicely in a superb introductory section that serves as a truly perfect tutorial / setting opener. The tutorial aspect is hidden so effectively behind the characters and solving their day to day struggles. It’s a brilliant balance between teaching us the core gameplay tenets as well as setting the stage and getting us invested. Couldn’t be more perfect. The sudden scope and scale introduced through the Twilight invasion is so abrupt, visceral and eye opening. It’s such a slap to the face after the sedate opening. Immediately brings tension, intrigue and desire to answer the call to adventure to save those that Link (and by extension - YOU) care about. All of that before I’ve even mentioned the gameplay. It’s completely fantastic. I’ve heard many people speak negatively about it’s similarities to Ocarina of Time. To that end, I couldn’t disagree more. Sure, there are some call backs and some locational similarities… but that’s the case for all of the games. It’s the same franchise! The game is fundamentally so different from OoT. (This is not to belittle OoT, as that too is a masterpiece that I love. Just a comparison that I think is misplaced and annoys me.) This game is so grand in scope, the journey to each temple an adventure in its own right and the temples themselves? Ingenious. Such a brilliant blend of combat challenge, intuitive superbly designed puzzles and excellent, satisfying boss encounters. The combat is first class. Even the fundamentals are great fun, thrusts slashes, jump attacks, spins, all of the core mechanics were familiar with but with a dash of improvement and superior animations. The hidden skills are the true bread and butter though. They add so much flair and depth to the systems both visually and mechanically. It’s so much fun to mess around with. The music is transcendent. The soothing and lightly melancholic tones of Faron Woods to the bustling, forward march of Hyrule field and the ominous groans of the temples… masterclass. Not to mention that little theme that plays whenever you’re wailing on a boss’ weak point - gives me chills to this day. Zant is a superb red herring antagonist, that provides a great active threat for Link, routinely foiling and sabotaging progression. A very unique and nuanced character indeed that surprised me at every turn. Ganondorf is of course the puppet master and while his introduction is late into the game… it hits all the harder because of it and the intrigue only grows as a result. I dare say anything else for those that (for whatever ungodly reason) haven’t played this game yet. To me, this game encapsulates everything that a game should be. It’s an absolute triumph in every sense of the word.. Best Zelda game ever. It has everything that makes a great Zelda game. Go and play too see for yourself. Piece of art, this have very good story to tell, more games like this please.. Absoluetly a master class ****. Expert story of thrilling moments, emotion combat and puzzles. Prepare for an epic adventure with big suprises and amazing bosses. Weapons that are some of the most fun and uniqe. A game with a very mature art style but with a alsowarm too with its bueatiful songs. One of Nintendos greatest games in years and still holds up today as one of the best games ever. If you want to be an awe of such a amazing game, great combat, puzzles and twist and turns and adventure this is the game for you. Rate a 9.9 out of 10.. First Zelda game and IT IS AWSOME:First Zelda game and IT IS AWSOMEFirst Zelda game and IT IS AWSOMEFirst Zelda game and IT IS AWSOMEFirst Zelda game and IT IS AWSOMEFirst Zelda game and IT IS AWSOME. My favorite Zelda game. It has some of the best dungeons, bosses and items in the series and it's story is also pretty good for a Zelda game. It has aged, but it is still a masterpiece.. Alot of people say that it's bad because the start is slow, but for me the start is great being slow since it makes me care more for the **** dungeons are one of the best this franchise has ever seen and the OST is truly **** only problem with the game is the ending but overall an amazing game.. Another great-looking, varied and immersive adventure in the Zelda series. I'm not the biggest fan of the Wii control system but here it works well.. Best Zelda game of all time. Rollgoal might be a nightmare with the motion controls, but that is just an optional thing so it doesn't count. Story spot on, Soundtrack spot on, Characters spot on, most Dungeons spot on. The definitive Zelda experience, no matter the system.. I mean it's a tloz game so i don't have to explain anything just play it.... Words could not possibly describe just how much adoration I have for this game.. Amazing game, a must play. It is a dark Zelda game with the best side kick in the series.. one of the best Zelda games in my opinion. Everything about this game is amazing, amazing story, amazing and cool characters, amazing environments and atmosphere, and also just really fun to play through countless of times.. By far the best 3D legend of Zelda game. It has a good world,art style,bosses,and many more. An excellent game with an even more excellent soundtrack. The whole soundtrack is a tour de force from start to finish, and easily the best soundtrack of any Zelda game made. The soundtrack is full of epic and guttural themes, and even a hauntingly beautiful night field theme.. This game is a masterpiece, but I prefer the gamecube version because of the controls. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I am a huge fan of the Zelda franchise, and I was very excited when I heard about this game on the Wii; I must say that the game delivered a grander adventure than I ever dreamed it could of. The story of Twilight Princess (I won't spoil any of it for those who haven't played it) is simply breathtaking, it has heart and emotion; the script for the game was marvelous, the whole story was just very cinematic and magical. A great addition to the story is being able to play as Link when he transforms into a wolf, and that is all I'll say about it, it's really fun. The biggest concern from most gamers were the controls which after playing the game are just perfectly suited for the Zelda franchise, swinging the wiimote as a sword never gets old. One of the greatest things about the game is the wide array of side quests. Zelda has always been known for its many side quests and this one delivers, you will be playing this game long after you've finished it to complete them all. Finally the graphics are just superb and need to be seen in action to believe. This is a Zelda adventure that appeals to both old fans and new, it moves the franchise forward into shining new directions without alienating the old fans. I have played many of the big games on the Wii like Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime 3 and I must say that I still enjoyed this game the most thus far. This is the best game on the Wii. A perfect 10/10!. Twilight Princess is in many ways more Ocarina of Time, and while this is not inherently a bad thing, the formula does being to wear a bit thin. The wolf sections in Twilight Princess -- which take the place of the dark world from A Link to the Past and the time travel mechanic from Ocarina of Time -- also leave something to be desired. Having said all of that, the core Zelda blueprint in Twilight Princess still makes for a superior action/adventure game.. One of the best Zelda to my taste, as it has a dark atmosphere and very mature to be a Zelda, its strongest points are the gameplay, music and art style, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enter this incredible world called The Legend Of Zelda.. A stark contrast from the cartoony world of windwaker, LOZ: TP heralded in Link’s first foray into motion control sword swinging and slingshot aiming in one of the darkest tales in the series. Of course wii-mote waggling is not always the most intuitive or effective but some expert control decisions (like z-targeting and the AOE attack finisher as Wolf-Link) keep the player engaged and pressing forward throughout this lengthy escapade in Hyrule. Joining Link on the journey is plucky companion Midna who is so sassy and bratty she is hard not to love. Her big jealous-Tinkerbell energy is matched with a compelling backstory that provides context for her behavior and makes it hard not to empathize with her position. Her design as well as the other denizens of the Twilight Realm is some of Nintendo’s most creative. Expert sound design also plays a big element with the music and battle sounds setting a wonderful overall tone. A long introduction and tutorial hampers the opening of the game which feels very drawn out. The only other criticism this reviewer has is with the save system which upon load does not always bring you back exactly where you were (such as loading just outside a dungeon you saved inside) these setbacks are not game breaking but certainly hamper momentum particularly in those dungeons where a route reveals itself through play and trying to get back to the midpoint can be a tricky game of remembering what routes and triggers have already been completed. One of my favorites in the series and don’t ever feel like the interesting things they did with Wolf-Link are talked about enough. If you are a Zelda fan who has not yet embarked on this journey, ready your hero’s tunic and best twilight shawl and you strap in for this incredible adventure.. Perfect game. I love the motion controls and prefer this version over the gc and wii u versions. Only downside with wii is that you dont have second stick to look around, but you'll get used to using the z button to change perspective a lot. I wish more developers made games like this, the scripting and overall development must've taken a long time and they're very skilled.. This was the first Zelda game I played. It's nostalgic to me and gets me emotional every time I think about this game. The music is **** amazing. The **** art, my lord. This game easily has the best character designs of any Zelda game. It's really not even a contest in this department. The story. **** amazing. An other **** amazing feature of this game is Midna, who's easily the best companion of every other Zelda game and a very loveable character. The different temples in this game are also great. The bosses, the puzzles, the designs, everything. I don't think this game gets the credit it deserves from Zelda fans. In my opinion, it's underrated.. I seriously don't get it. How do people hate Skyward Sword but like this game? This game is literally 5 hours of the tedious garbage from Skyward Sword in between every single dungeon in the game. The only saving grace for this game is some incredible dungeons and a beautiful soundtrack.. Great game with immersive story that makes you want to play until the end! And with the addition that you can teleport wherever you want so you don't have to go walking or with Epona. The dungeon design could be better but it's not bad.. My favourite game of all time. I have finished it more than 5 times. I am speechless for this masterpiece. It feels like a greatly improved version of Ocarina of Time. The story is outstanding, and one of the best and darkest in the series and.. ALSO Link transforms into a warewolf. The dungeons are perhaps the best and most difficult from the series or at least equal to Skyward Sword and Majora's Mask. The overworld is astonishing and huge with secrets to explore in every corner and many different interactions with it throught out the story progression. Like the map changing, you uncover new passages and places you didn't even expect etc. As of the gameplay, of course incredibly better than it's predecessors with more technics and moves for your sword, interesting new items and of course the new gameplay with the warewolf Link. Also, the visuals are the most realistic than any other Zelda game and I loved that. And of course, the soundtrack is, well.. Perfection like all Zelda games, nothing new here. I believe Twilight Princess is the best in the series and it's a must play.. This is one hell of a spooky Zelda game, 10/10 extremely addicting !!!!!!!!. A great game, but you gotta admit, those faces can be real weird. The controls are fine, graphics are good, but the fishing is garbage. Easily a great game for fans of the series.. Beep beep Masterpiece alert. Look this game is amazing, I could rate this game 10/10 just for the music alone. The story is full of compelling characters and can be pretty dark and sad from time to time which is a big part of appeal of this game. The overall atmospheres of the game is insane especially in the twilight realm and in the dungeons. Speaking of which those dungeons are the most gratifying thing ever and the pacing in them is perfect. I swear those dungeons are so good even the godamn water one is good. In summary - The music : 10/10 - The world design : 10/10 - The dungeons : 10/10 - The characters : 10/10 - The story : 10/10 - The gameplay : 10/10 - Doggy form : 13/10 What is there to say it's a masterpiece and I am biased. Now go play the game.. Excelent game, it’s the best game I have ever play, the history is so good and it catch my attention since day one. Absolute masterpiece. This game is just outstanding. You'll spend countless hours in just the main story. This is my second favourite Zelda game (closely behind Majora's Mask). This one also has lots of emotion and action. Great action-adventure game.. Amazing game. Some see it as a little annoying given the motion controls and if you feel that way you can play on WiiU, GameCube or the inevitable release of it on switch.. an incredible experience throughout. love the darker and gothic tones, with easily some of the best dungeons in zelda.. Despite the fear to see the Zelda franchise crash by releasing a bad 3-D game 'Zelda Twilight Princess' did a fantastic job. It compiles almost everything we love : an incredible original soundtrack, a great semi-open world, some collectibles, an impressive difficulty curve, the constant feeling of progression, a cool lore, a deep scenario, lovable characters, multiples gadgets and weapons and an profound universe. Of course it also had major flaws like the infamous water temple (yeah, that temple everyone hates), some rigid controls, some hardcore (almost impossible without hints) puzzles and ways to make events trigger. The game also requires an impressive amount of time to complete some ridiculous missions or even if you want to achieve it 100%. The graphics and colours were okay even if top notch for the Wii console. Opponents were varied, boss fights were as epic and challenging as usual. The alternance between 'day' and 'night' worlds is gorgeous and totally matches the universe of the game.. Less innovative than most Zelda games but still a really good game. Fun items, good dungeons & boss fights.. This game is my favorite game of all time. It in my eyes is near perfect. It's one of the games I grew up on and I played it non-stop as a kid and never stopped having fun.. It is my favorite Legend of Zelda game to date. I have well over 100 hours in the game and still come back for more. It has fun dungeons, places to explore, and events. I was pleasantly surprised by the boss battles, they all had their own theme and feel that never got repetitive. This game is a must play.. Twilight Princess is a tough one for me. Don't get me wrong it's a good game and does a lot right, but it has a lot wrong too. It doesn't do anything horrible, but it has some annoying parts to say the least. Let's star","the game is the quintessence not only of the Zelda series, but of video games as a whole . the music itself is melodious, melancholy, harmonious, depressive, joyful or terrifying . the tower of judgment, the abyssal temple, the Goron Mines or the legendary Hyrule Castle are all iconic to the series ."
450.Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition,"****.A.VIDEOGAME.EVER.PERIOD! Its just mindblowing how good this game looks. Besides that, yes, NPC act like bad Actors sometimes, but the the Facial Impressions are again outstanding! The Action, the Gameplay, the whole Idea around the Horizon Franchise is just out of this World. Thank you Guerilla Games!. Terrible optimization on a PC. On medium settings in difficult locations 20-30 fps, for example, in difficult locations in the game Cyberpunk 2077 on ultra I have 50-60 fps. Also, the detail of the game is not thought out. For example, the task when you need to swim underwater, oxygen runs out in a couple of seconds, and where to swim is not clear. The label shows to swim in one direction, I swim there and there is nothing there. Why is it so hard to make normal auxiliary labels? Another thing is that during the battle you sometimes need to turn on the pattern, but this requires the character to stand and not be in the battle and while it is activated the opponent deals a lot of damage. I played the game on PS 5 but deleted it on my PC after 5-7 hours of play. The score is mostly due to terrible optimization. I think this game is not worth the money (right now). Perhaps when everything is repaired, I will dare to play this game again someday. Now at the same time I do not recommend playing this one on the platform of the PC. Its a sequel to the game better than it, horizon zero dawn sure, but it does not mean this game dissapoints. if you want a good looking game, this is by far the best one. A complete improvement from the first game. Alloy feels like she grown a lot as a character. The addition **** is one of the biggest improvement and has made it more difficult to go back to the first game. More machines and a better storyline.. If you look at the bad reviews here, you will notice that almost all of them are from people who have only played the game for a few hours. That's a shame, because the fun starts when reaching the forbidden west after about 5-10 hours (depending on how many side quests etc. you do). The next point where the fun increases immensely is when you finally get your base and the main story really gets going. Of course, you can criticise the game for taking so long to get going, but for me it's still one of the best games ever made! So a word of advice to those who put the game down after a few hours. Give it another chance. You definitely won't regret it. This game is a masterpiece!. I liked this one more than the first, her hints do get annoying after a while though. The tools you get for traversal are great as well. It's a big open world where everything is explorable and I like that. It's rare to get games where jumping in water isn't an instakill. The story picks up right where the other one ends, and if it wasn't intriguing before nothing will change now.. Better story. better graphics. But worse fight mechanics. mouse buttons lag on pc. the combat system (rock paper scissors) is too complicated for me.. Many people don't like Aloy's look, but I happen to like her design. It's everything else in the game that I have problems with. NPCs in this game are the most boring and robotic I've ever seen in any open world games. The entire world is soulless. This game is everything wrong about modern AAA games. The puzzles are badly shoved into the game with Aloy yapping all the time about the hints which is an immediate deal breaker for me in any game with puzzles. It deserved much more criticism than Dragon Age Veilguard and it's insane how it got such a high media score. I can only give this game a higher score if they cut everything else besides fighting mech dinosaurs.. A very well optimized, visually stunning, gameplay-wise advanced game with a great narrative and lovable characters - especially Aloy. Similar to the first game, HFB also captures the social and political problems that may lead to an extinction of humanity very well, and it expand the lore in a well-grounded way.. I LOVE THIS GAME SM ITS THE BEST MOST UNIQUE AND MOST AMAZING GAME TO EXIST. Incredible game! Great story. Great characters. Technically exceptional and should have got a day one release on PC.. I had been looking forward to this game for over two years! I consider Zero Dawn to be a masterpiece of its time, with everything that goes with it. But this trash called Forbidden West is a boring, utterly stupid mess with no atmosphere. The invisible barriers that keep enemies contained are back, people constantly smile at you as if they have some mental disorder or the intellect of a 10-year-old at best. The only fun part was climbing, but that’s not enough to make the game worthwhile. Deleted after 6 hours. A disaster. And this comes from someone who’s been a fan of Guerrilla Games since the PS2 era. But guys, this one is just plain boring.. It was just meh meh experience for me, I dont understand why this game was soo hype. 4h and i'm feed up with this, maybe i will try one more time in future.... Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition has finally made its way to PC, and let me tell you: this game was worth the wait. Building on everything that made Horizon Zero Dawn special, Forbidden West feels like a massive leap forward in every way — from the story to the gameplay and especially the visuals. This Complete Edition also comes loaded with the Burning Shores expansion, adding even more depth and content to an already expansive game.Starting with the visuals: this is easily one of the best-looking games I’ve seen on PC. The world is simply stunning, with environments that range from lush jungles to arid deserts to shimmering coastlines, each packed with intricate details. The game makes fantastic use of lighting, particle effects, and high-res textures, creating a world that feels alive and dynamic. On a high-end rig, Forbidden West is breathtaking, but even on a more modest setup, the optimization is solid, and you’ll still get to enjoy the game’s beauty without too many ****, onto gameplay. Forbidden West improves on Zero Dawn’s already polished mechanics with more fluid combat, additional tools, and better AI. The variety of new machines Aloy encounters — each with unique behaviors, weaknesses, and attack patterns — keeps combat exciting and challenging. The new abilities, such as the Shieldwing glider and the Pullcaster grapple, open up exploration and combat in fresh, strategic ways. Whether you’re sneaking through tall grass or going head-to-head with a towering Thunderjaw, every encounter feels tense and **** story in Forbidden West is where the game truly shines. Aloy’s journey continues, delving deeper into the mysteries of the old world while introducing complex new characters and factions. This time, the stakes feel even higher, with narrative twists that kept me hooked. The side quests, too, are more fleshed out than in Zero Dawn, with characters and stories that feel meaningful rather than simple filler content. The Burning Shores expansion, included in the Complete Edition, is the perfect cherry on top, adding new areas to explore, tougher enemies, and a compelling story that ties seamlessly into Aloy’s **** with most big open-world games, there are occasional bugs and frame drops, especially in heavily populated areas, but overall, Forbidden West is impressively stable on PC. The controls feel responsive, and I was pleased to see plenty of customization options to tailor the experience to my **** summary, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition on PC is a masterclass in how to do a sequel right. It takes the best elements of Zero Dawn and amplifies them, adding a richer story, more complex gameplay, and a world that feels even more alive. Whether you’re a veteran of Aloy’s first journey or a newcomer to the series, this edition is a must-play.. So this is one of the best open world games I have ever played. There is so much to do and see, and the art style is great. This might be the most realistic game to date. I don’t really have much to complain about. The controls could feel strange at times. Like I fire the arrow but it doesn't actually shoot, or when I aim, let go of the aim button, and the arrow still shoots. Also, how does Aloy forget how to whistle? Such a strange thing to remove from the first game. I kept finding small frustrations like that throughout my playthrough. But the rest of the game was so good it didn't bother me too much. I really enjoy the story, but some of the colloquial slang and terminology used by NPC's does not fit as it is what 21st century people would say. luckily, most of the writing is great and top-notch.. A very impressive sequel, keeping what everyone like about the first one and improving on it. Some gameplay mechanics have ofc been pretty heavily nerfed, dodging and coils have been hit heavily but the ability to upgrade weapons and armor definitely picks up the slag!. This game is still a steaming pile of garbage. The DLC is exactly as I expected, it's just another empty wasteland of plants, trees and rocks with a few LA landmarks that should've been included in the base game. There's nothing to do in the open world. I'm pretty sure I criticized how bad the facial animations looked in my PS5 review. Well looking at it again, it's quite impressive. But those eyes look awful, which make the facial animations look terrible overall. Playing the PC version of this game reminds me of how awful recent games have gotten, and that's what I want to talk about. We are witnessing the downfall of gaming with all of these unprofitable big budget games, layoffs, overpriced hardware, remasters and just flop after flop. And why is this happening? Because you're all out of touch. Mods, you're going to have to let me talk about this, because no one else is willing to speak the truth but me; the devs need to see this if they want any chance of success. ● First things first, nerd games aren't profitable. By nerd games, I mean any game that is an internet/critic darling and you get called a ""contrarian"" for hating it (very ironic coming from nerds who hate on Fortnite because it's popular). ""But Sony's movie games sold 20 million units"" while that's true, nerds forget to take into account the story behind that success and the budgets. When Sony first announced 10 million copies sold for GOW, I remember seeing stacks of GOW games flooded in the $10 bin. So many casual gamers I know didn't buy Sony's arty farty movie games until they were deeply discounted. That was the appeal; you get a ""10/10"" game for a low price. Let's also not forget the bundles inflating the sales. ""But COD, FIFA and RDR2 had bundles too"" RDR2 was only a Pro bundle and the other 2 weren't standard bundles, stupid. Even if they were, third party studios get paid for the bundles. Sony loses money from their games if they get bundled, especially during the PS4 gen when it was basically a free game. Do I even have to talk about PS5 games like SM2 and HFW not being profitable? I've made my point Sony, stop wasting so much money on nerd stuff that isn't profitable enough. ● If you want to make games profitable, then you have to appeal to a more casual/mainstream audience, and you can start by giving us multiplayer. ""But Concord failed"" Live-service is not the answer Sony, it's a little too late for that. All you have to do is add multiplayer in your singleplayer games like you did with TLOU1 and Uncharted 4 (before the lazy devs took them out of the PS5 editions). Stop being greedy and lazy for online. Every full-priced game should have online multiplayer, no exceptions. I know I said I'd be fine with no multiplayer in HFW if the game had so much depth and content, which isn't the case. That was me trying to be generous. And by fine, I meant you would've gotten a 6 from me at best. Do you really think I would've been happy with just half the game when PS3 open world games like RDR, Saints Row, GTA, Far Cry all had multiplayer? Hell no, especially when you increased the price to $70. How can you expect me to be generous when you get greedier? From now on if you dare give me half the game for $70, the highest you can get from me is a 5. Half the game; half the score, that's how it's going to be. ● You should never listen to toy-collecing millennials. I need to be more specific about that term, because it seems that collecting toys is a thing with that generation. I can't say for a fact that all millennial sports fans collect toys for instance, but if you're a gamer with the typical ""muh dark story, Witcher 3 and Elden Ring are the best games ever; Fortnite/COD bad"" opinion, then it's a fact that you are a millennial with toys in your room. That's why I call them toy-collecting millennials. Basically nerds, but I don't see any other generation having this weird ""GOW good/COD bad"" superiority complex. Some Early Gen Z and Xennials nerds act like this too (same difference). You wasted so much money to please these dimwits with trash like GOW, and it was all for nothing since they're now happy with low budget shovelware like BG3. You see, they don't know what they want. That's why you don't listen to them. ● P.S. My way or the highway, Metacritic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm giving Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition a 0 for what I think is a pretty significant bug that is apparently due to the frame rate: Traps do no damage to enemies. I say significant because it essentially removes a tool from the player to be able to use, and affects a Skill tree in the game that revolves around using Traps. With this bug existing for sometime now, there is a potential for other bugs to exist that have not been addressed. Hopefully this is fixed because I was having a genuinely good time even on Ultra Hard, but I can't recommend it currently.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What an overrated snore-fest! The gameplay is clunky, blunt and extremely boring, just like the story and the characters. Bad optimization, too (burning shores). The only good thing this has going for is the Graphics but those will be outclassed soon enough. Open world feels dead (like ubisoft games). Wish I had never wasted my time on this.. One of most boring game I've ever played. Dropped it after a few hours because I wasn't having any fun. Graphics is gorgeous, but that's it. Everything else pales compared to any other of Sony's exclusive action adventure games. It baffles me why Sony seems to care so much about this franchise while neglecting games like Days Gone of Infamous which are miles better.. Exceptional game if you make at least an effort to enter story. Need some time to understand the way it work in the beginning if you haven't played the first episode. But then it becomes really addictive !. Score: 8.5 Loved this game, it's more Horizon, i didn't need a complete 180 on the game, i just needed this, the same type of **** but more,bigger,better! The world is amazing, holy crap the amount of times i just stopped to take it all in... The new beasts are **** badass! The story, had it's craziness, but overall i enjoyed it, i'm curious what they will do to follow it up! And finnaly, RIP LANCE, everything i got to experience of your work was amazing, and Sylens is just as awsome. I'm very curious, and scared, of that they will do in the next game with him, what VO they will get orif they will just remove him... i just hope it honours and respects you.. It is the same as Zero Dawn. It is not bad just it does not add too much to the previous game. Mechanics are the same. The all time wood looting for the arrows are the same, which made it super annoying in the first episode as well to move around, because you cannot move straight line between two points, but you must collect all bushes along the way to have enough loot. Some new challenges appear which are some labyrinths that you cannot quit if you start. I hated those, but fits well into the whole game being a platformer with some extra jungle around it.. Very good Game! | Horizon Forbidden West | 95 Points (4,5 Stars) | Story 9P | Side Story 8P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 8P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""It's the best game I’ve ever played."" The story is something special and amazing, more so than in other games. I also love the new mechanics and better graphics, which make the world better than the HZD world and activities.10/10 game.. Honestly this game is well deserving of it's 10/10. Beautiful vast open world. Story really sinks into ones soul. Different & Original Concept that was outstandingly well executed.. excellent game much better than the first part. The last time I played so much was just The Witcher 3, the horizon is amazing with its beauty. Works very well graphically, even on a steam deck. Technically a better game than zero Dawn: more map, more weapons, more enemies, more skills, more companions and types of quests…. But it all fell flat. The first games story was soooo much better. I started skipping dialogue half way through this one. Also, I nearly completed zeroDawn in 60 hours… this took 85 just to beat the main quest line…. Overstayed its welcome. It was an 8/10 for the first 30 hrs, a 6/10 the next 30, and a 2/10 the final 25. so weird… zero Dawn was one of my favorite games ever, but something’s off with this one.. I'm sorry I didn't know about the first Horizon game when it became available on PC a few years ago. There's a lot of back-story to absorb along with some returning characters. This is an open-world, action-adventure RPG with challenging combat that has widely adjustable difficulty. Most attractive to me are the depth of characterization, the excellence of the human character models, and the heroic nature of the main quest and many optional quests. I think there's replayability and an eerie relevance to current events. Certainly the best RPG since Witcher III. I will look forward to the third episode.. game is so trash, its a generic and bland open world game , knack 2 is better than this trash game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a MUST-play game. It has it all. The graphics are beautiful, the combat is challenging and allows players to use different combinations and weapons, and the player defines if he wants a playthrough with easy or hard combat. The story is amazing, giving us an aspect of the possibility of future life on Earth. Last but not least, the DLC is awesome because it improves all the 3 topics I just mentioned (graphics, combat and story). The only downside is the low framerate during cutscenes. Great job on this one Gorilla!. Expanded from the first game, Forbidden West is a fun action romp which suffers a little from open world fatigue. Looks fantastic, but doesn't quite have the magic of the first game, mainly when it comes to story.. too many dialogues . I am not gonna do climbing like a monkey whole day . boring story , boring battle system , I have no interest at what they talking about , I care nothing , so this is suffering game . if the game **** at least give me a beauty to watch . like no reason to live , wasted.. Pros: Combat is fairly good Tons of activities Not an inventory management game Board mini-game - I'll give the developer credit, it's not easy coming up with a new concept board game. Not as good as gwent but still fun. Flying Mount Cons: Tons of word vomit Too much unnecessary wasted time (quests designed to waste time, opening doors, dumb combat animation) Every quest and path are extremely linear Weapons and weapon system could be much better The game feels like a chore at a certain point The optimization around the hunter pack items are poor and you don't end up using items most of the time. The direction/compass system is trash The tree house maze cities that are found mid to late game are terribly designed No one wants to be crafting arrows 3+ times every hard fight, The limited ammo capacity, even when maxed out, is terrible Melee combos Variety of flying mounts Salmon. Graphically breathtaking, truly a sight to behold. I rarely take so many screenshots, this game is filled with beautiful vistas everywhere you go. Having played Zero Dawn though, this feels like a 1.5, with not much innovation over the previous entry. The grapple is useful to avoid wasting time.I don’t dislike the story, I like Aloy and Sylens. My main problem with it is that it feels childish, superficial. The story of the brave hero and a couple allies who save the world of impending danger where most of the population is childish and lives in the stone age. I feel like I’m treated like a child many times, and it gets boring and very repetitive. Aloy, just let me think about the puzzles, don’t make obvious unnecessary comments at every step of the way (this should be an accessibility option if needed). Ratchet & Clank may have similar vibes, but that is targeted at younger audiences so I’m fine with it. I’m sorry, but it is full of forgettable quests and characters. The main villains have barely any development if at all. You know you are going to fight them and that’s mostly it. I haven’t grown attached to any character, even Aloy feels more of the same.Gameplay/Combat feels like the first game, which is fine as I really liked it. I like identifying machines and countering them appropriately, using my bow to tear down components. My problem is that everything has grown bigger. One thing I don’t like is that some machines feel like sponges. Even if you destroy all of a Clawstrider’s components, it doesn’t die. Hell, it might even have half of its HP remaining. This goes against the game’s design intention imho and feels frustrating. We got many more elementals and weapon types, an enormous skill tree, weapon type specific special abilities that use stamina, special abilities… I have an issue with this (and many others) open world RPG progression. I’m happy buying a couple bows early, with different elementals that help me against the different machines I face. Then I like spending some time improving them on the go, until I go to the next trader and see that my weapons are already obsolete, even when upgraded. This is a slap in the face, it is so frustrating and disheartening. Am I wasting my time? Should I just go with whatever I find until late game weapons and then improve them? Why do I need 5 different bows? To cover the elementals? I haven’t found almost any purgewater bow, hell I don’t remember having even seen one. It's a horrible design, and the industry is plagued by it. I’d rather have Aloy’s bow, and be able to improve/modify it on the go. Here, I added a shock module. Here, I improved the string and now I can draw it faster…I hate it when a game tries to stretch itself, less but higher quality time is better! Nothing really stands out, it’s just good enough.. This game graphic is so beautiful. And action is the best. I need mor horizon game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horizon Forbidden West is a game that did not meet my expectations. The graphics and visual effects look outdated against the background of modern games, and the optimization leaves much to be desired. The controls are also inconvenient, especially during battles. The plot seems unfinished, and the characters are superficial. The game offers little innovation compared to the previous installment. I recommend waiting for discounts or trying the game as part of a PlayStation Plus subscription to rate it at a lower price.. Game could be great. But since I had to look at butt-ugly Aloy trash-talking down every men she sighted, I decided refunding the game and playing Stellar Blade instead will be better for my psyche.. Changed main character to unsufferable, annoying person, that is non-stop commenting on every action you do (or might do) which makes every environmental puzzle pointless. There is no real story just ""save the day for me... again"". It's technically very good, but it has mediocre gameplay and terrible characters and story. I don't find it attractive.. I don't know why Zero Dawn is much more fun to play with. The looting system is just overwhelming and it's annoying tbh. The graphics are superb though and it's one of the best I've seen.. Combats are fun and challenging, taking down enormous machines is very satisfying. Graphics is awesome, exploring in this beautiful map is a joy. I really love the underwater city part, it wows me. The story is pretty bland though, characters are uninteresting generally. Plus, all those woke stuffs that were forced into this game makes me think that the developers and the writer were not taking this game very seriously. I had to skip through a lot of the dialogs to keep myself from falling asleep. Also, the game is a bit too grindy for me. All of those upgrades, challenges and side quests are getting way too repetitive in mid-late game. It could have been an easy 8 or 9 without the above issues, what a shame. Hope the next game gets better.. Decent story and gameplay until the end and the DLC, spoiled by clear political agenda. I'd rather wish the devs focus on the REAL story than showing their own askewed beliefs in everybody's face!. All the good things in Horizon franchise are still good and truly sets a benchmark of what a good games require, in terms of graphics and gameplay. Probably the only thing missing is the feeling of freshness, which I think it is totally fine as the purpose of playing this game for me is to continue the fun I had from HZD and the main story progression. Will definitely recommend to players that want the same as I did for this game.. Horizon Forbidden West has amazing graphics and battles but after playing for about 30h it starts to become boring. The story isnt that good and the game loop is most of the time the same. You ran to a Quest -> Speak with someone -> kill something -> speak with someone. Another thing that i hate is the main character. She is know-it-all and annoying. Every few seconds there's a comment that's supposed to help the player, it's just annoying. Moreover, this woke approach seems far too forced and simply fulfills every cliché.. Um jogo muito bom, divertido com bom gameplay e plot. O jogo possui alguns problemas de desempenho. Personagens sem carisma. Muitas horas de gameplay e diversão com nível de dificuldade considerável. A very good, fun game with good gameplay and **** game has some performance issues.Characters without charisma.Many hours of gameplay and fun with a considerable level of difficulty.. While being great at optics, the game lacks with the story. The optics are on par with its predecessor, but the story of ""Forbidden West"" falls waaaay behind. It so pale and interchangeable that you can not connect with aloy even if know whats going on. It plays to safe and there is no depth to the story. You can not discover and use technology of the old world like in ZD and your companions are just chilling in the base while you do all the work. You can just rush through the main missons in like 20-25h just with your starting weapons there is no need to grind, no need to discover the breeding grounds and learn how to overwrite the machines. After the final battel it just fells like you just wasted your time. Hopefully this was just a fluke and the third and probably last title will be back on track with ZD.. Loved Horizon Zero Dawn, this is much of the same just a bit worse. The game runs incredibly well on a 4070ti, 13600k, 165 hz capped even while fighting. The visuals are quite lovely, sounds and textures good. Bit early to say about the story but it seems decent. Oh and I just remembered; the intro is so bad I took several days break just to want to play again. The intro before you get into the small valley, which is sort of also an intro, is just so uneccessary for people familiar with the game. I'm about half way through the game and half way through the map with looting and my biggest problems so far is the very apparent liberal, leftist, feminism bs going on in the background. 70% of the fighters and characters are female. You have pride ink mask, Ukraine flags put in old world places (this is California, US). Some pretty wonky dialogue and odd facial expressions here and there. I don't know, this is coming up more and more in games, like AC:Vikings/Odyssey where you fight women which would never happen during that times in history/ever. And yeah, every game is not supposed to be the real world, but it just doesn't work well in games when what you're seeing is too unlikely to be true. The biggest problem is Aloy herself, it's impossible to like her. I can't remember it being this problematic in the first game, but it might have been. Everything is sarcasm, she is always right, she talks sht to 30 people infront of her that could down her in one punch, she talks sht to just about anyone who doesn't agree with her. She carries herself around with this immortal attitude that she is the epitome of justice and nothing can stop her, which is pretty disgusting. It's basically the lack of any respect from her, not an ounce of being humble, staying in the background, being loveable. Maybe it's the actor with her face, the lines she gets or a mix of both, it's just not good. Aloy falls a bit into the category for me like Harry Potter is, I love Harry Potter the books and movies, but I dislike Harry Potter himself. All he does is ****, getting saved by friends and teachers, lucks out from some random born gift he doesn't know he has, throws tantrums at anything and anyone. Why on earth would you make a main character like this? Aloy hasn't laughed once in like 30 hours of gametime. Everything is ""oh I guess I will be the hero because no one else will"","" I will save the world I guess"",""don't come in my way because no one can stop me"". If it wasn't for machines you'd literally feel like you're playing with Godmode enabled in the console I don't know, Horizon Zero Dawn was probably a 8.5-9/10 for me which extremely good for a game, probably only beaten by Witcher 3. So I will continue to play and perhaps the story and characters will win me over. Putting camp fires 50 meters apart in an attempt to make the world seem larger won't do it. But all in all, the game runs fantastic, there are some ok characters, the combat is decent and you can play for many many hours which is more than you get from most games. 6.5-7.5 / 10 so far.. The game is just fine, and thats all. I understand when people like this game, but I don't understand when they call it a masterpiece. It just an assassin creed game that done with quality, nothing special.Combat seems fine at the beginning but later I was bored with it, fight become long and not hard actually (very hard difficutly). Graphic is good, there was some good views. The plot is mid, characters awful - it is the weakest side of the game, I only liked Sylens and don't even remember names of the others. Horizon Forbidden West on the PC is another example **** done right in its conversion from console. Slight improvement of the previous one regarding the story but the gameplay and mechanics do not change at all always the same as the first small map no relevant side activities few models and types of enemies a continuous recycling of mesh and textures. The crafting system stupid and basic, the ability to craft arrows in combat I find stupid no survival element food serves little to no purpose and buffs last too short.. Boring and repetitive too simple and obvious plot and still we have the infinite dodges??? That's not it doesn't even deserve a sufficiencyTranslated with **** (free version). 80% of the tasks involve solving puzzles and finding the way, which is really annoying. Does the development team know? The protagonist, being the most advanced perso","i played the game on PS 5 but deleted it on my PC after 5-7 hours of play . if you want a good looking game, this is by far the best one . the addition **** is one of the biggest improvement and has made it harder to go back to the first game ."
451.Far Cry,"MUST PLAY. Just finished for the first time on August 31, 2024. I must say that this is one of the best games I have ever played, let alone completed. Even though I played on the easiest difficulty called easy, it was not easy! Thank goodness I could use manual saves with ` and typing save_game. No problem loading with esc, but maybe there is key binding for that. Some locations required multiple attempts, even on easy. I can't even imagine how people complete this game on harder difficulties, but maybe I will try it one day; who knows? Now, this game is from 2004, and it stands superbly well after 20 years. Huge kudos to the people who created this game; this is a masterpiece for PC. The storyline and dialogue are pretty funny and charming; I liked it; it was not too dramatic and too long. For this game, it fits well. This game holds up very well graphically. Of course, back in 2004 it was probably not common to run this game on max settings, but in 2024 it shouldn't be a problem for most people, even with 240 fps probably. 2K 240FPS on a 27-inch monitor without any mods or FOV adjustments was fine for me. I like the vanilla experience after many years from the original release. Maybe it is possible to make this game look and run even better, but I was satisfied with what I got, and 240 fps allowed me to finish the game and did not break the engine fatally without letting pass some level like in some other older games. Although I have to admit some movements of AI were strange, I am not sure if it was due to higher fps or some other reason. I wouldn't call this game bugged. 20 levels to play, with open-world elements; some levels are inside the buildings. Length and difficulty are satisfying, as is accompanying music, which makes for a great atmosphere with some horror elements. Overall, it is one of the best games of all time. When we are talking about FPS, I would say it's easily TOP 5 for me; it laid the groundwork, the solid foundation for future games. I can now see how Crytek made Crysis; one can see huge potential from this game. Highly recommended. 10/10. FANTASTIC.. AAAAAAAAAA!!!! This game is by far the hardest FPS I've ever played; NPCs that can use tactics against you, have far above average perception skills, their mutant forms, and the developers' level design is a really bad game that challenges you a lot. Run-and-gun doesn't work.. At the time it was the fist game where you could snipe enemies from 500 meters. Guys with consoles could only dream of such a game. Technically incredible and for me easily the best Far Cry.. Old bad game. 0 - balance, 0 - tolerance to everything better didnt play in this. Graphics for 2004 - 9 Gameplay - 8 Story - 7 My favorite Far cry. Interesting game with a lot of weapons and enemies. Before trying out this game, I've literally played five games unsuccessfully—download, play, uninstall. Just like this. So, when a 2004 game could do what some modern games can't (captivate me), you know there's something special here. First of all, Far Cry 1 is surprisingly atmospheric, mostly because of the audio design, though the graphics are pretty cool, even for today. Also, the game can easily run at 144fps, which guarantees you some fluid gameplay, a thing that not most old games can deliver. The story is not a big deal, but it works well as a background to what is happening. Now, what really is good here is the gameplay. It didn't get old like wine as Halo CE, but it still holds today for sure. It is responsive and challenging. Mostly, you can't run and shoot like an average brainless COD campaign. You die a lot on higher difficulties, and you're forced to learn the mechanics, as well as the level design and enemy locations. Feels good when you outplay them. I'm curious about Far Cry 2. It's a shame that, beyond Far Cry 3, we just got the same formula over and over.. This game came with my PC along with AVP but I loved them both. The two things I liked about Far Cry was the map graphics and the introduction of hand gliders. I Stalled at the final boss but played others in the series. I Actually purchased a strategy guide along with number 2 (Fortunes Edition). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The open-world first-person shooter was truly revolutionary in 2004. But innovation alone isn't enough to make it an enduring classic. There is virtually nothing about the original Far Cry that isn't improved upon in either its spiritual or direct successor, Crysis and Far Cry 2 respectively. Your time will be better spent with either or both of those games instead.. this is a good game but it has a problem whit enemy **** AI can be sometimes very dumb or very **** level design is ok and the gameplay is good.. Very solid oldschool FPS with modern (at that time) feel to it. Of course some things might be dated from today's perspective and the game clearly has some minor/not-so-significant flaws, yet the overall experience is great. Big plus for trying to be innovative and creative, which they did successfully. I really like the idea that vegetation and stealth matter in an otherwise fast-paced one-man-army tactical shooter. Oh, don't get fooled by the in-game difficulty descriptions; the game wasn't made for casual players in mind.. While this game feels really dated it's still a sweet memory that reminds us of our childhood, all the fun and jump scares. I've spent a lot of time preparing myself to play this game when I was a kid as I was scared of those jumping monsters.. 1200. 10/10 Back in 2004, it was one of the most beautiful games on the market (besides Half Life 2). Gunplay is OK, as well as the story, but remember, it's a game from 2004, so at the time it was insane!!!. Far Cry is a revolutionary FPS that introduced open-world gameplay, cutting-edge graphics, and thrilling gunplay. A genre-defining classic.. the gameplay just is very satisfying, graphics stil hold up well, sound is amazing, almost all of the levels are veery fun and rewarrding to complete and its veery unique game. A classic!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Stunning sound design, bad game desing. Magnificent visuals, but fifty-fifty missions. Clean PC controls, but lots of lame scripts. Very good AI, but it cheats. The second GOTY in 2004, by the way. Gameplay: combat mechanics [bad TTK, some bugs] 8/10 combat logic [funny but absurd transport] 9/10 stealth 6/10 atmosphere [very uneven, but it's impossible to break away] 8/10 Story 5/10 Graphics 10/10 Sounds & music 9/10 [GORGEOUS RU localization, many times better than OG] . The sandbox of our childhood.. hard f$&$king game It reminds a lot of CRYSIS 1, and it's also crazy. This far cry is very strange, sometimes you face monsters that are difficult to kill and the game itself is difficult, that's why I give it a grade 8 difficult but beautiful and fun In 2004 you knew your computer was good when it ran this game well! ^⁠_⁠^. Far Cry's graphics and psuedo-open-world jungle setting were extremely impressive for a 2004 game. The gameplay mixed up both stealth and brute force with a variety of satisfying weapons. Unfortunately, some of the mutant monsters you had to fight were irritating, especially the big brutes with rockets. As for the story and dialogue, it was simply bad, but in a charming B-movie way. If you enjoy this game, then you will love the mod Matto4. IMPORTANT: Use the Steam Guide ""Far Cry Fix"" by MJR to repair glitches with the Steam version of this game.. The start of a famous franchise, which is different from the rest of this series, a linear FPS rather than open world.. In my humble opinion — this is the best Far Cry title. Far Cry 1 has it specific ambience and atmosphere that has been lost in future games of the series. Still to this day that game can empress with it's graphich aspects. By the way, this is probably also the most hardest Far Cry title. You'll need to get some skills if you want to pass it. After all — it's another good nostalgic & classic game so far.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Yes, by the way, I'm Jack Carver"" (c) Jack Carver. For 2004, I'm sure it was an over the top game, great locations, beautiful graphics, moderately interesting plot. The game is really hardcore even on the lowest difficulty level. Personally, I did not like the idea with mutants, especially with the ones they are shown in the game: smart, able to wield weapons, and indeed the whole topic... I advise those who like old shooters for a couple of evenings, no more :). The story and feeling is just so on point. I have came back to this game again and again.. Since I finished the game, it still makes you feel playing kind of a newer game style. Never getting old in my opinion. On some parts of it just a little bit exaggerated about harder difficulty. AI is a totally masterpiece for an 2004 game. Other than those, even at these times you can still enjoy.. The game redefines its graphics with the same blowing stuff-up storyline. This time they have added a wingsuit which makes travelling around the massive open world so much easier and just when you thought what more can you destroy that was not in the previous games, well now you can destroy bridges as well and the destruction looks so amazing. The explosions look very real and better than the last two games. The game has too much grinding which becomes very tedious once you are stuck finding a microphone hidden somewhere in the city to be able to liberate it or a cop stuck behind a wall which is frustrating since you need to take all of them down to liberate the town. Some military camps have special requirements to liberate them which makes it fun otherwise liberating cities is awfully boring.. Still amazing graphics for a 2004 game. Was quite graphics demanding for its time. Before Crysis it **** can it run Far Cry?? The most difficult Far Cry game by a good margin. Revolutionary in many ways.. I have decided not to recommend this game as on modern computers the game jerks and is not playable. even if you put some pieces, by lowering some options, playing with them you will always have annoying microlags.. Not a perfect but surely a revolutionary game. Maybe I was too young to appreciate it fully but I remember having fun.. Looking back, it's hard to believe that this 17 year old game is primarily responsible for being the inception point of Ubisoft's biggest open world FPS franchise. Nevertheless, Crytek's debut game helped establish the fledgling studio back in 2004, making valuable contributions to the FPS genre alongside other FPS greats like Half-Life 2 and Halo 2, and setting up the formula for Crytek's follow-up spiritual successor, Crysis. What made Far Cry stand out 'back-in-the-day' was it's non-linear missions and hybrid gameplay of stealth and action. While it could be frustrating to play because you didn't know exactly where you were getting shot at from in the jungle, Far Cry's maps were fun to explore. On the flipside, Far Cry could be very boring and frustrating to play at times because of how imperfect or imbalanced it was - a trait which Crytek's next game, Crysis, shared. But on the whole, Far Cry is a great 'Golden Era' FPS game that is frequently overlooked and often underappreciated. So now every time you play a modern Far Cry game, just remember to remind yourself that Ubisoft has A LOT to thank Crytek for.. Far Cry is a golden standard of game industry. Love games like this game because we will not get games like this.. nice job for 2004 but it fastly gets boring .. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 73 IIIIIIIIII====================. Half life but open world. Although the game was successful compared to the year it was made, the atmosphere and gameplay style was a bit boring, I think it was because I played better games, if I had played this game back then, I could consider it a masterpiece.. Far Cry. Welcome to the green hell. This is an amazing game. At first you enjoy walking along the beach, and in just a couple of hours you find yourself in catacombs full of mutants that can jump out at you at any moment. The game turns into a real horror. A wide variety of enemies, both mercenaries and mutants. A wide variety of locations - beach, jungle, laboratories, bunkers, dungeons and even a volcano.. The first Far Cry was developed by Crytek, a well-known studio, which in 2007 showed the world a first-person shooter called Crysis, which required a hell of a lot of hardware and only a few people could enjoy this graphical extravaganza in full detail. But now we're going to go back a little further in time, and specifically to 2004. The first installment of the legendary Far Cry series takes us to a very similar place to Crysis, and that is an island. Sunshine, sandy beaches, beautiful palm trees and beautiful sea. Yeah. That's what Far Cry is, or at least the first one. The story begins, as perhaps every saga does nowadays, with a good old-fashioned escape. First and foremost, you'll probably be enchanted by the breathtaking visuals for the time, which few adepts at the time could boast. For 2004, it was simply over the top. The gameplay was... What was? Actually, it's still fun. I mean, it's a first-person shooter. Just throw a gun in my hand and let me go wild! This is just action with a capital A. In Far Cry 1, you're going to have a blast in the shootouts, which are great, but unfortunately, this all has one minor downside, and that's that you don't have the freedom that you do in more recent installments. The first one is quite straightforward. The map we're used to isn't quite there. There is no radar to show you where to go. Unfortunately, you don't even have the delicious choice to choose whether to drive that part silently or in action. So if you're a fan of more of a silent sneak, this action-packed game is not for you. You don't choose your weapons here and only take them from your dead enemies. Although there is a silenced MP5 for example, the enemies will still notice you sooner or later and so even if you do try for some silent progression, it's definitely not something the game is counting on or even the style you should play the game. So, in conclusion, what is Far Cry 1 and who is it for? If you love action as much as I do and you're not exactly a fan of stealth, again like me, I wouldn't hesitate too much to pick up the game. If you're not a master of English, you'll be pleased to know that there is a Czech dub! It's an old classic that can be played on any PC nowadays, so almost anyone can play it. On Steam, it costs only 10 ecus, which is a couple of hundred, and with such a discount, this game will literally cost you a few crowns. It might not suit you, as it's quite a bit different compared to newer FC games, but you might also love it.. The ambient graphics look very nice for a game from 2004. Very unintuitive game. Missions are very repetitive.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Far Cry? More like this game made me Cry Far away from the keyboard when all those big, burly mercenaries came a runnin' my way. Now that we've dispensed with the need to evaluate my fragile mental state, it's time to look over a game that probably caused half those neuroses. Far Cry is a stealth, FPS mix. I didn't play it when it came out and I never hear anybody talk about this first entry in the franchise, so any witty or knowledgeable statement about its release or culture would be a Far Cry from the truth. And yes, that pun will show up frequently during this review. But despite the praising reviews of this game, it doesn't ever come up in conversation. Especially when compared to its successors. Far Cry 2 is the cult classic, 3 is the one that put the series into the mainstream, and 4 onwards just keep selling based on the success of 3. There's also Primal, but I think to this day that everyone still thinks that one was just an April Fools joke that hasn't been taken off of stores yet. Really letting that one linger, eh Ubisoft? I f$*king love the environments in this game! I've said it before and I'll say it again; open spaces with oversaturated colours and some real ambience are Gucci on crack. These tropical islands are my dream home. I could even put up with the rampaging monkey demons for a piece of real estate in Far Cry. And this extends into the actual foundations of the gameplay too. One of the major selling points of this game is its open, linear design. You traverse individual levels completing objectives from point A - B in a normal linear fashion, however any of the outdoors levels are wildly expansive. You can travel to islands with nothing on them, or follow beaches round to flank enemy camps, or just piss off and swim with some tropical fish. Evil scientists and rampaging monkey demons will probably just fix themselves anyway. That's probably just the way with scientists obsessed with chest day, and bloody bonobos. They have a complicated relationship. But weaving together beautiful world design and liberty in gameplay in this way is just a 1000 yeses in my book. And I wrote a book that simply said yes 1001 times. Best seller too! I also love the action set pieces in this game. A fight on a sinking boat, hang gliding over enemy camps, the world's worst turret section, and more can turn a generic shooter into an exciting, interactive action film. Other shooters need to learn this. Gameplay is vital, but context can make that gameplay feel way more investing and fun. It is with great sorrow, however, that I must now state that this is where the pros of this game end. Ain't got much of a narrative. It's only orders from other characters followed by a snarky remark by your character. An action movie through and through. Although that was hard to tell since there are no subtitles option in this game, and voices are part of the sound effects volume slider. It's bad enough that the guns are realistically loud so the slider needs to be turned way down to avoid giving yourself instant tinnitus-flavoured ramen. But the voices are already quiet at the top of the slider. Your companions prefer to vaguely and sexily whisper commands in your ear rather than just tell you what's going on. I'm into it, but I'm also very confused. I'm also confused about they just said as well... In an attempt to be make their stealth FPS a little more realistic they kinda f&%ked it up, and also forgot to put fun in the game. Yes, it is genuinely interesting that enemies have realistic vision and can spot you sneaking up on them in their peripheral unlike other stealth games. Unfortunately, after that point the game just breaks. Get spotted and all enemies on the map will be alerted. And they have aim tracking too so there's not much use in trying to hide again because I witnessed these people actually f&@king watching me through mountains. Yet a small bush will often confuse and scare a mercenary practically standing on top of you. At least this mercenary army isn't ableist. They take anyone with 20-20 vision, the completely blind AND the omniscient. So proud of these boys trying to murder me right now. Gunplay feels pretty bad too. To increase difficulty, they go with the tried and complete **** method of just bringing in new enemies that are increasingly health spongy. The last few levels also have a reliance on rocket launcher spamming. Yay, I hate both those methods. Those methods really date this game, huh. Remember when games thought rocket spam was legit? Gunplay just feels wrong too. Yes, it's tactical that your accuracy goes up as you crouch and prone. But damn is it no fun in the sections where you do have to keep moving and Jack seems to be holding his gun f&!king sideways! This area is where the game needs the most improvement. So besides enemies shooting me from beyond the max render distance, the game was on its way to greatness. I actually went Far without Crying out a pun. Wait ****. Classic shooter with amazing graphics for 2004. It was the fundament for another great Crytec game Crysis and I cannot stress it enough - it was a game changer at the time.. This game is able to provide you lots of fun with an interesting & deep story, saturated gameplay, a bit fearful encounters. There are lots of options how to achieve a target, locations & targets vary rather often, in that cause you will never feel boring from this game.. Far Cry was a blast upon its release in 2004. The then unknown german video game studio Crytek presented one of the best FPS in years. Now, almost 17 years later it still rocks! Graphics and sound are phenomenal, gameplay is wonderful and the ragdoll physics still rules. The story is a bit stereotypical, but who cares if everything else is brilliant. The wonderful start of a cool and famous series. RECOMMENDATION!. An incredible action-adventure. This game plays a lot like levels in a puzzle game. You must figure out where the enemies are, kill them, and move on. On your first playthrough, you will be intimidated by the first few missions due to it's open style of gameplay, but you will quickly get the hang of it. You will die lots of times too, and try the ""level"" again, until you can go on to the next batch of gunmen to dodge and eliminate. The action is accompanied by an intriguing tale and okay characters, but the level design is truly outstanding. My only complaint about this game is that there a good amount of unfair, unfun, frustrating parts to the game. The gameplay becomes boring and frustrating at some points. The game progresses very blandly with a clear lack of emotion or plot connectivity.. I've been playing Far Cry since they were released. I can say that the first version from the point of view of fun, was the best in the whole series! My first hours of play were unforgettable. The game mechanics, the style of play and the excitement that the game brought, was wonderful!. Maybe it is not right to write this review considering the fact the last time I played the game was about 10 years ago. On the other hand maybe it is the only right way to evaluate a game: I think we have to look at different pieces of art (such as movies, books and of course games) in the context of the time they were released in. Of course, this game as many others of that period didn’t age too well. Does it make FarCry 1 a bad game? Definitely not. While we had games like Half-Life 2 and World of WarCraft which were released the same year and which definitely became classic which aged much better and can be revisited today and still be fun doesn’t necessarily mean that all the other games released in the same period should be considered an utter trash. Half-Life 2 was just too good. 10 out of 10. Game of the year. While Far Cry 1 was just a good game which definitely was much better than people tend to make it to be nowadays. Of course revisited now the game doesn’t shine in almost every aspect for an average consumer but when I played this game about a decade ago I was literally blown away by the game. The graphics were insane, the guns felt real, the missions were truly challenging. I didn’t care much about the story back then but when the big monster-mutants appeared in the game I certainly was intrigued and wanted to find out what is going on. Far Cry 1 is far away from a perfect game…by today’s measures. I can only judge by the feelings I had when I played it then and I have nothing but warm memories about that times so for me to rate the game with anything less than 7/10 would be atrocious.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. First impression in the game was connected with great, beautiful, open world which was definitely not a standard in 2004. It was new, fresh approach to first person shooters - end of tight and limited locations. Game's graphics had standed out in those times. Story was not special, later in the game opponents became strange. Gun feeling was satisfing. Nowadays comming back to the game is rather pointless, nevertheless in 2004 Far Cry was ducky, interesting and sometimes even excellent. It is worth to mention, that game started new series, one of the most known nowadays.. Great game, the graphics were insane when this was released. Also interesting gameplay.. Enemies start shooting you from 500m distance, and it didnt quite age so well I think. Mindblowing graphics and tropical open world at the time, but gameplay was nothing special really. Far Cry is an agonizingly difficult game where 2 shots could kill you and enemies could spot you from miles away. If you are a modern age gamer, do NOT buy it. The 89 rating from critics is irrelevant now because the gameplay mechanics is old by now. You cant do stealth either.. It so bad game at 2020! I have really bad mood, when i played in it. Sorry, i understand, that it is game classic and parent big popular series, but i think this game had been makes without soul. Developers don't want make marvelous game. They want do just usual game. Them point, i think, were just make game, how inner will work gameplay, what we write a scenario, and etc. It is be during building game... It is true. I don't have satisfaction, when i played. I dissapointed. Me unpleasantly play, when me killing anybody enemy, when i ever and ever dead on middle difficulties, when bullets enemies give me so many damage. And why so few medicine and armor? WHY my bullets flying in side, but not in my aim. So big spread, so. ENEMIES. Why they random detect me, i try passed level is steals, but, - ""I think i something saw there..."", - and begin shooting. Nice. Although sometimes steals working. SOMETIMES. Okey, what are you say about story? Story is **** but if gameplay was is good, i don't said that it is bad. Since gameplay is bad, for this reason and story show itself not good light. Throw one more rock in reputation game. That's all. I said everything that want said. I don't passed this game, because i sincerely couldn't that. Kinda, i passed more half game(i played with girl, which searching our hero). I don't recommended play in this game at +2020. In world have a lot of beautiful games, which you can playing. With interest story and gameplay. P.S. And don't need consider me casual **** boy, i passed Doom(2016) on hard difficulties, I got satisfaction from game and love there dead and searching path for wining. I love hard, but don't love foolish hard. Thank you. Good luck.. A showcase for PC graphics in it's day, leaving all console games behind. Also had great controls, effects and a rewarding story. Highly recommended.. This game is very **** a point where fun and satisfaction get absorbed out of the **** it is quite good and strangely funny P.S.Stealth is not possible dont try it. Was alright, but not great, too simple not interesting gameplay............... A Classic! I have completed it multiple times. It takes a little to get into the storyline, but once you are off to the jungle you cant stop playing.. This game was an awesome start for the Far Cry Series. Going back to the roots and seeing where this series once started is really interesting. All in all it is a good game, but considering Half Life 2 was released in the same year, Far Cry had no comparable special game mechanics at all. Its is basically “Get from Point A to Point B and shot on the way”. A few more gameplay mechanics would have been nice, because either way the story isn't really that intriguing.. I really didn’t like this game ... Yes, I didn’t give it a low rating, because there were interesting moments and the general story and game-play were pleasant until a certain moment ... but then the author's brain was blown away and the whole monster's appearance killed the interest that went down the drain. And the very end was infuriated with the incredibly overpriced difficulty of the last zone and the completely useless and uninteresting ending when you climb the stairs ...it was stupid.. I'm forced to type 75 letters to this review when I'd just need 1 word: MASTERPIECE. Everything is fantastic! Graphics, sounds, atmosphere, enemies, vehicles, mechanincs, weapons, bynoculars, story, strategy. It's lot challenging, so you have to use your brain besides your shooting skills. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to run it with nVidia on Windows 7 onwards since you better play it on XP. A truly classic along with Half Life. Wonderful. All Time Game. Colorful graphics for 2004. The gameplay is not bad. The plot is quite controversial. Few weapons. The game is pretty hardcore. Enemies are not stupid, but rather smart guys. The levels are beautiful and memorable. The Cry Engine is a great engine, but demanding for 2004. The game gets me 8/10. Far cry 1 is a hard game and is certainly for hardcore game fans, to me this game was frustrating both due to its difficulty and a few clunky game mechanics *disclaimer* i used the F CAM mod while playing this and it was my first time playing it . i did this mostly to fix the AI because it dose have an issue with its AI being aim bot wall hackers . so if you are gonna play far cry this is a must have mod. Story: the story is LAUGHABLY bad , feels like a bad spy movie from the 80s ( and i actually loved it ) the bad guys are clearly bad , the hero reluctant , the woman sexy and ""bad ass"" at least she would be if he Ai when she follows you was better, And of course the guy behind the computer telling you where to go. its no wonder there was a movie made of this game , and even less of a wonder that the movie is even worst . that being said its awful story is occasionally funny and can be mostly ignored. Story: 4/10 World building: i think this games world is actually not bad despite its story , levels are designed really well, locations are beautiful. little touches like the mercs having nudie mags in their quarters. witch is a small detail that makes them feel like real people even if they are still just nameless henchmen. also there is alot of hang gliders so do they do sight seeing in their down time ?. there is enough enemy variety to show that the people do have different jobs even if they will all shoot at you. world building: 6.5/10 Graphics: the graphics are a little dated but not so dated that it makes you want to play the game. this is due to cryteks skill as graphical designers even if their later game (crysis) has aged better. like i said locations are beautiful. guns look modern and on the back drop of a tropical island makes it feel a little sci fi , the game has a decent visual style even if it isnt super fitting to the setting. graphics: 8/10 game play: the guns in this game feel great and are fun to use , the ragdoll physics have great player input to them and that makes the combat feel more satisfying. The driving also had some pretty good physics to it witch surprised me for a game that was released in 2004 . my gripes with the game are that it has a huge difficulty spike about half way through , when the targens show up ( these creatures that are basically mutants) the basic ones that run at you arnt a problem usually because they go down easy and usually have a lot of time to shoot them, and the ones that jump around might be a little hard to see some times but are no harder than the mercs . the worst ones are the invisible ones witch you need the heat seeking goggles for and the big bullet sponges with automatic rocket launchers witch arnt to hard if they come at you one at a time but there is multiple parts where you have to fight multiple and that is hair pullingly frustrating and those parts stealth is not an option. stealth is also pretty redundant through out the whole game even with the f cam mod. I luckily had quick saves because of the aforementioned F cam mod and i really dont think i could have beat ","this is one of the best games I have ever played, let alone completed . kudos to the people who created this game; it stands superbly well after 20 years . 20 levels to play, with open-world elements; some levels are inside the buildings ."
452.Nuclear Throne,"Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Easily one of my favorite Roguelikes out there, an adrenaline rush of fast paced action and chaos, its fantastic.. This **** is addictive. That's why it's so good. Play it. Play it. Just play iiiiiiiiit. Muuuuuy adictivo, quizás el mejor rogue-lite de la historia, buenardo Reeeeally addictive, probably the best rogue-lite of all time, **** amazing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Live classic in the form of a ""Beat them all"" roguelike in a post-apocalyptic setting. You just need a fast reaction. Works fine on notebook (Intel video) with Ubuntu 16.04.. pretty hardcore but its still the same level layout and weapons not enough content.. Normally I don't really play rogue likes but this one has me! Really fun and focuses on the core features of a rogue like. It's nothing new, but well executed. Good job!. Wonderful roguelike thats very fast paced and has a great amount of content. Gunplay is some of the best I've played in a game.. Nuclear Throne is a brilliant example of everything and anything that a top-down rogue-like shooter should strive to be and have. It's a game in which you play as one of many unique and different characters, each with their own special attributes and abilities and fight through all the enemies on any given floor. On each floor, you find new guns ammo and sometimes secrets. Your objective is to get as far as you can floor after floor, kill after kill, bullet after bullet. It's a very simple concept a mite more simple than other games that try and do this like Enter the Gungeon or Risk of Rain as they are a little more mechanically intensive than nuclear throne while this causes a slight lack of mechanical depth this is more than made up for in the simplistic fun the game offers. Everything from just shooting a new gun to destroying the nuclear throne itself feels good. out of the massive library of guns, you'll find not one doesn't feel good to shoot with and use. That's not to say that there aren't any bad guns as there are certainly some that are worse than others and others which are better. Which brings me to the next point of game balance. All of the game balance is done very well in terms of the player's arsenal as the way the game handles it is by giving the player some of the worse guns early on and holding the good stuff till later on, and when I say good stuff I mean Gatling rocket launchers and cluster nuke guns. While this is done very fairly, the game is a rogue-like and relies on replay-ability, while the guns early on are for the most part bad if you are lucky you could just come across a heavy crossbow and other weapons a cut above the cloth from the first level standard. In terms of the game's aesthetics, the pixel art is both wacky cool and imaginative with funny and unique art for the enemies and bosses. On the other hand due to the simplistic gameplay and the simple geometry of the rooms gameplay can get repetitive for some but I find that to be a factor more dependant on the player than it is the game. Overall I think nuclear throne is a fantastic example of what a good roguelike shooter should be like, fun gameplay fantastic replayability and an encouragement to keep playing to experience all the content.. Great game and an excellent innovative mechanics, the best and most addictive of the last years. The issue with games like Nuclear Throne, Crypt of The Necrodancer, Enter the Gungeon, et cetera, is that it's one of those games where you get crazy good at the first handful of levels. With rather unforgiving gameplay, the sheer amount of **** it'll throw at you at random times, and lack of any form of retaining progress means you'll end up really liking seeing Desert and Sewer over and over again, or make the time commit to become psychotically good. Case in point, I was having a awesome run, encountered a whole crap ton of enemies huddled around something I couldn't identify. I open fire, suddenly the unknown diamond thing explodes, lights up, and cut to the Nuclear police (???) beaming in and murdering me dead regardless of Halo. All of that took place over the course of about 2 seconds. Maybe the Rogue-like genre isn't for me? Though I don't quite grasp the mindset that enjoys potentially having a amazing run ended by the slightest mistake, which can very easily happen as early as level 2-1 with frogs things that explode and ninjas that can and will take out all of your health in 1 hit with practically no warning. It's good, it's fun, but like other games like it, the lack of literally any form of progress retention breaks it a bit for me, and at the time of writing, I'm really getting sick of seeing the desert because I didn't notice the one ninja in the cloud of enemies and bullets that took me from 12 HP to 0 in 1 hit.. This game is an amazing, responsive, and merciless roguelike ; the characters are very differents, and the mutations bring you so much differents gameplays, you could play this game for hours and hours without getting bored, I really think it deserves a 9/10, (no game is perfect). Seems like a fun game but can't really play it at 30fps, gives headache after 10 minutes. No dlc and loads of content, if you have no problem with 30fps I really recommend it.. My first review was excessively harsh relative to the amount of time I spent on the game. It does not mean the game is accessible and will stay a source of frustration put aside and forgotten by most. And the ZERO support and communication from Vlambeer post release still puts me off to buy any more of their products in the future. When you express yourself so obnoxiously, don't expect people to be nice with you afterwards and go pout in the corner because people were mean to you.. Vlambeer is one of my favorite indie developers for several reasons. I've seen the devs quite a bit in various videogame documentaries and so to some small extent I feel like I know them. A consist level of quality, along with their unique retro-style, can be found across their various titles. Its in the aesthetics that there games really shine, from the beautiful art to the superb sound design. Yet, as much as I like the studio for some reason I have yet to really fall in love with any of their games. This is not to say Nuclear Throne is bad by any means but there just isn't quite enough there to keep me coming back. So from what I understand this game takes place after a nuclear fallout and the mutated creatures that spawned from the event are competing with each other to be the best in order to eventually reach the illustrious heights of the Nuclear Throne. That is all the story you're getting because this game is clearly focused on gameplay. In Nuclear Throne you're simply dropped into a room where you have to kill all the enemies. Once thats done you're **** into a warp hole where you'll teleport to the next level where you'll do the exact same thing. As you progress you'll be rewarded experience and every time you level up you'll get to choose between four random upgrades to aid you in the increasing challenging battles. As you can imagine, with such a simple concept there must be a variety in the means of which you clear these rooms. There is a handful playable characters each with a unique special power and passive trait. Thankfully, you'll find a good selection of weapons as you fighting for your life. There are five different ammo types including bullets, shells, bolts, etc which leads you find different kinds of machine guns, crossbows, shotguns, and so on. For the most part they all feel quite good and its easy to quickly find your preferences. This is an intense, fast-paced game, and you'll need to be able to adapt quickly as the enemies will be shooting right back at you. With the cross-hairs a fair distance from your character aiming can be quite a challenge in itself. Its the visuals and sound effects that really make this game worthwhile. The guns in this game sound like they really got some nice kick to them. All the playable characters and enemies look great. There is a lot of charm in the theme of this game. This is really important because the gameplay can get quite repetitive. Even though the maps are procedurally generated you're basically always stuck fighting in fairly cramped arenas. Every two or three levels you will face a different group of enemies but after you've played several times the battles tend to all feel pretty similar. That being said you'll always being on the edge of your seat trying to make every shot count while at the same time trying to avoid the onslaught of enemy fire. The fact is this is a simple shoot-em up. There is nothing wrong with that if thats what you're in to just don't expect much more. Since this is such a though game the hope is that you'll keep learning as play and just get a little bit farther after each attempt. Since this is a rogue-like once you die thats it, you have to start right at the beginning and there is nothing to carry over from one run to the next. This is a game the requires a lot of dedication for mastery. Although I personally don't have the patience to get really good I did have fun while playing this game. I would only recommend it to those who really think they're up for a challenge.. Nice Soundtrack. Nice Gameplay Difficult. A really big weapon chart. Bullet Hell. Well, I really love this game, It's addictive, and really fun, something I noticed about enemies is that they love to rise the game difficulty, that's something I really like about. -Fish Can Roll-. Nuclear Throne is a super fun game in which I've sunk a wild, fast-paced, 12 hours ... but it's also super hard. Anyone that doesn't enjoy difficult games should turn away right now, but those of you (us) who enjoy a punishing rogue-like with massive explosions, and a variety of guns BUY NOW. Controls are super tight, though occasionally when trying to shoot in tight spaces you shoot the wall for a while (which can be kind of annoying). That's my only real gripe, and that occasionally the game lags when there is a lot happening on screen, but that's being very nit-picky. Blowing away/up a multitude of mutants is a pretty enjoyable endeavor.. Pretty damn great 8 - bit game that I really enjoyed. At first I didn't want to play it,it seemed boring and repetitive but than I actually played and HOLY CHICKEN was it good. It is super addictive and hell of a lot of fun , especially when you unlock a crazy gun blazing jacked scientist STEROIDS. So this game is just great I don't know what to add, you have to play this, it is amazing.. A Cathartic, Fast-Paced, Weighty, and Polished shooter, Bombarding the player with absolute anarchy, and yet, a strange meditative bliss, felt as one becomes lost in the anarchic rhythm of war, fingers jumping between keys as one bobs, weaves, and shoots, trying hard as they might to live for just one more level. The Sound design is incredible, every gun has its own distinct noise which feels natural and cathartic, aided by the screenshake which makes sure every gun feels powerful, and the combat feels satisfying and weighty. The Weapons start off slightly mundane, but later in the game, Weapons such as the “Grenade Shotgun” “Double Minigun” and “Ultra Plasma Cannon” reveal Vlambeer’s inner child. Each of the characters are adorably fun and have their own personality and identity provided in a simple character select screen rather than a professionally rendered, 30 minute long cutscene filled with droning exposition, as some AAA developers would do instead if they got their hands on Nuclear Throne. One character, the triangular, gangster-rapping prince of venus, YV, is an import from Vlambeer’s freeware spiritual successor to Doom, Gun Godz. Another, Aptly named Steroids, is a brawny man who can dual wield miniguns, is immediately given a softer side, when, in the select screen, is seen with spectacles reading a book. Though this is a new game, and it brings new tricks, it has old sensibilities, mainly, a focus on something many games have attempted to abandon to appear more professional, Fun. Vlambeer has created a raucous, roaring, rip-rollingly fun shooter that is not afraid to put on its party hat, raise its comically large ultra grenade minigun into the air, and have a goddamn party.. Nuclear Throne is an awesome game. It's fun, has a lot of content to unlock and is very challenging. The game is very challenging. It took me 20+ hours to make it to the end, so this game probably isn’t for you if you don’t like brutally hard games. Almost everything about this game is solid, the tight and responsive controls, the many unique enemies and guns, the awesome visuals (if you like pixel art). There’s a lot of play-ability in this game and even a two player mode, making twelve dollars a great price for this on steam. Throw your money at Vlambeer and play this game! The game does have some weak aspects though, such it’s lack of character and mutation variety. The game has twelve different character to play with, each with their own abilities and perks. But your play style doesn’t usually change from character to character. You'll find yourself taking the same mutations, the same guns and ultimately playing games which don't differ to much from your past play through’s. Two characters are an exception to this, Melting and Rouge who change which perks you take and how the game operates, making playing with these two characters a unique experience. While the other characters are unique and well designed, you’ll fight enemies in more or less the same way, take the same guns and take the same mutations. The mutations (or perks) in this game are cool, but have a clear order in how you take them. Some mutations are always better than others. This lack of variety is the game’s main downfall in my eyes, but it’ll still keep you playing for a long time and is one of my favorite rouge-likes out there.I give this a 9/10. :D. Is fine but nothing exceptional. Is like The binding of isaac but more simple and more difficult, the characters are boring and the feel is similar. The secrets are impossible to discover by yourself, the game depend the internet to see more 50% of the game.. This is probably the best rouge-like in terms of playability and longevity. I've been physically unable to stop playing it at points. There are enough guns and power-ups to keep things always seeming fresh, the difficulty curve is logical and extremely challenging and there are enough decent playable characters, with varied skill sets and all on a par in terms of power. Great music too and the sound effects really give you a sense of the power behind the weapons. a nice small game. very fun. why 7? cause i hate the trend of making a game rouge like as an excuse for a small amount of content. a good rouge like should be like ftl. every playthrough is awesome and UNIQUE. WOW! This game doesn't deserve the 90 percent that the critics are giving it. All though it's pretty fun. So... on with they review then: Pros: -The pixel graphics. I don't know what is it about pixel graphics but they just **** me in. I love the graphical style and it looks great -Thankfully the most important part of the game (the gun play) is fun. It feels very good to blow your enemies to smithereens and to get just that right gun to get you a little further. But now on to the cons Cons: -The characters feel the same. I know each one has different special abilities but i want something more damn it. How about different speeds of walking, different bullets for each character, hell even different stages for each character. But no the only difference is their special ability. - As you guys probably know this is a rogue-like. And i am not a huge fan of the genre. It just feels like a cheap way to make games harder so that you can play them longer. I have the same problem with Binding of Isac and Rogue Legacy but Nuclear throne at least isn't very cheap. So yeah, if you enjoy this kind of game go right ahead but for me it's just a decent time waster.. This game feels great, it has amazing sound and music, huge variety in gameplay and is incredibly addictive. Memorable characters and loading screen tips create quite a bit of untold narrative. I've sunk 100's of hours into this game and intend to add many more. Do yourselves a favour and have a swatch.. Great game, maybe an excellent one, but I personally feel that it lacks something. It's a game that I choose to play when I have to ""fill time"", and I have a great time, but doesn't make me choose the game over others or see where in the time table can I make a gap to play it. A great Indie game but for me it lacks ""ambition"".. Nuclear Throne is a very fun and insanely difficult rouge like. Many people who may dislike the game may have played it during the beta but now that the game is released everything is cleared up. Most of the time you will 100% lose after playing it for around 50 hours I've only gotten to the last stage 3 times. The upgrade mechanics are spot on most of which being applied to classes (pictures of the character it displays doesn't mean its better for that one in particular) The weapons are great and going through ares to find a new gun is one of the best feelings unless its explosive in which case avoid it completely because you will blow yourself up 9/10 times. Enemies can be very punishing if u don't take care of the bigger ones first as some might swarm you and devour your soul as they 1 hit you before the final stage. Overall its a very fun compelling game if you want a challenge and expect to play over and over to master it.. A brilliantly simple rogue-like top-down shooter. It's hard, but is designed to be played in small chunks. A single run that gets about halfway through the entire thing lasts maybe 10-15 minutes? Various power-ups as you level-up during a run, a paucity of ammo, and a handful of unlockable characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, add to tactical depth of this game.. This Game makes you angry it makes you happy and makes you sad The chaos in this game is brilliant Funny weapons Wide variety Of perks (mutations) And The late game gets ridiculous on how many enemies that appear. The Silly guns are normally the best but the most slow at firing. ALSO LASERS. Amazingly addictive and fun to play. You must try it Yourself, to get hooked up, because it doesnt look as awesome as it really is when somebody else is playing it. Im waiting for PS VITA release. Itll be awesome :D I want this and broforce on the go. The downside is waiting time for release, but thats ok I guess I bought luftrausers and it lacked the love that nuclear throne gets from devs.. This game gets 9/10 from me, only because no game is perfect. Despite a few certain shortcomings, nuclear throne has been my favorite game this year. Tight controls, fast gameplay, interesting locations, amazing art, great sound design, brutal but still fair, this game has everything I find fun.. Nuclear Throne is pure, unadulterated chaos on top of a set of evolving and tight controls. Things will try to kill you, and you need to learn exactly how many hits each enemy takes, how each of the multitudinous weapons deals damage, how the mutations work alongside weapons and character traits, what particular types of terrain and obstacles do, etc. - otherwise, you'll fall apart in this randomly-generated top-down shooter. It's brutal! That's part of the fun - even the developers often have a hard time getting past World 5. [@GenoTS - that chest is called a ""Mimic,"" and having no indicator that it's a mimic is the whole point of the enemy, a la Dark Souls. It's supposed to be tough!] Coming up on its 30th update, the team has been squashing bugs and making new stuff, while broadcasting their work on Twitch. They've almost reached their creation of the final level now. The soundtrack is awesome. The pixel art is expressive, weird, and cool. There are some really freaking cool secrets, and also some secrets that will kill you.. Nuclear Throne does a fantastic job at filling the role of a mere ""shooter"", but after your first glance, you'll see that the game-play is deceptively strategic. While *extremely* difficult, it never feels ""cheap"". Prepare yourself for one of the most addictive games to come out this year. At present, the game is not complete but as it stands right now, it's easily worthy of a 9.0 score. That said, the developers are quite prolific in their efforts (with updates like every week) and I have no doubt that Nuclear Throne will retain its worthiness of such a high score (if it doesn't exceed it, that is).","""nuclear throne"" is one of my favorite roguelikes out there . it's an adrenaline rush of fast paced action and chaos, its fantastic . it's a great example of everything a top-down rogue-like shooter should strive to be ."
453.Dead Space (2008),"Terrifying, visceral experience. Excels at sustained tension and jump scares both. Gory and unrelenting combat. The limb-severing mechanic nicely inverts a usual gaming trope and provides a ton of panic to normally mundane combat situations. The mood is eerie, the Ishimura a fantastic setting, the story creepy and despairing. An instant classic and one that still holds up today.. Oh, this game, why did I play you so late? It's great, I played it without getting bored, I'm so angry at myself, this game is a masterpiece, and they compare it to Mass Effect, it's like a joke.. A survival horror classic. It's ""Bioshock"" meets ""Resident Evil 4"". This game is truly scary. Through the clever use of lighting, shadows and sound effects, it puts the player on the edge of their seat. Sometimes, you might be spooked by the unsettling atmosphere. But then suddenly, a wave of xenomorphs will be right in front of you. The sci-fi setting is reminiscent of ""Alien"" and it is very convincing. There's also just a hint of ""Event Horizon"" in the design. Overall, ""Dead Space "" is a great game. The presentation is brilliant, the story is engaging and the action is intense. I would rate this with a 9 out of 10.. Dead Space is one of the best survival horror game ever made with a captivating gameplay, original characters and brilliant graphics for their time. The characters in the story are well built and the gameplay is one of the best. I can't say the same about the gamestory which lacks originality and has few confusing elements. Nevertheless the plot has an interesting progress and the 12 hours that I spent in Dead Space were totally worthwhile. Overall, these are my ratings for the game sections: Gameplay 4.5 / 5; Story 2.3 / 5; Characters 4 / 5; Video department 4 / 5; Audio department 2 / 5; User interface 2.7 / 5.. This game attracted my attention at first, but then the horror sequences seemed simple to me. People get bored when it's always the same.I looking for differences.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dead Space came out of practically nowhere to be one of the best horror games of its console generation. Dead Space takes some inspiration from Resident Evil 4, though it limits the action and cranks up the horror, and introduces an incredibly smart and fun mechanic with the focus of severing enemy limbs rather than just mindlessly shooting.. Incredible game. Is very immersive using very minimal HUD elements. The game is intense and is actually scary at times. The story is decent even though Isaac does not speak.. Dead Space is the quintessential survival horror experience. The level of care and passion in this project is unrivalled, and, in the 14 years since its release, no game has ever come close to touching the sheer terror that is Visceral Games’ (RIP) terrifying masterpiece.. It gets boring and repetitive towards the end, and the enemy designs are generic. But i had a lot of fun playing this game with my cousin when it was released. The game is actually really good. The atmosphere is everything. For me, this is a game after the ship exploded, I was not afraid. For everything is already predictable and understandable. The main disadvantage is the same type of Ishimura corridors. It really infuriates, because in the course of the whole plot you run along the same type of corridors. Because of this, it is difficult to pass the game in one gulp. And yes, the game is very good. She has not a bad lore, a cool combat system. And the graphics are very good for their time. So a well-deserved 8.. Resident Evil meets Alien in this space-bound survival horror. Very nicely designed with some genuinely creepy moments and bags of atmosphere make this ne of the few copycats that actually manages to surpass its inspiration. A great spinetingler in space.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I usually don't play horror games because they all feel the same but this game oooh man this is probably my fav horror game. Atmospherically just absolutely amazing and the combat is great. A horror game in 3rd person and with this heavy of a focus on combat shouldn't work as well as it does, but this game is just all around masterfully designed.. A NORMAL JOURNEY INTO THE SPACE BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game has been played on Xbox 360 and completed in every mode it offers, eventually achieving platinum trophy. QUARANTINE PROTOCOL ACTIVATED: The game starts by introducing, thanks to a cutscene, the game world setting. Immediately the player finds himself on the giant planet cracker USG Ishimura, a large spaceship used to dig into unknown planets' ground. Apparently no life forms are visible on the ship; this leads shortly thereafter to the player's discovery of the game's main encounter, the Necromorphs, deformed and repulsive creatures that would appear to be generated from the corpses of the former inhabitants of this ship. From there on, the adventure will be divided between uncovering the mystery of these absurd entities and managing to escape this spaceship safely. DISMEMBERING NECROMORPHS: The gameplay of the first Dead Space is that of a true Horror action, and I place the word horror first intentionally, since the focus of the game is on the horror part, as opposed to the third chapter of the trilogy; the gloomy atmosphere of the environment, the noises and cries produced by the Necromorphs rumbling through the hollowness of the spaceship, the rivers of blood flowing through the floors and those horrific scenes of death that Isaac will unfortunately have to endure in the adventure make the definition of the game genre clear. Right from the start, the player is launched in a chasing sequence, running from these monstrosities and then trying to find a way to succeed in counter attacking them, using various weapons unlockable as the game progresses through collectible schemes. The variety of weapons is quite decent for a game of this genre, and gives a lot of freedom to different styles of play. The game difficulty is neither too exaggerated to make it too horror, nor too easy to make it pure action. There are some environmental puzzles present, but they are quite simple and intuitive enough to become a feature of the game; there are also some rather interesting zero-gravity sections for a 2008 game. HOME IS FAR: Graphically Dead Space is a gem of the horror genre. This setting in space turns out to be one of the most beautiful seen so far, as well as one of the most inspired. The use of lights and shadows, Necromorphs passing through walls, dislodging cables and walls, and the proper use of color gradations make the game extremely immersive and scary. Let us be clear, this is not a horror game dedicated to jumpscare as it relies heavily on atmosphere, as already pointed out. The aesthetics of the various enemies and corpses also make it more gore and not very reassuring. Finally, there are a lot of death animations present; almost anything in the game that can kill you will delight the player with customized and very distinctive death scenes at times. HEARING NOISES: Dead Space excels here as well, using sound to add the excitement that the visual side cannot; the fear of approaching footsteps or behind a door, the frightening noises heard in the background, and even the frightening silence of the void give an essential addition to the final composition. The very accuracy of the resonant audio in space is also excellent. Little gem is the use of a very apt song in the game intro and trailer. Achievements: The achievements point turns out to be rather simple in this chapter of the trilogy, complete the game on normal difficulty, then do it in hardcore (with saves fortunately) and only with the gun. At least personally I found it extremely fun as an achievement. If this is frustrating for you, avoid thinking of getting the platinum trophy for the two sequels, because those will turn out to be hell on earth. BUT WHY 8? PROS: The game boasts numerous merits that defined a branch of the horror genre and in some ways are unmatched to this day; the sublime aesthetics combined with excellent level and audio design creates a near perfect symbiosis. The game is also really long for the genre and provides many diverse hours of gameplay. CONS: A couple of cons of the game are certainly the absence of special modes besides mere difficulty differences, something added later in the sequels, rightly so. Also, the clunkiness of the game's movements could be a small problem, which, however, is justifiable being the first title. Finally, the extreme difficulty in upgrading the various weapons, several playthroughs being required to complete them, leads to fatigue for those who want to upgrade them all. RATING Gameplay: 8 Music:8 Story: 7 Horror: 9 _. One of if not the best horror games ever made. It does everything right in the atmosphere and setting department. The HUD is also very cool and interesting. The game feels a lot like Resident Evil 4, which I like. It expands upon that concept and it works wonderfully. The level design and upgrade system is great, and the story is pretty good too. It builds upon the survival horror genre and delivers an absolute masterpiece ****.. A survival horror masterpiece. I would rank this one up with the GameCube remake of ""Resident Evil"". Gameplay is like a mix of ""Resident Evil 4"" and ""Bioshock"". It's terrifying and suspenseful. Movie fans will see the influence of ""Alien"", ""The Thing"" and ""Event Horizon"". If you've never played ""Dead Space"" before, then do so on the Xbox. It has a better framerate, a higher resolution and more colors than the PS3 version. I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. masterpiece i like this great game i was reeled in more because of the violence and the killings. The atmosphere in this game perfect, every sound and noise creates tension and is incorporated into helping the player playing the game by letting them know where enemies are in the environment. The lighting is amazing and is used to create spooky shadows in hallways or light up a torn apart corpse on the ground for the player to notice. The mechanics are slightly clunky, but this actually adds to the horror panic feel when you are fighting enemies in confined dark areas. The weapon upgrade and loot gathering system is so fun and allows players to upgrade weapons and their suit to help them survive the enemies and environmental areas with no oxygen. The story and characters are awesome and greatly add to the horror sci-fi of the game as well as the mystery of what is going on and caused the outbreak on the Ishimura. This game does everything great and the slightly clunky controls only help improve the horror aspect.. This is one of the best Horror games ever made and it's a must play the atmosphere, setting, gameplay and story all complement each other and add to the horror. Ive played this game on 360, PS3, and now on my SeriesX. Its a long story but i never finished it each time i played it, but not because i was bored or it was a bad game, just bad timing. Now im finally finishing it up! One of the best horror games ive ever played. In fact its one of the best videogames period. And after 14 years it still looks damn good! 10 out of 10 for this masterpiece.. Yeah..first time! Approx. 9 hours and 515 gamerscore. Dead Space was quite fun, demanding and very atmospheric. story Everything about the marker, the creatures and what was going on on the ship has continuously encouraged us to keep going. The whole thing was accompanied by audiologs, files for reading and a few communications with ship members. I was entertained, the ""twist"" at the end was good but not necessarily surprising. You know it, you shouldn't trust anyone in the game anyway. The characterization of Isaac was interesting enough to give the main character enough profile, although you are really only in your armor all the time and I will definitely play part 2 and 3 (when, exactly, I don't know). All in all, it was told in a neat and structured way. The only thing that was annoying was that I had to fix everything over and over again, basically doing the work for everyone (even if there was only one button to press), but it suited my figure. Gameplay Very nice that you could upgrade your weapons and equipment, although I didn't even begin to find enough knots. Also, the ingame money wasn't just useless stuff to keep, it was really needed for ammunition and suit upgrades. I often find it in games that I hardly use the ingame money. The opponent diversity was extremely strong and surprising, there are all sorts of different and also very challenging aliens. Removing the critters' legs or arms over and over again was very cool and also had a certain tactical depth. In some sections of a section you could at least keep some of the opponents at a distance so that you could take care of others. The individual weapons were also very different, even if I mainly used the plasma cutter and this sawthrower. I found the sound of the guns rather unsatisfactory, but the plasma cutter was nice and hearty. Also the repetitive mentioned above, fix here fix there, was a bit boring. Moving this platform over and over again in the last mission was not so firm. For this, the boss was made cool but relatively easy. the atmosphere A bit older in terms of graphics, of course, but the remake will certainly help. Still, Dead Space creates an incredible atmosphere on this alien infested ship. In its narrow corridors, the creatures wandering around in the air shafts, the play of light and the music, the staging is probably the greatest strength. You very often get goose bumps and have to get out of very difficult situations one or the other time. The sections of the ship just look really good and the game breathes sci-fi horror. Conclusion Great game and, despite its age, still absolutely recommendable. A game that you should have played and therefore more than 8/10 crawling aliens.. Dead Space is the classic action horror along with Resident Evil 4 and is a very good one at that. Even now horror games struggle to have interesting and challenging mechanics and will usually forgo combat because of it, or it will be completely lackluster. Dead Space does a great balance of this, not leaning towards horror game or action with the combat. It has a great idea regarding aiming for limbs and that really was something that was fascinating. Unfortunately, this game isn't as good as everyone says. The level design doesn't leave that much room for creativity except for a few interesting areas, and the gimmicks get real old real quick for how much they are used. The constant wondering in anti-gravity situations, the two turret sections, and the awkwardness of Isaac being a silent protagonist hurts the game more than helps. I feel that the remake might address these issues, but the original definitely isn't better than the later entry, Dead Space 2. I feel that the pacing was terrible because it was constant 'to escape we just need to do this one thing' and the moment you finish that task you immediately have another issue again, and this is repeated over and over almost until the very ending of the game. It kept pulling me under the run and really made Isaac look like a loser who has no agency over himself. He is just told 'do this and this' and doesn't show any emotion until the end. Along with that, I feel that a lot of the xenomorphs are great and very fun to fight except the babies with the tentacles that pop out that show up way too often. Fighting in the anti-gravity also wasn't fun either, and it was really janky to actually do. Still, these complaints are my own, and I know a lot of the hallway level design of the shop is what made people like this game but to me, I would've preferred open worlds for xenomorphs to hide in and attack from the shadows as well as easily encircle you, rather than only being able to come from two different ways. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who likes horror and the lore is great, but the cracks have shown through the age. While I didn't originally think a remake was necessary, after replaying the game I have to disagree with that idea now, and I'm excited to see what they'll change with it and hopefully they are good ideas that carry the series forward.. Great game with a creepy feeling while you place that something will jump out of nowhere. Love it.. An amazing game who is only fault it is kind of easy at the end, I really like this game I have played it for so many years now but it always has the same problem that the endgame gets kind of toothless, the game most unique quality is the you have to cut enemies lims to kill dem , and effect that Scientology is the main villain in this game is just awesome, this is one of the best horror games ever created you have played. An excellent game. With a story worthy of the good space horror films on which it is based and good doses of action in a nightmarish environment, on a ship where something very strange has happened and has turned the former crew members into terrible creatures, the necromorphs. I don't give it a perfect score because I found the game a bit simple and linear, until the end where ammo and first aid kits start to get really scarce and that's when it becomes a real survival horror. I will play the next installments. 100% recommended. 1/27/21-2/2/21 100% Story Some parts were a little frustrating and the enemies were a bit irritating, what with having to dismember them all differently, but this game definitely had an excellent story and atmosphere! You've got Isaac Clarke, engineer extraordinaire, trying to piece together the mystery of what happened to a giant mining spaceship that appears to have been abandoned. Fairly soon he finds out there are some monsters on the ship that want to eat his face (which is usually obscured by a helmet, incidentally.) The story kind of reminded me of Resident Evil mixed with Bioshock, which is an excellent combination. I will absolutely admit that there were at least two story sections that made me want to drop the game (both dealing with large asteroids-either shooting them or climbing on them) but I'm glad I stuck with it. There are definitely some memorable settings and boss battles, as well as first-encounters with certain enemies that were done very well. The shooting takes a bit of thinking, but once you get used to the dismemberment mechanic, it can make you feel very skilled. It also helps that they have an excellent upgrade system that makes you want to search every room, even it if means you have to juggle things around in your inventory. Just short of the mark on “perfect”, but it is a very well told story and an amazing horror game for sure!. This game has the ideal atmosphere needed for a sci-fi horror game. Everything included within the gameplay is upmost intense, from the freakish creatures to the blasting of your weapon. Personally I think this is one of the best shooter, horror game to date. It is impossible to get bored of the walkthrough and there is never a point were you would find the game too easy. It is great.. Basically a perfect game. Binge played 1&2 back to back during lockdown. Perfect combination of atmosphere, puzzle solving and action. And ambience is incredible. Genuinely spooky in places. Fantastic horror game the gameplay and atmosphere are all on point. I love the setting in space and the enemy designs and how you got to delimb them is so fun. And the inclusion of new game plus gives it good replay value. My only real complaint would be the lack of good bosses the final boss i found to be to easy.. Great game, really my only complaint is that it started to get a bit repetitive about 7 or so hours into the game. But other than that, it's all solid, ESPECIALLY in terms of graphics. If you told me this game came out in 2014 on XB1 and PS4, I would nod my head like crazy.. Blood, gore, violence, a decent original story with a good plot twist. Everything you need for a great horror game.. My first contact with Dead Space was on Xbox 360 and it was an unforgettable experience. Resident Evil meets Gears of War with a setting in a giant spaceship, Aliens style. The gameplay is just perfect with some innovative features and a good balance between intense fights and puzzle times. I picked it up later on PC, and I still play it often, every 2 years, just to say how much I love this game ! You can try it for sure.. After originally completing this game once or twice back in 2010, I decided to return to the USG Ishimura and try my hand at 'Impossible' difficulty for another playthrough. And boy, am I glad I did. This most recent venture has ensured Dead Space is concreted as one of my top 5 games of all time. The story, the pacing, the survival elements, relatively forgiving checkpoint system, etc. all make for a quality blend of action and suspense. Especially on the hardest difficulty, I was often finding ways to simply escape enemies as opposed to blowing them all into meaty chunks (which NEVER gets old by the way). For those who haven't played the game before, you're actively encouraged to dismember enemies by shooting the limbs off them – as headshots do minimal damage. Most enemies will need 2 or 3 limbs removed to go down, and they'll continue to hobble or crawl towards you depending on what you've already removed until you put them down for good. But what this game has in oodles which I didn't appreciate fully until this most recent playthrough is AMBIENCE. I'm playing the game through my surround sound system this time (must've just used TV speakers 10 years ago) and some of the things your hear are downright unnerving. Whispered, often unintelligible voices uttering phrases in the corners of your mind as you explore a decrepit toilet block, someone singing a disjointed version of a children's nursery rhyme echoing through the air ducts and corridors, the faint yet distinct wail of infants no doubt already corrupted by the evils onboard.. or simply the clatter and clank of what's probably just a misplaced wrench being dislodged as you walk on by. Needless to say I couldn't get enough, so went back for one more round this week get 100% of the achievements! Done! :D. This is one of the all time best survival horror games. People even complained that it was too tense. If you haven’t played this game you must find it.. Amazing game. If you love Science fiction/horror movies like Alien, Aliens, Pandorum, this is definitely a must play.. So Good, so gooooooood. Ahead of its time. Till to this day anyone picking this game up will not regret it, dirt cheap 10 years later.. pros: excellent atmosphere, creepy monsters and a interesting way to kill them, satisfying weapons cons: a bit predictable at times, too reliant on jumpscares, ammo is to plentifull (on normal anyways) overall enjoyable survival horror game and a must play for fans of the aliens franchise. RIP Visceral.. Such a great mix of action and horror. this is one of the best horror, sci fi, action, shooter game for along time its has great graphic, awesome game-play, good story, satisfying ending and many more. every at least try this once at a live time.. The most terrible thing in the game is the same places and its also awful a control under Isaac There are not variousity but the game has the atmosphere. I played this ages ago, but in honour of Visceral's demise I feel I should add my two cents. I first saw game-play for this game on TV with Geoff Keighley on GT TV on Spike. I was intrigued, but didn't know how great the game would be in the end. I figured I'd give it a try. What followed was 2-3 days ( I had school to go to) of horror, tense heart pounding action, atmospheric exploration, and just over all an incredible experience I've never had the pleasure of again. The sequels are not as compelling and feel cheapened a bit, but this first entry... it was phenomenal. A true classic that will forever live in the annals of Vidja Gams.. Dead Space is a great game that still has me convinced that it takes ideas from Resident Evil 4, apply a mixture of Alien and Ben Carpenter's The Thing, and you have a very unsettling and terrifying survival horror game. The Ishimura is a huge ship packed to the brim with monsters and creatures that make tension all the more noted. Seeing Isaac swing his tools to knockback targets and stomp floor level enemies while grunting the whole way is really great, and using the dismemberment concept is very clever even if it makes the game easier on newer playthroughs. Of course if you want a challenge, you can always start on higher difficulties like Impossible and Hard mode. The HUD system is very creative and in some ways outstanding because it allows better immersion and realism to Isaac's condition when the player looks at his spine RIG for health, his stasis battery on his back too, his inventory in a hologram projection from his body and a ammo counter shown only on the weapon when he aims it. It makes the immersion flow really well. Adding to that virtually no cutscenes or loading times aside from booting up the game or a new chapter, and the game plays so well and consistent that I never felt bogged down. Isaac isn't a fast guy (he's wearing a space suit obviously) but to hear his heartbeat and grunt as he moves around is really genius to make the player feel like him, like we are in his shoes when things go to hell. The atmosphere nails it. I very rarely found any part of Dead Space lacking. The ship's different areas and levels might have seemed mundane and realistically plain, but adding the grotesque alien tissue, blood, corpses and weird cult like symbols everywhere (esp in the final chapter) and you get a unnerving experience. The no oxygen space sequences are very memorable not so much for the objectives, but just the fact that it felt so real and like how sound in space would work. The shadow and lighting (at its time) was unmatched by game prior to, and I'd wager it was visually one of the best looking games of that decade (2000-2010). The combat and upgrade system was definitely good. I like the dismembering of limbs and seeing a ripper saw through a Necromorph limb really feels great. The grapple breaks and death scenes are vicious and outstanding in terms of horror and even tend to go on longer than you would like to watch it for. The story was okay with Isaac and his team crashing on a ship and desperate to get out when they learn first hand of the alien creatures on board. Lots of fetching and ordering on poor Isaac, which I consider an issue and con of the game, but what sold me was the loads of logs and audio recordings that detailed the mystery of the infection and colony outbreaks like one big conspiracy. Dead Space's world just felt so unknown and dangerous, playing on the concept of what we humans would want to see is out there in space should we ever leave orbit. It's not the first game or medium to do this, but the fact it made the alien threat far more sinister when tying ideas of Unitology into the mix and you get interesting theories that 2 and 3 would later answer (for better or worse). Dead Space to me is well done and excellent horror game that stole my heart for its world and mechanics. The only issues I have is the lack of other npcs having any real actions along side Isaac which instead is just serving as plot vehicles whenever Isaac completes an objective or acquires a new item. The bosses are a mixed bag; the Hunter is a very great fight that mixes the dismemberment mechanic and invincibility to make fights even more desperate whenever players are in a tough spot, but the Leviathan fight was pretty lame and could be hard for players struggling with resources, where unlike the Hunter players could at least shoot off a leg and run away and conserve ammo. The Hive Mind's first phase is pretty good, with a unique time limit event of which Isaac must shoot its weak spots while dangling thousands of feet up by its tentacles before he is eaten alive. The second part begins to fall apart though, as it only just repeats the same attacks and exposes its chest for damage. The shooting sequences like the asteroid and alien jamming comms also lack but its more in terms of fairness and luck than skill. Issues aside, it's a game still worth playing and I highly recommend it. Out of the trilogy, the original soars above its brothers as a testament to sci-fi horror games done right.. Just now playing for the first time in late 2016... Fun, dreadful atmosphere best experienced with earbuds and lights off. Great game looking forward to playing the rest of the series.. Dead Space is a rare, fully satisfying single-player only experience. One that nails the action-horror gameplay, if not so much the actual horror. It's actually not a scary game. Even with all of it's dark corridors and grotesque monsters I never found anything here that gave me any sort of fright. That may be a big disappointment for the horror enthusiast looking for the next thing that will scare them out of their pants, but there are still plenty of reasons to play it. For starters they nailed the atmosphere. The sense of loneliness and desperation complement the gameplay well. The sound is phenomenal and the graphics have aged remarkably well. The story doesn't evolve too much beyond it's ""stranded and looking for a way out"" setup, but there bits that hint at a larger mythology and what few characters there are were very well written. When it comes to the gameplay this is some of the most satisfying action I've experienced from the horror genre. The gunplay feels great and your limited resources mean that it always feels like you're just barely **** by. There are enough items scattered around to keep you going to the next checkpoint, but conserving your supplies is still necessary for survival. New enemies are introduced at a steady pace. The fact that you have to target and remove their limbs in order to actually kill them means these are more than just generic bullet sponges. Add in some special powers that tie into some great puzzles and you have an experience that stays fresh and tense all the way through. The only flaw I can find with the gameplay would be the mobility, or lack thereof. Your character ""Isaac"" isn't the fastest or most agile dude. This isn't a problem most of the time because you don't deal with too many enemies at once. However when the action gets more crowded and these surprisingly fast enemies have you cornered, you'll find yourself wishing Isaac would pick up the pace and get out of the way. A simple dodge-roll would have gone a long way. For what it lacks in actual horror, it makes up for with a well-paced story and mostly excellent gameplay. It might not be scary and it does have it's frustrating moments, but for the most part this is an excellent game. One with a fairly decent length (I beat it in a little over 8 hours) and high replay value. Dead Space is worth your time, horror fan or not.. Usually I don't play survival horror games but if there's one that gave me chills and even though got me inmersed in it, it was Dead Space. It has graphics that were very nice in the year it got released and they are still very great. Gameplay is above the average, it feels really cool to throw stasis to necromorphs, to dismember them... it feels really nice to play Dead Space. The level design is another very great hit, it has a lot of cool ideas and it may help to rise the fear sections. The sound is an excellent aspect of this game, it really has a very great inmerssion effect because the excellent work they did here. The story is somewhat strange but it's cool and makes you wonder from where did all this necromorphs came from. Pros: Graphics (in the releasing year and they are still ok), inmerssion, gammeplay, level design, characters, enemy design, sound Cons: Duration, some sound e","""Dead Space"" excels at sustained tension and jump scares both . the mood is eerie, the Ishimura a fantastic setting, the story creepy and despairing . the sci-fi setting is reminiscent of ""Alien"""
454.Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,"I'm a huge fan of the Yakuza series, and if you are too and play this game, it's impossible not to like it. The story introduces new characters who, as always, are very well developed and continues the mix of dramatic storytelling and over-the-top humor. The turn-based combat system has been significantly improved (it could still get better, but it's pretty solid), allowing for more freedom in choosing your moves. Of course, we also have our legendary Kiryu. I highly recommend it to all fans of the series and those who played Yakuza: Like a Dragon.. Amazing game. They improved the gameplay formula, added Kiryu as second protagonist and gave him an amazing hero's journey. Of cause the old characters return (except Eri) and the new ones are excellent. As the prequel it is a turn based RPG. You have levels, skills and jobs. Later I go more into details. The game takes place in Isezaki Iijinch in Yokohama and Honolulu City in Hawaii. Hawaii is a fresh an incredible setting. It works amazing and I like the exploration. The story is also really good for the franchise standards. It starts small with Ichiban taking a flight to Honolulu City as there is a chance that his mother, he thought dead, is still alive. However there is a more sinister plot at work. He is later joined by Kiryu who is still working in the shadows but has also a baggage I cant spoil. The story is really good. A lot of people say it is weaker than the prequel and I agree and disagree at the same time. Kiryus story is the most emotional ride in ages. It is immersive and emotional on a level I have not experienced in a long time. Ichibans story is a bit weaker but has also a lot f strong moments. I love the old and new characters. They always succeed here in the franchise. Gameplay wise it is the same like the last game but with improvements. Switching jobs is now worth it. It takes far less time to level up and you gain skills far earlier. So I switched a bit instead of avoiding any job changes. Also you can add a few skills from other jobs too. The battles feel good and I have used more varieties in battle (but fall back to some tactics more often). The side activities are excellent. Of cause there are the same mini games as always like Mahjong, poker, Koi, Koi, videogames etc. The bigger ones are the fun Pokemon inspired Sujimon Battles / League, Crazy Eats, the Photo Shot hunt and the Dondoko Island. I admit it can feel like it drags on a bit too muchbut I was entertained. Needless to say that there are other side quest, a facebook like challenge and more. Graphically they made a good game. It is not the best but has charm and style. Overall I give a 9/10. It won me over and I want to go even higher. If you like the previous game it will win you over easily too.. Downloaded the 10 hour trial. Seriously wtf. 3 hours in and all I've done is piss about at a job centre, find something to eat, dated and proposed to a girl on the 1st date and then gone after a clan... chapter 1 is so long and boring... even the fighting is ridiculous... I pray to God the Infinite wealth Pirate yakuza is improved over this game.. Honestly, this is probably the best game I've ever played, the story, the characters, the combat, the silly side quests, everything is perfect. A lot of studios this age miss the most crucial part of making a game, making it FUN, RGG did not.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved it, it did last a bit too long, and i did feel like hawaii was a bit boring. It had some really amazing moments with Kiryu in particular that i won't spoil. I think growing the map isn't always beneficial, I really loved Onomichi in Yakuza 6 because it felt packed to the brim, it felt so lovingly crafted and the lighting was stunning. Honolulu was a bit bland in comparison, and it could have been a settings issue but nothing looked that spectacular. Another issue I had was it kept putting it's side content front and center. You'll be at a dramatic part of the story (the whole story is dramatic) and all of a sudden you run into Professor Oak. The characters and Japanese voice acting is spectacular aside from Bryce. I really loved the romance thrown in with Ichiban. I'm not a huge JRPG fan but i was able to get through this by grinding and being overpowered most of the game, though i miss the brawler combat from previous entries i'm glad they're keeping it alive with the Gaiden series. I'm not 100% satisfied with how they left this game, and I absorbed every piece of content within aside from DLC which is why i'm leaving my rating as a 8.5 (9 on this scale). I played the original like a dragon for several hours before getting bored of the repetition and the characters. For some reason, infinite wealth was so much better for me. This time I connected to the story and the characters and the combat clicked more to me. An overall great game that is worth the time needed to finish.. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth takes the Yakuza series to new heights, offering an expansive, emotionally charged journey. Players can immerse themselves in a dual narrative starring Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu, exploring both the vibrant streets of Honolulu and the nostalgic Kamurocho. The game blends thrilling combat with deeply emotional character moments, though its lengthy runtime and shifting storylines can be overwhelming. Despite this, the wealth of side activities, including fun mini-games and dungeons, keeps things engaging. An excellent game, but the initially strong yet ultimately nonsensical plot and the yakuza protagonist playing Messiah detract from the experience. Great game, awesome battle but too similar to last game. Half of game is on the same locations from previous game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Graphics are a lot better than the common shimmering that was prevalent in Yakuza 7,story itself is long andengaging altough it shows that Ichiban is still years behind Kiryu when it comes to it so he takes a backseat even though we play 3/4 of the game as Ichiban. Combat is greatly improved, it's still a turn-based RPG but you must be active because of button prompts on attacks and active blocking on enemy turns as well as even positioning correctly on the battlefield to make chain attacks. Minigames are still as good as they were because they were already perfect since Yakuza 0 so every other game needs to look up to Yakuza/Like a Dragon series and take a note. Overall it was almost a perfect game if not for focusing on a worse protagonist(Ichiban) and RGG still not knowing how to make a compelling romance(the only exception is surprisingly Kaito Files dlc for Lost Judgment which handled protagonist love interest quite well).. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The gameplay is quite fascinating. It has a lot of mini games that will take you quite some time to explore. Some of the combat mechanics are improved compared to yakuza like a dragon. However, I am a little disappointed with the plot which was a bit shallow and not serious at all. Still though, it has the usual funny stuff like in other yakuza games which is a plus. The game world is very vibrant and alive. You can interact in a lot of ways with the environment and people. Overall, it is really worth it to get it if you want some yakuza fun.. A huge disappointment. While the gameplay is (appropriately) infinitely improved from RGG7, the story is abysmal and the tone feels like they wanted to play up to Reddit memes about the series being looney tunes nonsense. Hopefully not the Saints Row-ification of RGG, but it certainly feels like it.. All in all one of the strongest entries in the series. I really enjoyed the previous game's transition to turn based combat but here it seems they've improved it massively. Being able to pinball characters into each other and move your character around adds a new level of strategy to encounters. I also really appreciate that enemies no longer give you cheapshots when you try to attack a different enemy next to them. I think the new location works great. Hawaii is much more open so it's a lot easier to navigate without bumping into enemies and it adds a real sense of variety. Enemies are weirder than ever with a lot of variety as well and there are a lot of interesting new job types added. I also need to praise the sub stories as they were phenomenal. A great mix of hilarious and actually touching storylines. I also appreciate how over the top and insane some encounters can get as is often the case in these games. All in all a fantastic game that's very much worth playing.. LAD Infinite wealth was a really great sequal to LAD 7. I was excited from the announcement when they said that old protagnist Kiryu Kazuma would be back in this game and they did not disappoint. This game legit feels like a love letter to both old Yakuza fans and new fans of Like a dragon. They tried to appeal to both segments of the fanbase by having half of the game dedicated to Kiryu and reminiscing on his past as well as bringing back ""beat 'em up"" style of combat half way through the game. Which is why this game felt like a love letter to the fans without jeopardizing the quality. The combat is still fun as it was in LAD 7, a bunch of goofy attacks and essence moves that will change based on the job you give to the characters. If you played LAD 7, it's a lot like that, except it now has Kiryu's dragon awakening which allows him to go into free form beat 'em up mode and deal a bunch of damage to any enemies around him. The narrative of the game was okay, it was pretty linear and not as surprising as the last game's narrative was, but still a passable story. The gameplay loops are in my opinion the best part of the game, so much stuff to run around and interact with. A lot of minigames from LAD 7 came back like the can collecting, along with new minigames in Hawaii such as a pseudo door-dash minigame where you deliver food to customers. All in all, the regular hijinks you'd expect from LAD games. Ultimately, I barely if any have any qualms about this game, it's near perfect.. The game is very long! It actually doesn't talk much about wealth so weird name for the game.. turnBASED? check! kino? check! reddit? NOPE! finally a real turnBASED kino to put square enix to shame once again. (9.85/10 rounded up to 10). idk if barry was right, but i do know that larry was wrong.. The first was better, but this was still great. Love that you play with both characters but story was just ok.. Pros: Good for fans of JRPGs Is a mass open world game Plenty to do Cons: Very repetitive when upgrading bonds with party Side quest and Island part have no real benefits or gain, including switches jobs Cut scenes are extremely long and get tiresome easily Loose plots Japanese themes in the game are bizarre, even for a JRPG. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gameplay, story, side-quest, this game as everything, one of the best work of rgg studio, a must play !. Infinite Wealth could honestly be the most addicting game I’ve ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tremendous game that builds off the previous entry. Loved the new classes and characters. Only negative point is I felt the final chapter dragged a bit and could’ve had less filler fights. Overall love this game and can’t wait for more. Also the DLC was overpriced and not needed but not a huge issue for me since the main game packs so much.. 20 euro dlc to unlock new game plus? You should just be ashamed of yourselves. I'm not preordering or buying D1 any of your future games, new game plus is very important to me since I like to play my fav games multiple times, but if it's lock behind a paywall, then I prefer to skip that game altoghether.. As a huge Yakuza fan I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay, graphics and side content in this game, some of which felt like a improvement compared to the previous instalment in the series. But what makes those games so memorable for me was always the story, and in this one unfortunately I found the entire story, cast and villains to be rather boring and half-assed, especially towards the final chapter when everything felt rushed for no reason... I'd still say it was a fun game, as the Hawaii setting was very unique change of pace for this series.. I've been gaming for over 40 years and have played some of the best games there are. This game is as close to perfection as it gets and an absolute masterpiece. LADIW should win GOTY but nonetheless will go down in history as one of the Best games ever created.. Nutty story, nutty action, and nutty characters. Just call it Infinite hype at this point.. Best Yakuza game ever. Buy ****'s a no brainer. The game is closed to being perfect. Loved the game. Had a lot of fun visiting Hawaii and other old locations from previous entries. Gameplaywise, they've improved on every aspect of Yakuza: Like A Dragon, added some fun new classes and allowing you to select any abilities from other classes (rather than only certain abilities being available when), allows for a lot of fun team building and flexibility. It was great seeing some old faces and the new characters were also very interesting. The social bonds really helped to get to know the supporting cast. My only issue here is how long it took for certain characters to join the party, some came a bit later than I would have liked, but I'm also biased because I really loved them in the previous title. The dual protagonist worked well. Side content is amazing. The story itself is quite long, but if you ever feel like taking a break from it, there is a lot of other side content you can do. You basically have a mini Animal Crossing, Pokemon, and Crazy Taxi, with other mini games/arcades to visit. The side content is never mandatory for the main story, but they add a lot to the game character wise and to support certain themes throughout the game. They range from ridiculous to serious, but you never know what you'll get until you actually complete them. Yes, the NG+ being locked behind a deluxe edition ****, but the main game has more than enough content to keep you engaged well over 100 hours, which is more than I can say about other AAA titles released in the last few years. I did end up buying it later on sale because it did have an additional dungeon and a small story to go with it. I will eventually replay it in Japanese (English VA for Kiryu wasn't as bad as I thought he might be, but still love the JP VA), so I don't mind a few extra bucks for the amount of time I'll spend on it.. An absolutely incredible game, I played more than 100 hours of gameplay and I didn't want it to end. Charismatic characters and a narrative of ups and downs.Lots of content, side stories and traditional minigames.However, if you are a yakuza fan and have played the previous games you will enjoy it much more.. It's a very cool game, but I felt the story was a bit ""meh"" compared to the previous mainline entry. Gameplay-wise, very satisfying though. If you liked the previous entry's gameplay, everything's better about this one. I'd give it a 8.5 if I could. Story is alright, gameplay and OST Is perfection, funnest game I've played this year for sure. I recommend it if you've played every other Yakuza game beforehand or at least Yakuza: Like A Dragon. A tremendous story, with combat that improves on the previous game. Some of the greatest character writing I have seen in a video game. The side content isn't as tremendous as the last game, but still a 10/10 video game.. After a bit of a difficult start, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth soon manages to hit the gas, its story proving an engaging affair amid an ocean of mini-games and other distractions. This is a massive game, but one you'll want to dive headfirst into. TGG – 8.5 / 10 AUDIO 8/10 As always, Like a Dragon conjures up memorable tunes, although a lot of them have been carried over from previous games. Voice performances (especially the native Japanese language version) are excellent, too. VISUALS 9/10 The series has never been a slouch when it comes to visual loveliness, but Infinite Wealth kicks things up a notch, with rich, detailed character models and environments. Considering the sheer amount of content here, it's remarkable that the level of fidelity is consistent throughout. PLAYABILITY 9/10 If you enjoyed the turn-based RPG action of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, then the evolution of those systems in Infinite Wealth are sure to delight. That's when you're not wrapped up in the myriad diversions peppered across Honolulu and Ijincho, of course. DELIVERY 8/10 You can't have too much **** thing, and that rings true of Infinite Wealth. The issue is that it's all thrown at you during the game's opening chapters. Miss Match dating, dungeons in the Labyrinth, Dondoko Island, Sujimon... It's a lot.. Great sequel. Love the classic turn-based. Same issue as the one before it: difficulty is too easy, purposely wouldn't upgrade gear and avoid fights to maintain a level of fun difficulty since it doesn't allow you to increase difficulty till NG+ Story isn't as good as the one before but still great. I spent around 125 hours getting the Platinum trophy for this game, and it was well spent. The story taking place in Hawaii was a bold choice and I think it was well executed. I can't think back to any games taking place in Hawaii previously so it was a fresh experience. Almost every aspect of this game is an improvement over the previous entry. The story, combat system, characters, side quests, mini-games. There was one part of the game that I had to play on the way to get the platinum trophy that I did not enjoy at all: DONDOKO ISLAND. This was such a tedious and uninteresting grind I wanted to cry. The Ichiban Confections mini-game from Like a Dragon was 100x better than this. I was so disappointed that it wasn't brought back for the sequel. I wanted to cry having to play Dondoko Island. It was so unfun and I cannot stress that enough. Other than that the game is a blast. The Dungeon side quests are hella fun too with great rewards. The third dungeon is locked behind a pay wall as well as New Game +, wasn't impressed by that at all. I should detract a point off the scoring but I'm focusing on the base game for this review.. As much as I like the Yakuza series, this is one of the weakest entries in the series. The story just isn't good. There are many forced plot twists, that feel ridiculous even compared to some weird plot twists in other games. Kiryus part feels like filler, because it's completely detached from the main story. The characters most of the time get forgotten as soon as they areintroduced, just like complete plots. The game leaves a lot of loose ends, that the writers probably just forgot about by the end. And making Hawaii the setting wasn't a good idea either. The way the language barrier is handled in this game just rips me out of immersion all the time. Badischen everyone except for 2 or 3people in the beginning of the game speaks prefect Japanese. Some native Americans even have a very strong accent when speaking English. Also because of Hawaii the plot is so devided because you can't just travel as easily between Japan and Hawaii as you can between Japanese cities. And Hawaii doesn't add anything to the game, that Japan couldn't. You could have had the same tropical setting in Okinawa or one of the southern islands of Japan. The gameplay is great however and an overall improvement over Yakuza Like a Dragon. Also it has the most amount of minigames and side content of any Yakuza game. For my taste it's actually already a bit too much, because I got completely lost in the side content to the point, that I forgot what had happened in the main story. Overall for me it's just a 7/10 and that's just because of the gameplay. If the gameplay wasn't that good it would have been even lower, because everything else unfortunately is not good. I hope it gets better in the next game again and I hope RGG Studio focuses on Japan again.. You have to know very well what you are buying. The combat is very good, but there is a lot of video between the gameplay.. Very good combat system! Wish mini games would be more original and better the next time.. More like a dragon. If you liked the last entry you will enjoy this one too! Combat is improved the story I felt wasn’t as good as its predecessor but still very good. Last boss was a bit tough. 9/10. Really great turn based JRPG game. Definitely one of the best Yakuza game I've played.. (MY SCORE : 8.8 /10) An exciting game continuing from the Yakuza Series! And it's back with the Turn-Based Combat system!And in this game, we will act as Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu who meet in Hawaii! The two of them will face two main antagonists, namely Ichiban Kasuga facing Bryce Fairchild, Chair of Palekana, a belief that developed in Hawaii where Akane, Ichiban's mother is one of the members. Meanwhile, Kazuma Kiryu will fight Masataka Ebina, Chairman of the Seiryu Clan in Kamurocho, Masumi Arakawa's son who actually wants revenge against the Yakuza! Total 14 chapters to complete this game!. I have so many feelings but I think that is what this game is about when you look back on all the things you've done in your life and put them in perspective you begin to realize how you have connection to other people how what you have done had changed their lives and yours. It's one of those amazing games that make me feel and think about myself while playing **** darkness in people's heart the heat with the tick can't go away how you cannot change show you all but persevere and you're all the themes and the story of this game Kazuma touch my heart. I've enjoyed this game series for so many years and I can feel it in my bones. I could not sleep at night because I wanted to play more of this game because I cared about Kazuma.I could talk about how the plot feels like spaghetti and the more you want to talk about the more complex it becomes part. That's not really what is about the Conspiracy is nice and hard to explain what the characters in the relationship and the Heart of the game is the characters and I enjoyed a company and the experiencing **** turn-based combat is fun and it just of what amount of hif behind it. So it doesn't get boring to look ,all the animations are smooth. They are fun. It is just exciting defeating hard enemies. It is the funnest turn-based combat system I could ask **** didn't make me cry like guiden but what it did make me think about the life. I had lift and that is the important part.. This game kept me completely hooked from start to finish. At every step I continued to get distracted by the side stories and side content. The two big ""mini"" games kept me busy for over 30 hours on their own. Before I knew it, I was over 100 hours in and still not on the final chapter. Absolute bang for my buck. Gotta take away a point for locking away new game plus behind a paid DLC.. If you enjoyed Like a Dragon, then I am absolutely friggin’ sure you’ll love Infinite Wealth. It’s definitely more of the same, but ramped right up. Improved combat and crafting, more jobs, quality of life changes, and some new minigames. What can you expect is fantastic character development, ludicrous yet heartfelt sub stories, and everything just being ridiculously over the top, with a dash of some new surprises. As the setting this time is in mostly Hawaii, there is a bit of an awkward transition between characters speaking Japanese and English. While some characters seemingly had both an English and Japanese voice actor, others did not, so the broken English can be somewhat jarring. Man, what a game. Truly a 10/10 for me. I look forward to going back and playing the earlier installments, but I can’t wait to see where the series is headed.. If you're a fan of the franchise you'll also like this game. Great new story and world. Graphics could be better but that's alright. you'll get the high quality story and characters and weird side quests you'll like from other yakuza games. The story is quite bad. The dialogue is quite bad. The characters are fine to decent. The gameplay is excellent. It is a shame that the things around the gameplay are only terrible to mediocre as if this game had even a remotely competent story and dialogue this game could be a 9 out of 10.. Awesome and amazing game, deserves at least a 90 or 91 to show its a must play.. This game looses almost all of what made the other games cool and **** one the mini games and side stories and an assaults. I spent more time listening to dislougue ( reading fialouge) and having complex mini games forced on me than exploring or leveling the first 30 hours. Then there is the subtle esg western cancer seeping in..even the voice acting is more cringe **** game is to ridiculas, by hour 20 I was skipping dialouge fast as a could click the button.. Also Hawaii feels more like Chicago with the excsesive forcing diversity.. All the heart and charm of the first game has been replaced with over the top wakky japanesey cringe.. Worst part is what they did to Kiryu , not only is his dialouge to over the top and just bad, but they got the you tuber Yong yea to do his voice. Not only is his acting terible, but it just sounds like his videos, so every time Kiryu speaks you hear a tiny soylent drinking korrean guy, not the most badarse japanese character in 20 years.. This game feels like the worst part of western games is getting in. I feel like Sega forced wester devs to help make this game, its just not the Yakuza ive loved for decades.. I first started playing the Yakuza/Like A Dragon franchise in 2009 when Yakuza 3 first came out. I’ve played every mainline game and most spinoffs. First I have to say that RGG studios and the engine it uses for these games are rock solid. I played roughly 120 hours. Not once did it crash. There were no bugs throughout my play through. Sadly, in these times, that needs praise. And they deserve it. It is time to do something about the graphics, as they are subpar. Sometimes the characters can look ugly, there hasn't really been a substantial upgrade graphics wise, even with the updated generation of consoles. Story wise, without giving much away, is focused on Kiryu. Ichiban, and the antagonist are second and third thoughts respectively. When the story is based around Kiryu, it’s as strong as it gets. It is inspirational, emotional and reminiscent. I absolutely loved my time with Kiryu. Just as I always have. Ichiban’s story in this suffers because, quite simply, just as Yakuza 7, he isn’t as strong of a character as Kiryu. Though, the humour around him is much better. His unwavering kindness can be frustrating but also commendable at times. I do enjoy this protagonist, i really do, but he’s in a shadow of one of the best protagonists of all time. The similarities RGG decided to give him to Kiryu, in my opinion, are strange. We’ve already had one take the fall for a crime they didn't commit, middle aged once they get out, etc. I just wish they went a different direction with Ichiban’s backstory. Ichiban’s motivation to go to Hawaii is interesting at first, but then loses all momentum about halfway through, then it becomes uninteresting after that. There is a stairwell sequence in the story that was probably one of the dumbest ideas that RGG wrote. After that sequence, i lost a lot of interest in the main story. The antagonist in this game is there, because you need an enemy at the end of the game. That’s it. The motivation is weak at best. There’s really not much to say. Probably one of the weakest antagonist in the series. Gameplay wise, there really isn't any difference compared to Yakuza 7. Many of the same jobs (fighting styles), same skill attacks, a few cool new jobs but not much to write about. If you enjoyed the turn based fighting in the previous game, you will in this one. Mini games are back with a vengeance. I was quite surprised with how many were back from previous games and the new big ones were enjoyable. My biggest complaint, is that there is absolutely nothing new post game. Unless, you pay for the new game plus DLC. As an avid trophy hunter, I wont get the platinum, as one is to get to level 70 with Ichiban. After 120 hours, i’m level 58. With NO enemies the same or higher level than me. So, unless you pay for the NG+ DLC (where you get a high level dungeon), you will torture yourself spending hours to get there. I don’t think that’s right, and RGG needs to be held accountable because that DLC was DAY 1 and should have been in the game. Not DLC. Add ons previously in the series were questionable, but this one takes the cake. Overall, I like this game. Infinite Wealth is a must play for regulars of the series, for Kiryu’s story alone. Everything else lacks substance/motivation. And RGG’s decision to take out the post game and NG+ just to make it DLC takes a big hit on my rating of the game.. This is my GOTY , its incredible just 89???? He is very very top! i put 10 because i look thenote and i think he need min 95. At first glance the game reveals itself to us as something new, the beginning of the game doesn't give us any reason at all to doubt that this will be a great sequel to the seventh installment. But what the writers of this game did after the 8th chapter leaves it no chance. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is a ragged, completely inconsequential, crumpled piece of work that lost a lot of things that this series was loved for. Play through the game to the END and you'll realize just how bad it is. Lack of adequate motivation for the villains, battles with fantasy bosses, and a protagonist who behaves inappropriately for his original character. The ending of this game is a complete disappointment for all fans of the series, which has been turned into a slop-fan service game.Translated with **** (free version). Mechanically it way better than Like a Dragon and altho the story was lacking a bit it is an amazing addition to the Yakuza series. Freakin Ichiban, man.... I loved every minute of the 130 or so hours it took me to get the platinum in RGG's latest entry in the series that used to be known as Yakuza. Ichiban Kasuga returns, along with Kazuma Kiryu, all his buds from the prior game, two cool new party members, and a great cast of supporting friends and enemies. Turn-based RPG combat returns as well, with ""Pound Mates"" summons, new job classes and special signature skills that are even more zany and bizarre than before. Mini-games galore include the usual (poker, arcades, darts, etc.) along with new spins on Pokemon collecting/battling, Pokemon Snap, Crazy Taxi, and the excellent, addictive Dondoko Island (Animal Crossing). I'm not sure what the game's title means, unless ""infinite wealth"" is the friends you make along the way.. one of my favorite JRPGs. There is tons of content in the game and such great writing. It's just plain fun to play and makes you smile often at some of the references. Very addicting and HIGHLY recommended. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is a shoe-in for one of my Games of the Year contenders and is a heck of a lot of fun to play. Much like the previous Like a Dragon (LaD) title the game turns the familiar streets and locales of the flagship Yakuza series into a full blown modern day JRPG complete with exploration, turn-based combat, no shortage of humour and references to games and the rest of the series. Not only does the game bring you the maps from previous games but also adds a massive new map for the sections of the games that take place in Hawaii. With mini-games returning and entirely new content such as the Dondoko Island section which is pretty much Animal Crossing and Sujimon now being expanded even further into the realm of Pokemon with the ability to actually ""capture"" and train your own 3 Sujimo","the story introduces new characters who, as always, are very well developed . the turn-based combat system has been significantly improved . the game takes place in Yokohama and Honolulu city in Hawaii ."
455.Cuphead in the Delicious Last Course,"From the stop-motion, claymation backgrounds that dress some tucked-away areas, to mind-bending stage transitions, and the commanding full orchestral score from composer Kristofer Maddigan, there’s not one aspect of The Delicious Last Course that feels undercooked.. Island 4 and all that comes with it make an amazing game even better. This DLC is perfect for those who want to see Cuphead at its best. There is no fat; there is no fluff. There are only the best parts of Cuphead but much, much more refined.. While not being as long as i hoped for the average quality of this dlc is higher than it is in the base game, which basically means that it is perfection. Every boss is so cool and unique and interesting in their own ways. i also really like the chess tournament part of the game.. An absolutely amazing DLC to top off an amazing game. The boss fights are a little harder then in the base game, but it my opinion that makes it a little better.. The wait was worth the time, because Studio MDHR just delivered a whole new experience to Cuphead with the Delicious Last Course. This DLC not only improves the game in different areas, but somehow takes advantage of new technologies that make gaming better. The new Boss Fights are challenging and Ms. Chalice brings new entertaining game mechanics.. The Delicious Last Course is a delightful DLC that expands on the good things seen in the original Cuphead. The new playable character, Ms. Chalice, adds variety to the gameplay while the new bosses designed by Studio MDHR are all great fun to face. Offered at a price within everyone's reach, this additional package is an experience not to be missed.. Cuphead In The Delicious Last Course provides a new expansion and upgrades to Cuphead that is still as amazing as it was first released.. The Delicious Last Course is everything a Cuphead fan could ask for – more of everything the world fell in love with in 2017. This DLC’s colourful cast of baddies are just as challenging and intricate as any you can find in the base game, while Studio MDHR’s gorgeous hand-drawn art style means they’re brought to life phenomenally. As an added bonus, the smart moveset of Ms. Chalice means that even if you struggled with Cuphead in the past, this DLC is worth giving it another shot.. If you’ve been longing for more Cuphead, then The Delicious Last Course is for you. But if you were, for whatever reason, hoping for a big shake-up in terms of gameplay or difficulty, you’re not going to find it here. Brutal but beautiful, this is simply more Cuphead, be that for better or for worse.. The best DLC ever made, while it does not have a ton of extra content, the content that it has it top tier!. Oh thanks for ruin the game. Remove that garbage 9 Lifes cheat. Stop Dumbdown games. --------------------------------------------------","Studio MDHR just delivered a whole new experience to Cuphead with the Delicious Last Course . the colourful cast of baddies are just as challenging and intricate as any you can find in the base game . the new playable character, Ms. Chalice, adds variety to the gameplay while the new bosses designed by Studio MDHR are all great fun to face ."
456.Lone Echo,"Masterpiece Graphics-Amazing Gameplay-Great Story-Very Personal Voice Acting- Amazing Best vr game. This game is incredible. It's one of the titles worth getting a VR for. It's not perfect but it's excellent.. This game is probably second only to Alyx as an outstanding demonstration of what VR can do. Too bad its very slow placed and mostly comprised of rather soulless, lonely environments.. I played the game on quest 2 though oculus link and I enjoyed it. It was cool being able to float in space and doing through vr was impressive. It was a little slow at times but I enjoyed the story.. Amazing story, I love Jack and Liv. But the game is kinda blurry in Oculus Quest 2.. Lone Echo | 2016 | PC | Played for: 8h Up to HL:Alyx this was the defining VR gaming experience. The controls, graphics, attention to detail, interesting story, all add up nicely in a very engaging package that will keep you hooked for 6+ hours. Anyone who enjoys space exploration, is curious where AI might lead us or just wants to drift in zero gravity, welcome aboard! Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics/Physics: 9,6/10 Music/Sound: 8/10 Overall: 9,05/10. Excellent VR experience. The graphics are stunning, the mechanics great. It's very intuitive and the story is quite engaging. 9/10.. I only played this for 30 min and already know its gonna be awesome! Make sure to set graphics to high. It is my first real VR game and it is hard to believe that it was released so long ago. Sci-fi setup and story is really great, movement works like charm with me. Never got sick while playing. Game is a bit short, but unneccessery extra task requires some time to complete. Graphics is nice, mechanics works nice. And you have a whole body (no floating hands, Alyx, right?). No doubt, still one of the best VR games. Superb in every aspect you want to check. This is definitely one of the best VR games ever made. As fan of actions and shooters i found this project near perfect considering game genre. I seek week sides of the game but i failed. Atmosphere, sound, control, gameplay, storyline, mechanics, touch pads utilization, even in-game learning - all of this aspects made great. As i remember i set 10 score just once before - Half Life 2. This is second time. Strongly recommend to play it immediately, not matter game genre you prefer personally.. Lone Echo is impressive. In both ways. Graphically and Immerse. Not that you are see through android camera, you actually are an android. The sense that you are in the world and obey very single rule of it cant be described. It is something that you have to feel for yourself. Moving mechanics, puzzles and the plot makes this game apparently the best VR game out there.. A must own for VR enthusiasts. The developers obviously worked hard to polish the game mechanics and gameplay, and it really shows. First off, you don't just have lazy floating hands, you have a whole body, arms and legs. The game teaches you how to play in a series of ""calibration"" exercises that are nicely woven in to the plot. Your companion in the game is realistic enough that you can get interesting immersive feelings when conversing with her. Her animations are top notch as well. This isn't a combat game. There is no fighting or shooting. So prepare for a slower pace where you take your time to admire and explore in VR while solving puzzles. They do ratchet up the tension in several moments, and you can really feel it. That said, it never really felt difficult to me. Most of my deaths were because I didn't fully understand the task or mechanics yet. So, overall, it's a cinematic puzzler. And it is cinematic. Many times in the game feel like you are in a sci-fi movie. Use of confined spaces as well as vast open space is used well. The only thing I wish was maybe for a little bit more difficulty and faster action. Every time I thought it was going to get really crazy I realized it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I can understand that some people might not get their ""VR legs"" so quickly though, and they had to be careful not to make it too difficult for those people. But for me, after an hour in, I felt I could really whip around quickly. Echo Arena is kind of proof that a faster gameplay is possible. I think it spent about 4-5 hours completing the game. To me, that's a reasonable amount. Personally, I get worn out playing games, 2D or VR, and often quit before I've completed them. So, for me, 4-5 hours is a little on the low end, but acceptable. I paid full price and felt it was worth it still.. Wow. The game was so impressive and great. Just finished it. Really love the story. No nausea.. Yo this game is the real deal. You need to buy this game cause it's strait dope yo. I got this game for a friend was blown away you feeling me? laterz. This game is your typical tried and true space genre game and adds nothing new to the genre. Unfortunately, this game still has a few bugs. On top of that, the game is way too short. It's sad to say that It's definitely not worth the price.. By far the best VR-experience released to date. If you are looking for an amazing journey rather than a game-like demo, you should give this a try. Movement in zero gravity eliminates nausea brilliantly. The story takes me through a series of emotions and reactions I did not expect from myself. Voice acting is great and the level of detail in the visuals are stunning. Mapping of the body and its movement is stimulating to experience and gives a much more real sensation than most other games I've tried. Especially when it comes to all the different kinds of interactions you can do with your virtual body. If every game from this point takes a lesson from Lone Echo, Virtual Reality itself has gained a lot. Great work, Ready at Dawn Studios! I can find nothing to complain about and the only reviews I've seen giving bad grades are people not giving it a try because it doesn't come in Spanish, which in turn is unfair to the game. It is not like I walk around expecting games to be released in my mother tongue, that would've been ****, both by me and whoever in the industry that decided on such a bad decision. So instead of shooting down a masterpiece like this, learn English. It is 2017 and the age of IT does come with one particular language up front.. Once you get past the first couple of drab hours where you're basically doing virtual labor on a space station, it get interesting. Even the mechanics seem to get more interesting, as they are tied up on more interesting jobs and functions. It's not the most diverse game, and the ending is a bit abrupt. But the gameplay certainly improved as the game went along and the story also improved quite a bit.. Really impressed with this VR ****'s well ahead of all the other titles I own in terms of the feeling of immersion and use of VR to accentuate the gameplay. Character dialog and story is interesting and well done and the full experience is both polished and looks great. The added bonus of the Echo Arena multiplayer which is intense is just icing of the ****'t tell you how many times I've smacked my hands off my low ceiling in my VR playspace.. What a disappointment! The reviews were all so good. I've had a PSVR and Vive for almost a year, and this is my first Rift game, so maybe that is why I am underwhelmed. Some VR movement used to make me motion sick, but I got my VR legs some time ago. Yet this game is only playable for 10 minutes at a time. There is no way to teleport around. You have to move through the air, in zero gravity, by pushing off of objects or using little thrusters. There is no way to stay still easily. You float to the ceiling or sink into the ground, often through table and other objects in the room. It is like a bad tech demo. You have to make dialogue choices with multiple button pushes very quickly sometimes, which is hard to do when you're grabbing a wall so you don't sink through the floor or bob around in a vomit-inducing manner. I'm used to Steam's generous return policy for lemons like this. I hope Oculus has a similar policy or I might not be trying any more exclusives that don't have demos. Apparently the multiplayer part is free. If it is, I would recommend trying that out before buying the solo mission. If you can handle the horrible movement quirks, you might enjoy this game.. Yes, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is consistently enjoyable, and the motion is fluid and graceful without causing sickness, but the joy of Lone Echo is the relationship between Capt. Olivia (Liv) and her AI assistant Jack (you). The human connection you form together - YOU form together, not the characters form with each other - is almost unmatched by any other relationship in gaming. This is on level with the Witcher 3 in terms of emotional investment and realistic dialogue. Another incredible aspect of Lone Echo is how you can shape Jack through your dialogue choices. Does he remain steadfastly adherent to protocol, save for in the most dire of circumstances, or does Liv's habit of risky improvisation rub off on him? Does he understand humor? Would he adhere to his stated purpose forever, or would he - if the moment was right - define a better one? It's entirely up to you. Lone Echo is VR with a soul.. If you ever dreamed to be a crew member of a spaceship Lone Echo is for you. It's beautifully crafted experience, which beams you to the rings of Saturns and lets you play a robot on a spaceship. Behind this immersive experience, Lone Echo really lacks a satisfying gameplay. Everything you will do is to go from A to B or to carry something from A to B or turn a switch on/off. Maybe this, not enough to call Lone Echo a great game, but it's enough to call it the best VR experience of summer 2017.. I've played video games since the late 70's and have never played a game remotely like this. Even the phrase video game, just does not do it justice. At one point I spent an hour in part of the game that probably should have taken 5 minutes, I was just so absorbed, engrossed, amazed that I was suddenly a robot, floating in space, in these wonderfully detailed, realistic surroundings. This is an experience not to be missed.. Oculus studios. Not Indie. AAA development. Not multilanguage. Not even subtitles. 570 million Spanish speakers. Maybe the game is good but we can't enjoy it. Oculus all your funded titles should be translated. We want VR to spread. Spend your money wisely.. One of the first VR titles to really get everything right - graphics/visuals, story, movement mechanics, and engaging game-play. Actually two games in one! An engaging single player space adventure and a great multiplayer zero-g ""Ender's Game"" like battle arena e-sport game. Kudos to the developer! They really nailed it, especially the feeling of playing in a zero G environment without the nausea. it is games like this that will really help drive VR sales as once you've had a taste of this kind of immersion in VR gaming, you'll never want to go back to a flat monitor ever again!. This is one of the best VR games to date, in my honest opinion. I usually get some sort of nausea from VR, but Lone Echo is able to send you careening through space without feeling sick at all. Aboard a mining station in space among the rings of Saturn, you play as a robot helping out your friend Olivia in repairing the station and uncovering a mystery. I won't give away the plot here, but you're destined for a fantastic 8+ hr experience that looks just absolutely stunning. Regardless if you're playing on Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, pick up Lone Echo. It's nothing like any VR game currently available.",i played the game on quest 2 though oculus link and I enjoyed it . it was cool being able to float in space and doing through vr was impressive . but the game is kinda blurry in oculus quest 2 .
457.XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Amazingly fun!Starting from the ground up to design the perfect Alien killing squad is tough, but **** game is extremely challenging, and will keep you on your toes in order to make sure that all of your squad gets out alive!The game has great replayability and has hours upon hours of enjoyable game play. Even after beating the game, it's fun to keep your file and drop back in to play a couple of missions - as they can still be challenging even with a fully prepared **** strategy is sound, but there are a few glitches at times - and I have to call BS on the hit % on harder difficulties.(Once, all 5 of my men missed a target when they all had a 55% chance to hit. The alien had a 45% chance to hit one of my men in cover, and had a 10% to critical. The alien got the critical on one of my men - all of my men missed the alien... and that kind of stuff happened a lot on the harder difficulty)Even if you're not into turn based strategy games - you should definitely check this game out. It has to be my favorite game that I've purchased on steam thus far.. Whenever i see a turn and grid based strategy game i say ''XCOM like'' as in souls like or rogue like. This game made a genre and doesnt get the credit it deserves. Quite possibly the worst in-game camera I've ever seen. It's constantly twitching, changing altitude for no reason and changing angles so that you can't see anything. This game is a sad victim of the 7th generation of consoles. I've tried installing the mod to fix the camera, but no matter what I tried, it kept giving me errors. Whether it's due to the game's age or just how badly it was made, I don't know, but whatever the reason, it doesn't work. Otherwise, it seems like a cool game, but the atrocious camera controls make it completely unplayable for me. Call me petty, but sacrificing the game's UI and UX just to appeal to console gamers is a mortal sin in my book, especially when there are hundreds of examples of console-oriented games that still play well on PC.. One of the best strategy games I have played. Forces you to rethink your strategy all the time. No cookie-cutter missions as you are constantly faced with more powerful and imposing enemies.. Remains one of the finest examples of the strategy genre, blending tactical depth with compelling gameplay.. THE **** DO YOU MEAN 98%!?!? 98% MY ASS! THIS GAME IS RIGGED AGAINST ME AND THE UNIVERSE HATES ME. One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Source of probability memes.Graphics & sound are nice, unreal engine 3 is used. UI is clear and easy to use. The game is divided into two interconnected parts: Strategic campaign (story) and **** strategic campaing requires you to research & develop technologies, as well as managing soldiers and their equipment. you also have aircraft and special operations. Building your base and technology timings are part of the strategic campaign as well. You must respond to alien attacks around the world and keep the council members (countries) safe unless you want them to withdraw their support. So, you have a council-backing mini-game, an aircraft mini-game, a soldier mini-game, a base-building mini-game, an alien capture mini-game... All of these are interconnected and provide a deep strategic experience.Combat is turn based and hits are based on RNG. There are many different soldier classes and abilities, as well as equipment. The game might be punishing, plan carefully all of your **** game features incredible replayability, difficulty and second wave options (added in new game+ as you complete campaigns in the different difficulties) extend the game's lifetime. If you are a fan of TBS definitely give it a try. I would highly recommend getting Enemy within expansion, as it adds a lot of valuable changes.Good luck, commander.. Good strategy game, but nothing memorable in either story nor combat. Confusing and unexplained aircraft system.. What a game! Today, november 2023 still a LOT of fun :) great mechanics, bug free in my case, nice story and chalanges. If you like my always liked turn based games and never play it, go do it now.. God does not play dice. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. **** amazing. first saw my dad playing it back in 2013 when i was still a little kid. nine years later, got the complete edition for like 30 or 40 bucks on christmas cause i wanted to see what it was all about. instantly **** hooked. i now have 155 hours and counting on steam and i might never stop. highly recommended for anyone who is even somewhat familiar with tacstrat games some advice i have for new players: - normal mode, ironman. perfect balance of fun and challenge. ironman mode will keep you from ruining the fun for yourself. just take care to avoid softlocks, crashes or process terminations - buy the enemy within expansion and slingshot dlc. boot to enemy within. before starting the game, enable Operation Slingshot and Operation Progeny in the advanced settings. they add some very challenging side quest-style missions that provide substantial rewards if completed - avoid second wave options for your first playthrough, they make the game much more unpredictable and very different from the standard experience - smoke & mirrors, flush, battle scanner, and rapid reaction are the worst perks in each of their respective class training trees and are vastly outclassed by their alternatives. never **** pick them. There's a reason every new turn-based shooter is called an XCOM game; this game basically hasn't been beat since.. Excellent turn based strategy. Tons of fun, good balance of reward and punishment, practical and aesthetic customization is really fun. Tons of fun, worth your time.. It must have been amazing game back in 2012, but in 2023 it is just a famous name, nothing else. I'm glad they basically invented the genre - it spawned so many amazing games since then.. An amazing turn based strategy with perfect game play, great story full of twists and turns. I must have played through this game at least 5 times. If you are a fan of scifi and turn based strategy and have not played this you are doing life wrong.. Everything is great, but if you mess up something in early game, and you finally in late game. You just have to start all over, so make sure you plan accordingly or ""scum save."" Also, I shouldn't be missing a 90% chance shot so often.. It was my favorite game until Xcom 2 was released. Basic yet immersive story. You end up creating your own story with your own soldiers and missions. A good variety of enemies, maps and mission styles. The base management, research, resources, character evolution part is a separate game and it's wonderful. The graphics are nothing spectacular, but they are round, beautiful, I haven't had any bugs in my 160 hours of play. Above all, the game is extremely fun, whether for those who have never played it, using the lowest difficulties, or for those who want to suffer. I highly recommend the game.. I prefer this one to the sequel, better pacing and campaign is more stressfull.. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a 2012 turn-based tactical video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. The game is a ""reimagined"" remake of the 1994 cult classic strategy game X-COM: UFO Defense (also known as UFO: Enemy Unknown) and a reboot of MicroProse's 1990s X-COM series. Set in an alternative version of the year 2015, the player controls an elite multinational paramilitary organization called XCOM during an alien invasion of Earth. The player commands troops in the field in a series of turn-based tactical missions; between missions, the player directs the research and development of technologies from recovered alien technology and captured prisoners, expands XCOM's base of operations, manages finances, and monitors and responds to alien activity.. I fell in love with this game when I first started playing it, but then something went horribly wrong. If you only intend on playing the game once or maybe twice then this game is a fantastic gem; a great experience. If you want to play more than that then it has some surprises in store. First of all the UI and controls are ok but they could be so much better on the PC. Every once in a. Fun little game for people that like strategy games on a square grid with a little bit of bit of bean counting. Not without a challenge.. i liked it, honestly. i think it's an alright reboot - i love strategy so this was right up my alley. The perfect, quintessential strategy game, and a classic favorite of mine. I still play this game every year.. Game is decent but with some hard flaws for me. After few missions combat starts to be extremely repetetive and uninteresting, even boring. Skill set of your characters is very limited, hate that move and shot once per round system.. and those misses.. those misses.. its practically rnJesus fest. move, fire, try if you hit, reload, repeat.. that's all what combat is about on higher difficulty. Another thing I really hate is that enemy spawning system. Its ridiculous. No more aliens roaming through map, clashing with your x-com fighters as they dig deeper on map. They just spawn when you move, which makes really stupid situations like when you move with your last guy when others already spend all their atcions and accidentaly trigger spawning of another cluster of 3 enemies. It just force you to minimalize your movevement during combat because no, you really dont wanna accidentally spawn another enemies :D And why the hell can't i escape to menu durring enemy turn, forcing me watch those slooow animations watch over and over even if I know its rnJesus reload time? Thats really grrr.... Dynamic chess with plasma rifles and absurd randomness. The game has no analogues, tho.. Great game with an interesting story. Can spend hundreds of hours playing this game. But to be honest I prefer the second one.. Would reload savegame again. ............................................... It's fantastic and highly tactical. The game runs well and the graphics are good.. Great turn-based strategy. Classic story in the new graphics. Interesting gameplay.. This was my first XCom game and I loved it immensely. Sure, there are a few annoyances (I hate the base-building) but the character connections and situational gameplay is fantastic.. Removed without notice from GeForce Now, I purchased a game I can no longer play.. Amazing game, so many great and different elements coming **** gets a bit boring thougn once you become really good at it.. A solid, tight tactical game. It's a little finicky with some of the UI elements and it was hard to stay motivated through the base building element. Still a quality game.. Possibly the greatest strategy game of all time. The gameplay is intuitive and an absolute blast to play. It's intense, engaging, and results scale very much with skill. Anybody who likes chess or turn based combat in any form, this game is for you. Even if you have never tried a turn based game and don't have much interest in chess, I still recommend you try out XCOM. For anyone who has played the Civilization series, this game takes that whole model and applies it to a tactical shooter, and it works brilliantly. There is research that takes a certain amount of days just like Civ, and the tile-based movement system in combat is also very familiar. It works brilliantly in this new setting, perhaps even better than in Civ itself. One of my favourite things about this game is how the story is created organically. This is not because of dialogue trees or any effort to make the campaign have branching paths (in fact, the campaign is quite linear). It is because the best parts in this story will be made in gameplay by you, the player. And to me this is the absolute peak of what a video game story can achieve. Your soldiers, who start off as homogenous uninteresting rookies, will quickly win a place in your hearts through their heroic feats and resulting promotions. At any point, you can mess up and a soldier can die, and that's it, they will be gone forever. A soldier who has been with you from the first day the aliens attacked, gone forever all because you were careless and put them in a position where they are exposed. I cannot even describe the anguish it is possible to experience from a moment like that. The emotions and attachment I built with my soldiers in this game surpasses my attachment to basically any other video game story I have experienced. I recommend not reloading old saves when a squad favourite is lost, but to roll with the punches, your experience will be all the richer. There's a lot of thought gone into this game to make this game engaging as a whole and to provide proper support for the innovative core gameplay mechanic. The base building aspects are satisfying and the perfect addition to the campaign, making you feel invested in what's to come as well as properly dealing with progression and time. The world map and councils offer impactful decisionmaking to be possible within the constraints of a fixed plot. Lastly, I should add that if you are a newcomer to the XCOM series, I recommend you first check out XCOM 2 and then XCOM 2's expansion War of the Chosen. This is because XCOM 2 does everything right in making XCOM even better and there's no reason to not start with the best the series has to offer. War of the Chosen is possibly the greatest video game expansion of all time. Anyone who has tried out XCOM 2 and is wondering whether the original is worth it or dated, look no further. Although the graphics are a bit weaker, the gameplay is equally stellar, and for XCOM 2 fans it is easily worth it for the plot alone.. Please remove XCOM from the title, it's casual game with good graphics but not like original X-COMs from 90s. I've preordered it on Desura (RIP) and waited more than Second Coming but after release i was broken af. Absolutely linear and all **** with score 0-5 already said everything about this game and i can't add something new and original to it. PS: If you not familiar with old X-COMs from 90s i can recommed it, may be it'll be your favorit game. PPS: Now i'm happy with Xenonauts and Phoenix Point!=) Peace!. One of my favorite tactical strategy games. Very challenging in all good aspects. Lots to do in campaign which has a good story. Every lose of your teammate is painful :). There is nothing more satisfying with creating the perfect attack againts your aliens opponents one soldier is obove hiding ready to use overwatch while you have 2 sodliers on the ground hiding ready to throe grenades on all the aliens taht stand togheter. This game can get super intersting and is a streategy game that does things right. This is definetly a must buy for everyone.. Love tactical turn based strategy games but this game has serious issues. First of all there is nothing fair about the difficulty of this game. The aliens deal just as much damage as you but thats where the fairness stops. They are way more accurate than your soldiers, there's way more of them, they have more classes as well, and they can also shoot through (blow up) walls which only one class in the game can do on the Xcom side. Your soldiers can't hit the broad side of a barn, theres just WAY too many misses in this game, even while flanking. Too many elements of random chance for a tactical strategy game. I tried really hard to like this game but the flaws inherent in the combat mechanics prevented me from doing so.. I played both XCOM Enemy Unknown and XCOM Enemy Within. The games are 80% the same, same plot, same events, same actors, same stories, with the only difference in Enemy Within there are a bit more of new events, the human enemy Exalt, and few new enemies. There is no reason to play both since i see the second more complete and vast. If you want to play, just play the second. For the game, i appreciated really, even if it is not at the high level of the original X-COM. But is well done and made modern. I had anyway the feeling that the authors tried to make more commercial and accepted by a wider range of gamers, exemplifying the gaming. For example, I found less researches es to do, and also the combats are made easier with less commands. So i say 7 for the first, and 8 for the second.. Interesting additions to the original. Could not motivate me to complete another playthrough of the game though.. XCOM: Enemy Unknown fulfills a very specific niche with a very high production budget, but falls short in terms of mechanical and quality-of-life polishing. The game entails an extraordinary amount of downtime bundled up with arithmetic calculations on the RPG layer coupled with a plethora of lengthy, pointless animations; more than 50% of the experience is sitting back and watching the screen, worsened by the frequency the player must swap their attention between watching the individual unit animations execute and proceeding to issue new orders. This is worsened by the fact that for any given gameplay session, the frequency of meaningful decisions and risks is very low. The difficulty of the game does not scale well at all, scaling- for some reason- inversely with the player's performance. That is to say, if the game detects that you are doing well, it gets easier, whereas if you are struggling, it gets harder. This is especially frustrating due to the way the game recycles content; the main campaign can be ""lost"", which is especially cumbersome due to its immense length. I only ever played the game with the DLC ""enemy within"" so I cannot speak as to the quality of the base game. The game's storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. Whatever attempt this game makes at talking about transhumanism or whatnot falls entirely flat on its face. The aesthetic quality of the game is pleasant and refined, but it doesn't integrate with any sort of storytelling. For those interested in getting into the series for the first time, it would be a much better experience to play XCOM 2 twice instead of XCOM: Enemy Unknown once and XCOM 2 once. This games sequel practically resolves all of the issues with the original, save for the content recycling; and the quality of the content makes the recycling less aggravating.. XCOM Enemy Unknown is surprisingly addictive for a strategy game. The combat is super fun.. X-COM was my first contact with based turn tactical games... and I'm delighted. Addictive gameplay, okay graphic and cool setting. Sure, game has, for me, some issues with RNG and moments when a soldier shoots through wall spoils immerse, but still I really like X-COM. Especially I'm a fan of large amount of customization options (like color of your soldiers armors or giving them nicknames). Game which lands on a shelf ""Must Play"".. Very enjoyable well paced game. Doesn't hold your hand all the time, actual mistakes can be made.. This game is hard to review, mostly because it is a ""re-imagining"" of one of my favorite games. The short story is: I like it. I am playing it. So, it gets an 8. Could it have been better? Oh yes. As an X-Com remake, it falls a bit flat. Simplified is a commonly used description, ""on rails"" is how I'd describe it. It seems that somewhere out there in a secret gaming steering committee, an…. It is a disgrace, not a tactical game. It is really difficult to comprehend how was it possible to create such a piece of crap having the initial xcom as an example. Even the game is called tactical, there is no tactics, it is just a turn based shooter with idiotic rules. For example - how do you like a door that can not be closed once opened in a TACTICAL game? The game is full of idiocy like that. The graphics are terrific, the research tree from the first game became better and all these cosmetic improvements make it even more difficult, it looks so good but plays so bad . Primitive, dull turn based shooter with good graphics. that's what it is. When I first played Xcom 2, I instantly fell in love with the game. Then I quickly realized that a lot of people were saying the same thing about Xcom 2. That it’s not as good as the first one. Xcom: Enemy Unkown was a much better game so I knew that I had to give the game a shot. Enemy Unkown plays the exact same way as Xcom 2 and that made me very happy. If I could go back and redo the 2016 Game of the Year then Xcom 2 would have been on it. Regardless Xcom: Enemy Unkown is a turn-based strategy game where you level up units and send them on missions. Its a very stressful game because on top of its difficulty and the random nature of the shots there is also permadeath. What I mean by “random nature of the shots” each shot taken by a unit has a percentage chance of hitting. It could be 62% chance, 83% or 99%. You never know for sure whether the shot is going to connect, I have had shots in 90’s miss but I’ve also had shots in the 20’s hit. That’s what I mean by random nature when you take essentially dice rolls and mix that with permadeath. Stress levels go up. The one thing that impressed me above all else is this is a good game. Its extremely well made and since its turn-based the game mechanics don’t feel out of date. It’s also important to note that this game can be played on the Xbox One so you don’t even have to bring out your old Xbox 360 to play it.. Even if I'm an ""old gamer"", I never had the chance to play the original XCOM. Nonetheless, this reboot entirely satisfied my preference for squad-based tactical turn-based games, like FallOut Tactics did in the past. Even in ""easy"" difficulty, the game is hard and may require a lot of strategy guides and videos to watch in order to grok how the game is supposed to be played, especially how to deal with visibilty, pod triggering, cover and flanking ; and of course the details of base management. Even if I started many (many) campaigns, I actually finished only two, but they were very satisfying (except maybe for the last boss). I strongly recommend you to play Enemy Unknown before diving into Enemy Within.. Great game with fantastic strategic gameplay in both the field missions and the base management. I recommend playing on at least normal with Ironman mode enabled to maximise the pressure of each mission and make each soldier count. Also the story has some great themes to it and I personally found it really thought provoking, and the voice acting is so bad it's good.. This has remained my favourite game since its release putting several hundred hours into it. It is endlessly replayable, with its challenging difficulty settings and ironman mode as well as plenty of mod support.. This game is awesome. It is fun, there is a lot of replay value (especially when adding Enemy Within) and it's engaging, but most importantly, it delivers feelings of ACCOMPLISHMENT when you execute a mission well. And real DISAPPOINTMENT when your beloved high ranking soldier dies. With such a potent psychological aspect to it, no wonder I give this game a high rating. However, there are two significant downs, and I cannot ignore them. First is the price. At nearly $70 for the complete package, 5 years after release, after the sequel and its expansion are released? You would think pretty much ALL the bugs would be gone? NOPE! There are many mission-breaking bugs, and if you are playing ironman for a challenge, then you have extra-challenge in the form of bugs that will ruin turns, missions, and entire games. Also, the UI hinders good gameplay. In short: it will pan the map automatically, but allows you to click the destination WHILE it is panning. The result is that if your move is near the (invisible) auto-panning trigger zone, you will likely click just when the auto-pan starts, and the game will give you a move to the wrong tile. So this game might have been a 10. If at that 5-year price the bugs were almost all fixed, and if the UI worked well enough, I would have given it a 9. So it's an 8.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. this game has no excuse being as buggy as it is 5 years after launch. fix your game firaxis. _________________________________________________________. I'd been aware of the XCOM series for some time, but it never interested me until I tried the demo for Enemy Unknown, but even that wasn't enough. It took a love for Darkest Dungeon and a realization that there were a number of turn-based games I'd enjoyed over the years, when I had previously just told people that I don't like them. So I waited for a sale and grabbed the complete pack. Coming from DD, XCOM is both more forgiving (especially if you use the Save Scum modifier) and significantly more tactically complex. I had some experience with squad-based tactics from Dawn of War II, though this is on a smaller scale: You are limited to a single squad and control each soldier individually. It also uses small, often single digit numbers for damage and health, something it has in common with DD, combined with visual bar sections, making it very easy at a glance to see where you're at tactically. There are certain tactical shortcomings that I'm told are addressed in the sequel, such as not knowing wether a position you are moving a soldier to will give them a view on potential targets until they get there- but i've also heard its much harder to get a guarenteed hit in the sequel, even if your trooper is pressing a gun to an enemy's face. Ups and downs, I suppose. Enemy Unknown has layers of complexity that few other games have, though series veterans will still tell you its ""dumbed down."" Individual soldiers are highly customizable both in their abilities and appearance, especially if you have all the DLCs. You can name them, give them medals, and arm them with a variety of extra goodies. They start out as pathetic FNGs with the accuracy of the on-screen Stormtroopers of Star Wars, and dont even have a class, which they are assigned the first time they rank up: Assaults, Heavies, Snipers or Supports. These four classes are further split by players into two subclasses based on perk choices, though you may mix and match perks to your liking. However, you CANNOT respec your soldiers: choose perks carefully. With some planning, luck and maybe a few reloaded saves, they become apex examples of what human warriors can do- some of them may even become psychics. Then you can take them beyond that in Enemy Within, granting them genetic enhancements or cybernetic augmentation. XCOM resonated with me very strongly in this regard: Evolution is a powerful weapon indeed. One of my very first recruits from the post-tutorial mission, my first Support, went on to be my Volunteer. These are not just random grunts. They are your disciples. Their stories are yours. Combat can go very smoothly or completely sideways, and the difference can be as subtle as the positioning of a single trooper, or which soldier you place on ""Overwatch"" (Which causes them to fire upon the first enemy that moves within their vison during their turn) You must take into account flanking, elevation, line of sight and variety of other factors. This variety increases as you level your soldiers and their capabilities expand, as do the variety of enemies you face. One of the most useful such capabilities in my experience has been a perk for Snipers called Squadsight, which permits them to fire on any target visibile to another XCOM soldier, so long as they also would have line of sight to that enemy. Properly positioned, this enables the Sniper to hit targets from across the map: as my first Sniper did when he saved the afforementioned Support from a Chryssalid on the now-infamous ""Site Recon"" mission. When things go right in XCOM, it is immensly satisfying. When they don't... oh boy, do they not. XCOM is an incredible, in-depth experience and I enjoyed it from the first mission to the very last. It is easily one of the finest games of this decade. It permits you control of your characters in a manner that would be more common in a traditional RPG, and the random elements become less of a hassle as you progress, as the time and effort you put into your soldiers' development pays off as they become nigh-unstoppable post-human super-warriors that puts EDF's Storm Team to shame and would give Commander Shepard's crew a run for their money. I found myself with the same fondness for them that I had for my heroes in Darkest Dungeon. It is clear that an uncommon degree of care and respect went in to Enemy Unknown's creation, with its purely asthetic ""highlight camera"" when making a killing shot and its excellent soundtrack. More big-budget releases could benefit from its example, and it can be played as casually or as intensively as one prefers, thanks to its range of difficulties and modifiers. If you enjoy squad tactics games, turn-based RPGs, or strategy games of any kind, I encourage you to try the demo. I understand that it offends the sensibilities of XCOM purists, and as such a person as regards to other series I totally get where they're coming from: but Xenonauts exists, and from what I can tell they should just play that.. Coming back to this game after playing the second one, it is a tighter experience overall and does not need mods to give it a feel of pressure like in XCOM 2.. Fantastic game. Love the turn-based strategy. Love the strategically scarce resources -- can't buy the stuff you really want (i.e. what you need to build laser and plasma weapons), and can't harvest enough resources to build out everything you want/need all at once. Makes you feel on edge the entire time, unlike its namesake 1990's predecessor in which you could essentially run a money-printing manufacturing operation to buy everything you want. Love that it's not possible to handle every alien threat at the same time like you could in the game's predecessor. You make your decisions on how to handle what you can based on trying to manage the world's perception of you and what rewards are being offered. Again, puts you on edge the entire game. No sitting back and feeling comfortable. Love the story, learning about the aliens' motivation (hint: it's not the classic ""harvest the planet"" alien invasion story) which also explains why there's a progression of difficulty. Scalable difficulty makes the game more accessible, despite the fact that it can get pretty hard even on Easy mode. Love ""Iron Man"" mode -- makes it so you can't just save at good points and load when things go wrong, you have to live with your decisions. Playing that way, even on Easy the game gets really hard. Love the squad customization, rank advancement, abilities and team-building strategies. The only thing other than occasional glitches that I don't like about the game is that there aren't enough unique stages. Chances are you'll end up doing a mission on the same stage as one you did previously at some point in the game. The stage design is really good -- dispersion of cover, destructible objects, plenty of ground to cover and search for aliens -- but there aren't enough of them. The original XCOM: UFO Defense didn't have that problem, because stages were procedurally generated. I can imagine that would be possible to do while still maintaining the appearance of good stage design, but they chose not to do that. Makes the game feel stale on the second, third, nth run through it.. really cool and unique strategy game with a lot of depth. This is a must have for every fan of the strategy genre! It's really frustrating though when you lose that character that you had since the start of the game : ( And sadly there are also some **** mechanics that can screw you over really easily : /. My first game in the XCOM franchise and certainly hope it wont be my last. The difficulty can be harsh sometimes or maybe all the time, but that what makes the game better. All in all, a wonderful game.. XCOM: Enemy Unknown",the game has great replayability and has hours upon hours of enjoyable game play . it has to be my favorite game that i've purchased on steam thus far . Quite possibly the worst in-game camera I've ever seen .
458.Rise of Nations,"I don't know where Microsoft get of being the patrons of two game series like Age and Rise but you got to give them props for the way they pulled it of. Sick gameplay and sick ideas. Thanks for the fun.. This feels like several RTS games within one and I love it for it. The inevitable consequences is that each of them is not deeply fleshed out, but it mostly works. Feels great to cause a nuclear apocalypse.. This games deserves a 10 just for it's soundtrack.. Very Good game. Can spend some time to play and exeprience it again. Download and give it a try again in future. A strong RTS entry in the vein of AoE or AoM, but with a niche of modern day development. It does a great job introducing increasingly modern units and having them feel like distinct improvements. Unique wonders and tech levels also add to the equation. A lot of fun and worth your time, but not much faction diversity to speak of.. For old pals. Pros.: - Mix of Civilization and Age of Empires. - Can play multiplayer. - No bugs. - Some lags if played multiplayer but still fine. - Dynamic. - Easy to learn. Cons.: - Super outdated. - Need particular vibe to play it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Wonderful game play, challanging with friends and good view for history. Good mechanics.. one of the best strategy game ever. Rise of nations > Age of empire ....... Possibly the best RTS ever made. Reaction from Microsoft for a sequel: Crickets. The mix of the strategic map and RTS was excellent. RTS elements where good. But the games gets a bit repetitive after a while.. Remember played this game back in 2003. So many hours, days and nights :) Comparing to Empire Earth this game was awesome. Not a masterpiece of course, but very good game.. The best in strategic games, and i love it so much, I recommended for all of you.. As a kid growing up in the golden age of RTS-games, I spent all my free hours from the moment I laid my hands on this gem ****. Years later, I see that it aged well and still like to revive those memories from time to time. Here's why: Now that I'm 20, I have branched in all game-types and getting more experience(d) with a bigger count of hours and games. But I'd like to make an quick look-back at the game: 1) Everyone powerful Civilization 5 is viewed as one of the - maybe even the °1 - best age-processing game of all time. But even though civ6 build on all the most-liked features of civ4 and 5, it got big waves of critique for mainly 2 reasons: The more cartoonish approach to the artstyle and pretty much everything got a big nerf. No more overly powerful nations and ""features"" that could break the whole gameplay (except a few that were swiftly fixed with some patches.) Rise of the nations of course launched way before 5 and 6; but when playing those, I realized a big feature of rise of the nations: Instead of all nations only having a small nation-specific advantage, every nation had a original advantage that they could use/exploit to the range they want. But if every single player has an equally big advantage, it isn't an advantage anymore. It just makes the game more interesting with way more paths to follow. 2) up-to-date fanbase Even though you can't find that much on the ubisoft site about Rise of Nations, it still has a strong player base. Not as much as AoE does, but for a less popular, 16 year old game, still being relevant a hard task. S/o to the facebookgroup ""Rise of Nations / T%P and EE"" 3) Options Even though most generic games roughly follow the same pathway, every game has an new touch and opportunity to learn. There isn't a perfect strategy, only a few who come close all with their own flaws. But the options give you enough points to path your way to victory. 4) Artstyle I like the artstyle. Realistic approach but without taking it to far away from pixel-art. But this is just personal :s I personally love this game, but I would give it a 10 if it had these things: 1) bigger mod-community: Difficult for a game like this, but the ""big"" mods of back in the days are also a bit underwhelming. 2) more ubisoft support. 3) more micro-upgrades. There are a lot, but I just really love them :p. RTS that allows you to follow your civilization from the stone age to the future. Relies on territorial mechanics, unlike many other RTS of the period. Never had as much fun with it compared to Empire Earth though.. Not only an excellent singleplayer game but also well worth it in coop multiplayer. Great fun!. It's a masterpiece ****. Amazing graphics for a strategy game, at the time and no doubt everyone who played it enjoyed it a lot. I really wish there would be a re-build for this amazing game !. Probably THE best Age of Empires descendant I've ever played in my life. I still play it to this day, and it came out 13 years ago. Do I really need to say more?. Great graphics for the time period, engaging gameplay, and great fun to play with family and friends. If you're a fan of the Age of Empires series, Rise of Nations is definitely worth checking out.. Guys if you love this game , then please sign this petition ****/p/microsoft-studios-big-huge-games-brian-reynolds-rebuild-rise-of-nations-for-next-gen-pc. An excellent mix of Ao2 and Civ ideas. Very fresh and strong mechanics AI is smart and difficult (however does cheat on higher levels) Balance is excellent Not the best sound-design Empire borders are very interesting and dynamic. There are no words to express the utter joy felt when I saw this on Steam. This RTS is said to be the love child of Age of Empires and Civilization. Truly, it's a masterpiece of it's own. It has go to be the best RTS out there. Go out and buy it already, damn it!. Best RTS game ever made! Thanks Steam for bringing it back! Great variety of nations, game style.. One of my favourite games of all time. Multiplayer games are superb!. I've been playing RTS games since 1999 and i can assure this game is one of the best ever created. Of course it is not as massive or competitive as the Star-craft games but that's because people didn't give him the chance. The game is a mix between Age of Empires and Civilization sagas. Play is complex and provides lots of options while playing (diplomatic management, build orders, openings, and a good amount of units). As long as you like RTS games, this one is well worth to buy giving you massive hours of fun. Amazingly fantastic game. I'm not one of those people who give things they hate a 0 and things they like a 10 just to raise the score, i give honest reviews. beautiful RTS graphics, real strategy, excellent multiplayer, and an interesting world map **** has key elements from civ that make it fun with classic RTS factors too...definitely the RTS of the year. MY only complaints are even though the civilizations have distinct bonuses and special units and look different with i think 4 different unit and building sets.....they all still play al little bit too much the same, with maybe the exception of the chinese who get instant citizens. but mostly its just trade bonuses, faster tanks, **** will notice these and they are game factors, but i tend to like warcraft3 style a bit more with totally different civs. I think each civ could have a real radical ability(some already do). but check out the upcoming expansion, adding 6 races and some campaigns too. this is a excellent game with great graphics, sound, and gameplay. i hope RTS's will continue to innovate like this.. I personally think this game is one of the RTS genre masterpieces of all time. It is the game where most features of past RTS's (pre 2003) where assembled and refined to the finest detail. This game is great, combat, resource gathering and diplomacy are all complex yet intuitive, achieving a balance that is unheard of. Starcraft 1 is good, but I prefer this game by far, Starcraft is somehow limited, as well as AOE or Warcraft. The campaigns in this game are complex and challenging and very rewarding as well. I play this game almost everyday on multiplayer (look for Vugi's patch). I highly highly recommend this game for all RTS fans, and get it with the expansion!. This game is awesome! .. Steampunk, technological. magical RTS. Nice gameplay and graphics. Campaign is enjoyable and skirmishes are fun because the units are really cool. I like how strategic it is while also being action-oriented with the battles. Great game.. By far, this is one of the greatest RTS games of all time - and easily one of the best games of all time. In terms of gameplay, it is superb. The detail and complexity of its resource system ties in amazingly well with its technology and research aspects, which in itself is still unrivaled even in modern games. In addition, the building aspect itself ties into these extremely well. Each city provides bonuses to nearby resources, as well as to nation borders, which in turn help with resource generation. Then the combat adds another layer, with certain units countering others, terrain types affecting combat, generals giving combat bonuses, and so on. On top of this, the game itself is setup exceedingly well. There are a massive number of nations to choose from, each with their own distinct economic and military bonuses, as well as unique units. The user interface is amazingly intuitive as well as fluid. The multiple campaigns allow for the connection of separate skirmishes to a larger picture. As a single player game, Rise of Nations is simply a masterpiece. The AI offers many different levels of play, ranging from basic to very challenging. However, it also offers multilayer, for those who have exhausted the extensive single player AI. While multiplayer plays exactly like single player, the ability to use diplomacy only increases. Two players can team up to defeat a stronger opponent, or to gain an even stronger dominance of the map. In addition, diplomacy can be used to solve long battles with no clear winner in sight. Over all, Rise of Nations is an absolutely astonishing game. Anyone with any interest in strategy games should pick this up (preferably along with the expansion pack). I purchased Rise of Nations only a few weeks after its release, as well as its expansion pack (also a few weeks after release). To this day I still play and enjoy the game, and is easily one of the best games of all time.. Best Real Time Strategy game ever made.I have played so many,and this is definately the best.After playing Rise of Nations,I even admitted it was better than Age of Empires,my favorite game.This game is genius.. With the most immerse campaign I've ever played (borrowing the concept from Risk), the most diverse nations, and the most diverse units & buildings, this game is the type of RTS that's deserved to be called one of the most realistic RTS yet.. Bland and generic feeling. Too arcade. The civs are not unique enough, and south american civs are not supposed to have gunpowder troops in the middle ages! I came from having played AgeofEmpires2, cossacks & American Conquest. This is not a bad game, but I felt mildly disappointed.. This game is the next best thing from the classic RTS like starcraft and Age of Empires 1 and 2. Great balanced gameplay and interesting time frame, this game is better than Empire Earth. This is an addictive game. Only pity is it never put emphasise on the competitive multiplayer faction.. All strategy fans will love this game, it is by far the best RTS game i have ever played, Age of Empires, Warcraft, and even Empire EArth don't come close to this fantastic game.. Few RTS game can reach almost perfection state, and RON is the best example, the game is solid, addictive, clear, deep and easy to play, the developers build this game to be a game which you have to use ""strategy"" in order to win and that what is what all startegy games made to be since the board games, other aspects of the game such graphics, features and modes are excellent and perefect, till date I see the graphics are clean and crisp. The replayability is very high due to many availabe nations to choose from many different historic periods to play with. If you are RTS fan you have to get this even of we are in 2011, there wont be any game similar to RON anytime soon.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely enjoyed playing this game a lot. The ability to choose your time period was rather exciting, and being able to follow a groups' entire history was surely a great idea. Graphics are rather good, for back in 2003. Now, a bit outdated, but still entertaining.. This is a very good strategy game. Many ages, nations and functions like control 1 team as 2 players and so on. The only strategy game I had more fun is Warcraft 3 but mainly because of the story and world.. for being 2003, this game is stunning. The graphics are great for it's time period. The levels are so fun, and challenging. You can pick so many different time periods to start and end with, and playing online especially is the funnest of all. To play against your friends. It's 2011, and i still play this game to this day. There's no bugs, no flaws, nothing. The AI is smart especially for it's day in age. The game is fantastic. 10 from me.","a strong RTS entry in the vein of AoE or AoM, but with a niche of modern day development . a lot of fun and worth your time, but not much faction diversity to speak of . a lot of fun and worth your time, but not much faction diversity ."
459.Apex Legends,"This game is absolute ****. Too many sweats and skill based matchmaking is ****. These kids only grind ranked. And even when I play a non ranked game, these kids still sweat holy ****.. What a steaming pile of **** this game has turned into. I used to love it but currently you could not pay me to play this game i have officially uninstalled it. I am just plain done with it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a day 1 player until season 20 the game is absolute trash... it's a pity because had a lot of potential... and EA make it dirty. Enjoyable to play, but can be repetitive and slow. Ranked splits are pointless to even try if you aren't committed to playing all the time. A good mindless play.. this is one the best games I have played on the ps4 idk what the hate comes from. the game is ehhhh. i played apex when it first released and i didnt like it that much. the game is not that fun in my opinion.. Ins't a 10/10 couse they just DON'T FIXED YET THAT DAMN SOUND IN THE GAME, EVERY ONE APROUCHES ME AND I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING, But the rest its 10/10. Honestly I don't hate this game that much. I just hate the battle royale genre and this game is the reason we didn't get titanfall 3. The movement is good and characters abilities are good, but I hate every other aspect of this game.. I have 2,500 hours on this game across multiple platforms. i would have given this game an easy 10/10 in 2019~2020, but not anymore. Season 22 and 23 will be my last season as i cant play this game no more as its not the fun shooter that it used to be. Short answer would be : too many giga sweats ( Triple stack) running wild in pubs and 6 Man Squads in Comps and Cheaters. Plus, Respawn and E.A doing nothing to fix the existing issues (server lags , expensive skins , non existing new mode). its 2024 and BR is not fresh anymore. they had a really good idea with Arenas but they had to shut it down 'cause they couldn't fix the cheating problems. if you would have asked me my opinions about this game back in '19 '20 '21 , I would have told you this game is my Favorite of all time. But sadly its not anymore, and its not just me, its the story of alot of other players as well. and sooner or later this game will perish.. Best battle royale, been playing it since day 1. This game is for the mature audience.. Personally my favorite battle Royale, but the matchmaking is so fkd and they refuse to fix it. You start getting matched against leaderboard players the moment your gold. Solo Q as a masters player gets you a gold-diamond player. But even if u group q it does sht as you'd get matched into the same top lobby where you can't even win a gunfight and are forced to camp to try and get points. Non ranked gamemode is even worse as unrated you are forced into a full pred / washed pred lobby once your good enough, as all the normal players quit or are forced to play ranked to avoid that fkd q as at least there'd be some diamond/plat squad that got fkd and qd into that gold-pred lobby in ranked. Apex had by far the worst ranked system I've ever played. They refused to fix this matchmaking due to needing the streamers/tubers to keep farming kids to advertise their game. Game is under constant performance issues, bugs, dev team doesn't listen to the plaer base only streamers anders marketers. Any problem that does arrive that severely affects the players they don't even try to make it right just say sorry bro womp womp.. Stop WOKE culture. get rid of GAY characters from this game. just please change the characterswhere men are men, and women are women by look, clothing, talking and acting. I wish, Mortal Kombat had a DLC so that I can rip and tear of the following characters 100 times a day : Seer , Mirage, Pathfinder, Octane. God I really can not stand seeing them on the screen !!!!!!. I’ve been playing since season 3 and this new season is by far the worst,I’ve gotten to top three on ranked four times in a row for it to crash before anyone says anything this happened to my whole squad,getting a error code saying lobby **** game I had 5 kills 5 assists and 6 knocks with 1400 dmg to gain 0 RP from this happening,apex needs to figure this out because I’m debating on just deleting it and asking for the money I spent back.. Great gameplay, mobility & fun. But Money hunger & only trios.They recently added a quad but removed it aswell & changing the game too much. It’s becoming **** and ****. Need to allow quads ormore players to have more friends able to play together. And hackers are a problem too. Don’t recommend.. They changing because their revenues from twitchers is dropping not because they care about the players, Look at all the streamers dropping more than $10k a week on the store before since they stopped now they like ""ok we'll give in give me more $$ do"" so ea and respawn can go kick their game somewhere else going to be on the finals. I personally dont like this game. The only reason I play is for my siblings. I don't recommend this game. They put you in matches where you can't win. Me and my brother are under level 20 and yet we are put in with people who are level 100-400 and up. Not just that the people in this game are toxic. They Call Us trash even though we barely started ****'s not an enjoyable game. Another money grab and lying to us like where stupid. Instead of jest being truthful with us. Games full of hacker now 9 out of 10 games are filled with hacker or people teaming with each other.. Needs a big f****** change to the match making Every game I’ve ever played of ranked I’ve always been placed in the same game as sweats that are 2 or 3 ranks ahead of me and at the same time it has the audacity to give me teammates who have seemed to have never played the game before and don’t get me started about how many games I’ve played where the game is crashed or I get kicked out of for 2 min multiple times a game. Fix ya shi*. Don’t get this game unless you have money and time to waste. They do not value their customers as a business and they will extort you with inadequate **** NOT RECOMMEND!!!. I love the game, I really do, I have spent so much time on it and have sunk so much money into it. But with the cheating problems, the whole game just crashing out problems, and most importantly, with all the outrageous monetization, I'm deleting the game and never playing it unless they make a good change which I doubt there will ever be one with EA.. Apex at one point was an amazing FPS battle Royale game with its unique movement mechanics and a wide range of weapons to choose from. But currently the game is possibly in its worse stage. The servers for Apex Legends are absolutely awful as every game you load into, your either disconnected or have packet loss which impacts gameplay heavily. Also the rank match making are terrible as for me (plat - diamond) I have to go up against top players (apex preds) and from that alone there’s a massive skill difference and for the random teammates I get in rank, their most of the time 2 rank below me or worse skill. This game is also very money hungry as they chance they battle pass system from in game currency to real life currency. And it’s also split into 2 battle passes per season so you’ll be spending 20 dollars for battle pass for both the half battle passes or 40 for the premium (if this makes sense). They are also very dry on content and always have collection events that only wants money and release recolour of old battle pass skins for about $250! Overall at this currently state, this game is one of the worse game on the internet. (Please fix your game EA). What was once a great game has become terrible in the past year, they made terrible battle pass changes where you cannot get the battle pass without paying irl currency and where you cannot earn credits from the previous battle pass to buy the next one, then they added ""milestone"" events which is just gambling which has essentially made crafting shards useless. The game has become a cash grab with barely any meaningful changes, events, or content for the amount of money they get, the cheating is terrible as well, the game is just boring lately all around. Not worth playing as of right now unless they get rid of the terrible monetisation and add real content.. What once was a great game, is now over run with cheating. Has become a cash Grab. Splitting the battlepass in half and charging real world cash for it, is egregious! $20 every three months?? Terrible.. This game surprises me every single update. If you're a new dev and you want to ruin a objectively good game based in an amazing universe you can just see what apex has done. EVERY. SINGLE.SEASON since 2021 this game has taken a nosedive into being a worse game. Where do i even begin, from the fact that the game has so many predatory events that in order to get the thing you want you have to spend a ton of money? The fact that the balancing is thrown out of the window? The fact that pro players have to wait MONTHS before they get paid out? The fact that there are cheaters everywhere? The fact that the game has garbage sbmm putting people that haven't played in years with people that play daily and are a high rank. Players are pissed with all of these and the game devs do nothing about those things but add more unwanted changes like they will change the battle pass system that has been the same for YEARS just so they can squeeze every last dollar from their dying playerbase and the random new players that will stay for one or two seasons untill they even realize that the game has a whole pile of problems that the game ignores. Rant over. Amazing game in its prime, like many games it’s getting worse and more unplayable. The removal of maps and modes and nerfs just kill the game. One of my all time favorites but hard to play consistently anymore.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was my favorite game for years, I’ve been playing since the beginning. I absolutely can’t stand playing anymore. The audio is non-existent to the point where octane will be using his stim right up on me from behind and I won’t hear a single thing, or a Valkyrie using her jet packs to fly up on me. There are definitely people using strike packs and shooting with zero recoil and the lobbies are not equally matched at all. They’re constantly changing characters abilities season to season so they’re good one and horrible the next. The creators of this game don’t care about the players feedback and they won’t fix any of their crap or even take cheating and reporting seriously. Overall, the creators of this game completely ruined what made it so great when it first came out and if you haven’t played yet I wouldn’t start.. First off there’s 0 casual experience at all. It was of the best games I’d ever played. Too bad it’s owned by ea who are the most selfish companies. Every season has a new problem and it’s hard to enjoy even when it’s your favourite game of all time.. The gameplay is really great, but management issues, extreme instability on the Asian servers, excessive recolor skin items, and the use of illegal programs that are so numerous that even the administrators seem to have given up are making gamers tired. The people of ‘that country’ actively hope to be confined to ‘that country’ dedicated server.. I use to love playing this game everyday. After all the updates they put out and I get it u gotta keep up with other games and keep up with whatever contract yall may have. I still find it pathetically sad at the fact I gotta now worry about getting shot through walls like this is COD, it's sad that I can be playing the game and only deal with heavy server lag once I run into another player. I mainly play loba and the updates **** up the game so much so that I couldn't do a jump drive to another platform in peace because the game lags or glitches or whatever and make it seem like I never used my ability or how it's suppose to not allow me to jump into areas that can harm me like lava or off the map but yet it did. I get it yall got things yall need to do that's mandatory but I'm just tired of having to get games from these companies just for them to fick it up with an update. The saying goes it is isn't broken then don't fix it.. Apex is not worth playing. Horrible matchmaking, cheaters, hackers, non-existent footstep audio, movement glitches only available for MnK. It's hard to enjoy the game as a casual player with all these issues. I solo q into a game, get 2 noob teammates, then have to fight a whole 3 stack of very high skilled teams. What is the point? Then you got them doing all kinds of movement glitches (never intended for the game) that make it hard for you to track, and it's only allowed on MnK. Even on MnK, you're looking at months and months, if not over a year of practice, to really get it down. Then you have cheating, which is another big issue in the game. Their anticheat is old and outdated. 3rd, if your account that you spent thousands on gets hacked, you are SOL. Support will not help you get your account back. Their customer service is outsourced to India and all they do is give you the run around, and there is no other form of communication. You can't enjoy this game as a casual/somewhat competitive player. The company hasn't done anything to tackle any of these issues for years. All they care about is what they can sell you, and it's not cheap.. Best battle royale imo, pretty good, i'm not really a br player but this game is nice. Interesting with many different mechanics and new events that are updated quite often. Today one of my favorite FPS games with 300+ hours played. There are a few ""buts"" and these are bugs. It often “throws it out” of the game, apparently the backend can’t handle the load. Well, from time to time after updates there may be unpleasant surprises. For example, recently all achievements for the last 3-4 months were reset and the developers fixed this problem for two whole days.. This game has sad servers with frequent packet losses. Surprisingly, even after4 years of it's launch and the devs have not been able to provide a consistent gaming experience while raking up tons of customers' money through garbage in-app purchases. Kudos Apex!. The game is really fast. . hard to master but fun. what i hate is just when i roaming like 5- 7 minutes and died in 5 seconds. Give us tf3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ Please give it to us we need it. This game is not even worth trying unless you want your blood pressure to be higher than a guy who eats nothing but salt everyday. This game is so sweaty and so hard and is impossible to get 1 kill. My last match of this game I didn’t even hit a single bullet to someone. This game is dog **** and do not even try this game. I’ve been playing this game since season 3 and you would think I would be a god at this game. But no. I can barely get 1 kill in every match I play. Do not download I am trying to save you from breaking you’re tv or monitor in anger and heart failure from you’re high blood presssure. Have a great day.. this was mistaken, delete my review please .................................................................. I love playing this game I have over 400hrs into it I can say I do enjoy the new Evo shield update as it's a more fair fight now. I would like to in the future see you guys please implement a apex tracker into the game so you can see how many apex packs you have already opened I have surpassed level 500 and it restarted my level and doing it all over again been finishing battle passes opening bought packs prime gaming packs and Amazon packs and still NO HEIRLOOM I need to know how many I have opened!!!!! I also want to add thank you so much for finally allowing cross progression because I had my PC account and switched back to playstation when you did this it combined all mybought skins from both platforms and I couldn't be more thankful!. This game is one of the **** games of all time. The gameplay is average at best, and the limited action physics and animation make it as un-playable as it gets.While the game does have a voice acting part (which is the only part I enjoyed in the game), it doesn't help matters. To make matters worse, the dialogue is horrible. The ""movie"" cutscenes and character scenes have absolutely no character, or life to them at all, which is a major issue. However, it's the small things that make this game even worse. For instance, the ""action"" scenes use the typical quicktime event mechanic in place of gameplay. Again, like the cutscenes, the ""action"" scenes are terrible. The quicktime events are more like cinematic jump-cuts that don't let you react to the situations. This is just some minor flaws, but they just add to the fun-less experience.This is a very underwhelming game, and has only a few redeeming qualities. However, even though this game has so much room for improvement, there is nothing that makes this worth the price of the game. If you can ignore the terrible gameplay, and have a strange attraction to fighting 'totems', this game is an enjoyable time. However, this game really fails to deliver on the hype, and is a total waste of money and time.. I have to say, don’t waste your time. My wife and I have been playing since day one and frankly it is next to **** a moderate player like my wife and I, you are constantly and always being pitted against pro players, TTV’ers, and or cheaters. I can’t tell you how many times I have been annihilated by a player that has ten plus kills a when they come up to kill you the slaughter you in seconds. Today alone we got slaughtered by players that had 80k plus kills, plus it was the same two players in three different games. Hey if you’re a great player or a cheater this is your game, the creators will just keep putting you against the ever dwindling moderate player that has decided to move on from this slaughter fest. Dont waste your time.. This is the best EA Game ever, that has at least lasted 5 Years, and doesn't require Microtransactions like Battlefront 2. a fun battle royale, although a little quirky, had good gameplay and graphics but replay value isn't as good as some other battle royales. Gun operation is slow Game operation is slow Bullet speeds lack the element of credibility. Bullet speed depends on distance, the closer the slower the bullets travel.(point blank misses). Bullet damage lacks nuance, like being shot from a close distance should do more damage. Gravity, momentum, and inertia don’t matter, enemies farting back and forth literally dodging bullets(which should be traveling faster than sound). Aim assist spamming is a problem Lots of users have no recoil on kill cam. Shouldn’t even have sniper rifles if they’re gonna be as weak and useless as they currently are. A no scope hit does less damage than a scoped-in hit, same weapon does less damage. Sliding needs to be completely overhauled and redone. I can slide up stairs but not down a decline unless I run first. Pulling out nades is slooooooooooow! Throwing more than one nade is slooooow! Crypto’s drone should have Picture in Picture displayed when drone is up but idle. Revenant’s little bunny hop should either be longer/higher/better or the cooldown period should be cut in half. Valkyrie should have missiles that lock onyo Targets. Ballistic’s sling weapon should be much easier to utilize, this includes putting weapons into the sling, and pulling them out. It should be an automatic pull when primary weapon is empty. We should be able to throw nades through portals/rifts/phase breach. Nades should damage fences and caustic’s gas traps, the environmental elements should react to all stimulus. If you die while an ability is in progress, it disappears saving the enemy the damage they’d have taken if you survived. Grenades and active elements just stop, which is a primary source of annoyance with the game. Overall the game has potential but its current status is aggravating. Slow operation + console spammers + gun issues culminate in a poor user experience. Apex is essentially a jogging and loot collecting simulator. A first person shooter requires more balancing and nuance which it sorely lacks.. Bro Please stop making the damn game update every week.. Its alway A new update to download and then copy. Sometimes I just wana hop on and play but then I have to wait for some stupid ass update. once I am able to play I dont even see what the hell you guys have updated. I love the game I do. But that update **** makes me want to Uninstall it. How about you buff wraith so she goes Into the void faster.. Thats worthy of an update. If not leave the game alone man.. I've played over 600 hours and left it a while ago due to its lack of content. The ""events"" only consists of selling herilooms and recolors of skins. Plus, the servers are trash like always. Despite that, the game is entertaining:). About 1-2 years ago, This game was **** amazing. Gameplay was awesome, awesome legends, andeveryone played for fun, not for a flex. But now everyone just sweats profusely and i hate it so now it’s a solid 4.. After 4 years of APEX with thousands of hours, and 20+ years of supporting EA games, if you slur in ranked game chat once then EA will perma-ban you regardless of what you're going through. Soulless, heartless company full of non-understanding greedy corporate utopia believers. I told support my grandma died last week but they refused to appeal my ban even though my account has only had 3 previous occurrences, spread apart by about a year each. I don't recommend Apex Legends.. Has a lot of bugs, tapestrafe and cfg users, awful sound when you can't hear enemies. Periodical issues with constantly laoding screen, bad ranked system management where you are put in a lobby with predators even ifyou play in silver. In the past years only few good changes, 2 champions and 1 map per year. Although there's a lot of cosmetic stuff yesss, that's the reason why I play apex not because It had a decent gameplay but bc of cosmetics, bugs and cfg players and sweaters in my lobby. Respawn is surely loosing their game right now and the falling oline in steam is a demonstration. Once a good game now is totally lost due to poor management.. Respawn treats their fans like cucks, i cant recall how many times the dev team themselves have come out and said ""the fans do not know what they are talking about"" i could understand if its one or two people but no, the whole internet has clowned respawn so hard at one point (during the recolor of the battlepass skin for the peacekeeper in particular) they finally caved and said a b.s sorry with crocodile tears because they were so shooked up that the fans didnt buy their overpriced 160$ recolor ****. The devs obviously do not know what they are doing, causing distrust and tentation between them and the fan base, they think its okay, and continue till this day to put the stress onto the fans while they sit back and do nothing besides recolor the same skin 1000 different times. Disgusting practice, disgusting dev team, disgusting companies that deserved to be boycotted to the highest degree. Satisfying gun gameplay, good graphics and interesting abilities. the game does greatly suffer from bad servers, pretty poor balancing and overpriced cosmetics.. It seems that Respawn is more concerned with permabanning players who criticize them than listening to the fans. I'm convinced at this point that the devs working on Apex know less about what would make the game good than their least knowledgeable player. At this point, supporting Repawn in any way is objectively, and morally wrong. Play at your own risk, but just know that Respawn is so unimaginably conceded that they'll ban you for even daring to say something negative about the game, and that, no matter how bad, or how many fans want something, they'll never, ever add it. It's an attack on their fragile little baby egos or something. Respawn is to Rockstar what Rockstar is to anyone with a moral compass. Steer clear of this game!. Apex has paid players thatdon’t like it when you perform at a higher level so they have to cheat and hack you to prevent it. I will never spend another dollar on this cheating game. I have video proof as well as statistical proof of my accusations. I officially am boycotting apex. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The devs constantly tamper with the match making so sometimes the game is fun and sometimes the game is punishingly sweaty. The maps get worse every time they update them and every new character is more annoying than the last, the roster is far to big, time to start killing some off. Only giving it a good score because of the good movement and gameplay mechanics.. Greatest shooter ever. Decent, but get's old quickly. Plagued by abysmal matchmaking and low game mode variety.. Very good battle royale game. The Flatline ****. Period. Ong.. Honestly, you won’t find a better battle royale. This is the best one. There’s a very steep learning curve, and aiming and mastering legends is tough, but once you find one, maybe two, you enjoy, it can be great. However this game can be incredibly infuriating if you’re not playing as good as you could be. I’ve played thousands of Apex matches and many of them I’ve lost. That’s because it’s so easy for a match to end as soon as it started. There are matchmaking issues sometimes where you can be placed with incredibly good players, and I wouldn’t exactly call it ‘polished’ as each season there’s always balancing issues, bugs, and some seasons you can’t even log in to play on the first day of it launching because the servers can’t cope. However, with that being said, this is the game I’ve played the most of and it’s definitely great. There is enjoyment to be had.. Apex feels like an EAs version of fortnight, there is just so little that makes this game unique. While the gameplay is fun it gets repetitive due to the lack of game modes. It feels like Apex was just a game that jumped on the battle royal train when fortnight was at its peak. Less and and less updates come each year, the game just feels forgotten. There is also some truly extreme monetisation in the game. It's important to remember that the game is free but some of the micro-transactions are just too much.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of course influenced by my personal opinions. (7) Average. The game’s features may work, but are nothing that even casual players haven’t seen before. A decent game from beginning to end. They combined Battle-Royal with a Hero-Shooter. Solely a multiplayer game and is pretty fun. Don't have much to add besides that.. JUMPING on DOWN TO THE APEX LEGENDS GETTING THE WINS YEAH THATS HOW WE DO IT. If u don't play with the same people everyday u won't know what ur rank will be cause they will put a 2 yr old I'm they're first game ever in a match with u and ur 10 ranks above them and have no choice but to loose that match so might aswell not even play it since there's no accuracy on ur skill level ....I have a cousin that can't kill me in a one on one no matter how many times he tries but he's higher ranked then me cause he gets more rp then me and with less wins he started in a higher rank. Need to get that cross-progression going, fam. Also, Catalyst... seriously? You guys know what you did. Get it together.... A once great br is now a rotting husk due to terrible matchmaking. the only game that will allow 3 pros to team up and faice groups of randoms and noobs. Dont waste your time on this one the glory days of apex were years ago. matchamking doesnt work as well as netcode. and anticheat. and everything. theres no point in playing it unless you have friends to play with but its better to play anything othr anyway. Let me currently tell the current state of the game , right now it's season 12. The positives + the balance is probably at it's best place right now, no op legends , no **** legends. Mirage is still decent despite what people say, you guys are just trash. The guns are also very balanced. + the good maps: world's edge, olympus and king's canyon in pub + the gameplay stands out the most in apex, it's the smoothest fps gameplay on the market right now. + the matchmaking is not that bad like last seasons but im not an expert so don't take my word for it. + I like also how every map has a different way to get high tier loot. + graphics aren't amazing , but for a free to play game they are still solid enough. negatives - Even though the battle pass isn't terrible , i am still waiting for a decent one to buy for a couple season's long lmao. - storm point just feel like a drag. It's to big and when you get in a fight it's always with multiple squads. King's canyon is aight in pub's but in ranked it's a bit to much. Not bad but by far the hardest map to get a win. - connection issues still exist neutral point: - bring some small pve event back i liked those - add some new features or a new grenade or something. We just need something to spice it up after 3 years. Control is decent but doesn't feel new. Conclusion: Apex legends is the best free fps and maby even the best battle royale out there. Smooth gameplay, nicely balanced etc... The only thing the game needs is something fresh and finetuning of stormpoint. I give apex legends a 9 out of 10 , when stormpoint is back in ranked it will be back an 8 though lmaoooo. Apex Legends is one of my favorite games, being FPS, I also liked the Legends with their abilities, my main is Octane since it is accelerated.. Good but not yet great. Would be nice to have a solo mode a least. Currently you can only play with squads of 3 people. Unfortunately, too many times, other players (even using discord), don't listen much to the rest of the team and you end up dying simply because you are alone against another team. So too often you end up having to follow other people who don't play as a team. At least PUBG has a solo mode. In Rainbow Six and BF4, you have a team but you can still perform well without them. In Apex, good people tend to really stick together so if your team does not, you are dead.. Apex Legends is an enjoyable battle royale that can be played on almost any system. I've been playing off and on since launch and one of the things that keeps me coming back is the amount of content added to the game. With every season they add new maps, characters, and switch up the weapons. This has kept the game from being stale and makes it more enjoyable overall. I would say the game is really just better when you have a full party but it can still be appreciated if you prefer to play solo.. Pretty fun but way too much grinding involved to get any wins. One of the better battle royales as theres different playstyles between the characters.. The best shooter on the market currently. The gunplay is a bit too fast, and the grind is kinda silly to get new characters. Ultimately, it doesn't do anything great, it is merely good. But I'd rather play this to scratch my shooter itch over COD or Battlefield.. Like any free to play game it is hampered by bugs and server issues however it is the best BR game or best free to play game or currently the best fps game to dat","this is one of the best games i have played on the ps4 idk what the hate comes from . enjoyable to play, but can be repetitive and slow . i have 2,500 hours on this game across multiple platforms ."

But 2003 has HANDS DOWN the #1 soundtrack.. **i play PS2 Madden a lot..2003-2012 and They really upgraded the graphics in 2004.. ****, cause 2003 was a great year for all teams. The rosters and franchise were EPIC... Madden was REALLY REALLY BAD on XBOX360 until 2013.. ***90% of Madden gamers weren’t still playing Madden on PS2 after next gen came out.. So I went back and my god 2008-2012 on PS2 and the gameplay is soooo crisp compared to PS3/Xbox360.. unbelievable. —until EA/Madden sells us DLC for retro season/rosters= I will stick with my favorite era,, Same with NHL,,SSX,,MLB,,NASCAR ETC...... Perfect perfect game much good very beautiful best game 2019? Yes yes yes good. I had lot good of memories over the years with this game. It isn't the best Madden but it's a fun one still. First year of minicamp, franchise mode improved from the previous Madden. Definitely recommend to buy. Also one of the best soundtracks in Madden history. If your a rock fan, you definitely won't get sick of listening to the songs.","2003 has HANDS DOWN the #1 soundtrack in madden history . if your a rock fan, you definitely won't get sick of listening to the songs ."
460.Descent 3,"So, you are thinking of an old game to play again. I often find myself thinking... Descent. Now... one would ask Why Descent? Well, first off... it is a unique first person shooter with elements we shall not see again soon; at least until Interplay, revitalized, decides to make Descent 4. Why? I do not know. Only game I know with a similar system is Forsaken... which publications at the time reamed I do remember. Now though, Descent is a fun, action paced shooter that's great for anyone who wants an adrenaline fueled adventure. Story Junkies should check out another interplay product mind you... Planescape Torment. This isn't the game for them though. I love it thoroughly though and it both holds appeal today almost as much as back then. More... some days.. If someone had asked me, ""Quick, whats the game you remember most from your childhood?"", the answer would always be ""Descent"". Nothing else really has the same allure as the 6 degrees of freedom the Descent franchise is known for. Back in the day, the graphics were amazing and they still hold up pretty well today. It doesn't strike as ugly, even being over 12 years old now. The sound track still sounds as futuristic as it did back then. After playing first person shooters (ground pounders!) for such a long time, going back to play the game is every bit as challenging as opening the box for the first time. The AI runs circles around your weapons, gets right up in your face at the worst of times, and runs for cover at the best of times. The controls are heavily configurable, and work fantastic with a wireless Xbox 360 controller. The story in the Descent series was never blockbuster level, and while you probably still won't care much in the 3rd installment, at least there's some cut scenes to keep you vaguely interested. The level design and objectives are much, much more varied, having open outdoor areas and not having to destroy a reactor in every level (quite the opposite at one point). Descent 3 (Aswell as I & II) are part of gaming history. It sits you in the middle of a world where movement is completely unrestricted and doesn't ever let you go. It's a highly polished experience that holds up to the test of time! Windows 7 best settings; Patched to v1.4 Video mode: OpenGL (DirectX has issues with modern video cards) Audio: Primary Sound Driver (OpenAL needs to be installed for 5.1) Control: Mouse+Keyboard, USB Joystick (Recommended), 360 GamePad (Recommended) Extra settings in launcher (Misc tab); -width -height -aspect -z32bit -bumped Also since the engine is now relatively basic, feel free to jam on the anti-aliasing.

461.The Curse of Monkey Island,"The Curse of Monkey Island continues the beloved tradition of the Monkey Island series with its witty humor, charming characters, and engaging puzzles. As the third installment in the franchise, it delivers a piratical adventure that remains true to its roots while introducing modernized visuals and a refined **** in the whimsical Caribbean, players embark on a quest as the charismatic Guybrush Threepwood to rescue his love, Elaine Marley, from the clutches of the undead pirate LeChuck. The game's narrative unfolds through hilarious dialogue and quirky interactions with a colorful cast of characters, each with their own eccentricities and motivations. Visually, The Curse of Monkey Island shines with its hand-drawn art style, bringing to life the vibrant locales and quirky inhabitants of the pirate-infested world. From bustling ports to eerie ghost ships, each scene is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of whimsy and adventure.Gameplay revolves around solving inventive puzzles that range from logic-based conundrums to zany antics that require outside-the-box thinking. The humor permeates every puzzle, offering a blend of challenge and amusement as players unravel the mysteries of the cursed voodoo ring and navigate through pirate politics. While the point-and-click mechanics may feel dated to some players, the game's timeless humor and engaging storyline ensure an enjoyable experience for fans of adventure games. The voice acting adds depth to the characters, enhancing the comedic timing and emotional resonance of pivotal moments. Occasional pacing issues and obscure puzzle solutions may frustrate newcomers, but The Curse of Monkey Island remains a classic example of storytelling in gaming. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of the Monkey Island series, capturing the essence of swashbuckling adventures with a dose of irreverent charm.. Absolute beauty this one. Not even Metacritic can silence me here. Get wrecked.. Great adventure game, with the acid humor of always in the saga and with fun puzzles, maybe not well aged. For me an unachievable ideal of a video game and storytelling. Awesome humor, art style and characters.. Best adventure game all time. I finished this game many times. I recommend this game to everyone.. At first, I thought that this game would cast a curse upon me, turn me into a monkey or something. But no, it really did not. This game is beyond being decent. It has its great moments, interesting puzzles and game mechanisms that you cannot find on today's game market. It is and will be remembered as a classic. Anyways, I couldn't be bothered to type more in this over-exaggerated manner. Just take my word for it, this game is awesome.. This game is amazing. Has been my fav game for a long time and i revisited it. I got to admit, I still enjoyed it and had a fun time. The dialog is funny, the puzzles are very good, the characters are very charming and the art style has that disney feel to it. It's main downside is the fact that if you play it on a high end monitor, the game looks like a pixelated mess, but you can't expect a game from 1997 to hold up to today's graphical standards. All in all, if you like point and click adventure games and/or pirates, you simply have to play this game.. very funny very funny game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. Was a pleasure to play as a kid there's not enough games quite like it. It's an adventure sim with many tales to tell and secrets to find. Such a classic game which I had in my youth love the storyline and the puzzles. Gotta love Guybrush.. Funny, great localizations (I tried Italian), still enjoyable today Try it, it one of the great games of point and click adventures sunset era. A piece of gaming history. The Curse of Monkey Island (CMI) featured a pionary graphics engine that redefined the benchmarks of the period with its unique, cartoon-like, yet extrenel. Great soundtrack. Very nice looking backgrounds. Good sense of humour and reasonable level of difficulty.. I cant really add anything to the points already said in other reviews, but it was a really funny and enjoyable experience troughout the entire game and i was surprised by myself that i remembered nearly every thing and had to use the guide only to times. Pirate point and click adventure with fun puzzles and typical, weird, awkward, morbid Monkey Island humor. This is my favorite of the series. The graphics are 100% different than in the first or second game, but this unique style is just perfect for the atmosphere. Even over 20 years after release i still love playing through The Curse Of Monkey Island now and then. So many good memories and a comforting, uplifting distraction from real life. It's a ""simple"" game (like point and click adventures usually are) but you can feel it has heart. A mus play for point and click adventurers!. An amazing game, the art-style is unique and looks fantastic, the point-and-click game-play is very fun and it has a great coin-menu, that is very good for these types of games(and I, at least, haven't seen it in any other game, would have loved to also have it in the other Monkey Island games, but I think this one is the only one that uses this system.) The music is awesome and fits perfectly the style of the game and the settings, as well as the environmental effects, which are very well used in the scenes to create atmosphere. The voice-acting is brilliant, and I would especially credit the person who voiced Guybrush, who is just such a loveable character and the voice fits perfect. Puzzels are fun and varied, and can also get very hard at the mega-monkey difficulty. I can not find any faults with this game, and I actually find it as a perfect adventure game, and therefor I give it a perfect score! One of the best games of all time.. One of the greatest adventure games of all time. Was not a fan of the art style at first but it aged really well. The puzzles are silly, but the story does get to be engaging. Ultimately it is maybe the best humorous game.. 'The classic game'. This and its second part are the best graphic adventures I've ever played. A story of pirates with humor and puzzles. What more could you want.. One of the best adventure games ever made. Great story and humor, music and design. Perfection!. It's the best adventure game ever. I'm confused why they haven't release a remastered version of it yet.. This game is an all-time classic for me. Simple but compelling story with solid, memorable characters and really funny dialogue. Some great clever puzzles with the right amount of difficulty, and you can get hints in-game through dialogue if you're stuck. Amazing soundtrack and excellent voice acting. Endlessly replayable despite its linearity. Wonderful cartoony graphics with charming beautiful backgrounds by Bill Tiller. What's not to love? (the rushed ending due to time constraints probably, still an amazing game.). LucasArts adventure games were among the first computer games I played (that weren't y'know, Snake or Oregon Trail or played in an arcade...) Monkey Island is still my favorite of all the games, and MI3 my favorite of the MIs. This was some pretty amazing art at the time, jumping from 2 to this, but even today I still love it because I think it matches fantastically well with the bright silliness of the MI universe itself. Great dialogue, characters, story, music... I've played this countless times and I never get tired of it.. I'm surprised how well this game holds after 20 years. The hand-drawn graphics still does the job well. And even if I think of it as the worst of all three games I played in the series, it is still a great poin&click game that I can recommend to almost anybody. One of the best I have ever played, to be honest. The humor is hilarious in this one as in the previous ones. The puzzles and story are just fun to play. The characters are memorable and likable. I wish there were more games like this one.. Unlike other films and games of my youth, The Curse of Monkey Island is still as entertaining now as it was when I originally fell in love with the game. A combination of beautiful animations, a hilarious plot, memorable characters, exceptional voice acting and a quality soundtrack means you've got yourself a classic Lucasarts point 'n' click adventure that stands the test of time. Puzzle solutions can be tricky for newcomers to the Monkey Island franchise though and the rushed ending can cast a pall on what is otherwise an excellent adventure game.. Best point and click adventure game ever made. The characters, writing, graphics are spot on and the voice acting is excellent. This game has an atmosphere to it like no others made before or after. Even though the original creators of Monkey 1 & 2 were not (as) involved in the making of this sequel, It has everything in it from it's legacy and done in the best way possible. Even if you played through this game a dozen times it's fun to pick up and just look at the beautiful graphics, listen to the excellent lines and soundtrack, and explore the rustic charms of Blood Island.. It is a must-play classic game , it is the best game of the monkey island series in my opinion , it has nice and unique graphics , there is a huge quality soundtrack for every place you go and characters are beloved , there are great puzzles , funny dialogues and easter eggs from other games too. The audio just fits there wherever you go. Voice acting is AWESOME for every character. it is by far the best game as you can enjoy the big work from developers in every frame. Monkey 4 and 5 have nothing to do with this 2,5D game. I wish more Monkey games like this will be released in the future that are worked in story and puzzles. You will love it even if you don't like pirate or adventure games LEGEN ... DARY Arrrgghhhh... ahhhh... ahhhh... AHHHH... CHOOOO!. This, along with Grim Fandango, are two of the greatest games of any generation ever made. But what makes this one just about superior in my book is the fact that, 19 years after it was made, it still holds up as well as the day it was made. The hand drawn 2D style is so timeless that if this came out now, people would not bat an eyelid. It's so good in fact that while other games in this series have actually required a remaster to be playable to a modern audience (and Day of the Tentacle, come to think of it - all excellent games), this one doesn't. What it does need though is a way to be playable on modern systems without a program called ScummVM. If it were re-released on GOG or whatever, this would be an instant buy for me. The humour in this title is stunning, the puzzles bizarre yet logical, the characters are exceptional and... it's just perfection, it really is. The age of the point and click adventure is long gone sadly, but I am always happy to say that the glut of them we had throughout the 90s raised the bar so high that they couldn't foreseeably have been beaten anyway, so they went out on a high note. Eternal thanks to LucasArts from this gamer for both the memories of first playing this with my jaw permanently dropped at the experience, and the fact I have replayed it once every two years on average since release with the same feeling of joy.. The definition of perfection in a graphic adventure game. Smooth and intuitive gameplay, very cool graphics, very nice storyline, impressive soundtrack, interesting and sometimes frustrating (but that's the core of graphic adventures) puzzles, great characters, and all that mixed with a very funny sense of humour, definetely a MUST experience for graphic adventure lovers, and for everyone that likes videogames really.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While this game is great, I don't think it is the best in the series. DO NOT THINK I HATE THIS GAME. I love this game! It has so many memorable, funny and great moments with excellent writing and graphics. It has a brilliant soundtrack and one of the best songs in gaming of all time. However, this does not have the sharp wit its predecessors held close, and seems more of a fan made Monkey Island than anything, but in a respectful way to the originals. Take for example 'Act 3'. Without giving away too much, this starts off strong and enjoyable, a masterpiece in gaming. This turns into 'Sid Meiers Pirates!' like game-play with having to take down ships, followed by beating their captains in a sword fight using not attacks, but insults. No violence, just pure comic relief. There is clever writing to this part, but soon it all becomes repetitive and boring. The first game did this as well, yet managed to be fun and enjoyable, with no delay. Here, its a chore. Also the ending is rushed beyond belief, and sticks out like a sore thumb. In conclusion, the first and second games in the franchise are better than this, both retro and special editions. However, I still strongly recommend giving this game a try if you can get your hands on it, whether you are new to the series or not.. Best game I've ever played (and trust me, I've played a lot). If you love adventure point and click games half as much as I do, please consider playing this wonderful masterpiece. Best chapter of the Lucasart series imo, by far.. What a masterpiece. Let's get the only problem out of the way: This isn't Monkey Island 3. This is neither the successor to Monkey Island 2, nor the conclusion of Ron Gilbert's Monkey Island trillogy. This answers no questions, and doesn't in any way satisfy the hunger for a real Monkey island. But oh boy, this is one of the best Adventure games and Video games in general of all time. This was made by fans of Monkey Island and Adventure games, with an rediculous amount of love and production value. You can see it as the worlds greatest fan-game. I think I first played this around 1999 as an small child. And since them, I play this game at least once a year. Allthough I know the solution to all puzzels, I sill find this game to be A+ entertainment, and always discover some new detail, I've overlooked before. This game offers great dialoge, beautiful scenery, a superb soundtrack, great characters, professional and matching voice acting, good puzzles, a good coin-based interface, timeless humor, beautiful artwork and animation, nice divesion, and a truly great journey. This game may never fill the gape that rose when Ron Gilbert lost control over the IP, but it will be one of the greatest and funniest games of all time for generations to come.. One of the all-time classics of adventure gaming. While some adventure games had challenge and some sought to imbue a sense of wonder (mostly through graphics), Curse of Monkey Island had everything, from humour to adventure while being able to develop characters. Can anyone forget having a banjo shredoff with Edward Van Helgen or tossing logs against Haggis McMutton?. I remember being 9 and had already played the likes of Island of Dr Brain, Super Solvers, Eco Quest, Some other Sierra games, and Myst. I wouldn't say I was in love with the adventure genre, as I'd love a good game of Doom or Quake over these titles anyday. Then came along The Curse of Monkey Island. Wow, did my perception of adventure gaming change. Sadly, the game was so good and masterful that it raised the bar for adventure gaming tenfold. Not even Monkey Island 4 could capture the masterful artwork and humor of its predecessor. No other point-and-click game would ever challenge this title's illustrious perfection. Find a way to play it. Now.. One of the best games I've ever played. For those of you that don't know, The Curse of Monkey Island (CMI or MI3) is a point-and-click puzzle game where the player solves puzzles by collecting and combining items and using those items to do solve a problem. The game has an extremely simple control scheme, it's entirely mouse controlled and extremely easy to get used to. The art style is incredibly charming and pleasing to look at. The art consists of what seems to be beautifully hand-painted environments and cartoon like sprites for objects that move. The game is fully voiced and has some superb dialogue with some great voice acting. There are so many jokes to be heard and laughs to be had. The story is great too, I particularly enjoyed Blood Island, and there is variety in gameplay which stops the game from becoming repetitive somewhere in the middle of the game. The puzzles can be hard, but are satisfying to complete. For those of you who like a challenge there is a game mode with more puzzles (recommended!!) CMI is an incredible game, I would recommend this game to anyone.. Classic LucasArts point and click adventure masterpiece. Beautiful drawing, hilarious dialogue, great adventure, great puzzles, awesome voice acting, great music.. The unbelievable game. So much joy and humor. I love it. It is for me the game which stays in my top 10 list. Bravo again for the Lucas Art team. Superb.. Best adventure game (along with ""The Longest Journey""), and one of the best game ever made. This is the funniest game out there: every single line of dialogue is to die for! Characters, situations and puzzles are priceless. It features the most ergonomic interface of the genre. Graphics, animations and art style are still great and always will be, like an old fashioned Disney cartoon. Music, sounds and actors' voicing are really good.. The best monkey island game in my humble opinion. A unique plot involving guybrush and elaine leading to hilarious circumstances. Great performance by Le'chuck in this one. @ DavidD if I met you I would flat out kick you in the balls. Besides that, this game is 100% classic, with a awesome visuals style and atmospheric music this game will never get old... Makes me want to start playing it again >:D. While being a departure to the style of the first 2 monkey island games which had a darker tone, The Curse of Monkey is one of the best Lucas Art adventure games of the 90s. Having very memorable game moments, very funny witty humour, great atmospheric music, and beautiful styled graphics - I love the warped environment style and its one of my favourite art styles all of gaming. Curse really used the pirate theme well, Pirates of the Caribbean clearly borrowed ideas, themes and characters from the Curse of Monkey Island. The music is original, interesting and memorable and the song half way through this game is one of my most beloved moments in video games. Unfortunately like most Lucas Art adventure games - the final act of the game was rushed, did not wrap of the story as it should and had a disappointingly short ending. Nevertheless, The Curse of Monkey Island is one of my favourites! A pirate I was meant to be! Trim the sails and roam the sea!. LEGENDARY! The BEST game I`ve ever played. Funny, thoroughly enjoyable and clever! Not to mention the great dialogues, amazing songs (the opening theme of the series, in particular) and unique graphics and scenarios!. Great adventure game, the pinnacle of a certain style within the genre. I actually prefer it to the second part, and consider it at least just as good as the first one. If someone is into playing the classics of gaming, i do believe this one should be in there.","the third installment in the monkey island series delivers a piratical adventure that remains true to its roots . visually, the game shines with its hand-drawn art style, bringing to life the vibrant locales . the voice acting adds depth to the characters, enhancing the comedic timing ."
463.Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES,"Get FES no matter how familiar you are with ""Persona 3"". [June 2008, p.86]. FES' other addition -- a remarkably expansive epilogue called ""The Answer"" that's instantly accessible from the title screen -- simply cannot be missed.. This game was my first Persona game and it's still my favorite in the series. As a JRPG fan, this blew me away with unique qualities I rarely saw in the JRPGs I had played so far. From the stylistic menus and unique anime artstyle to the kickass OST that even had a dude rapping over sick beats, I got hooked pretty easily. The cast is super memorable and endearing as you see them grow over the story. With the narrative also being very interesting and pretty dark at times. The day cycle that takes place over a year and all the social links were really cool to me as I had never played a game like this before (closest example at the time being TWEWY). And I also liked the fact that not only do you summon Personas in battle to fight for you (which are basically just Stands, which I really enjoy being a JoJo fan) but that those summons are characters from various regions and folklore, which I thought was neat. I'm very happy I played this game because not only did it introduce me to Persona, but the SMT series as a whole which quickly became my favorite JRPG series of all time.. Unquestionably if you did not get around to buying Persona 3 earlier this year then this is another opportunity and one not to be wasted.. If you're after a challenging and engaging game that'll reward you with a huge well of gameplay with polished style, and - we'll just say it - you're not afraid to nerd out, Persona 3 FES is an all around quality title that it'd be a shame to miss.. Persona 3 FES lacks the memorabilia, but packs more in-game content at a cheaper price. The newer version offers a chance for Atlus to recruit new MegaTen fans and should be enticing enough even for those that picked up Persona 3 last year.. The bottom line is simple: if you love true RPGs, then you need to pick up this game.. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3: FES is a hardcore title with hardcore appeal, and it's not intended to a blockbuster.. The deepest story and characters of the entire series (yes, including the persona 2 duology too). This game revolutionized Atlus at the time, introducing so many new gameplay aspects never done before in the original release, including the new art and soundtrack direction, gameplay, and sim aspects. Unlike it's successors however, persona 3 truly complemented these new aspects in the most meaningful ways tied into it's story. The story has the most beautiful commentary on the fear of not living to the fullest vs fearing death I've ever seen in fiction. The game also, unlike future installments, had a cast that really had human flaws like jealousy, and laziness; a cast that DIDN'T want to follow you around everywhere, and had their own growth developments outside of the main character's presence. This game pulls no punches when it comes to characters dying, and it can feel like a big emotional punch in the gut, sometimes even bringing tears out of it's players. This game is sometimes a bit slow, with the movement in the overworld feeling clunky especially, however beneath lies a life changing story that everyone should experience. P.S. Persona 3's been adapted into 4 continuous movies; yeah FOUR. They're INCREDIBLE though, and arguably go deeper into the story than the GAME does... needless to say, I binged all four back to back, and I think they're an incredible way to experience this story in 6 hours rather than 90!. The improved version of the original Persona 3 released for PS2 (as with many other Atlus titles, you got to wait for a year or a few before buying any game, because they'll publish the ""definitive version"", sometimes for the same console as in this case and you'll regret having jumped into the hype train and bought the first version on launch), a somewhat radical departure from the earlier 3 Persona titles (Persona 1 released for PS1 in 1996 localized outside Japan as ""Revelations: Persona"" - a re-release with several differences was launched in 2009 for the PSP - Persona 2 Innocent Sin was never released outside Japan except in a PSP remaster in 2011, and the 3rd title, Persona 2 Eternal Punishment was released for PS1 in 2000. The PSP remaster was only released in Japan in 2012) noticeable when you face unimpressive shadows rather than the iconic Kazuma Kaneko designed demons from previous entries, and also by the fact that your protagonist is limited by time constraints, a calendar system, to operate, and you have to spend all your daytime at banal activities like reading, eating or hanging out with colleagues trying to improve your social ranks, and fight ""shadows"" at night only. The story isn't very interesting, definitely less so than the Persona 2 duology and still draws too much inspiration from then already worn out anime tropes, despite the characters and their Persona have some cool designs which would crown Shigenori Soejima as a major artist for upcoming Atlus titles. The calendar system can prove to be a nuisance as you spend more time in a half baked ""social life"" simulator than in the turn based combat the series (and its predecessor, Shin Megami Tensei - which 1994 spin-off ""If"" was the main inspiration for the development of Persona) became known for. There are no demon negotiations either and the only dungeon in the game, Tartarus, gets boring fast. Still, since it was the first title to follow this formula it still has its merits. When 4 and 5 came out it was already repetitive and unimpressive, if anything, 4 and 5 only increased the value of 3 since the later titles feel even more childish.. Just want to say this first but I find it so stupid that metacritic considers a 7 mixed or average, it should be part of green aka good as well cause a 7 is not mixed or average it's good! Anyways I just wanted to say that first, Persona 3 Fes has a fantastic story a many fantastic, charming and interesting characters and the gameplay while fun is not nearly as refined as polished as it sequals which definitely hurts the experience a little, the combat is clunky and not as well refined as its sequals, the fusion of personas has some issues that were fixed in the sequels and the social links having a reversing mechanic is dumb But overall I still really love this game! And I'm excited for Persona 3 Reload!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. great music and a revolution in combat and combining simlife with jrpgs. but is literally unplayable. the only persona game that does not lets u control your party. u can use a tactics system that barely works. no character development. horrible pacing","if you're after a challenging and engaging game, this is an all around quality title . the cast is super memorable and endearing as you see them grow over the story . the newer version offers a chance for Atlus to recruit new MegaTen fans ."
464.NASCAR Racing 2003 Season,"Despite being 20 years old, this game still proves to be one of the best NASCAR games of all time. I genuinely had more fun playing this then I ever did with heat 5.. This is bar none, the greatest NASCAR game of all time. Extremely modable and even without mods the game is fantastic. So much so that it is still widely used in 2023 20 years after it's release. There is absolutely no contest, this is the best NASCAR game ever made, and none can really compare. NR2003 is THE best nascar simulator you can get and with a great community and easily moddable files this game just ROCKS!. Complete respect for this game being the basis for modern simulation racing games such as iRacing.. The best NASCAR game of all time, hands down. Graphics: 8/10, great for the era and actually hold up very well with some very minor mods Gameplay: 9.5/10, physics are great - realistic and very fun to play UI: 8/10. Only complaint I have is that the in-game paint booth ****.. NASCAR Racing 2003 Season is NASCAR simulation at its finest. It has no career mode, but it doesn't need one, the core idea of the game is to accurately replicate the feel of stock car racing in 2003, and the hit the nail right on the head. To this day, it is only matched by iRacing, a sim that was built off of the code of NASCAR Racing 2003.. NASCAR Racing 2003 Season is definitely a game ahead of its time. The fact that mods are still being released should give you all you need to make this a must have...only problem, good luck getting your hands on a copy at a reasonable price. I used to own this game and made the mistake of selling it years ago, trying to land a copy now is a tad difficult. Regardless this is a must have for avid NASCAR fans looking for a great racing simulator. The physics are top notch for its age and one can easily spend hours just toying with the possibilities. All in all NR2003 is easily the best NASCAR game available, yes even better than the latest renditions of the sport. GET A COPY IF YOU CAN!. Graphics 6/10 Physics 8/10 Cars 7/10 Tracks 8/10 Career mode 7/10 Multiplayer 8/10 Presentation 4/10 User Interface 5/10 Sounds 6/10 Music 3/10","despite being 20 years old, this game still proves to be one of the best NASCAR games of all time.

465.NORCO,"A good experience, altho a bit lacking. The setting, characters and story are really interesting and leave you wanting more at the end. Not that its a bad game, but its a bit rushed.. Norco is a game with great potential, amazing art and concepts, but feels like it was given up on at some point. A lot of characters and subplots are never really explored and game ends suddenly early. It should be easily 10-hours or so longer than it is. Still a very interesting experience!. Such a disappointing climax. I actually cannot remember a worse ending execution. So, some plot points are explained within the last 10 sentences, half of them being white text on a black screen, and BOOM, credits. The narration and mood of the game were excellent if it wasn't for the last 5 minutes (seriously!).. Strange little point and click adventure that got good reviews, but other than that I knew nothing going in. Went some unusual directions. But ya, I'd recommend. Took about 9 hours to finish so not too long.. In the near future a young woman returns to the refinery town of Norco, Louisiana following the death of her mother and discovers that her brother has gone missing. Norco can occasionally be a little frustrating when it doesn’t really make it clear what you’re supposed to do next in order to progress, but the plot, interesting characters, graphical style and sound design all help to create a unique atmosphere. Fans of the point and click genre should enjoy this.. I'm all for old school graphical nostalgia, but really wish there was just a bit more detail in the scenes. It was too pixelated for my tastes. The story was a bit too.....bizarre and convoluted.. Norco is one of those games that stays with you, the time goes by and you still remember those. It has a very well written story altough it turns a bit complicated towards the end but is good anyway. also beautiful pixel art, really good music and some memorable characters. To be honest i love PnC games but im not into text based games and this one has a balance that i never thought i would like. Im very glad i gave it a shot.. The best thing it does is tell a very compelling, emotionally moving world, full of human weaknesses. There's cancer, dysfunctional family issues, corruption of the rich and powerful, gimmicks to make money and habitat struggles with nature. It has an appeal similar to a Radiohead album, it discusses and reflects on things many people struggle through day to day. Though it fixes the pacing issues of early 90s adventure games, some of the story beats are a bit loose like from that era. Along with an ending that doesn't wrap things well, could have been more complete but still a great experience. I am 100% looking forward to supporting Geography of Robots next game.. I'm a big fan of point-and-click puzzle games, and pixel art, but I found this game really, really dull. The puzzles can barely be called puzzles, more of a waste of time. The story and characters were really unengaging. I'm surprised that this game has gotten such high scores, I found little to make me feel as though I wanted to continue playing.. Very entertaining, i like this game because you can complete it in a day, it has a compelling story and the ambient feeling is special, the design of the caracter is good too, not a single complain, i enjoyed it !. Another one of these games that critics praise for NO reason. This game is pathetic really. Boring from start to finish. The plot barely makes sense and is on the level of something that L. Ron Hubbard might write. If you like to spend 5-6 hours reading walls of text and clicking on pixelated graphic screens have fun with this one.. Norco features an engaging story and is filled to the brim with secrets and fun characters. I think the story got a little scattered and hard to follow as the game pulled the pieces in for the finale. I am not sure how many endings there are but the driving force of the game was seemingly unresolved at the end for me. The few non point-and-click aspects of the game were few and far enough between to be fresh and inventive. Would recommend this to any narrative style adventure game enthusiasts. Beat in just under 5 hours in one sitting, thanks again GamePass.. First of all, i'm a huge (HUGE) fan of Disco Elysium and Kentucky Road Zero, and for that reason i don't understand the comparison. Yeah, it's well written and sometimes can be evocative, like these games. Yeah, the setting and atmosphere remind somehow to KRZ... but that's it. The plot doesn't do anything new or interesting, and doesn't explain the mysteries and weird things that happens. The characters are... simply ok. And the mix of humor and trascendental/religious themes may work in some points, but in general i'm disappointed. in my humble opinion, I think that the game tries too hard to be deep (without achieving it).. Easily the best point and click adventure game I've ever played. Smart writing, interesting characters, funny moments, some mild and intuitive puzzling. The exact midpoint of Kentucky Route Zero and Disco Elysium. You can get a bad ending if you miss a few things but, there is an autosave that you can reload to rectify it. This is on Gamepass so no reason to not check it out.. One of the best writing in any point and click ever. Also feels like the next evolution of point and clicks it becomes a bunch of different games at times, creative way to do it. You won't regret playing this.. Stellar: a must buy. Seriously, get it. Pros: - graphics are beautiful - story is.... amazingly thought provoking. There's so much to talk about, so many ideas that it deals with intelligently, that just throwing them out here would do you a disservice. Seriously: the game speaks for itself. And beautifully so! My translation of it's ideas would just be muddying things. - minigames are fun. - the amount of side-missions that you can stumble into are really neat and range from hilarious to depressing. - a lot of earnestly funny moments Cons: - too short - not meant for people who want a lot of fast-paced action, or dislike reading - not a game for people who don't like stories or complex narratives - the ending is very philosophical and interesting, but as the reviews show, it can definitely go over some people's heads.. This one is overrated. Yes the writing is pretty good, at least not banal, at least in the beginning. But I had no fun with it. The atmosphere was good enough, but the story was not.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Short and interesting story with delightful pixel-art and soundtrack alongside it. A tribute to old-point and click games with a very distinctive modernized approach. Most gameplay mechanics felt like failed experimentation and some exploration segments also felt less rewarding. The lack of voice acting was also detrimental to the experience.. Good. Reminded me of the Jake Hunter series and Portopia Serial Murder on the Famicom/NES. A visual novel type of game, you would like it if you like narrative focused games.. For me the best Writing since Disco Elysium. If you enjoy great writing/Story in Videogames thats must buy.. Just an incredible game. I'm not sure what EDGE was thinking (or Playing), but it's an early GOTY candidate for me.. Amazingly beautiful pixel art, great soundtrack and sound design, the writing of this game is sooo good you won’t be disappointed!",a lot of characters and subplots are never really explored and game ends suddenly early . narration and mood of the game were excellent if it wasn't for the last 5 minutes (seriously! ).
466.Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss,"One of the best DLC`s which were ever made.................................. None of the bosses in this dlc miss, artorias and manus are my favorite bosses in all of dark souls 1, and the sanctuary guardian isnt an amazing boss but its still a very good boss and also the lead up to kalameet (and also the fight) is amazing. You can fast travel to every bonfire in the dlc which i wish they did in the base game with the remaster but that doesnt have to do with this. My issue with the dlc is the areas, they arent bad but theyre not that good either, theyre pretty small and linear.. The game is very beautiful, both for the design of the areas and for the bosses (almost all of them). He has a good variety of weapons including swords, greatswords, ultra greatswords, axes, hammers, scythes and many more. The system of leveling up and upgrading weapons is perhaps a little too cumbersome, but it's an unnecessary problem. The bosses are among the best of Fromsoftware's games and almost all clean and easily doable.. Its a good game,with good design and amazing story,written by an amazing developer, mihazaki. I loved this game, even lost izalith who was mid,but its ok because the gameplay is amazing.. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. An overall fantastic Dlc which features some of Dark souls best bosses. The environments are for the most part okay at best. The atmosphere is amazing.. Every boss in this DLC is memorable and super challenging. That's makes this a great DLC, along with the cool new items and weapons you receive. I just wish the areas were more uniquely designed from the main game. Still great though.. Looking at the seven DLC the Souls series has released in retrospect, Artorias of The Abyss is easily one of the best of Fromsoft's work. With Artorias, Kalameet and Manus proving to be great boss fights (along with a decent first boss of the Sanctuary Guardian), the enemies being new additions that are creepy and interesting and new things to be seen, it really shows just how DLC and expansions are done right. Sure the DLC will only take a few hours to complete, but I prefer games that manage to make powerful moments in shorter games. Bigger isn't always better and adding too much to the structure can make it feel bloated. This of course is far from this DLC and it deserves much praise for what it accomplishes. In the current standing of the DLCs, Old Hunters is first with gold with Artorias is very close with silver and Ringed City is significantly more distant with bronze.. Good DLC. Bosses were very hard, unfortunately I found it very unbalanced. To be able to beat the bosses you have to be at a pretty high level. This meant that the battles between the regular enemies were very easy. It was way too short.. This is really good DLC but It was horrible marketing. The content was added in a patch, so you could still fight players who had all the DLC items. I found that to be very unfair considering the DLC content gave a clear advantage over the other non paying players also the content was there you just need to unlock it through payment which I really don't like.. I thought this was a little disappointing. I am a huge Dark Souls fan and I was waiting for this DLC with more excitement than most retail games. I bought it day one and jumped straight back on. Problem is, I jumped straight back off again too. The DLC is extremely short for people who have mastered Dark Souls already, I completed it in around 3-5 hours (or something?) It's is quality DLC for the most part with new interesting area's and extremely cool bosses, but for the £10 price tag it just isn't enough. The PVP area is a little underwhelming and it seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. Overall I thought this would bring new life to a game I had already spent a ridiculously long play time on, but really it was a short lived adventure that I can really on recommend to people who have recently completed Dark Souls. As for the rest of us, you'll burn through it in no time, and I'd recommend it still but at a discounted price.. This is one of the best add on´s yo can buy if you are a fan of dark souls, This DLC feature new areas, enemies and some kick-ass weapons, armors and epic boss fight it´s and you will discover what the abyss is and meet some characters that are constantly mention in game dialogs. I´ll give it a solid 10 but there is a problem with this DLC I think it comes with a bug that freeze the game in the loading screen when you die and are about to revive, it´s really annoying, it doesn't happen so often but it happens.. Wow the wait has paid **** of the best price to content DLC this gen.Like DRVP said the bad thing is the lack of achievements which have become **** you're a fan of Dark Souls this is a must purchase.. Artorias of the Abyss is great a DLC. The new areas are interesting and the bosses are really challenging. Although I'm not a PvP person, I enjoyed the new PvP arena too. The only flaw in my opinion is the lack of new achievements.","i loved this game, even lost izalith who was mid,but its ok because the gameplay is amazing . the bosses are among the best of Fromsoftware's games and almost all clean and easily doable . i just wish they were more uniquely designed from the main game ."
467.Metal Gear Solid HD Collection,"You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. A wise man once said... MGS2 is subjectively the best game; and MGS3 is objectively the best game. And I can't think of a better way to put it. Both are arguably the best stealth action games ever made, with their revolutionary stories and gameplay. Whilst MGS2 has the better story, MGS3 has the better gameplay, and both are incredible experiences. Peacewalker in this collection is by far the best way to experience it. The updated FPS and controls make it a much more competent game, and really show what it was envisioned to be. Peacewalker, while less popular, is still hella fun, and an absolute must play to fans of the series as a tie in between mgs3 and 5 (4 is much later in the timeline), and a very fun more action-oriented title. Closing thoughts: literally 3 masterpieces on one disk, that's nuts!!. Three wonderful action games remastered for HD by Blue Point Games. If you've never played them before, this is the best way to do so. I would rate this collection with a 9.1 out of 10.. I am writing this review after finishing all the games in the series. I never played the games when I was a child but have seen references and memes growing up. I played the games for the first time with this collection. I'll leave a short review for each title here. This collection I picked up on PSN for $37 aud (from memory). this price is good for the content I got considering local 2nd hand versions are roughly $50 for some reason. Generally these games have aged. The controls are dated but manageable. Graphics (dispute the HD Facelift) in some cases aged well and in other cases not so much. I give MGS2 Sons Of Liberty a 7/10. pretty ok gameplay but the dead cell members and their fights are not too interesting. The story swapping main characters early wasn't a great choice but 'Pliskin' was a fun supporting character. Raiden in an ok MC but lacks charisma compared to Snake. Not a bad game overall. MGS3 Snake Eater is a 9/10 game dispute questionable hitboxes with CQC. I'm not too sure if it was the HD collection and looking it up no one really has the same issue that I saw. It might have just been me. MGS3 is probably the best character driven story of the series with the main conflict being between the MC and his mentor. good gameplay and level layouts. plenty of good boss fights but some of the Cobra unit could have BEEn better. plenty of good interactions with supporting characters (though somewhat awkward and the 'humour' being pretty dry). The other main antagonists are pretty fun in different ways. Ocelot being a recurring enemy throughout the story is fun and the leader of enemy forces Volgin is a big dumb cartoonish villain. I enjoyed this game a lot for what it was. MGS Peace Walker I Have to give a 5/10. I previously thought that this game suffered from being made for the PSP. however I finished MGS4 recently and I have changed my mind a little. My problems haven't changed but Peace Walker being released 2 years after MGS4 is a decent return to form. I enjoyed the comic style cutscenes and boss fights but most of the general gameplay and base management was a slog. Though slamming enemies into walls never really got old. I found the level structure and most enemy AI to be lacking but again if you can forgive the hardware is use than you will enjoy this game. I couldn't really get over it unfortunately and didn't like most of the game. Also don't forget MGS3 comes with the original Metal gear games made for MSX. Both Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake Get 6/10 from me. I had a few experience with NES and Sega Mega Drive games growing up. Returning to the era was a nice novelty at first but quickly wore off. I did not hate playing these games but I didn't find it too fun either. a lot of progression is about finding the right thing or finding the right place to be. The key cards are obnoxious to deal with (less so in MG2). MG1 is a basic game. running around enemies and dodging bullet sprites for the most part. Being as old as the game is, it isn't a bad first game in the series. MG2 fixes a few issues with the original with a better UI but in places is hard to play and progress. overall I liked MG2 better but also found myself more frustrated with it at the same time. A great collection and one worth getting for people new to the series.. this game is the worst evar!!, there is no first person cardboard boxing. kojima was mad because of this review.... The games just don't hold up very well. MGS games rely heavily on presentation, with polish and graphics being much more important than gameplay. The graphics hold up pretty well, but I just value gameplay much more than presentation. I felt disappointed in MGS 2 as I was playing it. The creativity in the game felt like gimmicks. MGS 3 had better gameplay but also felt like it would have been a movie/anime. Still, these games are very polished and important for video game history.. The best HD collection available till this day. The only bad thing that can be said about the poor controls.. Having played through MGS2 and 3 on PS2 many years ago, then MGS2 on 360 I felt I'd hit the trifecta. I haven't touched Peace Walker and never will get the chance. Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater are both fantastic experiences, sure they verge on the ridiculous most of the time but they're still very good. Graphically they still look pretty and the sheer volume of content means you get bang for your buck. The controls still take a while to get used to and will probably never get the upgrade they need. The whole Raiden thing in MGS2 never had an effect on me because MGS2 was the first MGS I played. This makes MGS2 my favourite in the series basically because everything was foreign and new. The whole sneaker concept was a huge change from the Duke Nukems and Dark Forces that were around at the time. Snake Eater was too campy for me, all the pervy first person views and sexually weird scenarios (which are littered throughout the series) were too overt for my liking in this outing and took away from the experience. This collection is a must for MGS fans, even if you've already played them, and if you've never played them you really should. If you can look past the convoluted story and supernatural bosses you've got yourself some seriously good gaming ahead of you.. All the three games present in this package aged extremely well and are on par with modern titles in several aspects. However, I had to give it a score of 9 since both MGS2 and MGS3 freeze during some cutscenes, both are not compatible with DualShock 4 and, besides that, the first game is missing - there is no code to claim it on the PlayStation Store either. I'd like to see them remade with enhanced graphics as seen in the stupid **** machines developed by Konami..

Three great games on one disc with updated graphics and mechanics. Plus playing Peace Walker with a controller makes this game so much easier. Great job adding subsistance versions of PS2 and Peace Walker from PSP. Good Collection!. With this, you get to play every Metal Gear game straight from your PS3. You have Metal Gear 1 and 2 in the MGS 3 menu. You have MGS2.3 and Peace Walker, you can digitally buy MGS1, buy physical copies for 4 and 5. With the Legacy Collection, you get MGS 1 and 4 with it, leaving you just to buy MGS 5. Required if you want to experience the Metal Gear series.. Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is one of the best collections out there. It contains 5 Metal Gear games (MGS 2, MGS 3, MGS Peace Walker, and emulations of Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2 inside MGS 3), but Metal Gear Solid is missing from the disc (no worries, it's available on PSN to download, but you have to buy it separately). These games are all time classics. MGS 3 is still highly playable and remains by far the best entry in the series (no, the original Metal Gear Solid isn't the best, sorry). MGS 2 is a controversial game because of Raiden and the conspiracy theory-filled story plus the long cut-scenes (I loved all of those things critics hated XD), but it's still great to play and enjoy. Peace Walker is another great game but it had the misfortune of being originally a PSP game and is erroneously considered just a spin-off in the same way as Portable Ops and Metal Gear Acid. But all these games have been remastered by Bluepoint Studios, so they run at 60 fps and graphics are scaled up nicely at 720p resolution. The old Metal Gear games though are products of their era (they originally released during the NES hayday), so if you play them brace yourselves for some serious difficulty, clunky controls and almost no save points. Typical of NES-era games. Another bonus feature is ""Transfarring"", a method of transfering your save files between PS3 and PS Vita, so you can play the games either at home or on the go. I can't recommend this collection enough. Every gamer and fan should get this epic bundle which is rivaled only by The Master Chief Collection on Xbox One. Now if Konami made it available on PS4 (perhaps along with MGS 4 and MGS 1) it would be the absolute collection for the best saga in gaming.. This was made with so much respect for the original games that is a blueprint on how to port games for other companies. One of the best HD Collection aside ICO | Shadow of the Colossus HD Collection.. Captivating stories, excellent character building, stunning graphics for the early 2000's make this collection a must own. MGS 2 inroduces us to new characters and completely overhauls the MGS series from the first game. MGS 3 does more of the same with new settings, takes us back to the beginnings of lore for the franchise and adds survivalist gameplay. Peace Walker implements new gameplay as well as co-op, multi-level design and several new characters to the series. MGS franchise has always done a superb job of making each iteration of the following games feel fresh, properly continuing the vast story and adding several mechanics never before seen. You will be getting over 60 hours of gameplay with this collection and will be on a thrillride throughout.. I was so damn happy when this came out. It made MGS3 which is my favourite game ever and made it SO MUCH BETTER. Better resolution, screen ratio, framerate, camera control. And it comes with equally improved MGS2 and Peace walker. This game is just one of those that you must get no matter on which console you play on. The only bad thing i can think about is that it doesn't have the monkey hunting game and that playable dream sequence in the prison of MGS3 and the skateboarding minigame of MGS2. I would give it a 9.9 but its closer to tn and thats the closest i can rate it :/. This game.... oooh this game. this game is what you want to prove that you're a gamer. the 2nd game is amazing done everything right from the first game.amazing graphics from the original, good twist and turns in the story. The 3rd game. do i have to say anything....... no? ok. peace walker... might turn some people off with the more grindy rpg stuff, the art style and the monster hunter bosses (**** not **** the game is so goddamn awesome that you're not gonna care about the **** to the question...''should i buy the ****. i think you ****'re either gonna like with the 2nd game. if not that you're maybe like peace walker and fall in love with the 3 game. Amazing stories,quality graphics and a tiny... tiny.... cluncky controls... very tiny problem. 10/10 must buy!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best ""HD"" collections on PS3, surpassing most simply for its great updating of the games included. Many HD mixes I've found to be lacking, really just highlighting the fact that things have moved on a lot between the PS2 and PS3 generations. It helps that the games here (actually I can't speak about Peace Walker as I have yet to play it on PSP OR in this collection) were amongst those that pushed their original hardware, but really you'd almost accept these as being from their current (now last) generation. IF you don't know what MGS is you won't even be looking at this. The series is famous as the best stealthy games, encouraging you to sneak around enemies rather than attack them head on. Crazy characters throughout, fun boss fights that require some brainpower and dexterity and very interesting (if weird and wacky) stories will drag you through all the games. The ONLY way to improve this collection would have been the inclusion of the first MGS game - although it does include Metal Gear 1 and 2 of the MSX as added bonuses.. Pros: HD remastering is very well done, and all three games look crisp and crystal clear. Bonus content includes most of MGS2's Substance edition, the improved third person camera for MGS3, and both MSX Metal Gear games (""Metal Gear"" and ""Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake"") Cons: Games might feel a little dated to some unfamiliar with the PS2 originals. No Secret Theater. ??? Worth owning for MGS3 alone.. Well that's an easy game to mark, three unchallenged masterpiece brought back to life better looking that ever. Each of this game has a great story and more importantly a great gameplay with tons of little perks that ends up being one of the most critically acclaimed (and it's well deserved) saga of modern video games. I don't want spoil anything (even concerning the gameplay) so I won't say more, just if you never played those games before, go run and buy this collection. PS: What a loss for Konami to fire Hideo Kojima, a true genius of video games.. What can you say its mgs. 3 metal gears on 1 disk. 2 excellent games and 1 good 1. If you've been around as long as i have u know what to expect. Never played peace walker before though. It does lack in depth and mechanics but thats understandable considering the system it comes from. Well if i hadnt played the crap out of these already id probably give it a 10. So if you haven't and can stand older style gameplay add a point.. This collection brings one of the best sagas in video game history to life once again.Every one of the games presented brings out a whole nostalgia and excitement to be able to play them once again, bringing all the marvelous stories that complete themselves in a wonderful way. Not only can you explore the oil-tanker as Raiden, as you can also play as the real Snake in hte middle of the cold war in Russia and in Costa Rica, altogether in one single game.This whole bundle makes this HD collection one of Kojima's great choices.. Great HD collection, a must buy for any MGS fan. Amazing combat system, great storyline and stunningly beautiful graphics. If you haven't bought this already go ahead and get it.. What have I been missing? Prior to this collection, I had never played any of the titles beyond Metal Gear Solid for the first PlayStation. We are truly lacking such fantastic storylines in modern gaming - and I feel it is sorely missed. I have even returned to the first MGS because of this collection and will soon finally get around to MGS4.. Not much to tell. MGS2 & MGS3 HD are awesome, Peace Walker is OK, for being a PSP game ported to console. The HD os well done, however I missed some aspects from the old versions that were not included in these new versions. Really worth the money.. Only Played MGS 3 so far but what to say? It's a MGS, it´s a Hideo Kojima at his top level. Loved in every aspects with the exception of the dated controls. If the other two are as good as this i might have to raise my score.. This collection is a fantastic port of the original classics in HD. To clarify to those who don't know it yet, HD remaster does not equal HD remake. It is designed purely to make things look smoother on HD display. Don't expect it to be the Twin Snakes (remake of original MGS) of these games because it is not (You'd be surprised at how many people actually think this way). Having said that the games are exactly how I remembered it back in the days. Both MGS2 and 3 are still fun despite showing some aging mechanics...this is more apparent with MGS2, but it doesn't bother me seeing as I remember the gameplay being that way when I played them years ago. Both the story and characters are extremely well thought out. Peace Walker is another great game. It does suffer a little for being in portable consoles however. The cutscenes are replaced by comic-book like cutscenes. They are a little offsetting if you're expecting full blown cutscenes like MGS2 or 3, but you do get accustomed to them. The story is equally well thought out and the addition of the second analog stick in the controls works wonders for the game. It is certainly a welcome addition to the series. The only problem I really saw in the collection were some slowdowns in cutscenes of **** is especially apparent in scenes where Volgin uses his electricity powers...they're noticeable, but not enough to make you stop playing as they are very brief. Overall, I'd say that you should get this game if you've missed out on the MGS series or just want to replay it again like me. Also MGS1 is not included in this collection because it is a PS1 game, but if you have a PS3 it should be up in the Playstation Store for 10 dollars.. Just finished silent hill HD collection on hard action/hard puzzle mode & needed a few days off so my brain could Recuperate lol great games!!! Now its metal gear solid HD turn so lets start with the good:the graphics are at there best in snake eater(my opinion) everything looks great but when it comes to grass or leaves you can see the Pixels clearly! I thought peace walker would have the better graphics but oddly enough it seems like there's a bit more brightness to the colors used in peace walker than snake eater! Controls & gameplay:snake eater handles perfectly as I played this One on the ps2 so I hopped right in without any difficulty when dealing with controls but newcomers to snake eater, peace walker & mgs 2 might find it awkward & confusing! gameplay has always been great in mgs games so veterans like myself will find it well implemented,easy to use while remaining **** once again the new generation of gamers(I.E. cod players gow players) will have to get used to its Uniqueness & Complexity but once you do you will be pulled into a very enjoyable action/stealth experience! Story:probably the best aspect of these games is the story as its told by interesting characters whether good or bad!! I just love how naked snake assumes or should I say unwantedly assumes the title of big boss in snake eater as well as peace walkers story as snake I mean big boss only takes the missions to truly see if the boss is alive!! Mgs 2 story is good but I prefer to play as snake all the way through not just certain parts as raiden is the main character but all three games are excellently written & paced,the voice acting is perfect and the characters are just believable as you make your way through these rare masterpieces by hideo kojima!! you just can't find great storytelling in games these days anymore as game developers focus more on style then substance with is sad! now the bad:new generation gamers acceptance of these classics as these great games do not follow your typical 3rd person shooter these days so if the new generation keep an open mind to the length(which these games are long)substance(actually gives you a rewarding & entertaining story) last generation control scheme(but easy to learn) then there's basically nothing wrong here! oh & if you hate ling cutscenes just skip them your not forced to watch them ya know.....10/10. Uma das melhores coletâneas lançadas em HD até agora . MGS 2 e MGS 3 são simplesmente 2 dos melhores jogos já feitos , agora com gráficos melhorados , podemos jogá-los novamente , ou para quem não jogou , é o momento para conhece-los , Peace Walker , na minha opinião é um bônus extra , o que vale mesmo são as dua obras-primas lançadas originalmente para PS2 , obrigatórios ! One of the best compilations released in HD so far. MGS 2 and MGS 3 are simply two of the best games ever made, now with improved graphics, we can play them again, or who has not played, is the time to know them, Peace Walker, in my opinion is an extra bonus, what really counts are the dua masterpieces were originally released for PS2, required!. Some of the most overrated games ever. The sneaking is primitive, cumbersome and bugged. It relies on you memorizing enemy paths like an autistic robot. There is no real free thinking involved. There is no real way to quick load the game after being detected. The 3 games are just extremely obnoxious and unejoyable. The controls are complete **** I'd recommend checking out Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory or Thief 3 if you want a real stealth game.. This is the hd collection i was waiting for since god of war started the new trend. These are some of the greatest games of all time, with fantstic graphics for their time that stand the test of time redone in hd, with great stories, characters, ideas, music, gameplay and most of all how unique they are even now. Hideo kojima broke down walls with the original metal gear, and did it again with mgs1, and these games made that great gameplay even better, doing things that were unheard of, such as survival in metal gear solid 3, and the ability to look down sights in a 3rd person game is still uncommon. there controls are based on a japaneese mindset instead of a western one, so that takes time for newer players to get used too, even if they have been slightly changed from the original. Metal Gear Solid HD Collection does exactly what it says on the tin. If you loved the originals, you'll love this. If you didn't like them... well, enough said. If you are a new player, perhaps you should approach with caution. Games have evolved a lot since the peak of MGS. Devoid of nostalgia, these games can flounder a little. MGS2, for example: Great game all the way up until the last third, where it suddenly disintegrates into an incoherent mess. It is widely considered to be the weakest of the franchise (not by me, though). Conversely, many would say that MGS3 is probably the best Solid Snake outing, but I strongly disagree. Part 3 was where the balance between the cut-scenes and gameplay was thrown out of whack. Play for ten minutes, watch for fifteen. It got worse in MGS4 but the rot started back here in Snake Eater. MSG3 also suffers from being a transitional title. The newly introduced elements such as it's camera system are not yet perfected and feel cumbersome when compared to modern games. Overall, this is a solid (pun intended) package, but these games are not perfect and they never were... And where the hell is the first game? That WAS perfect.. This is a phenomenal package, and it even hurts to give it a 9/10. You're getting three full games, each an easy 20-30 hours of gameplay, each with beautiful plots and lots of unique gameplay. You're definitely never going to find another game that's too similar to Metal Gear! Wonderful experience that tests both your strategic intellect and philosophy. Only reason I have it a 9/10 was because, for new players coming in to the series, the controls have a rather steep learning curve. Far from intuitive, but not impossible. Personally, the story, characters, and overall originality, make the difficult control scheme worth it. Great especially for PS3 users, who can buy the original Metal Gear Solid game through the PlayStation Network (or with their PS1 disc), and the fourth game, MGS4: Guns of the Patriots. You can have the complete series, sans a few spin-offs, all on your one console! All in all, a must-buy for people unfamiliar with the Metal Gear Solid series, and a delightful reprise for long-time players.. The best versions of the best games from a legendary franchise. MGS2's plot still amazes me, but the controls feel outdated. MGS3's free camera from the Subsistence release really makes the game a lot better, but it's a shame they didn't include the original Metal Gear Online. Peace Walker's first 4 chapters are great but the last (which you play after the initial credits) is very, very weak. Co-op works well and the multiplayer is fun, and you can play this for dozens of hour, unlocking challenging missions and getting better scores. This is the best collection money can buy.. I am a huge Metal Gear Solid fan, and this collection exceeds so many expectations, and it shows just how good the original games were on PS2. Peace Walker really shines as the controls were completely re-done and extra content added. This HD collection is well worth your money, fan or not.. I am agreeing with most of the professional reviews here. Most game players will know what MGS is, at least in essence. This package would have been worth it with just MGS2 & 3; but the inclusion of PW (which I had never played before) makes this an essential purchase. There are very few immersive gaming experiences like MGS out there. The ability to throw in fourth wall breaking devices and humor and still have you drawn in is 'Kojima magic'. The best for me is MGS3, but they are excellent.. In terms **** package it doesn't really get any better than this, particularly for MGS fans. Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is a reminder of just how epic this stealth-em-up franchise is. It contains MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater and MGS: Peace Walker, the latter of which is a PSP import rather than a PS2 one. Having experienced all MGS outings on the PS3's predecessor I was psyched not only to get the opportunity to see them again in all their glory but also to see how stunning they would look in HD. Then, to add it all off you get Peace Walker. All i can tell you is that these game have stood the test of time and remain the classics that they have always been, they are just generally unforgettable games which have been updated and polished to be played to death all over again. Snake Eater is without doubt the best game of the 3. Infact, Snake Eater is arguably the greatest game ever made. I will never forget the experience that Hideo Kojima delivered with this epic masterpiece. Playing as Snake in a Soviet jungle brings endless hours of fun, intrigue, joy, sneaking and an element of frustration but you will never tire. It's truly one of a kind and as immersive as hell and has a storyline that will have you in awe with all the twists and turns throughout. MGS3 was a landmark moment on PS2 and reborn on PS3 it once again delivers an exhilarating experience, it provides some memorable boss battles along the way with The End, The Fury, The Sorrow among those whose pass you'll cross before embarking on an epic finale with The Boss. Oh and there's also that torturous 10 minute ladder climbing scene to enjoy. And then you can sample MGS2: Sons of Liberty. Not a match for Snake Eater but a great game nonetheless. The plot is somewhat complex to say the least and can be hard to follow but its all worthwhile in the end. The biggest issue with Sons of Liberty for many is the fact you don't play as Snake! Plain and simple, you play as Raiden. And as any true MGS fan would tell you thats criminal! Snake is MGS, however the main problem is Raiden lacks to appeal and is unconventional. Those gripes aside, because you have to to enjoy the game, MGS2 does provide some awesome gaming. Their are some missions that even now are sheer brilliance. The final piece of the jigsaw is Peace Walker. This was refreshing for me as I hadn't played it on PS3 and it was an excellent experience. Set 10 years after Snake Eater, Snake has broken off from The Patriots and formed his own mercenary unit. In Costa Rica the Peace Sentinels, a mysterious group equipped with all the latest weapons, have risen and their presence threatens to endanger the balance of power between the East and West. It's not vintage MGS but it has its moments throughout and is more than a worthy addition to the franchise providing plenty game time. Furthermore, there's an added bonus you can play Metal Gear & Metal Gear 2. In the end this is a collection you simply cannot afford to miss out on, it contains the pinnacle of stealth games and delivers an unforgettable trilogy of epic gaming, the controls are really the only thing that hinder the experience as they are dated and remain in the PS2 era however that doesn't prevent you enjoying each epic outing Kojima has provided. Snake Eater alone is worth your money but the fact Sons of Liberty and Peace Walker are included only enhance what I can only describe as an epic and unmissable set of amazing games. Absolute genius!. i have been eagerly awaiting the release of this collection for a long time now and it was more than worth the wait. i was fantastic to play through MGS2 and 3 again but now with the added HD .. no great tweaks with the graphics but the games are still fantastic to play. the only downside was the Controls took a little bit of getting used to again as they are a bit old school but i will not mark it down for that. the added appeal with this collection is Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker. which i never had the chance to play it on the PSP .. what a great addition to the series ( ok the graphics are not as good but do take into consideration that it was a PSP Game ) another great chapter t the saga and great Game-play. combined with the fact that you get the MGS2 and 3 ""substance"" versions of the games which give you many more extras. this is getting nothing less than 10. While I write this review I remember the memorable experiences and fun that I had going through each of the Metal Gear Solid titles, and there are many. Since I only played MGS 1 and MGS 4 prior to this, I have always wondered what happened and what happened, asking many questions like what happened to Liquid and who is this Raiden. I do however have a small minor problems with Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, which are the fact you play has Raiden in the 2nd game. Not knowing this when I started I was expecting Solid Snake to come back for the entire length of the game instead of a few hours at the beginning of the game. Of course the game plays like that of Metal Gear Solid but since you are not Snake there will be some disappointment when you find out you will be controlling Raiden for the rest of the game. In terms of Peace Walker, I found the selecting missions and carrying them out sort of boring and finding myself going back to Metal Gear Solid 3 (the jewel of the collection, absolutely fantastic) instead. Overall though I did enjoy my run through of both MGS2 and MGS3 and probably will complete MG1, MG2 and peace walker when I have free time. I only wish they remastered MGS1 and added to the collection to make this the ultimate Metal Gear Solid pack. Well done Kojima at creating a fantastic franchise of video games, that I enjoyed playing through.. This game is one of the best selling franchises on PS2 and now its on PS3 in HD. Just the sheer fact of playing this game again let alone the fact that it is in HD now is exhilarating. I","a wise man once said... MGS2 is subjectively the best game; and MGS3 is objectively the best game . both are arguably the best stealth action games ever made, with their revolutionary stories and gameplay . the updated FPS and controls make it a much more competent game, and really show what it was envisioned to be ."
468.Battlefield 3,"Battlefield 3 has a simply decent campaign, notable for its stunning technical achievements and for being one of the first games to use true global illumination on PC—a milestone that would later pave the way for the implementation of Ray Tracing. Other than that, it’s a play-and-forget experience.. The best Battlefield game ever made. It couldn't get any better than this... I only played the campaign: As with all EA games for every good moment in this game, there were dozens of bad ones... Wont even bother to describe them, it is just EA bad game design.. I meant to do a review on the PS3. If I had this game on the highest end PC back in the day, I would be the happiest person on the planet. I would still give it a 9 on the PS3 around the time this game came out. This game is way better than Call of Duty and the other Battlefield games I were playing at the time which were Battlefield Play4Free and Heroes.. The story, multiplayer, gameplay, everything is F***ing good. I play one of the missionin story mode everyday. As an Iranian this is all I want to play. And I'm sorry for my language. English wasn't my first language.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A GAME AHEAD OF TIME. If in 2024 I enjoyed it and literally opened my mouth in surprise at the mechanics and graphics of the game, then I can’t imagine what happened in 2011. This thing is definitely head and shoulders above MW3 which was released at the same time. As for the plot, it’s not bad, but it’s not particularly memorable. I think COD has brighter characters and story setting.. One of the best examples of a franchise that is better than the new, Battlefield 3 still holds up to this day with great graphics, a incredible story, a relative multiplayer, and overall, a great FPS over Modern Warfare 3 and a fantastic experience that EA has yet to unfortunately have yet to deliver a Battlefield game in the same level as 3, outside of 4 and 1. I’m giving it a 9.5 out of 10.. In this game, EA tried to go to the same path COD was going at that time, but maintaining it's roots, it was a good decision imo, very fun game. Good story, fun gunplay, cool setpieces. I played this a long time ago, but from what I remember it was pretty good.. I tried to play it recently but it's a very old game now. It may have been one of the most successful games of its time, but it's impossible to play now. Graphics may be dated, but the story in the single player campaign was pretty bad.. Battlefield 3 is the best Battlefield game so far. Graphics are still insane in 2023 and bf3 is still playable after 10 years.. This game has one of the best single-player fps campaigns ever made. Every single mission is so fun and cinematic. My favourite has to be ""Going Hunting"" since it is so fun and I love how the music is implemented. The only mission I didn't like was ""Operation Guillotine"" since it was just standard boots on the ground but i understand why since it is integral to the game's story. Pls give the game a try. It is amazing.. What a bummer Dice could not capture the magnificence of Battlefield ever again after 3, 4 and 1 because this series was the ULTIMATE online war shooter experience of all time. Battlefield 3 had such incredible maps and gameplay and destruction and team play and I miss everything about it. I wish they would just remake BF3 so we could experience it all over again online, but sadly this series is all but dead. RIP, Dice. You gave me such epic warfare memories; something CoD could never do.. The game is very **** in team play it lacks the level of the players and is unfair in **** it is very good in the style of play and it is very realistic and this is a very good touch for the game. Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!. really sadly this game shows its age... Back when first releised this might be great but now near unplayable everything is better at 4. Story was nice tho had some great moments.. Honestly, I don't care what the single player looks and plays like. Playing the multiplayer is truly amazing. This game has such a unique atmosphere, game play, graphics,. A huge step up from the last entry, Battlefield 3 is a game that stays fun to play from beginning to end. The story isnt exactly new or mind blowing, but thats not what people play these games for.. Great game. The story really good. The scoring is great, visual is really amazing, the voice & sound is also amazing. Developers are lazy critters. The Battlelog site works crookedly in the game a lot of bugs even after 11 years. And I can’t play the game, because I throw out the local anti-cheat, although I don’t have cheats !!!!. Complete trash The gameplay was awful and the story was **** This was the worst game that i played. Besides the general look of the game graphics, sounds, and whatnot. the game play falls short from the previous titles. played Bad company 2 for 500+ hours, BF3 for 700 hours, and this game for 80 hours and I'm already sick of it. Multiplayer is rage inducing experience nothing will works out the way you think it would. spawn camping seems easier on this one than other ones, and the maps… Expa. a time worth respecting EA GAMES. if you place the BF 2042 next to this one, the 2042 becomes a game made by children learning to program games. absolutely amazing game, even after years. one of the best parts of battlefield, still. We are on the top of a high building (at least 6 storeys), given the task to guard a squad that escorts our former squad member, there are enemies right down at the surface level that have a clear target (the squad we need to guard, that is), but guess who they're shooting? Of course they're shooting me! I come to rush a script-spawned location just to get stabbed by a clown that nobody tries to kill, because why? The squadmates are there to pretend that I am not alone and sometimes they even deal damage with random hits. That was too much stupidity for me so I dropped the game right at the beginning. Thank you, Microsoft, for saving me money with your game pass for PC.. I played BF3 on the Xbox 360 through backwards compatibility. And the multiplayer servers are still alive, it’s it’s not many people play the co-op missions anymore. The campaign is pretty short but sweet! The multiplayer is the best part, it’s pretty hard to get into and new players will match with pros, but it’s actually really simple!. The single payer gameplay is good but the multiplayer was where this game truly stood out. Was graphically demanding for its time though and had some compatibility issues but nevertheless a really good game.. This game is amazing, I don't really know how EA managed to make this game in 2011. The graphics still look amazing hell it even is very close to modern games. Campaign was pretty good and I had a lot of fun playing it overall a great experience!. Attention: That's just my opinion! Battlefield 3 - War against terrorists. So I played single player and was very surprised by the details and realism of the game. The levels of the game are directly impressive with interesting missions and war details, the game has a very good realism about war and game details. I really enjoyed the game having a very structured communication between the soldiers and the communication center, it was fun to listen to how they communicate, strategic words and characters, the game felt very realistic. The atmosphere of the game is directly impressive with cool details, in each level that atmosphere is very satisfying and cleverly done. The story of the game is very simple and interesting as America war against terrorists and their leaders, and you try to stop the terrorist attacks with your team. Voice - actors did an impressive job, I enjoyed it. The game itself has an amazing event with certain events, I don't want to say. The game has fantastic weapon mechanics, they feel as strong as real weapons. Personally, the game didn’t give that much time to get used to your team’s characters and others. As for the minus of the game, I played the game on Hard difficulty and noticed a few things that made me nervous that the hardness of the game is very poorly optimized as if the enemies have a very good aim 100%, and I died many times for example: enemy shoot me when I was hiding in spot where you can't shoot through the things as big rock. The game has quite bugs. Some cutscenes face acting look's kinda cringe. And the music in the game didn’t really involve me in the action, there wasn’t much of that music at all, sometimes xD. So the game is really impressive with a realistic war atmosphere and details, has a few downsides. I would rate this game 9/10. Multiplayer good too!. Still remains the best Battlefield game to this day, DICE really nailed it when this one came out, neat campaign, great multiplayer and a ok-ish coop mode. Sadly after Battlefield 4 the franchise has gone down and down for the most part.. Great experience, an intense game. Noteworthy that its graphics were considered great for the time.. This is the last Battlefield game I had fun with. Newer titles aren't necessarily bad but I feel like this was the peak of the franchise.. Best battlefield game in the series ! This game was ahead of its time . Graphics look amazing . Singleplayer story is awesome . Amazing background music ! Best REAL war experience in best multiplayer maps in all battlefield games. Just buy it ! you'll enjoy sp & mp both a lot !!!. It was a cool almost beginning of modern BATTLEFIELDS ... like CoD, I remember and cry !!!. The last Playable and decent Battlefield game of the series. Everything afterwards is a dumpster Fire!. Absolutely amazing game. Best of the series by far. Shows its age bow or id play this over any of the modern games in am instant. Best battlefield I've ever played, after BF3 it started to decay, until I got to this 2042 game that can't even be called a battlefield.. This game had some minor issues early on, and I know it's an older game, but it is way better than all of the more recent titles. Definitely miss this game.. Amazing game a great modern total battlefield. Tons of details. The actions the audio the vehicles. The only down side is no navy like bf1942. I love this game. I enjoyed BF2, and BC series. I also played BF1943. I am torn between me giving this game a 5, and 9. I decided a 9 would be deserving because I had no issues with the game WHEN it worked. And I have a blast playing it. I am not going down the list of issues becau. A very good game but bc2 that came before it did things a bit better that makes bf3 just missing a 10 for me.. Buggy launch but it still is one of the best modern shooters out there. The maps are good, the destruction is next level and it is still populated on PC servers.. Fast paced action sequences make it a great game with interesting storyline , one can understand the story as the game goes .... Nice destruction physics and big open areas. There is also blue filter which somehow fits the game. But other than those it is meh.. A very good game, with live online. Good graphichs. And the gameplay is 10/10. Amazing rollercoaster. It's not that complicated and truthful story but cool graphics and action.. 10 years later, Battlefield 3 still holds up tremendously well. There aren't as many active servers, but there's still just enough to enjoy the core game modes and maps. It's still a pretty impressive game graphically and in its scale. The only downsides now are that the servers aren't quite as active as they used to be, and game progression takes a lot of grinding.. Of all the BF games, there are only three (BF2, BF3, BFBC2) that have a good case for being the best in the franchise, with BF3 having the most convincing case. In hindsight, this game has aged amazingly and the ""controversy"" during the game's lifespan was a nothing compared to how low the franchise, and the industry in general, has sunk. Amazing how I'm able to play this game as recently as today and enjoy it as much as I did back in 2012. Among FPS titles, Battlefield 3 still stands as one of the greatest multiplayer experiences ever by having no competitor titles being willing or able to deliver on the same scale. Realistically, I would give this game a 92/100 due to the mediocre singleplayer and co-op but the multiplayer is 95% of the reason why people play it. In conclusion: BF3 was the 2011 shooter of the year and 2nd best shooter of the 2010s after Bioshock Infinite.. Second best installment in my opinion, just after BC2. I have spent a lot of hours, especially playing TDM on Canals :P. (Disclaimer: This review is Singleplayer only) While Battlefield 3 may be to this day a fun shooter with a somewhat aged but still responsive and intriguing gun play, It is in my opinion overall not the best choice anymore, when it comes to Singleplayer shooters. The story, while not super important, is somewhat simple and nothing to set focus on, but considering that most games like Battlefield and Call of duty have a higher focus on gameplay, rather than story telling, it is admittedly nothing I would judge the game on too harshly. I just wish to mention that point, since there will be lots of people who seek to play a fun shooter, with a focus grabing story. Beyond that as already mentioned the gun play is solid and works well enough despite feeling somewhat aged, but the overall game feels too easy, making you focus less on actually utilizing the gun play or to try to play as tactical as possible, but rather makes you want to just run through the game, while spraying aimlessly towards the enemy, because you can. This may sound as a weird critique at first, but having played this game on hard difficulty and still having no problem whatsoever, makes this game not feel like you are in constant danger, having to play as tactical as possible, or else you will be in trouble, but rather it makes you feel like you are in a nerf battle. Also worth mentioning are the bugs. While there may not be any game breaking bugs in there, they are certainly still noticeable and in some cases even quite annoying. Less noticeable bugs would be your allies standing inside objects or even straight up running in and out of walls, but those that are more annoying are when you get stuck inside an ally, or try to run down the stairs, but get stuck on nothing, or you have to interact with a character, but he won't respond, so you have to die in order to go back to last checkpoint in order to finally progress. Worst bug of them all though was one, where my whole game at one point randomly set it's difficulty to normal, which may not be a problem, if it weren't for the fact that in order to change difficulty back you have to replay a mission or rather in my case, replay the whole game. I looked up the bug btw and I found out, that I am indeed not the only one that had to deal with this bug and those that did already had to deal with it back in 2011, when the game came out, making this somewhat inexcusable to be still in the game. When it comes to graphics though, I do have to admit that it does indeed holds up to this day quite well. Yes it does look aged in some parts and you can sometimes see, that this game is almost 10 years old, but overall it certainly does look great and certainly will still look great in the future, though I believe that a game does not need to have the best or rather most realistic looks possible in order to be enjoyable. The sound design though, while the background sound is ok and serves it's purpose, the gun sound definitely does hold up fantastic to this day and makes gun play feel a whole lot more satisfying. Overall conclusion, do I think I would recommend this game? It depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a shooter with really good story telling, play something like half life, Metro, Bioshock or. If you are looking for a shooter that demands you to actually play tactical, then play Metal Gear solid V, Halo or Battlefield bad company 2, or if you want a game with a super satisfying gun play, then play doom or wolfenstein. But if you do seek a fun Battlefield exoerience or just wish to play a laid back shooter, then yes Battlefield 3 would still be a good choice. Despite me speaking mostly negative about this game, beyond that I could recommend this game a lot more based on the mulitplayer, since it does have a very solid and enjoyable multiplayer mode, but since I prefer to just review the game based on singleplayer, because I have not played multiplayer during my session, I will just say that it is definitely still one of the better multiplayer shooters out there. Thus I will conclude my review with a 6/10 for the Singleplayer mode. (Multiplayer mode would be an 8.5 or 9/10).. {GamePlay: World/Level Design, Driving/Combat, Game Theme/Mechanics,} 8/10 - Great. {Narrative: Dialogue, Cutscene, Voice Acting} 8/10 - Great. {Visuals: Graphics, Animations, Motion Capture} 6/10 – Average. {Technical: Bugs, Performance} 4/10 - Bad. {Story: Plot/Ending, Character Development} 8/10 - Great. {Replayability: Replayability (Alternate Endings, Secrets, etc)} 10/10 - Good. ☐ 5/10 - Bad. [The Level Design is great, The Combat is how you would expect from an FPS. The Narratives are good, The Cutscene is well made and the voice acting is fantastic. The Visuals are great for a 2011 game, I would say it's still a decent game to play in 2021. The animations are alright, but motion capture is slightly bad, especially facial capture. Encountered a lot of Bugs during my PlayThrough, from T-bone animations to unclickable NPC when i was supposed to climb over walls. And also had multiple full-on game crashes. The story is still great, it's not like its changes in the past 9 years.] The single-player part of the game isn't that replayable, you will get the same outcome every time. I couldn't find a match in Co-Op, and on Multiplayer everyone is basically in a vehicle all the time. But yes, the replayability is good, you can theoretically spend hours upon hours in this game, but if it will be enjoyable, that i don't know. ""7/10 – Good Playing a Good game is time well spent. Could it be better? Absolutely. Maybe it lacks ambition, or is too repetitive,"" ~DeathKillerNOR~ ️ IN MY OPINION ️. Gameplay: 9, Graphics: 9. Story: 6. This game **** over 100 hours from me. When i've first play it i was so impress by the amazing gun play and jaw dropping graphics. The gun play are so addicting because the the weapon were so fun to play with combine with the graphics and animations that blew me away despite being a 2011 game, but the story is... it just so bad. The best game in the entire Battlefield franchise, a very good campaign, a majestic soundtrack, some impressive graphics with many details, a complete epicity, the only thing was that I found 2 bug, but it does not matter since the campaign and the music is outstanding, etc. So I'm not going to judge that two bugs at all. Very Good Work DICE !!!. The best part of this game is multiplayer, graphics and physics. This game was truly ahead of its time and still not outdated by any measures. Campaign is decent for Battlefield. It was good because it was grounded and realistic, it showed the life of regular marine not some special force badass dudes in steroids trying to save the world. This game is nostalgic memory for BF players, a reminder of simpler good old times. BF3 is truly the best battlefield game. This game still looks good today. BF3 aged like a wine, while MW3 aged like milk.. Destructibility, graphics, optimization, gameplay - everything was amazing.. I Played BADCOMPANY 2 It was awesome but after playing BF3 like I was into battlefield franchise btw best bf game buy it!!!!!!!!!. I love this game. I enjoyed BF2, and BC series. I also played BF1943. I am torn between me giving this game a 5, and 9. I decided a 9 would be deserving because I had no issues with the game WHEN it worked. And I have a blast playing it. I am not going down the list of issues because there are plenty. Origin should be optional, and it shouldn't scan a damn thing on my PC. Thankfully I… Expand its impresv iam this the best game i ever seen. I just finished this today in 2020, and I'm only rating the single-player experience, and it's the essence of ""meh"" mediocrity. The gameplay can be frustratingly clunky sometimes, and the story is by-the-numbers. There's more variety than most FPS games here, as you can play gunner in a plane or tank, but those experiences are actually kind of dull, albeit realistic.. I played the campaign and I really enjoyed it. It had alot more going on than just a standard war type story so it was nice. The multiplayer I remember being fun since it's old battlefield which is good.. Summary: As bullets whiz by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before. In Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will experience heart-pounding single player missions and competitive multiplayer actions ranging across diverse locations from around the globe including Europe, Middle-East and North America. Great game, still playable in 2020 because of the great graphics. Great story.. playing it in 2020 and still worth playing more than many new games......... 95% of these reviews are from CoD fanboys. Anyone on here trying to get an actual unbiased user review is not going to find very many, if any at all. Im a big fan of the CoD single player,but I only rent them because if I want replay value I go to the BF for it's multi-player. The best reviewer is yourself though. So, just go rent the game, play the single player to get a feel for the controls, team up (best experience is with some friends) and head out into the battlefield for some multi-player. The worst that could happen is that you don't like it and you're out a couple bucks, and if you do, you buy it and have a new game to play. If you want single player alone, only rent this game. If you want multiplayer, I would definitely recommend buying this game.. The best Battlefield game in the franchise. With better game mechanics and gun design. It would be unbeatable.. What a game.... This and bad company 2 are my favorite battlefield games. I don't play campaign, only online and battlefield 3 have the best maps, 24 player that are enough for having fun, the weapons feel good and gameplay even more. Please give us good games... Battlefield 3 remains my most played multiplayer game. It wasn't a perfect game by means and too often DICE broke just as much as they fixed with their patches. The game introduced some new maps that went on to be classics and had great gun and vehicle play.. Best game ever made.Best campaign, best multiplayer, best coop ever made (not considering that we're talking about a game that came out in 2011 ). Return to the glorious old days EA please :(. I own and played this on EA Origin, and I play exclusively on the single player campaign. Right of the bat, it is stupid and ridiculous that you have to be online to play the single player campaign, because the launching the game requires you to sign-in to some EA Battlefield's website, and launch the game from there. The game story is very great and enjoyable. Gameplay and graphics are top notch. But I personally hate the quick-time events, spoil the single player experience.. His Story Usually Tells The War Between Iran And America. It has a realistic story. Multiplayer Mode is Perfect!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ENG I very long and stubbornly bypassed a series of games Battlefield, that immediately I'd say for good reason, was able I see only in 2015, when already was twilight of the third and fourth parts of, with whom I and got acquainted. It's a shame to realize that the best days of the game have passed, online has become less, the list of cards is not so extensive, and in General, the passed stage. But I'm still playing ball and I can't get used to four, so far, it's not really coming in, so I probably need a little more time. Summing up, I want to say this part thank you for everything that she taught me and for the experience that brought, I hope that the coming years, there will still play 3-4 thousand people and I will have the opportunity and desire to go and play. RU Я очень долго и упорно обходил стороной серию игр Battlefield, что сразу скажу зря, смог я прозреть только в 2015, когда уже был закат третьей и четвертой части, с которыми я и познакомился. Обидно осознавать, что лучшие дни данной игры прошли, онлайн стал меньше, список карт не такой обширный, да и в целом, пройденный этап. Но я все еще поигрываю в трешку и никак не могу привыкнуть к четверке, пока что не очень заходит, наверное нужно чуть больше времени. Подводя итоги, хочу сказать данной части спасибо за все, то чему она меня научила и за впечатления которые доставила, надеюсь, что ближайшие годы, там все так же будет поигрывать 3-4 тысячи человек и у меня будет возможность и желание зайти и поиграть.. Best Battlefield game to date :) Everything in this game is awesome, especially visuals and mechanics.. a driectx 11 title firt time felt thats it or even refuse to open that time. game remains still best looking modern shooter. guns here so well done. animations 3d visuals some how manage to beat next frostbite titles even like battlefield 4. design of bigger maps like caspian border firestorm to reimagned gulf of oman wake island or biggest bandar desert to closest counter metro to tdm noshal canals one best still. singleplayer felt like so adavence first misson jet mission and night missions effects on lights or reflections everything here look more next gen to today nextgen. 64vs battles with air vehicles to tank qualty enough to be own games even.. Beautiful graphics, interesting game-play, but a faceless plot at the level of a regular American action movie.. Other than it having some hit reg problems(mainly fixed now), this is a great game. I still play it in 2019. One of the best BF games ever. Better than everyone that has come out after.. This game is totally awesome!!!! Graphics, Story, Cut scenes and Game play are great.. Main evaluation criteria: -Story: 8 -Atmosphere: 10 -Characters: 7 -Graphics and design: 10 -Gameplay: 10 -Sound and Music: 10 -Bugs: 8 -Interface: 10 -Balance (Multiplayer): 9 - Donates influence on the game (Pay to win): 10 Аdditional evaluation criteria (Do not really affect the assessment): -Freedom of choice: 0 -Coop in Story mode: 8 -Multiplayer: 10 -Mods and the ability to change the game: 0 Scores from 1 to 10, the higher the better Singleplayer: 7/10 Multiplayer: 10/10. what's there to say after all these years? perfection for its time as an online shooter. Battlefield 3 is one of the last good Battlefield games. I had about 200 hours of gameplay in the multiplayer.. An interesting plot, interesting multiplayer, all this awaits you in BF3. An interesting implementation of the plot. Very cool multiplayer with a large variety of locations, with good destructible and with a large number of weapons. I put 9 because there are minor flaws. I only played the single player campaign but the game was good as far as I recall.. Years after its release, Battlefield 3 is still a very impressive shooter, both visually and gameplay-wise.. Really liked most of the maps, graphics were good for it's time, shooting mechanics are satisfying. Fun game, but grenade spam can be really annoying, suffers from infamous lens flares and blue color grade, and suppression is extremely annoying.. Wow this game looks **** awesome. Even in 2018. I still can't handle it. Story was cool but the Multiplayer is the core of this game, which is cool as well but there should be more Infantry-Maps like Operation Metro.. Been playing since launch, absolutely love it. Even reformated my hard drive so my outdated laptop could run it & it still looks amazing. & yep im a BF3 all the way, i used to be all about Modern Warfare, but once MW2 turned out to be less entertaining than minesweeper, tried Bad Company. & i was completely mind boggled with the fact why ive been playing MW at all.. I consider this part of the best in the series (at the time of writing the review). The guys from DICE showed us the destructibility of objects, cool moments, excellent and dynamic game. Each weapon had its pluses and minuses. I cried like a little girl when I first saw a knife-kick animation. The funniest thing is that the game has already been playing for more than 7 years and continues to play in it)))). - No bots - No mods - No commander - No VOIP - No artillery - No bots - No level editor - Annoying blue tint - Horrible lens flares - Terrible netcode - Terrible balance issues - Gadgets need to be unlocked - Weapons for vehicles need to be unlocked - Servers full of hackers - Horrible DLC policy - Boring campaign - Co-op is a ghost town - ""Battlelog"" service requring Internet for multiplayer This game ****.. Buy this for the multiplayer - it is, by far, the best multiplayer experience out there. BF3 improves a lot on BF2, but you will have to learn your skills again as the game is quite different. Netcode and hit detection is excellent (at least for me) just be sure to play on low ping servers. Battlefield 3 delivers an intense, dynamic and immersive multiplayer with gorgeous graphics and masterfully crafted sound design, despite an underwhelming campaign that is just there for the sake of it.. Battlefield 3 is a fantastic game. Featuring spectacular graphics and physics with the incredible new Frostbite 2 Engine, satisfying and responsive gun-play, and amazing multiplayer, especially on the PC. The sound design was done by the same sound designer behind Limbo, and it shows, because it is very well done. The crack of a sniper rifle, the rattle of machine gun fire across the map, and the distinctive sound of a helicopter flying overhead, all of it is just great and immerses you in this war experience that Battlefield is trying to deliver. And while the multiplayer is pretty much perfect, the campaign is very bland. Dice really, sorely needs to get their act together in developing single player experiences, because they've always misfired when they attempt one. Aside from that, Battlefield 3 is an excellent game that anyone who enjoys multiplayer should play.. The best FPS of my life. Wonderful maps, realistic guns and sound effects, infinite fun and last but not least the GRAPHICS Omg Battlefield 3 graphic is amazing for a 2011 game! Buy it and you won't regret it.... NEVER! and **** you battlefield 1, **** game where everyone can make a good k/d ratio and the maps are awful.. Rushed, plagued with glitches, bad hit detection and balance issues, never meant to be fixed, just another disposable title that died after one year so that stupid people could purchase their next low-quality overrated game.. Graphics, gameplay, sounds and weapons places this one as the best FPS MMO of the century. Blasting buildings, sky and ground battles, the detail and animation implemented into this game is unbelievable. Once you experience the many maps and vehicles/weapons/radar sensation it becomes a natural source of enjoyment and winning tactical strategies against veterans and badly COD players who think they can bring COD factors to the battlefield. However if you are deemed too good in custom servers, admins will start kicking/banning you and hate messages will come.... Battlefield 3 campaign doesn't compare to battlefield 4 campaign, The multiplayer may be good but.... I found the campaign just plain boring, the story was poor and the weapons are no way near as good as battlefield 4. The optimization is fantastic and graphics are supreme for its days! I only recommend this for the pvp not campaign. Really fun game with lots of variants. Although the rush mode isn't a","the story, multiplayer, gameplay, everything is F***ing good . if in 2024 i enjoyed it and literally opened my mouth in surprise at the mechanics and graphics of the game, then i can't imagine what happened in 2011 . as for the plot, it's not bad, but it's not particularly memorable ."
469.Synth Riders,"I had some fun with it, and I honestly enjoyed it slightly more than Beat Saber. I'm not great at it or anything, and VR still makes me a bit woozy, but this game was really cool, and it got me moving for sure! Unfortunately, I don't own the system I played it on, so I couldn't upload music, but this was pretty fun, albeit not for extended periods of time.. Great workout. Great graphics. Great music. A lot of free songs. Absolutely love it.. Pretty good PSVR rhythm game but it's Definitely not as good as Beat Saber as some reviews said.. One of my all time favorite music games with Beat Saber and Pistol Whip. The song selection is great and there’s something for everybody.. This game gives a great feeling of movement. It also has frequent updates. Highly recommended as an alternative to you-know-which game!","this is my all time favorite music game with Beat Saber and Pistol Whip . the song selection is great and there's something for everybody . unfortunately, I didn't own the system I played it on ."
47.Persona 5 Royal,"Persona 5 royal is an exceptional game that takes the already amazingly popular persona 5 that attracted many new followers into the persona series, and just make it better in almost every way possible. Persona 5 royal also adds new content to the already existing persona 5 and it's not describable in anyway other than exceptional. Every role-playing-gamer out there should 100% give this game a try.. The best game of all ****'s the peak of the saga and my favourite game :). Good game but not perfect imo. Pros: > Combat is amazing, one of my fav turned based combats ever. Quite deep and satisfying. Good enemy variety. > Cosy game, the UI and moving around the world is very nice and kinda simple. There is basically just one interaction button with everything but it works. > Characters are pretty good and likeable Cons: > Kinda long especially the tutorial. Takes a while to settle into the game. Lots of padding too such as repeated dialogue. Not all dialogue is voice acted. > Story is full of melodrama and at times can feel unauthentic to me. Some parts work but others I was skipping through to get to more combat.. It's perfect, the grafic is super good 10/10, the story is good 10/10, i kinda like the persona too, the dlc look soo cool to. Might be the best game i’ve ever played. It literally changed my life for the better.. Pretty much a near perfect game. Top 5 for me out of the thousands of games I played. Every character is loveable in their own way, you enjoy all of their stories & friendships, the combat is turn based with little twists in between like ultimate moves, combo attacks, can just pull out a gun & unload on enemies, you unlock more perks & enhancements through building your friendship level with your companions, basically everything you do in this game advances you in some way, shape or form. Leveling up & unlocking things becomes addicting & you see the effects & buffs it has makes everything so much more enjoyable. This is a big game & a long one, you will need to invest some time & every second of it is enjoyable. ""Royal"" version adds new story mission & characters, some of the best I might add, amazing ""DLC"" If you like turn based games or story games, you'll love this but honestly I feel like this is one of those types of games that has something for everyone, there's even some farming sim type stuff amongst the social sim stuff.. A phenomenal game despite its glaring flaws. Vivid and voguish art, one of the best JRPG soundtracks, smart gameplay designs, interesting themes, and most importantly unparalleled immersion. While the combat and story leave much room of improvement, P5R capitalizes its strength to the utmost, delivering one of the most memorable JRPGs of all-time.. My first Persona game and really enjoyed the change of pace. Interesting and fun way to develop characters in your party.. I finished my first playthrough after 153 hours, one of the best JRPG's I've played, truly peak and will play again in the future.. It is a masterpiece that succeeded in finding both memories and fame of JRPG. Looking forward to a follow-up. If you haven't played it yet, you must try it.. A near-perfect turn-based RPG and school sim that only falls short due to some questionable execution of its themes. The gameplay is sublime. The race against time aspect of the school calendar puts pressure on the player to figure out how to juggle the many responsibilities of the main character - raiding dungeons, proceeding with the main story, studying for school, building relationships, etc. The game's many systems are all balanced intricately. The turn-based combat is riveting, full of strategy and plenty of personas to collect. A massive experience that satisfies and thrills in equal measure.. At first, I thought the ""Royal"" in the end was just a detail. A complete mistake. This game not only adds new charming characters, but also brings a way more hours of gameplay and a new canon ending, as long as you follow the right steps to it. Not only that, but it also fixes some issues for some characters, like Akechi, who gains a brand new arc for his character development. This new ending, even though the original is very good, they made a better one, adding the best antagonist to this game. I highly recommend that if you're playing the game, search for a guide of how to get the true ending. And, of course, this game music and IU is insane.. I cried like a female dog at the end, I've never been so moved by a games story. This game has very good progression in its gameplay, its story, the way you develop relationships with the game's characters. I LOVE the music, absolute bangers. This game is funny, it's sad, its joyful, its degrading, its hopeful, its art. Not everyone will enjoy it's a 100+ hour game, but I sure did, I wanted more!. Persona 5 Royal is a flawless gaming experience, a perfect blend of narrative, gameplay, and art that earns its 10/10 rating. At its heart, it’s a story about rebellion. You play as a high school student, falsely accused of a crime, who joins the Phantom Thieves—teens fighting corrupt adults by stealing their distorted desires in the Metaverse, a parallel world where these desires manifest as **** story delves into themes of freedom, justice, and personal growth.

Both the English and Japanese casts deliver strong performances that breathe life into the characters, making their struggles and triumphs feel **** terms of content, Persona 5 Royal offers a wealth of things to do.

Every detail is crafted with care, resulting in a game that will be remembered for years. Persona 5 Royal is, without a doubt, a peak video game experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really hits everyone you expect And gives you more. Aesthetics, music, design, creativity, story, art, combat for turn based. Atlus really hit it out of the park with this must play game.. Looks normal, but this is a game that you would spend full days into it and enjoy playing as a well-surrounded high school student in Tokyo. Visual design upgraded the level of this game to masterpiece.. Great characters and storytelling, the turn based battle system is fast paced and fun.. This game has to be one of the more contradictory and hypocritical in its messages and themes. The first palace we conquer is of a man who preys upon and sexually and physically abuses teenage girls and boys, and one of the main leads, Ann, is a victim of his abuse. And yet this game allows the protagonist, a 16 year old boy, the option to fate women over 10 years older than him, constantly sexualizes Ann and makes her the butt of many jokes that border sexual harassment, and constantly market their teenage female heroines in sexually revealing merchandise and promote them in such manner to the very same people that the game criticizes. Its attempt to address contemporary societal issues in Japan is about as deep as an Instagram post from wannabe online activists whose observations and attempts at social commentary amount to saying obvious bad things are bad, in which they themselves continue to uphold and practice the bad things they critique. Other than that, this game has a cast of loveable characters and the character writing largely carries the game. It is still a game that I hold dear, and I will still enjoy playing it whenever the urge hits me to revisit this amazing cast of memorable people.. At first glance, this seems to be a 10/10 game no doubt. The first half of this game was near perfect. From a story and character perspective, they really nailed it. However, it becomes bloated about halfway through the game and the story therefore takes a sideline to characters which to me hurts the experience. This game is simply too long and bloated. The ending in this is worse than the original which hurts the overall score. Still, there's no doubt this is a great game with great characters that'll leave an impact on you even if the game itself is bloated.. I love this game . I've completed it in 77h. And i enjoy every detail about it. And i love how it actually has a connection to the real life problem's. Persona 5 royal is an incredible game that offers the best bits of the series, it's fun to casually play through and the style is like no other, the music is gorgeously composed and is able to be listened to without ever getting bored of it, each character does their job very well and not to mention having is what I believe to be the best villain in fiction period, the only downsides towards this nigh 10/10 game is the fact it is 'too' easy, alongside this the characters may feel a bit dull in the overworld or during some confidant rank ups.. This game is insane,they have a fresh concept and best gameplay,in my opinion p5r is the best game of all time. Very polished game in its mechanics and presentation. Loved the gameplay loop that alternates a life sim and traditional dungeon crawling. The story is full of plot twists and has kept me engaged for many hours. It has a lot of anime tropes and redundant dialogues that may put some people off but they didn't bother me too much. Persona 5 is a must play for JRPG fans!. Amazing Story, Characters, Soundtrack and UI Design. Good Gameplay as well. One of the best JRPGs of all time.. In comparison to other JRPGs, it is a great game which excels in thrilling turn-based battles, visuals and music. The story is, admittedly, a bit underwhelming for a game in the Persona franchise but is nonetheless good for a JRPG.. Truthfully, there's not much I can say about this game that hasn't been said thousands of times before me. Yes, the world is dense and full of unforgettable side activities. Yes, the soundtrack is my favorite in a video game. Yes, the characters are so well-written to the point that you feel you know them. All these things are true and then some. A jaw-dropping experience from start to finish, and one that everyone should experience at least once in their lives. Hands-down my favorite game, and my choice for the greatest game ever made.. No need to say. The greatest JRPG I have ever played, offering a authentic life and a unrealistic fantasy. The greatest game of all time. this game will change your life. Live Love TAKEMI!!. GUYS I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THE LYN ALBUM PERSONA 5 AND PERSONA 5 ROYAL SOUNDTRACK COMES WITH AN ENTIRE GAME!!! I'm not much of a fan of modern RPGs, I don't enjoy turn-based combat, and I don't watch anime. With that being said this Anime, turn-based, RPG may be one of the greatest experiences I've ever had while playing a video game. Story / Characters This game is a social-sim, dungeon crawler, RPG. Somehow this game is 3 things in one and is somehow a 10/10 in all of them. This game has many elements to it, but the one that's most fleshed out is the social sim/story This game's characters are all fleshed out and all worth experiencing. Say what you will about a few of them, but if you will I'll point out the fact that 90% of video game stories **** and so do the characters. Octopath Traveler, Xenoblade 1, 2, or 3, Starfield, or Hogwarts Legacy just to name a few are all trailer trash by comparison to even the worst characters in Persona 5 Royal. Additionally, these are not watered-down shallow characters, by the end you legitimately care about them, and get the chance to experience and care about their problems, goals, aspirations, etc. The story is a fantastic experience of social commentary about issues in this world. Not all of the areas pan out, but a majority of them do. Without spoilers, this game has themes of drug abuse, suicide, child molestation, government corruption, corporate greed, and much more. There are some cringe parts, like the fact that a focal reason why the characters are doing what they're doing is because of ""rotten adults"", but again for the most part is great. Additionally, the late game gets very deep. These themes and elements get as fleshed out and profound as you could want. Gameplay A majority of the game revolves around the social sim. This means that you have a social life to keep up and in order to keep it up and talk to certain people you need to raise your social stats. That may not sound fun, but it 100% is. You do this by balancing the elements of a high schooler's life. You yourself get to choose if you want to benefit your social stats by seeing a movie, benefit your social link by hanging out with a friend, or doing hero work in the 'metaverse' Dungeon Crawler / Combat That's the second majority of the game. The dungeon crawler. The Dungeons are fun and unique not only in visual style, but music, enemies, bosses, puzzles, and storylines. The puzzles are all fun, not incredibly difficult, but not all that easy. The combat is what shines most in these areas. P5R somehow made turn-based combat fun by taking concepts from most rpg's and actually trying to flesh it out. You find weaknesses like in Pokemon, but when you do you can knock the enemy and do an ""All Out Attack"" which is a cool cinematic that drops the enemy's health by a considerable amount or kills it outright. There are all sorts of attacks such as a gun or sword for physical and an element like fire, or wind for a magic attack. And then even small things like getting a victory screen at the end of battles after doing an AOA, having randomly generated dangerous enemies you kill and have exploded to knock an enemy's health, or knocking an enemy and having to negotiate with it to get money, item, or its power. Additionally, the bosses are all unique and expand on this considerably. Other - This game is the most stylish game I've ever played. The opening, loading screens, pause menus, animations, level-ups, and music are all so fancy and stylish. Again a big part of the game is balancing time, so for instance when a day goes by it doesn't just flash up a screen that says the date, instead it goes to a specific screen of the city with dates on it and throws a dagger at the date. Additionally, if it's raining or snowing in the game, it switches music tracks completely to a rain version of the track. On loading screens, there's an emblem in the bottom right that says take your time. This is so unbelievably ironically intentional because P5R is a game all about balancing every day because you only have so much time before the game is over. FInal Thoughts - This is a review with no real spoilers. Everything I mentioned you could find through a trailer of the game. That's the point tho. I want everyone to give this game a shot. It's easy to knock down quickly but trust me when I say this is one of the greatest experiences I have ever had playing a videogame. Modern RPGs are put to shame every day by the fact that this game even exists. So trust me, its 100% worth your time. Persona 5 Royal offers a huge variety and content and a long game duration, but it is not boring like the rest of the open world games and the long duration they offer, but in Persona every second is a masterpiece | Pros- A huge world full of interactive content - Great environment design that adds atmosphere to the game - Multiple characters and excellent writing - Strategic and fun gameplay - | There is no negative worth mentioning. 10/10. This game saved me from suicide, it's a love letter to JRPG and it is a gem of the persona saga. im a big fan of turnbased combat, this has became my favourite game, romanced ann. must play.. When I think of perfection I think of this. Art style is amazing. OST is not only the best one in videogames in my opinion but also has some of my favourite songs in general. But the story is something ingenious with both the general story and each of the characters own stories. Only problem is I wasted 122 hours of my life playing this game.. Added a huge amount of new things and freedom, however, the story of the game is rushed after the second/third palace. The first palace really hook me up on the game, the second one was a huge what the f*ck ? The ending was very boring and lackluster, clearly not in the level of Persona 3R.. This was my first ever persona game. And to say I loved it is an understatement. The games story and narrative are amazing making it feel impossible to let down the controller. As this is my first persona game the calendar and social link system amazed ne. This game is so different from any ither game yet imo stands as one of the greats.. A very (too) long game (100 hours). Our choices are very limited, the flights are easy when you have farme. The story is ok, but 100 hours it's too much. Masterpiece from Start to finish, polished to a tee no performance issues on base PS4, with fast load times. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. literally the best game i have ever played the story the characters the sound track everything is just peak asf!. this is my goty for 2024 so far. it has a higher metascore than final fantasy xvi and final fantasy rebirth (some people know it better as reddit fantasy). persona 4 is also a higher metascore. 10/10. Best jrpg since 25 years, the animations are very cool, the story is very well written and deep. The art style is one of the greatest i've ever seen. I very suggest you to play it!. This game is a masterpiece. The start of the game is like a 8 out of 10 but the plot twist made The game Persona 5. I would probably forget the feeling i got after i finished the game. I will never get as much as joy i got from playing Persona 5 from any other game. This is my favourite game of all time.. This is one of the best Games I've ever played, story, gameplay and fighting system, plot twists, charachters and their own story, its just full of joy. Persona 5 royal, the game that have the best dungeons in all series, the Palace system is absolutely amazing, good characters overall and amazing villains, the game also have a good amount of things to do everyday, very good story, not my favourite persona but it is a awesome game. Its a pretty good JRPG but I would rather play Persona 4 Golden. This game definitely drags in the middle.. Once again, Atlus releases a definitive edition **** that they released not too long ago. This feels like the norm now and it is hard to justify buying this game at full price. They add new characters and convenience features (most important is speed reading). There's a lot more information that is provided to the player in the form of tutorials and map icons as well. If you don't already own Persona 5, then Royal is a fine place to start. Otherwise, wait for a steep discount because this is content that could've been patched in.. One of the best games i have ever played in my life Well done atlas I hope perosna 6 will be good. P5R is a magnificent experience, with deep characters and story, fantastic music and amazing level design, from the halls of Kamoshida's palace to the intentionally unfair challenges of Sae's casino, there is something great in every dungeon, whether that'd be fun character interactions or fun gameplay... except for Okumura's palace that is, eitherway, the game is fantastic and considering how long it's been since it release I definitely recommend it, since the price has dropped considerably, and Royal's additions are well worth the price over P5 original. Persona 5 Royal is one of those games I always heard great things about, but never got around to. I had never played a Persona game, but having heard so many great things, I figured it was all just overhyped. There have been plenty of times I hear great things about something, go in with sky high expectations, and while I end up enjoying it, I don't quite reach those expectations. Persona 5 Royal is not one of those instances. Not only did it reach the sky high expectations laid out before it, but it honestly EXCEEDED them. I had SO much fun playing P5R. From the artistic style, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the characters, the story... all of it was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, it never felt like a 120+ hour experience. I just wanted more. So, eventually I branched out to other Persona games since then, but overall, I have only good things to say about this game.. The style is amazing,as well as the music. The level design is terrible, as well as the pacing. The combat is alright, but overstays its welcome, because the game is so long. The life sim aspect was fun as well, but similarly overstays its welcome. The story seems fine, but definitely don't think about some of the rules too much. Because the game is so long it's just paced bad as well. The start of it is pretty cool, but by the halfway point (50 hours in) I got very tired of it. Basically things only really happen at the start and end of a mission with long periods of downtime where there's a lot of dialogue reiterating the same things over an over. It would have been an 7/10 if they trimmed the fat to make the game 40 to 50 hours long instead. The way it is I eventually learned what scenes to fast-forward,in accordance with the very obvious pattern of the story-telling. Other thanthe option to fast-forward and skip, the game just doesn't respect your time and is severely overrated.. Persona 5 Royal elevates an already exceptional RPG experience with meaningful additions and refinements. The game's stylish presentation, captivating story, and memorable characters remain its strongest assets, drawing players into the vibrant world of Tokyo's underground. The introduction of new Confidants, activities, and an expanded Palace provide fresh content for returning fans to enjoy. However, pacing issues still linger, especially in the latter half of the game, where the story can feel drawn out. Combat remains engaging thanks to the strategic depth of Persona fusion and negotiation mechanics, but some may find the difficulty spikes frustrating. Despite its flaws, Persona 5 Royal stands as a definitive version of an RPG masterpiece, offering countless hours of immersive gameplay and unrivaled style.. I think that both the original and Royal are both amazing games but Royal adds so many new things that completely surpass anything that the original did, Royal fleshes out the story and makes it more understandable and enjoyable. They added and tweaked many mechanics and introduced a new character which is honestly like 7/10 in terms of how much I liked them but Kasumi is still a cool addition. Amazing game! Must play for jrpg fans. I can't wait until another persona game comes out!. People who actually played the entire game: “Masterpiece” “The best JRPG ever” “Never felt bored thanks to the story” “Best game ever!” People who barely played the game or haven’t at all: “Too Long” “Too Difficult” “Why do I have to pay full price for an expansion?” “Insert random poop joke*” Basically if you weren’t a fan of this Masterpiece, then it was either an overlying fixation on your skill issue or impatience rather than the perfectly told story (or even involving yourself with the characters (such as confidants)) or you hated how much it initially cost (which has nothing to do with the quality of the game at all.) I genuinely don’t see how it’s anything lower than 10/10, it’s such overwhelming fun and addictive, that my eyes became red and strained for playing this game for hours upon hours. Every character has key development, personality or plays a role within the other characters of the story. I will say that most of the negative reviews go hand in hand with other games. It’s probably the biggest reason to stay away from user ratings on this site because there’s no proper balance or reasoning. I always trust the critics more with video games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best JRPG of all time, no question. It will always be a favorite of mine.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably the best game I've got to play in my whole life! It stands out through incredible gameplay, great graphics, a genius plot and storytelling and especially loads of fun. It took me about 120 hours to beat this game and it was definitely worth every single second I invested. I would definitely recommend this unbelievable journey to anyone searching for a game to play!!. This waste of money is nothing more than a 60 dollar DLC. Atlus should be ashamed of themselves for making cost the exact price as the original version.. A simulator of Japanese high school life with of course super nature power involved. Perfect in every aspect except that the combat and dungeon gameplay is a little boring.. The best JRPG I ever played. I don't know how Atlus can even surpass this, but still hyped for P6.. One of the finest RPGs in the market to experience,the story, characters as well as the setting are sure to leave a **** every single game out there can manage to do so,even though it is not a AAA game title it still managed to surpass them with ease because of it charming and quintessential environment. There's not alot to say in words but to experience it for yourself as Atlus managed to exceed the expectations of consumers by dropping this this game into the market. To be saying the least this is the one of the best in franchise and this is coming from a person who enjoyed and played each and every one of it from shin megami tensei to persona and soul hackers.. It is very much a style over substance type of game. The story drags on for way too long at times, and the stakes never really feel high despite it being a ''world will end'' scenario in the final parts of the game.. One of the best jrpgs you can play - the addition of Royal only makes it better and longer.. One of the best games i’ve ever played! Story, progression, art direction, soundtrack, chatacters… all 10/10. Great Improvement on Persona 5. Nevertheless, the extra story was not as good as it could have been. Charging for the full game price is ridiculous, if you owned the original base game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game and RPG ever. The combination of Dating Sim and dungeon crawler works very well.. Amazing game. Music is fantastic and often i just let it play while i did other stuff around. Gameplay is interesting even though i'm not into turn based games. Minigames/friendship mechanics and secondary missions were always a suprise. I would say this game is the apex of JRPGS. Great optics, great soundtrack, intriguing battle mechanics. But an overall awkwardly sexist cast, thin story and very repetitive social interactions and skill system gets stale soon. What crossed the line for me was the fifth palace with unfair puzzles and a boss battle with a completely ridiculous jump in difficulty.. Masterpiece Best soundtrack ever made! Awesome history Definitely one of the greatest games of all time. This was my first time playing a game in the persona series and it really had me hooked all the way through. Exploring the cities and building relationships with the characters was really fun. The story was very interesting and the characters meshed nicely into it with strong personalities. Great mix of story and fighting gameplay.. A lovely and enjoyable upgrade to the already magnificent Persona 5. Makoto is best Girl!. Best game I've ever played, the story is just catered perfectly to each player, whatever you want there is, just perfect. The themes The graphics The characters Absolutely amazing Recommended for all audiences. Incredible game I’m 50 hours in and I’m loving it, it’s captivating and has an interesting story and amazing and funny character. A game that reinvigorated my love for video games, in a time where everything felt stale and games were nothing but time killers for me, this game stood high above the rest. It was the first true JRPG experience I had, and the best one since. You could make a case it is the most complete JRPG in the world. As someone who loves turn-based combat, and found it a dying breed, this game was breath of fresh air. A soundtrack for the ages, style dripping out of every pixel, a satisfying and fun gameplay loop, and so much more. I couldn't recommend a game more, especially if you even vaguely like anime or Japanese culture.. Truly Truly Trulya masterpiece. The third trimester is an invaluable addition to the canon (or not) and the changes in gameplay are sublime. Persona 5 Royal manage to succeed and add another layer, to the previous edition of the franchise. I am so glad everyone gets to discover and play a persona game, and this one has truly being a master in story telling, character development, and universe building. Now, please tease us P6 !. I play video game since I was 7 years old. I'm more than 30 now and Persona 5 Royal is actually my favorite video ga",persona 5 royal is an exceptional game that takes the already amazingly popular persona 5 and just makes it better in almost every way possible . it also adds new content to the already existing persona 5 and it's not describable in anyway other than exceptional .
470.Battlefield 1942,"The best game at the time it was released. The soundtrack remained the best for many years. Even with the release of Battlefield 3, we still remember this game!. A decent FPS shooter. Quite revolutionary for its time considering there wasn't really any games that supported 64-player big team battles with the ability to fight the enemy on the ground as an infantryman, in a tank or from a mounted machine gun on a half-track, the ability to fight and pilot planes and even fight other ships in a submarine or provide shoreline bombardments against the enemy on maps like Iwo Jima or Omaha Beach. The map selection is decent, the ability to fight on the Western Front, Eastern Front and the Pacific Theatre provides the player with unique atmospheres as well as different countries to play as: British, Soviet, American, German and Japanese. As of 2023 however, multiplayer support is still somewhat alive being ran by the community, gameplay can be quite stale but it's nice to see where Battlefield has come from. Mod support is quite nice as well, expanding upon the game base massively with mods such as BattleGroup42 or the notorious Desert Combat mod, giving Battlefield 1942 a more modern spin to it.. At first I thought it was a good old game, but in the process of passing the game I was disappointed, very stupid ai, these bots just stand still, they don’t respond to commands, while you captured one point, the enemy is already at another and my bots just often stood still, now this part is not playable.. The first Battlefield I played. The game is set in World War II and one of the first games in this style. I was reminded of historical settings when I played this edition.. One of the best Games of the Series and a true cornerstone to the Battlefield Franchise! Buy!. I mean it's better than the latest Battlefield games for sure, at least it's finished.. One of the most iconic online FPSes of all time. Like most of the Refractor engine BF games, the single player doesn't have a campaign and is basically the online player maps but with bots. Set in WW2, it offers a great selection of weapons, vehicles, maps, and factions to play as. Onto the modding side of the game, Desert Combat is the greatest mod for any of the BF games and had a significant influence on future titles post BF Vietnam. The game has aged significantly and important mechanics in core gameplay are absent (eg sprinting, reviving, etc) but the fun factor is still there. The BF series have come a long way but 1942 is still one of the top 5 BF titles.. This game was my childhood! I'll always remember it because of the good and funny moments this game gives. Also it's a very realistic battle experience of WWII, except the graphics, everything is great. I liked it very much, hope some day will be remastered, because i would buy it without doubt! Great game 10/10!. First Battlefield game in franchise, which bring us colossal maps for its times. Fun to play especially with pack of friend :) Playable only on MP :). A great game THE game that start a great saga of fps that marks a generation. This one was right up my alley back in the day. Played countless hours and have very fond memories of it. This was a big thing for my generation, everyone (who was a gamer) played this.. Amazing!!! Battlefield 1942 was Really a first of its kind. Mixing FPS and Full on battlefield scaled warfare. I mean anything from medic sniper assault etc to jeeps, tanks, artillery, to airplanes, helicopters, bomber, to aircraft carrier, submarines, battleships and the list goes on and on. It was epic battlefield experience and stupid battlefield games today are SO LIMITED. This was one of the best games of 2002, and did a pretty fine job of expanding on the innovative mechanics first introduced in Codename Eagle 3 years beforehand. I'm not even sure if people still play this game, but I am sure that the multiplayer here was great. Allowing players to take control of tanks, jeeps, and combat planes. Allowing players to snipe across huge maps, or lay down fire with a plane down on a sniper nest. All of it really tied together to bring a realistic war experience that encouraged cooperation between players to win the day. Battlefield 1942 is overall a great multiplayer experience.. Enjoy a game which is fun, but it lacks on hitboxes or whatever is f*cked up here because the game is like this: Take a sniper rifle and shoot your enemy 5 times in a face with no damage done, then take a pistol and shoot him 3 times to body to kill him from the same distance.What? Are you serious? Ok, f*ck it, let's say I'm just bad at sniping. Let's try anti-tank unit. So take a bazooka and shoot a tank 5 times to blow it up, then find out, that 2 or 3 grenades do the same. Ok, f*ck ****'s just play medic or assault only with pistol and grenades, because those are the most powerful weapons in this game. And you others enjoy Battlefield 1942 b.c.. Amazing Battlefield Game, still in Top 3 of the best Battlefields of all time with Battlefield 2142; Battlefield bad company 2 and Battlefield 1942. Was a good time. Best game ever. Used to play it 6 hours a day. I didn't even study to play this game. My grades dropped and I lost weight because I kept forgetting to eat. I reached a point where I weighted 65kg (my height was 1.83m at the time). 10/10 PS: I am doing well now. I have a degree in IT and I weight about 75kg (my height is 1.87m). Battlefield 1942 is one of the best games of WWII. The game even emrita played even if old. I recommend it for that year because the game is very well done.. NOTE: As of July 2014 the Gamespy servers were shut down forever. Use GameRanger to play online. I don't know what actually is, probably it's just nostalgia, but I can't think of any bad thing about this game. I enjoyed every single second I've spent on it and I'd recommend everyone to play it. It isn't the most perfect game out there but the whole package is just so excellent that I enjoy it a lot. The one thing it does best it's the overall balance, especially between all the different types of gameplay, which is something that has been missing in the other Battlefield titles for a long time now.. I played this for countless hundreds of hours for 6 years before the servers got too empty. It was one of the most fun games I ever played (bar Quake). It was more action orientated, unlike it's successors, which are more hide and seek orientated.. So this is where Battlefield all started. It's really great. Now I want DICE to make Battlefield 1944 with the Frostbite engine! We really need WWII shooters back.. This game is the greatest first person shooter and the first game I truly played constantly as a kid. The game gives me nostalgia feels all over. Better than Battlefield 2 or 3 OR 4. this is the best game of the battlefield series for me. this is the best game of the battlefield series for me. this is the best game of the battlefield series for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Battlefield 1942 is one of the best 1st person shooter games I have ever **** game play is extremely fun in single player or **** game is great you can go into tanks and aircraft.Going into those tanks feels great,you can kill those enemies by crashing them,shooting them,and even using your cannon against them.Going to the aircraft also feels good,you can fly to the air and you can kill those enemies by dropping you bomb into them.Although the game has a bad story the game play saves the game from getting a low score.This game is great but there are also some negatives in the **** 1st one is that the game doesn't give you some you know what to press button if you are in here.I totally had some problems when I first played this game like getting stuck in where to respawn.I was so confuse and frustrated in that **** there are many more confusing parts in here.2nd one of the most important **** cannot customize your ****!There are only five sets in **** medic,the scout,the anti tank,the assault,and the engineer.I wish I can customize what weapons and gear I will use. While the game has 2 big problems it won't effect the game from getting a low **** game gets a 9/10 for its extremely fun game play experience.That is why I recommend you to play this game **** can download this game for free by having an origin **** once you already have an origin account go to free games and you can see the Battlefield 1942 download for **** try downloading this game now and have fun.. It is hard to say, but this game is disqualification as a game due to many malfunctions. I will explain the reason below. This game has many and many faults. For instance, the error message ""**** was halted"" appears frequently. It has probability of one in about one hour. My environment satisfies to required environment like communication speed and memory capacity. So this problem can concludes as an error of game side. When I am playing online mode, error ""connection failure occurred"" is displayed, and the game is halted forcibly. This malfunction occurs frequently. Some names of troopers are not displayed somehow. This game distinguishes friend or enemy by the color of the name. So player cannot attack the troopers. This fault is too fatal to form as a game against human. The manual of this game does not describe much important information. For example, it does not have instruction how to use parachute, or how to switch sitting positions of big vehicles.. This is game is great, even 11 years later it is still the best WWII game in my option. I remember when I first played this game, allowing me to enter and drive a vehicle unlike most games, allowing me to fly a plane (though a failed at it), letting choose which class I want to play as and what side, the game system is simple, its all about capturing and holding flag points until one of the team's reinforcement's bar gets down to zero. Multiplayer is cool, though most of the servers are abounded because now everybody's playing Black Ops 2 and Battlefield 3 or something else like that, this game is a must buy.. More than ten years ago holding a disc box I remember thinking, that it was the first WWII first person shooter that gave opportunity to drive a car and a vehicle, allowing to enter them at any time. That was more than enough to play the game that I had never heard of. But then another picture took my attention a plane that was controlled by a player. ""Is this a joke?"" I thought, could there be really a game that allowed even flying? Oh, yes! ""Battlefield 1942"" gave multiplayer only experience that left so much unforgettable fun. There is no doubt that EA set such a high level of quality with this game that even now is difficult for many companies to achieve. Huge maps, much tactics, various combat allowed me to enjoy so many situations that rarely appear in singleplayer campaigns. Combat system was very different comparing to ""Medal of Honor"" and ""Counter-Strike"". But it was easy to get used to. There were some class types but somehow I remember that usually everyone played with bazooka, because entering a vehicle was the first thing each of my friends tried to do. Basically ""Battlefield 1942"" game system is all about capturing and holding points. At that time it was not an original regime, but with transport it seemed liked just something completely new and unique. Main theme of the game is still one of the best scores that were written for a game. I also have to say that there were some very successful modes that added not only extra maps but transport and weapons too. Ten out of ten for the game that took us to battles that no other gamer had been before.. This Game is so Funny I never play Battlefield 2 or Battlefield 3 but this Game is so funny and so cool very long playtime. The Multiplayer is good to there are very great player and not so many flamer because this Kiddies are now playing Games like Battlefield 3 or Call of Duty Black Ops 2. This Game is a Have To Buy. You Have to Played before you are playing Battlefield 3.. Addictive, captivating fun. The ability to switch between toolkits (sniper, engineer, medic, etc.) and drive any vehicle found on the battlefield (tanks, airplanes, jeeps, submarines...) leaves me coming back again and again for more! It's even fun to play offline with bots, if that's your cup of tea.. Installed it for free from Origin, and I'm more than happy. Battlefield 1942 is a classic, a masterpiece of shooters. It revolutionize the online gaming. And I found it as the best BF game. It's simple to play and It's fun. So, all you need to do is to have Origin and get it easily with your account for free. If you don't have Origin, download it and get Battlefield 1942. What I'm trying to say, is that no one should not miss this game. (10). This is the first and only Battefield I owned for PC, and while I had it I wasn't disappointed. This game was very refreshing because unlike shooters in the past you could really take advantage of and use vehicles. This is what makes this game, rolling around in a tank to stomp the enemy or get em' from a far in a plane. This was the first successful attempt at an online-mulitplayer FPS war sim and the battles that ensued were epic at times. Battlefield definitely has a learning curve, you will die a lot more than you kill starting off, but once you've trained a bit you'll be ready to go.. BATTLEFIELD 1942: Back in 2002 this is one of the most realistic game I've ever played. Not even Medal of Honor could beat it. I think this is the main inspiration of UT2004's Onslaught mode. I really liked it. So here's BF1942. The gameplay isn't like any of FPS games out there. It's intended to be more realistic with vehicles, wide battlefield, and I think 5 different classes. The single player campaign isn't like the recent BF games. While the recent BF games have linear CoD-like Single Player campaign, this one actually takes inspiration from Counter Strike. I'm too lazy to play multiplayer TBH. Talking about the historical elements, there are very well done. It really feels that you are inside a WWII battlefield. The vehicles, the weapons, the environments, the planes, everything feels just like WWII. There are some things that I don't like on this game. The first is that the flying controls are awful, but you'll get used to with it. The AI is ridiculously stupid. At some moment, I found out one of my team mates prone JUST RIGHT near an enemy. This is just ridiculous! I don't really like some of the level designs. There are places that were a little bit too small for a tank, and some places that you can only reach with a plane or a boat. But otherwise, there are tons of mods that you can use to tweak the game. You can also install 2 of their expansions. I haven't tried all of them but I think they're excellent. OVERALL: BF1942 is an awesome game, worth trying especially when you have a netbook. [8/10] ""Awesome"". Like C&C Renegade this game was mind blowing compared to any other game. It really evolved what we thought of fps games back then. It's a classic in my book.","as of 2023 however, multiplayer support is still somewhat alive being run by the community . mod support is quite nice as well, expanding upon the game base massively with mods such as BattleGroup42 or the notorious desert combat mod ."
471.Dreams,"(This rating is based on the performance on the base PS4 and PS4 Pro) This game is the best way for aspiring game developers to start making games. It can be a bit laggy at times while editing large scenes, especially on the base PS4. If you just want to play dreams, don't buy it for full price. Most good dreams are in development and/or are fangames. Otherwise, it is an incredible game and definitely worth the price tag.. I absolutely LOVE Dreams. It's my favorite Media Molecule game. You can make a game, which will take a while, but is super fun, and may even get you started in a bit of logic for future, non-Dreams games, or play the awesome games made by the community, and put awesome in that. Media Molecule makes some games for Dreams, and they're actually pretty high-effort! I really like Media Molecule actually colaborates with Dreams' community to make games, it's the best example of user-developer interaction one could ever find. I do think the tutorial for Dreams is annoying and not targeted at the main audience, and that Dreams' ""engine"" system thingy is a bit hard to learn, and it should've been ported to PC, but, eh, this is next-gen tech we got here, there will NEVER be a game like Dreams.. Not my cup of tea but you can enjoy it if you are into creating your own games. I tried it for almost an hour.. Just came back to this game after a break and wow, it's still just as good as I remember. I love diving into the minds of others, it just gives such a great chance for those to express their imagination and creativity. I truly hope they release a sequel to this for PS5, as with the way it looks already the potential would be ridiculous!. This game can be many things. Other games, art showcases, lsd trips, and all inbetween. Finding something that you enjoy playing is relatively easy, and there are some surprisingly talented people making these small games. Props to them.. This game is a remarkable learning oppurtunity. It goes through the basics of video game development as well as animation with a user friendly engine. It does not dive into the coding to allow for mechanic customization to a deep level, but all in all a great teaching game.. Game which let's you kinda create your own games and let's your imagination be the line.. It was ok game but i personally didn't like the games mechanic to make games. Yes i know there are people who are very creative with this but i saw it pretty hard to make any games. Playing the others games was pretty fun but it came a little boring after a while.. nothing much to talk aboutbut to say it's a masterpiece in terms of skills and technical development, really liked it. an underrated surprise from sony. Dreams really is as the name describes. a game with endless possibilities and game making mechanics. I enjoyed different fan made experiences that surprised me. There is something here for everyone to enjoy!. How can you not like this game? You can't be bored because you can see many games. I played NonVR but damn it was fun.. Perhaps the most patronizing, boring tutorial I have ever attempted. I couldn't stomach it. They opted for the sappy kindergarten teacher target than humor, which was a poor choice. I want those 5 minutes of my life back.. Dreams: Owned the game when it first came out, the creations within a month were crazy, I could search up any topic or game and get a dreams version of that, now 3 years later on ps plus monthly I reinstalled it to see what happened, even more work put into it, there are only a handful of games that look like they could be triple AAA and it is truly mind boggling, I’ve never understood the creation process and I’ve tried it both with a controller and with vr controller, but the game itself is just very impressive and sometimes beautiful. 8/10. ""Its a really good Sandbox Game it remembers me of my childhood when i was playing lbp1 back in the days"". Great stuff. Not really a game but I've spent 1000s of hours playing and making games on what is essentially a fun casual game Dev social network. Niche, friendly and tight-knit community. To think what a ps5 version or pc version could be in future is quite exciting too. It's not a thing everyone should be desperate to get their hands in but those who it does resonate with will be using it forevermore.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done! P.S. it works great. I first saw dreams when it was still on the beta version and I couldn't believe what I saw, a basically infinite game with user made content, it was stunning i can't even describe it. I didn't even get started on Art's Dream, the main story made entirely with dreams and it's even better than some triple A games, with all that said dreams is really worth checking out if you haven't already.. You can make sonic, or mario, or actually be creative and make a minecraft pig. i made the pig. Nintendo stepped into this game fast and shut down a ton of people. But beyond that, its fun, if you like clay, and making things. its just very limited the file size has way too many limits and restrictions you cannot get too wild, because of that. but otherwise its a masterpiece.. The game has a lot of promise but, unfortunately, the audience just wasn't there. However, just playing the story missions is good reason enough to give it a try.. Best creative tool on console to date. Express your creative in modeling art, music sculpturing animating and much more. The toolds are easy to understand, though if you want to use some more sophisticated tools, they are yours to command. This is one of the best platforms to share your ideas and creations no other platform has. The simplicity of the tools are great for younger kids to understand and use and the more complicated tools can still accessed if needed. Dreams is a good blend of simplicity and complexity. A platform for everyone to share their ideas and thoughts. Them's facts, dreams is a one of a kind ""game"" and everyone should give it a try.. i love this game, his graphics, music, everything! i personally love how i can make everything, even music, paintings and sculptures!. Masterpiece From Well Written Story to the engaging Gameplay & Combat to the freedom of exploration & stunning world to the emotional music, what an excellent experience delivered by PlayStation Studios I think everyone should absolutely experience this gem. As a person who wants to creat, this is the best game ever, EVER. But if you like to play games more then play them you will be underwhelmed.. A lot of high ratings for this game. Although it is pretty fun, but nothing really new, and not all that special.. Dreams needs to go on PC to salvage what they can from that ABSOLUTELY FAILURE **** and Media Molecule needs to make a game ppl want to play because right now they are the DEAD WEIGHT OF PLAYSTATION STUDIOS.. Dreams is more like a ""creativity tool"" or ""game engine"" than a game,it can make a game,music,animated video.Dreams is truly open a door to anyone interested in making a game but didn't understand a thing about coding.i wish dreams is existed back when i was high **** would have been a life changing experience. Not 100% sure how to define Dreams, is it really a game that can be completed? With all the content people add over time? I only played the little story mode that was available at launch and finished it in one sitting. I had a really good time, the characters were all really cute and I was surprised at how invested I got in such a short time! The singing parts were kinda cringe though.. I never dove into the actual creator this game has because I don’t wanna know what abominations I’m capable of creating. If I could barely build a good stage in Smash Bros Brawl I doubt I could make a working game lol. Overall I’m glad I experienced Dreams!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nothing like the trailer. It’s not even fun, none of the games are good it’s not even a real VR game, not even full screen.. When I first heard about this game I got very excited. I thought I could make something special, as learning how to use the tools was said to be very easy. I was also fond of the idea of playing others' games. Unfortunately, a year after the game has come out and the community still hasn't created anything worth playing for more than 5 minutes. Moreover, the tools for creating games weren't as accessible as they were advertised. Having said that, some amount of fun can be had by trying out the user created games.. Dreams is an incredible creativity tool, it has undoubtedly marked a new milestone in terms of content creation from the comfort of your console. It has a series of easily understandable but long-lasting tutorials. This is an experience that requires patience and time, but ends up satisfying any player. Excellent!. It's a VERY good game, it deserves a better rating than the one I'm giving it. Fantastic ; Congratulation Media Molecule and Sony Intractive Entertainment. very nice game, i created my game, i always wanted to, but can't make large games with details, it's nice to build indie games.. Tutorial is annoying, I can't seem to turn it off, just want to play and experiment. Good game of it wasn't for that.. If you ever had the “dream” to create your own video games and have people play it, that dream is now a reality on PS4. In here, everything you can think of can be made and thanks to the massive community of talented people already in it, this game is endless.. I really don't get this game. It's like an engine to make games ok. I have never ever seen any decent game on the platform. I play all kinds of game and in dreams there is nothing that really has any potential due to engine limitations. Racing games, terrible Fps, clunky platformers, why play clunky and buggy platformer here really. Even if you are a creator, why spend your time learning a useless engine while you can learn to code games without limitations? Dreams was supposed to let you create games easily, this is nothing like that, you work your ass off for borderline playable tech demos.. JUST TWO WORDS: BUY IT! And also...i need to make this 75 charscters long so Pwpqqoaisjshdhhdhdiqoqiqywggeevbfjvjvkvldpaoajahagsvxggfhrjwiaoqoququwhgdvcbcvc. What an amazing job Media molecule did with this game. They give us the tool to create something special. We can now dreams of anything we want. U don't have to be a programmer or need some epic game engine to make something special. If u spend time with this tool set n how natural the control felt.. I hope they make a new version with improvements for PS5. Dreams 2. So cool. Best game of the year.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hard to put number on this ""game"" its more creation engine then game it self. But it can give you many hours of creation your own game or playing other people games. I would tell take it on sale and have fun with it :). Not just game that allows you to play others creations but also a whole too set to create really anything on your PS4. You can create music, sculptures, paintings, logic systems, characters, instruments, demos, showcases, short movies and of course full games. This is an incredible achievement and I’ve started to become a game developer. Already released two fun games. Yah! I’m hooked.. I really like the VR part. It's so virtual and such. Dikke vette 10! Or in English, nice!. One of the games that I wish I didn't buy. Not because it's a bad game. It was not for me. For someone who doesn't have any design, IT or computer skills I found it hard to learn on how to create games. Also, I did not enjoy the games that people create. I'm sure some of them are fun but just not for me. I prefer full games made by professionals not just some short 'indie' type games.. I had this game for a long time now and still don't feel like ""playing"" it. I really have a problem calling this a game. A game-maker is more like the right word. It's too advanced for a usual gamer and this is not a kids game. BUT i really think that this game is worth supporting.. On paper, the game seems fun and inventive, but in practice, unfortunately, it is not. :( The problem is that the game development tools are very clunky and intuitive to create something original you would have to squeeze millions of light years. I wanted to add an Acturian doubling to my cutsenki but it worked, the custcen broke and cannot be fixed. If you want me to play this, you have to make the creation tools easier because man is only nervous and **** from it! 0/10 I'm sorry but this is a very worthy evaluation of such a **** game as I will not have a place at home to sell this **** if nothing changes :(. I was an early adopter, buying Dreams in its beta phase and while I appreciate what this game is doing, I find the controls quite clunky to work with. Its fun playing other peoples creations but I found myself getting bored quickly. Its one of those that if you have time to invest, you will get the most out of it.. nice game just nice. a beautiful game that let you create everything you want. i wonder.. I dont have words to describe how wonderful the game is like a Universe with Infinites games just Woow what you can make here. Buggy mess. Tried it again before posting this review. Really needs updating. It promises a lot but fails to deliver.. Amazing game. Love going through all the content and relax whilst playing. Deffo would recommend. Just unbelievable game stuff you can create and play is sometimes mind blowing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has Tower Ball! This is the best game ever created! I love this game so much. I have played towerball alone about 60 hours! Buy it now!. Through the conflicting duality of progress and humanity, DREAMS fragments established notions of the star system.. Very good concept. Really enjoyed using my imagination to create little games. Very complicated to use but once you go through he tutorials and start to understand the controls better the possibility for this game is endless.. such a powerful tool, the creations are amazing and lets people creativity fly, I hope his game gets more exposure. There is and never will be a way to make video games more accessible to legit anyone.. A game that is all about beautiful potential, mostly squandered by not only being old-fashionedly restricted to a single pay-walled platform, sealing its fate into unfortunate obscurity.. I loved every bit of this game. The story mode is such a **** once you're done with it you still have a lot more community levels to play! Great game!. It is very good this program serves to create many great and fun things and share it with the community.. Brave concept, wonderful community, excited to see how it will grow from here. (youtube tutorials are often better then in-game tutorials though...). This game is really fun to play, I like the concept! Going through the user generated levels and seeing and playing what other players have created, it is a beautiful community!. Good game, it has a very great community and some of the things that people make are just so good. now, my one problem has to be the game controls are a little weird, and for what it is its a really good game not a masterpiece but a good game.. Poor game play and the levels peie make are boring. Creation tools are OK but it's Not a game!. I love it. The idea is amazing. I had so much fun playing all of the creations. Truly an art piece in this industry. It is a really good game. If you don't have any talent to art or design, like me, you can enjoy all the new games that the community developed. I think this game should be installed by default on PlayStation 5. This game is a good game is a game that lets you make your dream game and gives you the tools to do it. In short this game is a must try !!!. Epic creativity tool to your reach. This is the envy of the others plataforms. There nothing like that in others places. Just for some tastes.. Awesome stuff. Colorful, practical, intuitive. Very nice price . Not for everybody. Unlimited content (theorycally). Enormous potencial for the future. It needs more import options, however, and that can be fixed I hope.. This game is absolutely amazing, even if it can be complicated sometimes. It's basically a game engine made into a PS4 game, which allows for almost limitless creative possibilities.. Amazing game, i love everything about it honestly, been playing everyday since early access!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As expected, long time motivation isn't there at all. And all creations are of course not as big as everyone had hoped for. Since even with those nice tools, it's still a lot of work to do to get something big enough created to motivate someone playing it for a longer time. All creations are mainly some nice gimmicks, or short levels of a concept, or broken and buggy as hell. Nice in all, but yeah, as expected.. INCREDIBLE. I didn't feel like playing but when I tried it it became addictive. Limit to what can be created is really your own imagination.. I've bought dreams because I wanted to play other creations and maybe one day make my own. This ""game"" have the potential to be massive once people start noticing it. Already now I'm blown away by how many good games some users have created, there's room for so much potential here and we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I can only speak for myself when I say that personally this software is a masterpiece! 10/10 Very well made media molecule!. Not really what I expected .. Boring. Developers could do better. Others will find it fun. Great effort by the way.. Dreams gives you the opportunity to make your dreams come true. Seeing the impact of this game is indicative of its quality and is a title for somebody who loves community supported games like Forge in Halo, Mario Maker and Media Molecules own LittleBigPlanet.. Too boring, to be honest this 'game' is just for a few kind of people, If you love to create scenarios and waste your time hours and hours,then this 'game' is for you.. It's immaculate, it's powerful, and it's quite imaginative that the developers behind Little Big Planet crafted something truly spectacular for the community that loves video games made by gamers.. A beautiful and challenging game that has no real equal in the world of consoles. Complex at first, its well designed system and learning curve allows you to create anything. It's a pity that being an exclusive many people miss it and don't realize how valuable it will be for the audiovisual world in the future.. I honestly feel like there should be two separate user scores when it comes to this game but as there isn't I will be giving it a 6. As far as creation goes the game is amazing giving users the ability to realize their own ""dreams"" into actuality. Though I personally have no interest in creating and bought the game for the same reason I have bought every little big planet game because the user created levels are a blast and so creative. On the other hand, I feel that the user created levels in dreams are a bit lack luster. I feel crappy writing this as I am not a creator and can't even imagine the hours these creators put into their games. I guess more than anything the magic just doesn't feel there especially when compared to LBP. Still that isn't my biggest issue with dreams cause I can only imagine that the creators are only going to get better and better with the create function of the game. My biggest problem with dreams is the game play and visuals. Visually the game is hideous, the characters are blocky, they cloud like state of the world just doesn't really add anything, visually it looks like a free to play mmorpg graphically. and then comes the game play mechanics, the controls just don't work that well, which is kind of saddening considering how fluid everything ran on LBP. One of my biggest issues is the jump functioning its overly sensitive, honest most of the controls are. I guess all in all dreams is a ps4 game that should have come out on the pc, Still i do like that it was only 40 dollars and I did play a few games that were fun. All in all I feel that's its a game that's either for you or not for yo. If you're a creator its amazing but for people just looking to find really awesome created games it can be a challenge to find those games. I'm glad media molecule created such an amazing game for creators, I'm just hoping for their next project they create something that is also fun for just players. I have to recommend this game VERY STRONGLY to any PS4 owners with even a hint of creativity or passion for art in general. You can make ANYTHING with this title; games, music, character models, animation, architecture, landscapes, pixel art, you name it. You can also play, rate, and discuss other people’s creations. It has one of the kindest online communities I’ve ever been a part of as well. This commands respect from everyone at Media Molecule who worked tirelessly to give us the most comprehensive, complex, and accessible toolbox of creativity ever released on home console.. The game is phantasmagorical and truly a master of creativity and an artistic showcase you’ll be bound to adore!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The worst tool for making games. Confusing menus, impossible to understand what you are doing and where is the cursor, the ""game"" part is boring, very low and unfunny. Above all, Drems lets you make games in MONTHS when Unity is free, fast and incredible fast to learn. Dreams is very bad done.. Dreams has been, by far, one of the longest games in development. There have been a lot of detractors, especially industry pundits, who did not quite seem to catch the potential of this project unfortunately. I first started seeing potential back when one of the first demos came out. It was a simple demo of a level being designed and various tools being strung in like musical synthesisers, etc. In my head, I saw a glimmer of the impossible, then I sat back and crossed my fingers. What Dreams has achieved is something almost unthinkable. It is an entire creation suite of video game development. Think Unity, Unreal, engines that modern games are made on. It uses the power of the DS4 and the PS4 Pro to create a very intuitive creative experience. I have not, by any stretch, explored it completely. However, I am definitely a believer who is really happy for media molecule and am still gasping at what they have created here. Someone pinch me. For budding game devs like me, this is a Dream come true, pun intended. If you doubt it, go ahead and look at the stuff people are coming up with!. Is good hace crearte to videogames o recreation other games only hace ps4 need more games can created more minecrafth y dreams.. its a mess, another ps4 exclusive, what more can we say? buggy, short gameplay, bad interface, child game, you waste a lot of time to try another player level. waste of time and money.. THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN! Infinite games Bugs are mostly up to creators of their levels. Making old school games and adding the good old glitches in isn’t that difficult actually. Let’s take Super Mario Bros. The logic is very simple. If mario is in the air and get’s a little bit inside a block, the game pushes him the opposite direction he’s pressing the dpad. So if mario presses left while in midair. He gets **** in the block. Simple as that. If you use trigger zones. This glitch is very easy to remake.. I don't want to be any rude or something, but lets be honest guys, how can a game like this get 10/10? It's far from perfect. No games deserves 10/10 unless it's perfect in every way, Dreams is not one of them at all. After trying 30 games or more that people have created, I quiting pretty fast because 98% of them are broken and unplayable. It's nice that you have the abulity to create your own games, but I see that I just don't have time to spend countless of hours to make one. This game is sorely meant to devolpers, clearly. Positive thing was the price, big thumps up for that.. A masterpiece - all great . From the story to the online department … Everything is fantastic . Game training is a complicated value . Thanks ""Gamestarm"". This game is really incredible! It changes, poeticly, the perspective from which I see games. I won't be spoiling the wonderful moments and let you experience this game by yourself, believe me it's amazing!. Dreams is a creative achievement, with it’s ability to be charm full and allow players to make there own levels, games, music and so on. Unfortunately the only problem is making those creative games and levels, its very frustrating and hard even annoying at times, only people with patience and skill will achieve such things. Yes there is tutorials but they don’t go in depth, I really think they should’ve allowed more options then motion controls, at least the game has more than just playing people levels and games. There is a story mode made by the developers showing the power of dreams which is amazing, the story mode it self is actually very impressive and so much fun it’s perfect. Dreams is a simple concept build and share or play and share, it has so much charm put into it and so much love I just wish if the building mechanic was more welcoming to newcomers. (Amazing 4/5) Your Missing Out!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dreams is one of the best games ever made It needs to be more succesfull because really deserves it. Dreams is an incredible experience that has most likely never been done before. Releasing a game engine so powerful and allowing anyone to share their creations and give the possibility to make almost anything is something else. In this game there are 2 different main modes. “Dreams Shaping” and “Dreams Surfing”. In Dreams Shaping you have the possibility to create whatever your mind wants to make. It’s much easier sculpting and doing logic in dreams compared to Unreal Engine 4 or Unity. Dreams removes the scary coding part and simplifies it with special blocks. There are a lot of tutorials in the game that allow you to learn what each thing does and how to use it. It helps a lot with learning and you will be able to make something special at the end of it. The tutorials aren’t borring. They encourage you to do stuff in your own way. Choose your own colours. Make your own strange shapes. Anything is possible in dreams. Dreams Surfing is selfexplanitory. You can surf the creations others have made. Play Animations, Games, Showcases and so much more! It’s a blast. You will also find a game called “Arts Dream”. It’s an epic story game made by the creators of Dreams (Media Molecule). They used all the same tools we have access to in Dreams Shaping. I’ll won’t spoil anything. Play the game for yourself to find out what it’s about. GAME OF THE YEAR 2020 CALLING IT. A gem that not a lot of people will play, and I'm ok with that . I want to say they're missing out, but at the same time they're really not. A lot of unique creations by users, that will keep people who enjoy short 2-3 minute games ( for the most part..there are some exceptions obviously) coming back daily or weekly to check out new games made by the community. I think the diversity of community creations is what's really amazing, from remakes of games, to driving, combat, music, art, scenes, sports, mini-games, the games are endless. It's really like a youtube for games, they weren't lying. The only negatives of this game are hit and miss quality of user created content, which is really not that bad because of the trending and most liked games that are front and center when you surf user generated conent. Who this game is not for is for people expecting 30 minute- 2 hour games made by the community/ or triple a content made by them... its not realistic, so this game is probably not for you. As someone who mainly just plays the game and doesn't create, game is amazing to me. Pros: Story mode is short, unique, and has a fantastic ending. Youtube for short user created games Every genre for games imaginable. It will only get better as time goes So-So: Creation tool still feels overwhelming for me. Cons: Hit or miss ugc. short games and mostly demos. To end, Kudos to sony for giving the game a shot, it's amazing and even though it won't sell well.. I think the it was worth the investment for the gamers. When you play this game, prepared to be inspired, amazed, laugh, relax, etc. Amazing game.. but not for everyone.. You don't have to be a game maker. Playing the games made in Dreams is a joy all its own. No corporate b.s., just pure creativity expressed with some easy to use tools. If you do want to make games, this is the best game creation tool since Gary Kitchen's Gamemaker. No prior coding experience is necessary! Best of all, you can make pieces of things, like music, a background, or a character, and find it in someone else's game. Or you can take the assets that others have made to design your own game. This is like Minecraft if the creation in Minecraft mattered. I recommend Dreams for everyone who loves games. If you merely like games, then feel free to keep buying sequels from EA, Activision, and Ubisoft.. Really? This game isn't bad, but it isn't good. Average, i'll say. First of all, how this game became top1 on metacritic? What makes it special? I've spent some money on it, and i still didn't get it. Meanwhile, some REALLY good games having at least 60-65 score, like Fallout 4, Death Stranding, The Humankind Odyssey and etc.. Dreams is a innovation of this generation. The potential of this masterpiece is endless! This is definitely a game you should own.. Fun at the start, but then becomes a complete waste of money. I want my refund but PlayStation won't give it to me. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Though game to rate. If you're into this kind of stuff it's definitely 10/10, if you're not into creating and expect great games you'll probably looking at a 6-7/10. If you're something in between and you want ocassionaly check what are new, unique lindielike games than you'll safely get 8-9/10 from Dreams. This game needs keyboard/mouse support as soon as possible. When I first started Dream Shaping tutorials, it was a struggle. But as I advanced through the tutorials it just started to being a painful experience. I mean literally, my hands started to get cramps, my shoulders tired. I just want to connect a kb/m to my PS4 and build my creations but the developers enforces motion controls. It could also use graphic tablet support, but it's not an option for a PS4 I guess. I hope they release, at least the Dream Shaping feature of this game on the PC in the future so we can use the peripherals that we're more comfortable with. Dream surfing feature is almost perfect though. If you just want to play creations, you won't have many of these issues. But if this gets an update for supporting kb/m on Dream Shaping, I'll change my score to 9 or even 10.. Amazing game. Worth playing and buying. Endless hours of surfing between amazing levels.. What can you say about this … the youtube of games? Just ridiculous that this is even possible I’m mesmerized by the genuine quality of the creations people have made and I can only imagine what this will become. They said streaming was the future of games? Nah it’s this, this is the future of games. Absolute masterpiece!. Okay guys, I dont know how you can build these amazing games in dreams because the building controls are so terrible, i want my money back!. Beware. Most reviews smells fishy. I don´t underlook any type of dev software because it can be a powerful tool for very creative people. But like any gaming editor creating is not for all. And like mention in other reviews you´ll have a lot of clunky ","this game is the best way for aspiring game developers to start making games . it can be a bit laggy at times while editing large scenes, especially on the base PS4 . the tutorial for Dreams is annoying and not targeted at the main audience ."
472.Einhander,"Masterpiece gameplay, masterpiece soundtrack. Recommended, a must have. When will Square Enix make a remake? The background music is very awesome, gameplay is very good. This game manages to mix gameplay with sound design, transforming the whole experience into something epic. There are a wide variety of weapons and different ways of using them, each of which has its specific utility and is found by the senario as a very rewarding secret bonus. It is a game that you notice was made with love and care.. This is a really great game, even if it's very hard. It's a side-scrolling shoot em up that has very addictive gameplay. It has an arcade feel to it, because while it does have a save system, that's mostly for the weapons you collect. If you're lucky enough to find this game for less than $50+, it's definitely worth it. Good luck with that though.. This game is great. I first played it in 2000 on the PS1 and I've played it every now and then since then. Costs a pretty penny if you want to buy it nowadays.","this is a side-scrolling shoot em up that has very addictive gameplay . if you're lucky enough to find this game for less than $50+, it's definitely worth it . the soundtrack is very awesome, and the gameplay is very good ."
473.Deus Ex: Human Revolution,"It's amazing, the hacking, exploration, combat, story, they knock it out of the park.. Amazing! For me, it scratched my cyberpunk wants from a game. I can't believe how ahead of its time the gameplay was. The semi-open world and level design work even in 2024. I enjoyed almost everything about this game. Bravo!. I liked it quite a bit, especially the story, but probably won't be replaying it any time soon.. A hybrid of FPS, sandbox and RPG styles in this Blade Runner-esque story about augmented humans. It feels a lot less original than the first game and although there's nothing terribly wrong with it, it never feels particularly special either. A decent enough game, but the Mass Effect series does something similar and does it much better.. It was great seeing this series make a comeback in a good way. Square did great here.. I feel like this is a game which when it came out in **** many people saw the appeal behind it and I got to ask myself...well why? It is a shame because I think personally if more people gave this game a chance (and its sequel) then it may become somewhat of a cult classic (like the original Deus Ex games on PC) That is not to say this game has its flaws because I do feel like it does. For me personally, my personal biggest gripe with this game was its control scheme. I dont know if it was due to me being a bit younger when I played it originally or due to me playing it on Xbox 360? But looking past that, This game has alot to offer. Gameplay itself is very clever as it gives you the option in a number of areas to either go stealthy or go in guns blazing. The latter not being the best option but a option there nether the less. It is a nice twist and the fact that is a RPG and gives you the options to tune the character to how you want to play just adds to the charm. Story/Visuals wise isn't too bad. Story is a interesting concept but I think considering how much freedom you get given to play how you want to play, I think they could of personally injected that into the story JUST A TAD bit more. But that is me being nitpicky now. In conclusion the game itself is a nice RPG. Has a lot of player choice/freedom which elevates it higher than some other games in this genre but those controls for me at least caused me to have some doubt.. really polished game but kind of boring. sort of fun, probably just not my thing.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. A visually stunning, stealth action RPG with interesting settings and solid gameplay.. In terms of immersive sim games, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is among the best I've ever played so far. It's a fantastic first-person RPG set in a dark and grim ""Bladerunner-esque"" environment. The game takes place in a series of semi-open world environments that are well optimized and are only as big as they need to be, so they cut down on tedious commuting within the game. Human Revolution also provides and enormous amount of freedom to the player, allowing them to tackle main missions and side quests however they choose The game's combat mechanics are spot on. Shooting feels really powerful, the guns sound great and even on ""normal"" mode, the combat can provide a meaty challenge. You can only take a few shots before your die. Your guns hurt, their guns hurt, it's all good. The game also implements a cover-based shooting mechanic where the camera switches to more of a third-person view. This is extremely helpful if you choose to approach the game in a more stealthy way, rather than a frontal assault. You can move from one cover spot to another in order to stealth around enemy targets and even bypass them all together if you choose to do so. There's also lethal and non-lethal pre-animated take down moves that look awesome and are incredibly fun to pull off. The game's plot is pretty hefty and can easily provide 30-40 hours of gameplay. The game centres primarily around Transhumanism and how it's the way of the future for humanity. On my initial play through, I didn't really mind this as a central theme since it seemed cool enough. It was only on my second and third play through where I started to pay more attention to some of the dialogue and flavour text that you can read via emails and ebooks. The game briefly explores some interesting topics and it made me wish Human Revolution expanded on these ideas even more, such as predicting the U.S. oil crash of 2015 (a good guess, even though it was wrong), China emerging as an economic superpower over the U.S. and geopolitical shifts in Europe, among other things. If Human Revolution expanded on these topics, while slightly dialling back the focus on augmentations, then this game really could've painted a striking picture as to where humanity is headed in the future. This would've made Human Revolution my dream game. My only major gripe with this game is the ending: there's up to four possible ones and they're all really lacklustre. You essentially approach a giant computer and you pick your own ending. Which ever one you pick ends the game with stock video footage that has barely anything to do with the game and with a voice over narration as to why that choice is the right one. Overall, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a fantastic game. I've easily sunk over 90 hours into the base game alone and it's all been fun. Full recommendation!. The good: A super interesting story of a saga that is older than many believe. All situations can be solved in two ways stealthily or Rambo type. Customizable skill tree according to the way you want to play (stealth or Rambo). There are situations in history that can be solved with charisma or using endocrines or detecting lies (as long as you have the improvements). Here too ""not everything is as it seems."" AI is very advanced and enemies also have access to the improvements that you, such as ""Rino skin"" or ""thermal vision"", so they invite you to be creative using the environment and your skills. It is backward compatible and improves a certain part in Shanghai where the Lasers directly thundered the Xbox 360. Three different endings. Moral decisions. This game will surprise you in a good way and it will blow your mind when you play it and pass it The bad: a part of the story (The missing Link was DLC). In stealth mode it seems that you go to ""decal"" mode. The game at the beginning is very slow (there is much more after Detroit). Difficult achievements (Pacifist and The most cunning deaf). In certain parts the AI ​​hits a huge jump and frustrates a lot. The normal version (not the Directors Cut) is confronted with bosses who are sooo anti-climatic, especially if you carry stealth weapons because you're not going to tickle them. There is a very damn decision that will **** your game. The Meh !: when many listen to stealth the first thing they think is in the games of ""the most solid of snakes"". Many did not like the first person view. Many get carried away thinking that it is a shooting game more, but no.. What makes this game so appeal, aside from the compelling story telling, is the gameplay. Eidos team was able to mixed the complex tacticis of Rainbow six games with the extremely deep stealth mechanics of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory (the sound spotting mechanics is such a nice touch). More importantly the game seems to reward those players who prefer a non-lethal approach rather than the brain-dead call of duty playstyle, in spite the fact the game itself gives you the option to use a bombastic approach. The problems of the game are the obligatory Boss fight and the stats modifiers which break the exquisite skill-based tactical action game that this Deus Ex should be.. Despite its extremely slow start, stick with it and you'll end up with some of the most rewarding 35 or so hours of exploring a stealthy, fully realized cyberpunk atmosphere, with some of the best philolsophical questions that are likely to come up, not too far off in our lifetime. While your main character Adam Jensen is a bit of an impersonal shell, it provides the ability for the big questions and intrigue to happen to the great characters around him. The story is convoluted, but starts making a ton more sense after several hours. The sense of adventure and environment and choices on how to navigate feels great, and the leveling system is fantastic as you learn that you won't be able to level up everything, so everyone will end up playing the game a bit different. They did miss a sense of balance with some of the powers seeming essential or pretty useless but that's easy to overlook. In the end, this game is propelled by a solid, compelling story, good side characters, great abilities and a fleshed out stealth system, and most of all, fascinating and meaningful philosophical substance that very few games can get right.. I had a great time playing through this campaign on insanity difficulty. The sad part about that particular difficulty setting is that is highlights how rudimentary the combat system really is. Solid story elements and a near perfect length make this one worth hanging on to until the end credits.. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is decent stealth-RPG The gameplay is mediocre,my problem is that it asks you lethal or non-lethal,I take lethal and get a assault rifle with 40 bullets,how are you going to kill everyone with that? The stealth is well-done but i'm not a fan of the genre,and I hate RPG's but this one is **** bosses are unfairly difficult and generally really f*cking **** controls also feel weird,particularly on the **** shooting itself is not very good. The graphics are great,and the game does run really well on the 360. The story here is solid,no doubt about **** game is expertly voice acted,and there are plenty of dialogue **** game is very immersive too. The sound design and soundtrack are mediocre. Overall,Deus Ex Human Revolution is a game held back by questionable design choices.I would still say get it if you like stealth or RPG's,but everyone else should stay away.. Deus Ex Human Revolution is the best game in series, because this game made Square Enix (creators of Final Fantasy Series, Hitman Series, SMRPG Legend of the Seven Stars, Sleeping Dogs and not many games from Tomb Raider Series), in Deus Ex Human Revolutions very interesting storyline, good gameplay, with awesome stealth, not bad graphics for 2011 and this game is very amazing cyberpunk stealth and I think Deus Ex Human Revolution is one of the best games of 2011. Amazing game, very good.. Deus Ex Human Revolution Gameplay Freedom Deus ex is a first person stealth / shooter game, and I say slash because neither of these 2 are forced. Deus ex was clearly designed with stealth in mind… This is a game where you play as a man who is critically injured early on in the game and wakes up augmented… This essentially means he’s part robot… These augmentations give you way points on the screen, energy and can be upgraded as you play. Through an xp system to eventually be able to hack higher leveled security panels, be immune to poison gas, have more energy among many other things… There are also stealth augments if you choose to play this game stealthily… Everything about Deus Ex is so greatly designed… You can sneak around cover perfectly, climb through vents to pass patrolling guards…you can create your own cover by moving objects... you can sneak up behind enemies to either put them asleep or take them out for good, one being louder than the other, as well as hide their bodies to not alert everyone.. You can play through the entire game without killing anyone… This game is also greatly designed for aggressive players like me so you have the option to play the game as a 3rd person shooter like I did as enemies do all carry weapons and ammo… This gives such a great feeling of freedom to truly tackle the game in any way you desire unlike other games that promise this but never truly deliver… its delivered here… You can peak over cover, and there is a variety of heavy, combat, and compact weapons, all with their own unique feel to them… All of this gameplay freedom sounds great but it’s not even the best part of the game… Deus Ex Human Revolution is hands down one of the most fleshed out games I’ve played period… There are side missions to complete…. Conversations to be had to convince a character to allow you to go inside a building for example, or to prevent a suicide… and not only are there conversations for you as the player, but the characters that inhabit this world all have conversations going on as well… Some seemingly random, I never heard the same line of dialog twice, bringing so much life into this world… you’ll hear characters on the streets of the handful of cities you visit asking for directions and the locals making fun of them because of the location they ask for… you’ll hear guards and janitors talk about work… it’s really perfectly done and other developers need to take note… The only downside to this game is ultimately the story… It’s the typical bad guys wanting to use technology for bad things story.. It never really kept my intention or kept me pushing forward, luckily the gameplay is good enough to carry the game on its own. I give Deus Ex Human Revolution an 8.5/10. + Freedom of gameplay, its one of the few games that can actually offer a completely different experience depending on how you choose to play, and rewards you for exploring and planning your next move + Levelling up adds more than a 'stat boost' like in other games, every upgrade you get matters and can change the approach you take to gameplay + Interesting story and raising moral and philosophical questions about what it means to be human. It is dark and gritty and touches on real life issues we face in society like discrimination and bureaucracy - The graphics aren't great, stiff animations and im not a fan that everything is bathed in yellow light, more variation in the places you visit would be welcomed other graphical issues include everyone in the background freezing in place when you perform take downs, it looks so out of place when in a large scale fight, people clips through the walls and some times the character models don't even make contact with each other - load times - confusing layout to the world, i got lost plenty of times. Where to begin, well for starters the story line isn't that great, graphics are decent. But when it comes to game play I have never played such a bad game in my life. The cover shows promise but when it comes to actually playing it, it's worthless. It was so bad that I made this account just to write what I thought of it. Something I have never done beffore. Great game. Good lengthy campaign with very interesting story line. I cant see why the latest deus ex games would get such lower reviews. I am very glad I purchased it. One of the only complaints I could come up with is the aim function. Its activated with the R joystick button and not the L trigger like im used to. Still the game makes up for it with EVERYTHING ELSE.. Deus Ex Human Revolution is a great game. It is actually a confusing game to describe. It has so many elements to the game. It's a third person, first person, RPG, hacking, stealth, sci-fi, game. It's also does all of these elements better than I've seen in any other game. It really is a great game, with a surprisingly good, interesting story. I thought it would be very generic, but I was surprised on how adult and dark it was. The only thing that made this game a 9 instead of a 10 was the boss fights. It doesn't fit the game. At all. The first one is just ridiculous. I won't spoil anything, but it defiantly should of been left our or redone.. One of may favourite games of all time. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is for me the strongest entry in the series. The game (now over three years old) has still left a deep impression on me. The setting, atmosphere and environment design was very memorable by depicting a realistic future. The weapons and inventory had pretty solid customisation options and was more than what I expected. The stealth was well done and so was the combat. (The boss fights were still fun) What finished it off was the amazing soundtrack, character development and story but what made the game stand out was the multiple choices we could have made. I went back and experienced all that I missed out on - doing multiple playthroughs since it was just such a good game.. It's not a bad game. You can have fun sneaking around and shooting people in the head. But there are a couple things I didn't like. One, it takes too long to gain your upgrades. Two, the hacking bit is no fun whatsoever. Three, you can't delete saves it seems. Four, the story is so-so. It's nothing new. But if you like stealthy, first person shooters, with a strong sci-fi element I think this might be for you.. This game is probably worth a 9. why 8? boss fights... not sur and the first hour of it is so boring it makes you regret your purchase That said and that first hour behind, when you get into the story... so nice! freedom, variety, gun mods, upgrades, etc. You can see they put lots of effort in the mechanics and upgrades system They could easily make a near-perfect game with another deus ex in the futur, only by fixing the few negative points in this one. (come on, lets get to work ;)). fun gamplay tremendous story cool lever Exploration super good protagonist satisfactory ending and one of the best sountrack Ever made.boss fight pretty easy the only thing that cant make feel Empty. Is a third/first person game where you can choose to play any style (stealth, guns blazing, hacking, etc) and is set in a near future cyber punk inspired world, takes you to places from Detroit to china to Canada etc. Pros: Lots of choices in gameplay, levels are well designed 4 different endings (all satisfying enough) Great voice acting Nice visuals Great sound design High replay ability Great length: 25+ hours Great protagonist Good side characters Good side missions Repercussions in story on choices you make Diverse levelling system, thoroughly ur journey you will see some things you should of upgraded to go through there etc, but all skills are useful. Bad: Facial animations Lip sync Boss fights Bad villains, didn't have any backstory. An incredibly fun game, beautifully crafted with strong RPG depth, exciting stealth mechanics and very well honed 3rd person cover based shooting. Whilst the game probably was a little too easy at times, I didn't feel like it mattered I was enjoying every minute of it and whether you are in to sci-fi, rpgs or just like a good shooter romp I think you will too.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have been a long time fan of intricate rpg's and thinking games. Deus Ex will give you some of that complexity you crave. However for me it is wrapped in such a linear, pointless, b-movie script that I can't muster up the ambition to play past the first couple levels. There was no immersion or compulsion to find out what pre-determined encounter might be around the next corner. But I have never been able to enjoy on-rail games (except Spacemarine). If you like scripted stories with only one way to complete them then this is probably a good representation of that genre. Hitting the uninstall button now.. This game has an incredible story that gets better with every playthrough. I feel like this game took the best parts of an RPG, an FPS and the Splinter Cell style stealth gives you an incredible amount of versatility. I think the best feature of this game was the ability to choose whether you wanted to play as a stealthy pacifist, an assassin of opportunity, or a kill-em-all machine gunner. I also thought that the hacking and security measures added a great twist to the stealth platform. The only part of this game I found to be awkward was the boss fights which embraced a run-and-gun style that seemed out of place. Overall, this game had an exceptional story with a number of surprising twists and a great style of play.. Simply put, this is one of, if not the best, first person shooter of this generation, and here's why. 1. The concept behind Deus Ex: Human Revolution involving human augmentations is just really interesting. For some reason, the whole controversy regarding whether or not humans should advance is just really compelling. It never got boring, and it made the political aspects of the game really cool. 2. The graphics are just stunning. They're mainly made up of orange and black color schemes, which makes the game look very stylish and slick. It also helps to make the places you visit far more interesting. 3. The music and sound design is top notch. 4. The gameplay is just phenomenal. The game allows for a huge amount of player freedom. You can approach most situations in any logical way you might think. For example, if you have to get through a gate, you can either kill the guard by the door, bribe the guard, knock him out, bribe him and then kill him to get your money back, or you can just forget him and climb over the gate by stacking boxes. This kind of freedom is one that I have not experienced in any game other than this one. The only reason this game isn't a 10 is because of its few imperfections. For one thing, the loading screens are insanely long, up to 40 seconds in length. Also, character animations are pretty poor in conversation. AI isn't the best, and enemies just sort of stand around waiting for you to shoot them some times. The worst issue, however, is the boss battles. The whole game I had been upgrading my stealth abilities, only then to get my ass kicked by a boss. It's not really emphasizing freedom of play if I have to upgrade offensive abilities for bosses, and that ****. Regardless of its flaws, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game that any fan of FPSs or RPGs should play.. Beautiful art, spine tingling soundtrack, and heavy moral questions make this game one of the best you'll ever play. This game will go down in history as one of the greatest, even if it was so limited by 2011 technology.. The original Deus Ex was a true step forward for gaming. Combining elements of the first person shooter and RPG genres it allowed the player more freedom to choose their own path through the game than virtually any other title before or since. As a result any games released in the series are always going to be the subject of huge amounts of hype. Fortunately Human Revolution, for the most part, lives up to that hype. Playing as a prequel to the first two titles in the series the game takes place in the 2020's with human augmentation still in its infancy and creating tension between those that can afford the technology and those that can't (or choose not to use it). The opening sees the main protagonist, Adam Jensen, left mortally wounded in an attack on the augmentation facility in which he works. In order to save his life he his involuntarily equipped all manner of said augmentations. Six months later and fully recovered he sets out to unravel the conspiracy surrounding the attack that almost cost him his life. This story is generally well told and is certainly more interesting than most video game scripts. As the game progresses the player is rewarded with a choice of upgrades that allow for different styles of play. If you want to run in all guns blazing then upgrade the damage you can take, if you want to go in quietly then unlock the invisibility upgrade. The choice is always yours and the excellent control scheme makes virtually any choice possible. Alongside the main quest are a series of side quests that be can be initiated by talking to certain people around the main city hubs. Avoiding the usual fetch quests associated with RPG's these usually offer multi-layered objectives that again offer the player the choice of how best to tackle the problem. Now for the negatives and the reason I have not awarded the full five stars. Firstly, despite all the advances made in video games in the last ten years, the AI of the enemies is still lacking. When patrolling these enemies will patrol a set route around the room and, as is the case with every stealth based game ever released, it is possible with a little patience to work out exactly when to move to avoid detection or take out an enemy. Also if an enemy spots a dead or unconscious colleague they will search for you for all of about 2 minutes before giving up and returning to their preset patrol route making them an easy target. The second negative is the frankly unnecessary boss battles. In a game that allows such freedom of choice (including the option of never having to kill anyone) it is jarring to find yourself in a one on one battle with a super powered enemy in which the only option is to kill them. Why does the player not have any choice in how to deal with these situations? Despite these faults Human Revolution is a fantastic achievement that, while not the revolution the original was, is amongst the very best games available on Xbox360 and would make a great addition to anyone's collection.. Amazing game! Upgrading yourself is fun and there are so many different ways to tackle a level. The story was well done and very engrossing. I hope they release more!. I was really hyped about this game, but just couldnt get into it. Game had too much small text that was very hard to read and main character was so lifeless and monotone. Ultimately, the biggest turnoff to me was the gameplay which I felt was bogged down with countless boring text logs and dialogue.. Dues Ex: Human Revolution is probably one of the best stealth games I ever played. I'm a big fan of stealth games and Deus Ex: Human evolution easily holds its place as one of the best in the stealth genre. The story is really good and interesting but that varies between people. Some might find it boring but in opinion I enjoyed the story line and the **** story takes play in the future where people have augmentations that are pretty much robotic hands and arms. But not all is good because there are humans who oppose these augmentations to humans. The game also offers choices that can change the storyline outcomes. Which actually has differant results so some people might reload their game to choose differant choices. The game looks great overall but some of the cinematics sometimes look worst the Game play itself. I found it funny how people in the cinematic look like they were covered in grease like a cheesy McDonald commercial. The gameplay is also fun with a mixed of first person and third person action. Suprising it works well with the game and before you know it you get well used to it. You can also run and gun through the game if you want to but the best choice is probably stealthy all the way through. There also many role playing elements that work well with the game. Such as augmentations that give you more health or more energy. The game also offers many different paths you can take to your objective. You get alot more if you thoroughly explore the area instead of rushing from point A to point B. There are also a good amount of weapons that can suit everyone's needs. The only complaint I probably have is the boss battles which hardly requires any stealth mechanics. All you do is get the most powerful weapons you can find and spray all you bullets into the bosses. So players who went through the stealthier approach and invested their skill points in stealth skills they will have a harder time. Also I would have preferred it better if you had the option to kill the bosses or let them live. Since you can complete the entire game without killing the anyone except the bosses. Overall, if your a fan of stealth games or enjoy like a futuristic story you should pick up this game.. A brilliant prequel to the original Deus Ex, Square Enix has definitely delivered with Human Revolution. Combining an absolutely brilliant story, along with fluid gameplay mechanics and a wide choice of playstyles to choose, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the best Stealth/RPG/FPS games of the recent years. An excellent score of music also helps to reflect the dark undertone of the game. Set in future Detroit, the game revolves around conspiracy, and secrets. Players will feel involved in the story travelling from Detroit, and other places such as China etc. Overall, one of my favourite games from the past few years, and an excellent addition to both the Stealth genre, and the Deus Ex series too.. I haven't expected too much from the game at first (never played the original), but it really surprised me. You can really feel the effort that Eidos Montreal has put into this great game. Style, story and universe are incredibly interesting and based on your skills, or your way to interact with great developed characters, every playthrough can feel different. One gripe that I may have are the side-missions. You land in some city because of the main-mission and the side-missions you get are in most cases just optional additions. They never lead you go somewhere new, what makes them uninteresting after a few. The way these mission are played, is fun though. Challenging and fair. You just don't have 2 options: sneak or shoot. It is different: hacking turrets and cameras, going threw ventilation shafts, assassinate guards, several entrances... There are many ways to the goal. Whatever your plan is, there are decent skills for every type of gamer. The games' strongest point is it's great developed story, supported with decent gameplay and average tech. At todays' dead RPG genre a very good game.. Immersion breaking is abundant. The illusion of freedom is painfully obvious. Each component of the game has issues that can't be forgiven.... Jensen's apartment is pretty.. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a great action/stealth RPG with a fantastic atmosphere, characters, world and combat. You can choose to go in guns blazing or take a more stealthy approach and your choices in upgrades will be crucial when deciding your play-style, whether it's upgrading your hacking skill so you can attempt to hack more difficult computers or unlocking several perks that can help you in stealth or action gameplay, One of the weaker points of the game is it's boss battles which feel out of place compared to the rest of the game, especially if you happened to choose the stealth route, But overall it's a solid game that is an easy recommendation to action, stealth or RPG fans.. Great story and great storytelling in this game BUT the gameplay is off by a longshot. The ""super"" powers are anything but, and the implementation of actions can be frustrating, as it jumps to a cutscene, then back into character. Can make it difficult when you are hanging on for dear life in a firefight.. This is my first game in the Deus Ex Series, and it has been a blast! I enjoyed the storyline and the fact you can choose to go finish things in a stealthy way or a ""Hasta la vista, baby"" way and go all Terminator. The graphics look great and side quests are really good and adds some sense of what people think in the game about the Augmentations. Had a great time with the game, you can too.. Good gameplay, bad bossfights, good voice acting, didn't care about any of the caracters though. Don't hide the eyes of the guy you are supposed to care about. I had fun, but with a little more Joss Wheedon, this game could have been great.. I am happy to say that this game lives up to the original. Loads to do with so many missions and upgrades, the only thing that lets it down are the poor boss fights.. AWESOME, this game is an example of what a stealth game must be! Story is very well written and totally believable, and the flexibility in gameplay makes this game 3 in 1. You can play it by stealth, action or no-confront at all, This is Money well spent for sure!. Deus Ex: Human Revolution had some very big shoes to fill. Not only did it have the pr","a hybrid of FPS, sandbox and RPG styles in this story about augmented humans . gameplay itself is very clever as it gives you the option in a number of areas to either go stealthy or go in guns blazing . if more people gave this game a chance, it may become somewhat of a cult classic ."
474.The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay,"Riddick brings a rich gameplay experience, and marries it with a Hollywood story.. I just finished this on PS3 as it was included with my copy of Dark Athena. Did this not come out on PS2 originally? Maybe that's why I never played it as a kid. Anyways I was really impressed with how far ahead of its time this game was. It is a first person shooter/stealth game with RPG and platforming and survival-horror elements. It honestly reminded me of Fallout (years before that franchise went to first person shooter/RPG), Dishonored, and Prey. I was really impressed with the physics of this game. The dead body dragging stuff was really next level. I was impressed with the scope of this game especially considering it was a movie tie-in game that came out in 2004. They didn't have to go as big as they did but I'm glad they did. It's a fun game that moves quickly and there is a lot to explore. It's fairly linear but not wholly and it never feels like you are rehashing the same corridors over and over. Some of the graphical things were really impressive for the time too like how you will occasionally see Riddick's shadow based on the player movement and lighting. But overall the graphics don't hold up and the textures and polygons mostly look like crap now. I did like the colors and overall design of this game. The characters' mouths moving when speaking is probably the worst offender of ""past graphics that don't hold up"" in this game. The voice cast features plenty of actors/characters from the movies as well as a couple of big names from the industry. However, it felt like the game didn't get the most out of its cast. So many of the actors just sounded so sleepy during the whole thing. As impressive as the physics were it seemed like you never had to use the dead body drag mechanic all that much. The AI was smart, almost too smart. Any time I tried stealth they would spot you immediately. You would barely peak out of a corner and the guards would start blasting you. This caused me to basically abandon stealth all together and basically speed run the game. I liked that there were little RPG style fetch quest side missions, but I played the game fairly linearly and before I knew it I was escaping from Butcher Bay and the credits were rolling. I never got a chance to return some of the items I found along the way because the game didn't bring me back to the spot where I accepted the quest. I guess that's on me for assuming it would. Overall this was a really impressive game given the year it came out and the type of game it was. It reminded me of so many modern games I've played in the last 10 years or so. It was fun, interesting, and a breeze to get through. I'm really glad a copy of this was included with my PS3 version of Dark Athena because the obsessive compulsive completionist in me felt like I had to play the first game first. It's better than most movie games you will come across, but it's not without its pitfalls. Onto Dark Athena now.. Possibly the best FPS game ever made or at least a good contender for that title. Everything from the gameplay mechanics to the story and the art direction make EFBB an unforgettable experience that transcends the video game medium.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Been a Riddick fan since the film Pitch Black and this game doesn't disappoint at all! Great stealth mechanics, good story, and an awesome prequel to the Riddick franchise!. Though the Riddick films are so under appreciated (it's a crime) I speak for real si-fi fans when I say that the Riddick series (video games included) is one of the greatest series of its genre.",first person shooter/stealth game with platforming and survival-horror elements . i was really impressed with the scope of this game especially considering it was a movie tie-in game . voice cast features plenty of actors from the movies as well as a couple of big names from the industry .
475.WWF No Mercy,"I created an account specifically to leave a bad review for this game because I’m sick of people telling me it’s the greatest wrestling game ever when HCTP exists. The reversal system is random and the handicap matches are endless. I can see where it would’ve been fun if better wrestling games didn’t exist, and at the time they didn’t, but this game categorically DOES NOT hold up and is basically unplayable to anyone without a drinking problem and 2 divorces. Unless No Mercy didn't make mistakes like WCW Mayhem or Backstage Assault, THQ and Aki could have given more time to polish the game much better. And regarding the save file corrupt glitch, it shouldn't really have happened and that can absolutely be avoided. And despite it'san critically-acclaimed wrestling game and the bestest of all in wrestling game history or era, it's just that particular problem. That stupid save file bs thing that THQ messed it up lmao. (Back when WWF/WWE was actually good, not Vince only cares about Roman Reigns, the Roman Show, and Romanmania) Anyway, this is by far one of the best arcade wrestling games, had a pretty deep story mode, and loads of fun to be had at every corner.. I Love this game a lot and is one of my favorit games of all time, the controlls are great, the modes are great, almost every thing is great, but it can get boring when your playing by yourself as a aki wrestling games I think are mostly a heavy multiplayer game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best WWF game on NIntendo 64,titantrons in this game is awesome,big roster of wrestlers,many arenas and nice graphic.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. This is what wrestling games should be like. ALWAYS LIKE THIS!!! This game had a great story, and it was just overall great. Never got bored with it. WWE needs to pay attention to their old stuff, but this was THQ, and unfortunately, THQ doesn't exist anymore.... This is the most beloved wrestling game that fans have on their top 10 lists. This broke the mould on how wrestling games should be made with time and patience not like every 2k wrestling game coming out every year. The intro is THE best wrestling game intro of all time. The wrestler models look impressive for the time but obviously aged badly. The roster is perfect for 2000. The customization mode for the game is so massive and you could change anything on your wrestler. It has all the pay per views and match types you expect. The controls are good most for the most part except for reversals and throwing them out of the ring. The soundtrack is fantastic. The career mode is the most famous element of this game. It is still the only wrestling game to have branching paths with different outcomes and many different championship belts to go for. The secret wrestlers to unlock in career mode gave the game so much replayability. The survival mode is the only way to earn big money and to buy many alternate things in the Smackdown Mall. The only things that are kind of bad are the collision detection, the controls and the unbalanced ai in career mode and survival mode. This is a very difficult game and requires a lot of time and patience to master. It is still worthy of it's reputation. Definitely get this game if you are a wrestling fan.. One of the best wrestling games ever made, This game was amazing when it first released back in 2000 and blew away the competition on the N64 and Playstation.. This game is awesome exclusive on Nintendo 64 with normal graphics for 2000 and many finishers, in this game can spend finisher on opponent's meneger . In this game amazing championship mode and cool gameplay . For Nintendo 64 this game is very good and amazing, but on Playstation there are wrestling is better . WWF No Mercy is good game, but can better because about WWE/WWF many good games .. WWF No Mercy is the best wrestling game of all time, and of course, one of the greatest games on Nintendo 64 behind The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Golden Eye 007, Mario Kart 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Conker Bad Fur Day! I like this game because it has massive roster, special pay-per-view events, old-school and quality battles! My favorite wrestler is The Rock and I can kick Kurt Angle and others! If you smell, when No Mercy is cooking?. This is my favorite wrestling game of all time! I really wish they remade this in better graphics and updated roster! aMaZiNg!! Retro! Grab a buddy, grab a beer and give me a hell yeah!","despite it's an critically-acclaimed wrestling game and the best of all in wrestling game history or era, it's just that particular problem . regarding the save file corrupt glitch, it shouldn't really have happened and that can absolutely be avoided . this is by far one of the best WWF game on NIntendo 64, had a pretty deep story mode, and loads of fun to be had at every corner ."
476.Gran Turismo 4,"Not much to tell, besides that this is one of the greatest games of all time. And by far, the best racing game to have ever been published. Simple as.. Good game but not better than midnight club 3 Probably second best racing game tied with GranTurismo 5 imo. Big Rigs Over The Road Racing is so much better than Gran Turismo 4. I don't know why everyone is giving Gran Turismo 4 a 10 and are caliing Gran Turismo 4 the best racing game ever made. Big Rigs Over The Road Racing eats Gran Turismo 4 for breakfast.. The game is alright. It made me want to cry when I finally beat it. Truly an incredible emotional roller coaster of an experience let alone a video game.. Best Racing games with so many cars and track. Good graphics for PS2. Gt4ever. I **** love this game. It introduced many new cars, with better graphics and physics.. If you will play this game you won't regret it and even you will love it. MASTERPIECE!. This is Gran Turismo 4. That's all I need to say. Amazing progression system. Not too hard but also not too easy (although it seems that this is what people's problems are as 99% of the negative ratings are from people who are used to paying to complete the game rather than actually playing it or just in general they have no driving skill). The soundtrack is also really good. Awesome graphics and so much variety in events or cars.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game saved me in the worst year I had that it was the motivation to keep going. Mid game, even Gran Turismo 7 is better... hell, i'd rather watch paint dry then play this god-awful game. #DownWith4!. Boring games, with boring races, boring cars, boring tracks layout and boring soundtrack. My childhood game, a visual banger and stunning gameplay!I spent so many hours racing the 24h of Le Mans, this circuit was a marvel!. The Best Gran Turismo Series Ever, I love this game. Great Graphics, Many cars from 1800s until future, 50 Tracks, Real Handling and other.. This is a really great game if you don't play it your missing out it's is the best racing game of all time if you don't agree your life will be in danger. This is the best racing game so far. I've never seen racing game like this before. Very recomended.. 9/10 because tire screech, car sounds were bad, the handling model leaves more to be desired, a bit on rails. The visuals were a bit weak too but that's the PS2's fault. Photomode is beautiful and on a emulator it's pretty mindblowing that it COULD look like that. GT3 is one of mine as well too. I started on GT but I think FM4 edges both of them out in the GOAT conversation. I also think GT3 had a better Aesthetic than both of those games but GT4/FM4 have a equal one.. Gran Turismo 4 more like G.O.A.T Turismo 4 If you have an emulator, a good pc or even a PHONE Play this game...... RIGHT NOW!. Amazing I just can't name a single better game in the world just the graphics, the physics, the cars and everything its amazing. A fully-realized vision of an interactive racing simulator, Gran Turismo 4 sees Yamauchi-San and his Polyphony team at the absolute height of their creative power. The most comprehensive single-player campaign in any racing game can be found here, carefully thought out and perfectly executed. The wealth of content here is outstanding, ala Gran Turismo 2, and the technical presentation is spot-on. Full of grace, vision and creativity, Gran Turismo 4 isa true benchmark for the genre.. This is simply the best racing game of all time, no questions asked. Just go play it already. Happy New Years 2024!. Easily the greatest racing game on the PS2 by far!! anyone who says otherwise, ESPECIALLY WITH A RATING OF ZERO, is either s**tposting, rage baiting or just your typical Forza Fanboy. Shout out to my main man, the GT Auto guy!. This actually is one of the greatest racing game of all time. Even for 2023, it is totaly playable and enjoyable.. AbsolutelyAbsolutely THE GOAT when it comes to amazing gameplay bgreat graphics in it's time and the huge variety in the amontes of tracks and cars vroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom NAILED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Greatest game EVER in the history of games,nothing more to say,buy the damn thing and experience for yourself. Gran Turismo 4,more like GOAT Turismo 4. This game saved my marrige my bank account my lunch my life But theres 1 thing my balls itch. The best racing game of all time. Period.. Its beautiful and provides lots of fun. If you dislike it, just deal with your skill issue.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the best racing sim games if not the best racing game ever the progression the cars the environment is just amazing if there would be a remaster to this game id definitely buy it right away. My dirty hand never would have touched at least five separate copies of this masterpiece if I didn't consider it a 10. I have been playing racing games since I was a wee little lad, I didn't play this one back then but the first GT as a kid and went back to start playing this game recently and was genuinly surprised at how awsome it is, there are many different models/packages of cars I didnt even know existed but now do and some interesting concept cars. I'm not super far in but ive gotten the A1 liscense and the amount of speed in the RC92 made me realize ok I am in for some serious ****. The handling for the cars still holds up great the tracks you get to play are fun and feel more alive the most modern games with people taking pictures or running to get out of your way as your pass and ducking back behind walls if you take a corner super tight the level of tuning you can do to your cars is amazing I turned a r32 Gtr vspec n1 into a full on rallycar I can't think of another game except the forza horizon series that lets you do that but the handling/tuning/courses don't even compare in those to this the rally physics almost feel like the newer dirt rally games and those are over a decade newer the in game soundtrack is great although I wish the song didnt change when you go to a event but I can live that If you read all this first of all thanks and second what the hell are you still doing here and not playing this legendary game!. This carefully crafted game is a love letter to car fanatics as me and yeah i guess. It only evolves graphically. Playably it's a Playstation 2 Gran turismo. It should be an evolution, not a remastered.. Legendary Game AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. The game’s scuffed, weak to my ZA WARUDO, broke all licenses with 9s faster than golds EZPZ. still finished the game 100% tho so it’s 10/10 WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. I really wanted to like this game, but it was impossible. Realistic car racing games were and still are boring for me.. Now for a look at GT4. Lot of content, some reward cars can be awkward and the manager mode an entire sub genre I think started here (I may be wrong but can't recall other niche games or notable doing this till GT4). First is the menus. The orange and blacks of menus, HUD and more are gone in favour of a more white modern look. I enjoy the other design but the quality of it (resolution I mean) it still looks appealing as if it came out in this generation for a map in GT Mode to options/arcade mode (also less boxes and blandness like modern games too). Music remixes are still here & great. While licensed music has more variety of genres and artists. The driving model is more higher level skill. The variety of FF, FR, MR, 4WD & RR are still different enough & quirks that cars are known for are present. Many tracks do look like their real life counterparts now. While some new ones have been added alongside some less appealing too many cars for advertising big number counts when its too many versions of a Madza MX5, Honda Civic or others. Too many trims included. No car classes or Gear Score/PP/PI system, no level system (didn't till GT5 & further focus, even stricter in GT7. Only Corvette/Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano/Racing Lagoon as RPG focused for the time. Licenses tests offer 80 tests (16 per 5), 3 1 lap trials each (15 total), then 8-10 per of GT1-3. There is variety but some are filler (repeats). GT4P save import offers bronze tests & 100K. Coffee Breaks are fun little side challenges. No 1L Fuel left of GT6 yet but many cone focused (cone maze/spiral) or marked Gymkhana course layouts. Driving Missions are introduced. Many of these are more so overtake missions such as slipstreaming, 1 Lap Magic aka time limit back of the pack and overtake all opponents (Sprint in FM6&7), 3 lap overtaking with opponents scattered around the track & overtaking just 1 or 2 opponents of a similar car range. 1 lap magic times can get long to wait for so be careful about how to beat them. Some around 30 seconds others 100. You did have R Racing (story/challenges)/MotoGP time trial, checkpoints, overtaking challenges to get concept art and bikes, or MotoGP3 20 custom tracks never seen again or TOCA story mode/motorsport variety but GT4 offers it's style of content offerings. Like those listed above to the GT2 approach of: -one make events (no randomiser this time so no filtering Super Speedway anymore XD), -Endurance from 1 to 24hrs (3 24hr events) (no dynamic day/night) or 100 lap counts, -Drag Race (1 Las Vegas Strip so not as many as Sega GT on Dreamcast or FM3), -photo scapes to position cars in photo mode, -speed tests or races (5 credits and a custom race based on the car you selected), -3 difficulties and many rally events -B spec mode useful for tracks you don't like or endurance events which does cut out after going to the pits so you have to reset it again. You can x3 speed which isn't present in GT5&6 B spec sadly but GT6's player control option with R1 and accel/brake does put it up a bit then just paces. The event variety is good. You have a good mix of drivetrain, supercars/Horse power requirement, car classes (hatch, muscle, trucks and more) old era or modern era, one makes, rally and more are available. Tuned cars offer different complete/better parts than makers. With some rewards as concept/historical, some not all can be used in main events only in arcade mode/speed tests. But it varies, try out some concepts to find out (message will tell you if you can't use them). So be careful winning concept cars for some events you worked hard to beat. Events can be repeated/sell those cars. Car selling prices vary, concepts aren't worth selling anything (unless fan mods). The mix of road, wet, dirt & snow for rally is great. Some tracks are tight, so get creative with ways to pass single opponents. Some GT2/3 tracks are removed (some still there like Tahiti Maze/Swiss Alps). With some new added like Grand Canyon, Paris, Italian cities (Coast de Amalfi, Cita Di Aria), Tsukuba wet & Cathedral Rocks. Used car dealers return, results of car types/region are fair but still awkward. Especially for non-Japanese cars you can find some for certain events, but best to go with new cars. For trucks go for new dealers. Besides day 690-700 silhouette cars. If you complete Beginner & Professional events you receive the end movie. But Extreme Events are available as a bonus besides the rally, endurance (after 25%), US, EU & JP events. The game can easily last 100s of hours, be played many different ways even with the fair event requirements (something many modern games like FM6's linear & side content approach could learn from. But different in structure to a PGR2 that has car class event careers but is allowing many event types/tracks still) events so many are open ended (main or side). With many ways, casual/custom challenges/B spec/roleplay.. One of, if not the best racing game there is! An absolute amazing game that perfectly shows the history of the automobile. This is the best looking PlayStation 2 game I ever seen with its amazing detail & car models that have aged incredibly well. Driving physics are really good with infinite customization & upgrades. The selection of cars is astounding, there’s no other game where you can drive the worlds first automobile or some amazing concept cars & having over 700 cars is incredible for a PlayStation 2 game. The only downside I can think of is no damage model but the car models are so good that it doesn’t really matter. This game is a love letter to every automobile fan & my favorite racing game of all time.. This is a must-play game! Highly recommended to play on ps2, or if possible play it on an emulator for better graphics and an overall better expirience. Gran Turismo 4 offers an incredibly wide variety of cars (over 700 cars) ranging from the beginnings of car manufacturing to wacky concept cars. I dont want to write this anymore im to lazy. Never will a video game moment be as perfect as starting arcade mode in this masterpiece. The sea of beautiful to drive cars and gorgeous landscapes still amazes me. If you’re considering getting Gran Turismo 7, don’t bother. Enjoy your life and play GT4, and then the other ones after that. But mainly 4. Where else can one get a Daihatsu Midget with it’s own racing series?. Very fun simcade racer. There are better games though i would give it a 9.7 if i could do point ratings. If your idea of fun is driving a Fiat Panda round and round in circles, over and over again until you can afford a ""port polish"", then this is the game for you. Not quite as tedious as the previous game, but still nowhere near as much fun to play as it ought to be.. the best gt game that ever existed without doubt. everything about this game is goated. This is the best racing game of all time. No other racing game has been as revolutionary as GT4. Every single person who likes car racing should play this game.. Polyphony Digital hit a home run with this iteration of Gran Tourismo. In my opinion it is still the best game you can play on a Playstation 2. Not only does it look good but it runs at a rocksolid 60fps (NTSC) / 50fps(EU). Despite its obvious limitations, being a PS2 game it still holds up remarkably well. Abit of a downer is the limited amount of opponents is abit of a bummer but you can adjust the difficulty to your liking so it is not that much of a problem. The tuning is awesome, the amount of cars is awesome, the number of tracks is amazeballs, the physics are good, the music is good.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best racing game. I've played it as one of my first PS2 games, I play it event today on mys PS2, and I will always play it, it's that good. Graphics are good even by today ****, physic is on point, noting to say other than if one day my PS2 game collection burns to ashes it's the first game I MUST get again.. This game is from 2005 and there is to this day no game that even can get close to Gran Turismo 4. This is one game you need to play, even after all this years it holds up to racing games that have come out recently.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. By far my favourite game ever, the graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is just *chefs kiss* and even though my dad did most of the work when i was little i played through last week and can say it holds up as one of the best games of all time and the pinnacle of Racing games. The best racing game ever. Period! The cars, the tracks, everything. Perfect blend of physics and playability.. Probably best game ever made, for a racing game at least. The graphics are incredible for the console, it can go to 1080i if i am not mistaken. The selection of cars is mind blowing, together with the iconic tracks. The only weak part of the game would be the soundtrack. Not because its bad, but simply because its so quiet that you barely pay attention to it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Title: Gran Turismo 4 PS2 Version Review: A Masterpiece of Racing Realism 10 out of 10 Gran Turismo 4 is a racing game for the PlayStation 2 that completely redefines the genre by providing an unmatched level of driving realism and content richness. My interest in the game was immediately piqued by its meticulous attention to detail, large car collection, and engaging gameplay. In terms of racing video games, Gran Turismo 4 is unquestionably a masterpiece. Gran Turismo 4's beautiful graphics are one of its best features. Despite the technological restrictions of the PlayStation 2, the game nonetheless manages to provide stunning images. Every aspect of the autos has been painstakingly modelled and faithfully reproduced. Few other games at the time could compare to the stunningly realistic rendering of the tracks in terms of realism. Racing in this virtual world is a genuinely immersive experience, and the visual fidelity further enhances that. Gran Turismo 4's driving mechanics are superb, finding the ideal balance between usability and realism. Because of these differences in handling, each automobile has an own feel. The handling is immensely enjoyable, whether you're drifting around turns or keeping precise control at high speeds. Each race feels like an actual motorsport experience thanks to the developers' extraordinary efforts to generate realism. The vast car collection in Gran Turismo 4 is one of its best features. There is a car for every racing lover among the more than 700 available from different manufacturers. The range is wide-ranging and includes anything from classic vintage cars to contemporary supercars. Each vehicle is faithfully replicated, both in terms of design and functionality, demonstrating the incredible attention to detail. Gran Turismo 4's car collecting and customization joys are unmatched and will keep you entertained for countless hours. Gran Turismo 4's career mode features a rich and interesting advancement system. Starting with a low budget, you progress through various racing competitions, collecting credits to buy new cars and upgrade your current ones. The different races and difficulties make the gaming interesting and new. The sense of achievement you get as you advance and open up new events makes every triumph feel significant. Gran Turismo 4 also has a remarkable attention to detail. The game has realistic weather effects, day-night cycles, and damage modelling, which adds to the realism. The soundtrack is likewise well-chosen, with a variety of officially-permitted songs that enhance the racing experience. In conclusion, Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is a true gem in the racing genre. Its stunning graphics, impeccable driving physics, vast car collection, and deep career mode make it an unforgettable gaming experience. Even years after its release, it remains a benchmark for racing games. If you're a fan of racing or simply appreciate finely crafted games, Gran Turismo 4 is an absolute must-play. With its unmatched realism and sheer enjoyment, it deserves a perfect score of 10/10 on Metacritic.. This game is what got me started on cars, from playing non stop on my brother's PS2 to him helping me with the endurance races, these memories will always live on.. Great game, nothing to say at all. The graphics are fantastic for the time even on old CRTs with composite cables, and the amounts of cars and tracks present in this 18 year old game is mind-blowing by todays standards as well. Gran Turismo 4 is THE racing game of all time despite its old age. 11/10. Unfortunately, until this today, June 2023, there is no better game within this category. Gt 7 is a mere shadow in comparison. GT 4 is simply the best and looking at the trends in modern gaming, it will probably be forever.. It has no competition till this day. And if you have the chance of emulate it in pcsx2 with better resolution and mods that are coming in this year 2023(new textures and hq engine sounds) it will improve a lot!. The best racing game ever made, and the best Gran Turismo obviously, this is just unbeatable. I love GT4, it's the best **** game ever. FACK this 75 characters requirement SHlT JUST LET ME **** POST THIS SHlT GODDAMN IT!. I mean its the best game ever ever and ever!!! Lets make Gran Turismo 4 Good again!!! Justice for Gran Turisno 4!!!. This game is a perfect 10/10. This game is one i have never forgotten and have always loved. This game was the reason when my PS2 blew years ago i decided to fix it after close to 10 years of never touching it. Yes this game isn't as detailed in graphics as the modern games, but as a game that is almost 20 years old it has almost double and sometimes triple the cars modern games have. This game is challenging but fun and when you are stuck there is always a way to get through it. This is the racing game and from a 2005 game it is beautiful. The cars still look good, the tracks are amazing and unique and super fun. The game isn't ball busting punishing but gives a decent challenge. This game was the reason I love racing games, and no game in the series competes with it. And what racing game has 700 different cars you can drive ranging from one of the first motorized vehicles ever from 1886 to a 2022 Nike Concept car from 2005. This was also the first Gran Turismo game to have most to all of its tracks be based of real race circuits. And was the first to have the full Le Mans race circuit and also has the legendary Nürburgring as a drivable track. This game is amazing, Just watch the Iconic opening with Van Halen's Panama. This song and intro is so iconic it has been stuck in my head for over 13 years. And I will never forget the intro or the song because of this game.. I'm writing this review because even as an Xbox Gamer, this game is still amazing. I hope this game someday becomes available to play on the PS4 and PS5 (and maybe even on the PC officially), and it is unacceptable that this game is not available on those platforms. So please Sony, allow more people to play this game without having to pirate it or forcing them to search for a PS2 and a copy of GT4 that could be overpriced one day *cough* Pokemon Games *cough*.. Greatest racing (sim racing) game of all time, nfs got nothing on this ****. Gran turismo 4 was simply the racing SIM every other racing SIM wants to be of the early 2000s. Truly the most legendary driving game in existence. Gran Turismo 4 is the pinnacle of Racing games and one of the greatest if not the greatest PlayStation exclusive ever. I have so many happy memories of me as a kid playing this game and its truly something you must experience in your lifetime .From the music to the tracks and the car culture, even if you dislike cars this game will make you fall in love with them.. i actually busted a nut twice to this game and drank it because gt4 is so good and then busted again in the disk drive and broke my ps2 and had to get another one. Such a great game for its era. It really is ""The Real Driving Simulator"" !!. One of the best racing games of all times. The nostalgia might be strong with this one, but to this day it still holds up. Just can't praise it enough. An official remaster by Polyphony would be nice, however I can understand why adding content to the starving Gran Turismo 7 is a priority considering that GT4 graphics are still decent.. Hands down, the BEST Gran Turismo I've had. Never get bored of it. The amount of cars, and cars that were either easy to get or really hard to get, the game progression, decent graphics, decent soundtrack list, coupled with the most infuriating license tests, it has it all.. It's ****! No, seriously Play it And Install Mods Graphics On pcsx2 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////. The music of this game is just the best, can’t say it’s bad, not at all.. It’s not often the greatest games of all time get made. And sometime the best examples aren’t even from a genre you like. Everyday I’m glad I like racers and GT4 is perfection. GT4 is not a video game, it is not simply just a piece of software you run on a games console. Gran Turismo 4 is a work of art, a masterpiece of design, an avant garde of automotive celebration that has revolutionised the industry and touched the hearts of millions of young gamers. it has brought the thrill of driving, the appreciation of the automobile and the competition of racing to the masses in a beautifully presented package and yet it is not overly pretentious, it does not demand that you love cars but asks that you appreciate the engineering, the design and the spirit that goes into making an automobile. GT4 is a true Masterpiece #GT4Sweep. The pinnacle of racing games. From the kind of car you may have in your garage in real life, to Rally monsters of the 90's, and even LMPs, this game has a selection like no other of the era, and even a greater selection than most racing games today. The licenses help ease you into the games physics, giving scenarios to help you learn the feel of driving in GT4. But also have the silver and gold times for those hungrier for perfection. Then there is the simply unmatched number and types of events. Races reminiscent **** together on a Sunday, to 24 hour endurance events, to everything in between stand before you. The 100% speedrun for this game is 260+ hours. That should give you an idea of the sheer amount of content. And even then, you wouldn't have used every car. So you can go start again, completing the game without a single car having been reused even once. No racing game, whether a part of the Gran Turismo, Forza, Need for Speed, or any other series, can possibly match the accomplishments of this game from 2004. 100/10, a must play for all.. The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats! The Goats!. This game is meticulously crafted to be one of the best racing games of all time. With its cars, track list, gameplay, and progression, this game is iconic.. “Small things make perfection, but perfection is no small thing.” - Sir Henry Royce. really good even if i'm an xbox fan boy this game is the goat of racing games. This game is pure perfection. If you're struggling in any way shape or form throughout the miserable journey of life, you need to try Gran Turismo 4. Specialists conclude that Gran Turismo 4 is much more helpful than trained therapists at supplying a coping mechanism for your crippling depression. Buy this game, and play it. You will not regret it.. An great game and one must play! I have spent a great time with the photo mode.. This game is the best one along its series, GT2 is in 2nd. The endurance series so addictive and so many cars in this game, definitely 10/10!. One of the greats of the genre. Forza only just got tyre compounds in 2023 and this game had them 20 years ago.. The best racing game ever No need to stay on track, no story, pure racing except for the pace car and the licenses and the pink yaris. Anyway 10/10 would recommend. why is this game isn't on the must play tho?. This is the best racing game ever made, no other has come close to it's perfection. Not even the GREAT Crash Team Racing. Other racing games wish they were this good, and unfortunately for them. They NEVER will.. this game changed my life forever i used to think that it wasnt anything special until i played this with my portugues friend manuel and we became true car enthusiast (dont care about the spelling).

477.The Beatles: Rock Band,"This is my favorite Rock Band game, playing it with the Paul bass is also pretty cool. I'd love an awesome remake with even more songs. Just make more please, and don't change the guitar it was perfect.. In my opinion the best rock band game out there. I would recommend this game to newcomers of the Rock Band series. Great game for the family. DLC makes it even better. Get this game now!. And alas, The Beatles Rockband... for Xbox 360. Ok, If you've read my review for the Wii version, you know that I don't own it for Xbox 360. But, my uncle bought this before me, and that's where I got a chance to try it on Xbox 360. Same as the Wii... Studio recordings, Online gameplay, DLC, wonderful dreamscapes... The only difference is the graphics. The Xbox 360 really brings out the game with It's ""fab"" graphics and beautifully animated dreamscapes and characters (This includes the crowd). It will absolutely delight any Beatles fan out there. In the end, The Xbox 360 version receives an outstanding score of 10 from me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brilliant, Harmonix doing this , is like declaring doomsday to the rival Gh. The legendary and classic British band, The Beatles finally has his own video game adaptation. The best songs are included here, the old videos,photos was important to give new comers the opportunity to know this band.. Fun indeed, and entertaining for Beatle fans and newcomers alike. The games graphics and design are amazing (the opening cinematic is breathtaking). And the selection of songs is perfect: From big hits like Hard Days Night to rare gems such as Hey Bulldog; from power ballads such as Something, to hard rocker Helter Skelter. The games only flaw is being too short, forcing fans to download songs in order to extend the fun.. If you're a Beatles lover like me or even if you have a Guitar Hero controller like I have, you should get this. Amazing look-a-likes of the Beatles characters. I can't decide which Beatle needs improving on, it's great to look at from the early years when they all had the same black-haired style back in the early 60s to something of their preference in the late 60s. Sadly, there aren't enough songs (Well there are some good ones, but some of them are DLC) and the frame rate is somewhat spotty in the background (Not while the notes are coming down, which is pretty peculiar). However, to summarise it, good looks and a great learning curve in terms of difficulties. It's a pretty active and challenging musical game.",the best rock band game out there . great game for the family. DLC makes it even better . i would recommend this game to newcomers of the rock band series .
478.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising,"One of my favorite games of all time. The innovations are pretty interesting and make the game more enjoyable.. Somehow the developers manage to improve on perfection with this, the best military strategy game on any platform. One of those games I have completed multiple times and never, ever tire of.. An absolute classic that is full of strategy and charm. An excellent strategy game is indeed possible on the GBA!. Love it! An incredible strategy game, almost like chess, it made me fall in love with the entire genre of strategy games, I had lots of fun playing this as a kid. As good as the first game and is something that all turn based strategy fans will love. A massive improvement over the already-great original Advance Wars. It's been expanded in terms of story, graphics, characters, balance, and gameplay. One of my favourite games on the GBA.",the best military strategy game on any platform . a massive improvement over the already-great original Advance Wars . one of my favourite games of all time .
479.Return of the Obra Dinn,"It's a very strong 4 hour experience - just know your own limits and don't fret about missing out.. Dazzlingly effective gameplay hook. The mystery is engaging and the frame-by-frame piecing together of what happened to the Obra Dinn is never tedious and always interesting. The grimy art style contributes well to the mood. I got so into the experience that I started keeping a notebook full of clues and observations. Highly recommend.. The best detective game ever made. The only flaw in it, isn't really a flaw -it's a detective game, so it's inherently unreplayable. It's a one and done, but wow is that one time perfect.. This game is one of best one i have ever played. It is all based on you and everything is so satisfying, you find out the misteries of the obra dinn all by yourself and there is nothing like the feeling of when you finally get 3 right, I'd say that the only game that is better tha nit in this aspect is Outer Wilds. The art style is incredibly well done. Plase give this game a shot it will be worth it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game, the music, the story, the game mechanics and the art are all fantastic. the only problem is how the story is presented. my main goal through out the whole story was find out who everyone was. when i finally finished that, the game was over, and i didn't have time to understand the story fully, as i thought they were going to show the story in order at the end. that caused me to search it and watch it on youtube. now that i know how good the story is, the game definitely deserves an 8, but i wished they had showed us the full story before ending the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A deeply satisfying and fun puzzle game that is like none other. Some obscure solutions in finishing up the crew list, but other then that is a overall great experience. The overarching story is intriguing and has a few twists to uncover. The art style is also very unique and suits the game perfectly. Some of the scenes it places before you are beautifully detailed and a joy to explore.. The best detective game ever made and one of the masterpieces of the 2010s.. What will you get if you combine Lucas Pope and Sailing ship? BEST GAME EVER CREATED (after Minecraft). Loved it, replayed it, loved even more!. If you like the game Cluedo but want to try your hand at determining the fates of sixty crew and passengers on a 19th century East India Company vessel, Return of the Obra Dinn might be the game for you. If you have a morbid curiosity on the creative ways people can die or you enjoyed playing What Remains of Edith Finch this game should also appeal. Whether you enjoy the story or not really depends if you're content with less characterisation but are at home with the nautical setting. Frankly, I found the characters in Papers, Please and the Soviet-era politics more compelling but Return of the Obra Dinn was still enjoyable if only to experience a trip down memory lane thanks to its early Macintosh monochrome graphics.. One of the best game i have ever played, specially when you finish the book and rethink and manage the credits.. An incredible unique experience. I want more games like this. This game made me feel more like an actual detective than any detective game I've ever played.. A fantastic game made with great attention to historical details. What an interesting experience! The setting is great, I've always loved stories taking place on ships, and the mysteries themselves are so satisfying to unravel! The music sets the tone perfectly for each chapter, and I have listened to ""Soldiers of the Sea"" and ""The End"" soundtracks many times over, and I still cannot get enough of them, even though they are quite short. And this game also brought to mind some fond memories from my childhood, how I'd lay in bed at night with a bedside lamp on and read Jules Verne, and imagine the atmosphere of a maritime adventure in the faraway lands... And while the game reminds me of those times, unlike Jules Verne (or, rather, what I remember from Jules Verne's books, since it has been a long time since I've read one), I really like that 'The Return Of Obra Dinn' is critical of practices (and laws, for example, the insurance laws: how a murder is fined less than stolen cargo) of the marine of the English Empire. I like when stories are this aware of the historical times they are set in. Overall: a great experience!. A legendarily great game that does what all games should… tell a story and do it well. An amazing adventure-story game with a first-person exploration mechanics.From the very start your mission is simple… find out what happened to the crew… and how they died. But this task is not nearly as easy as it seems, as you must accurately determine who each body belongs to… and exactly how they died, from what, and by who if necessary. Without spoiling the story, it can only be said to get better and more bizarre as it goes on! A must-play if you love murder-mystery games, stylized games, thinking games, or want a casual game in general to play with an excellent story!. Well, it's a masterpiece. Pros.: - Story. - Audio. - Even visuals. - The concept and gameplay. Cons.: - Pity there is no full event film at the end when you solve the whole book. - Some visuals prevent from understanding what exactly is going on (like explosions). - Some causes of death are dual. Can be done both ways.. I have never played somethinglike this and I am sure I never will. I hope to loose my memory to play it again for the first time. very impressive . retro style have good atmosphere but make things difficult to identify . the story is well designed but still need your attention go get into it , or you may just uninstall the game very quick . somehow it is really a damn to identify spines or spear . being press to dead or being squeeze to dead by kraken's tail .. Niche genre but best game ever made about assessing an insurance claim. It's a little bit clunky in places yet transcends all its self-imposed limitations to be a wonderful example of piecing together clues and inferences, with the help of some guesswork. The only sadness is in realising you can only complete it for the first time once.. Got this recommended to me by my friend as breath of fresh air from modern AAA dev games. The game experience was truly unique. Indie devs are truly carrying the game rn,. Return of the Obra Dinn is a very original investigation game. It's set on an abandoned ship where the protagonist has to investigate what happened to the 60 people that were on board. You can do this by exploring the ship in a first-person view; during your exploration, you'll stumble accross many corpse, and every time you find one, your special power will let you listen to the last seconds of life of that person, and, after that, you'll be able to see and explore the surroundings of a static scene representing their istant of death. Starting with an almost blank book containing the ship map, some drawing of the entire crew, the list of people on board and little else, you cannot talk with anyone, examine object or read documents, and just looking at the scenes you'll have to notice a lot of details and make a lot of connections in order to understand who is who and what happened to them. Sometimes this process is very difficult and makes you feel lost, but with attention is possible to identify several characters, and excluding them from the people list will help identifying the remaining ones. The process is fun, the game will confirm your choices every time you get 3 of them correct, and when it happens it's extremely satisfying. The game has also flaws, it's short and not replayable, its graphics is stylish but sometimes confusing (and surely not the best you can find), the little area explorable and the lack of any interactivity with the environment let you wonder the potential that a similar game would have, if it wasn't a low budget production. In conclusion, Return of the Obra Dinn is a great investigation game, with an original and clever structure that will give you something fresh to play and a lot of satisfaction for completing it. It's not perfect and won't last long, but if you're curious to undersand how a ship with 60 people can disappear for 5 years, and then be found without a single person alive on board... well, you won't regret playing it!. This is a good age of independent games, and Return of the Obra Dinn delivers well. The basic premise is that of an insurance agent searching an old sailing ship, attempting to identify those aboard, and what happened to them. Essentially, a detective story, and it is done very well. Some cases are easier to solve than others, and I found some situations took more thought than others. Sometimes a little extra thinking goes in, and personally, I found that very rewarding. It's remarkably satisfying when you get it right. The graphics are interesting. On the surface, they seem simple, but they are very effective. If one monitor style doesn't suit you (the default is old Macintosh), there are other options that might appeal more. I found the default works fine, and given I am prone to migraines, but didn't have any issues with this game, I was relieved. There's quite a bit to this game, and it had more depth than I was expecting. The story drew me in, and if you like detective stories or mysteries, you'll probably like this. I've reached a stage where I've grown a little tired of many AAA games being flashy and pretty, even quite big, but lacking that soul, the element of good writing, interesting plots and just something a bit different to the standard ""destroy enemy, fetch item, sit through some Hollywood-style lacklustre dialogue"", so I'm finding the independent games offer something that older games tended to. In lieu of enormous budgets, special effects, bloated marketing budgets and buckets of hype, the independent arena has offered many games which just do things a little different. I think this is for the best, and Return of the Obra Dinn can certainly be added to the list of smaller (though there's a lot of meat to this one), more independent games which have these qualities. Yes, there'll always be a place for the big pricey hype machines (just as Hollywood films tend to deliver), but it's good to see independent works out there which offer something that simply throwing truckloads of cash can't achieve. And that's some soul. Some writing. Some results that don't insult your intelligence. More of these independent efforts, please. They're hitting the spot nicely.. The best thing I can say about Return of the Obra Dinn is that it is unique. The premise is that a ship with a crew of 60 had gone missing and has now resurfaced. You are given a personnel manifest and your task is to put a name to each corpse. Your only tool is a magic device that allows you to view a flashback of the moment each corpse died. To make things easier on you, the game will let you know every 3 correct matches you make (makes it way too easy IMO - should have added difficulty levels). What is unique about the game is that you do not have any sort of inventory to manage, or witnesses to interview, or puzzles to solve for unlocking new areas. All you have is a ship filled with dead bodies and your little flashback device. But don't mistake this as the game being hardcore ""bring your own notebook"" type game. The game takes care of all the legwork you could want - it will record names to persons matches you made (so in a flashback you can tell who is who), it will order the flashbacks from first to last, and it will give you a map so you don't have to remember anything. Everything is taken care of for you besides your one task - matching the name to the body. You'll be able to do this through various hints in the scenes. For example, you'll hear someone referenced by name, or you'll hear him speak a different language, or you'll see he is dressed different, or sleeps in special quarters. Lots of little things, a few of which are a bit contrived. Basically it is through guesswork and process of elimination you'll be able to win. To give you an idea of how this works, as an example in one flashback you'll see 3 men playing cards and speaking Russian. You check the crew manifest and confirm there are only 3 Russians on board. You see a funny hat next to hammock #41, then in another flashback you see one of the 3 men wearing the hat. Now you know he is #41 on the manifest, you can cross him off. The other 2 russians have different job descriptions - one works as a sailor the other as a deckhand. In yet another flashback you see one of the 2 scrubbing the floor - now, out of the 10 deckhands on the manifest, you know this is the russian speaking one. Cross him out. The sailor you can guess by process of elimination. Done. This is a more or less simple example, but that's essentially what you'll be doing all game for all 60 crew members. It's not exciting, but it isn't terrible either. An average game that has been exalted only for being unique compared to the regurgitated AAA slop that most every studio produces these days. One thing other reviewers aren't mentioning is just how morbid the game is. I'm not very squeamish, I've played other fantasy horror games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, but this game is particularly depressing. You will literally spend 90% of your playtime watching people die, hearing them beg for their lives, and all set to a funeral soundtrack. Not very fun.. this game was so phenominal. it is the most interesting puzzle game ive played with an amazing atmosphere. This game is just something else, Lucas Pope prove us, yet again, that you can tell a story in a totally different way and still deliver every single emotion intended. It's not a particularly hard game, but you gotta really put some energy in it sometimes if you want to finish it correctly. Honestly, there's not much more to say about this, the game speaks for itself and you must really feel this experience to understand it. If you like indie games or just looking for a different experience, this is a must-play.. An absolute masterful experience. That being said, it won't be for everyone and do your research beforehand. A great concept, interesting setting and unique mechanics make this a must.. Absolutely amazing soundtrack. Unique visual art style (that can be customized). Superb voice acting and sound design. Perfectly crafted story. The only downside (if you can even call it that) is its lack of re-playability.. if there's a good game here, it's buried under a ton of minutia and time-wasting transitions. when you get to a death scene you're forced to just sit and look at it for 30 seconds before the game lets you do anything else. and when the game points you do a new death scene, you first have to walk there, and then click on it, and then you're teleported back to the previous one, then have to walk there a 2nd time, only this time behind a slow-moving gas cloud thing. Repeat 60 times. these things serve no purpose other than to waste the player's time. you spend more time following ghost clouds around to places you've already been than actually ""playing"" anything in this game.. Why hasn't anyone made a game that completely rips this game off yet. I wish there was a whole genre based off this game.. The Return of the Obra Din is wonderfully creative and at times, maddenly confusing. I am no Whizz at puzzle solving (though I'd like to think I'm no dunce either), but Obra Dinn hits the sweet spot of being tough but reasonable for most of its puzzles. You are tasked with identifying a whole ship's worth of people and how they met their untimely demise and in this game, everything is a clue. You are forced to look out for minor details that can give you vital information. Sometimes you will notice what a person is doing to figure out what their role is, sometimes you have to notice what room they were in at a certain point in time. There is also the subject of accents which does give an indication of where they are from, unfortunately for me, I am unfamiliar with many European accents and so that line of deduction was largely out of my reach. Still, this is an ingenious way to create puzzles and it makes you feel super intelligent when you work out the identity of a person based on a detail that seem small, but easily noticeable once you figure out what you are looking for. Sometimes the game can feel a bit unfair though. I remember how I got stuck on one character in particular because of a comment made by one of the characters that totally mislead me (and most players I suspect) and there wasn't much that would later alert you that you were misled. The art style is also something to comment on as it is quite unique and works to give the ship and the tale that it tells with this dark atmosphere. I'm a fan of it as it is much more memorable than the high fidelity look many games try to achieve. Overall, this is a game that is worth checking out if you're into puzzles that require deductive reasoning.. When you finish this you just wish you could use a time travelling pocket watch in real life, just to go back and do it all again.. The best puzzle game I have ever played (and I hate puzzle games in general). Pros: * Perfect 1bit art style. In general, that's a game made by a single artist who had both a singular vision and a knowledge of his craft. (Lucas Pope did the story, the music and programming all by himself.) * You feel like a real detective (even more so than in Her Story which is also great). Also, I didn't google anything to complete the game. It was very satisfying to solve everything by myself. * It runs on my M1 Macbook as a breeze. Cons: * none. Super unique game, from the gameplay to the aesthetic and even the story telling. It's basically a giant puzzle, trying to sort out who everyone is and what happened to them. So if you like puzzle games definitely try this. There isn't a lot of information to go off of either and at first seems ridiculously hard. But eventually through process of elimination you'll get there. Also the sound design and sound track are awesome, voice acting is solid.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For the first time, I played a game for 12 hours without a break. I've never been bored. Art design and music fascinated me. The story is just like a novel. I didn't want the game to end. But when I finished the game, I didn't feel smart. The game makes you think, but the solution is very easy to find. I wish it had a more complex plot. More variety of tips. More plot twists. I just had a hard time finding 2 or 3 people. Honestly, I wish it was a little harder. But it was still very good. Definitely play it. A truly different experience.. Return of the Obra Dinn is a retro-styled puzzle-mystery game. You play as an insurance adjuster, going onto a ghost ship and trying to figure out what happened to everyone on board. Along with your job assignment, you are given two tools: a journal and an ominous looking pocket watch with a skull on its face. The game has a striking visual theme – it is entirely in black and white, and is designed to look “old”, and yet it is very obvious that the 3D models in it are of much more modern vintage. The “retro” deliberately obscures some details – like color – and makes the entire game look like old 19th century drawings found in books – examples of which appear inside your journal. The journal serves as the player’s guide through the game. It has a complete list of all 60 members of the crew, along with some drawings that depict the crew in various scenes. Each crew member or passenger’s face appears once in these drawings (with a couple deliberate exceptions), but there is no connection between the images and the names. The goal of the game is to figure out who each of the people were, connecting the names to the images, and determine the ultimate fate of everyone onboard the Obra Dinn during its final voyage. The pocket watch is the central conceit of the game – when you approach a corpse, you can activate the pocket watch to be brought to the moment of that corpse’s death. This allows you to hear what was going on in the lead up to the death, and see (in a still image) what is going on when they die, and try to make inferences about how they died, who or what killed them (if anything), and who they actually were. As the game progresses, you fill in a series of sequential events in the journal, split up into ten chapters. Each pair of pages corresponds to a single scene viewed through the watch. In some cases, some people “disappear” from the story after a certain chapter, and you have to figure out why – what happened to them? Did they leave the ship in some way? Fall overboard? Die in such a way that they left no corpse on board? Early on, this is pretty simple – people will say their names or positions, or cry out at each other. But as the game goes on, things get increasingly difficult. Some people are only referred to by name in other scenes. Sometimes, someone will be injured, then die some time later, requiring the player to find the scene where they were originally wounded. Sometimes, people are injured, but pull through and recover, causing them to reappear in later scenes. After viewing nine of the chapters, you are invited to leave the Obra Dinn. But at this point, there’s a good chance you’ll have filled in only about half the names on your list, maybe less. At this point, you have to start getting increasingly clever – many people are never actually named or ranked even once in the entire game, requiring you to infer their identity from their uniform or attire, their accent (the nationality of each of the crew members is noted in the crew list), who they spend their time interacting with (for instance, the captain and mates have stewards, while people like the surgeon and carpenter have mates who serve as a helper), and various other things. This is a game about taking in all sorts of details, and making educated guesses and inferences based on information. Oftentimes, seemingly inconsequential details will actually give away someone’s identity, and various aspects of the journal itself can even give hints. The game does a very good job of getting the player all the information they need, but doing so subtly; exploring these scenes is rewarded, as is noticing various things going on in the background, listening to voices and accents, and looking at what people are doing and who they hang out with to try and figure out what their jobs might be. By the end of the game, you will likely be feeling quite smart for having figured it all out – and because the game does play fair, it is possible to figure everything out, often in a couple different ways. The game also assists you by “locking in” correct guesses, but only in sets of three – that is to say, if you correctly identify three people’s names, visual identity, and cause of death (including who/what killed them, if anything), the scribbled in information is replaced by typeset information, allowing you to gradually whittle down your list of unknown people with confidence. That's not to say that the game is perfect - going back through memories at the end of the game is kind of a pain due to lack of fast travel between them, the audio associated with a memory can only be replayed by exiting and re-entering it, and the plot is servicable, not amazing. But it is still a good game, and one I'd recommend to anyone who likes feeling clever for noticing minor details and making inferences.. Pretty good story told visually with almost no words. Also an actual detective game, everything can be a hint. Locations of people on the map, clothing, who hangs out with who, etc. Doesn't hold your hand either. Go and figure stuff out by just context and the frozen moment of death. Very unique.. This game is a masterpiece. Music, game design, visuals... top-notch overall!. One of the most original games I have ever played. I loved the story and the graphic style is great. The mechanics are a bit confusing at first but definitely worth digging in.. Lucas Pope has struck Papers Please gold again. Obra Dinn is a detective game (dare I say the best one I've played) in which you, an insurance investigator, must figure out how everyone on a ship (The Obra Dinn) disappeared. It's a very clever game, although some of the assumptions you have to make may seem a bit far fetched. It has virtually no replay value, so try to savour the game as you play it. I honestly don't want to spoil anything, so I'll leave the review as it is here. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a clever detective game that makes you feel smart.. Return of the Obra Dinn - 9.9 / 10 - {I recommend more than the size of the seven seas, you need to play at least once in your life} The game is [Mysterious, Atmospheric, Challenging, Engaging, Artistic, Unique, Impressive] => Pros: + Complex history of unraveling; + Atmosphere with unique and tense graphic art; + Unique research dynamics; + Everything is mysterious; + Each character is unique and has its own story; + Exceptional soundtrack; + There is a possibility of the replay factor after zeroing the game, because the player forgets everything after a few months; => Cons: - There is a small range of information that is practically impossible to find by the scenes accessed, and you need to go on the basis of ""guessing"" until you get it right, which is a minimal problem compared to the masterpiece that this game is as a whole; => VERDICT: The Verdict is that Return of Obra Dinn is one of the best games ever made in history for several factors, having a unique art, an immersive atmosphere that will involve you a lot in the scenes, a perfectly characterized soundtrack, and a story of countless mysteries that wins over many series and films. The dynamics of exploring the scenes of death, the photos, and navigation of the book, everything is so well done that it makes this game not just any masterpiece, but a that should be marked in history, like Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. It will make you use your ability to deduct at all times, and makes you understand what it is like to be a detective like Sherlock was, but on a ship, where there is only you, your book, your ""special"" compass, and a sea of ​​mysteries ranging from the shallow to the most obscure. The point is, are you able to get on that ship with nothing, and leave with everything? Only you can find out, so embark on Obra Dinn, and discover what the depths of the ocean hide from us all.. Return of the Obra Dinn is a really beautiful game. The first time you look at it you may say that it looks like some game from the past century and well… you are right. Obra Dinn is a detective mystery game with retro graphics and surprisingly the graphics is one of the strongest things about it. But let’s start from the beginning. In 1803 The Good Ship “Obra Dinn” was lost at the sea. Five years later it approach the Falmouth port without any living member of the crew. You are a detective whose job is to identify every member of the crew, discover the way they’ve died or disappear and finally find out what actually happened on the ship. The thing is you have a certain artifact – a pocket watch which can show you a memory of the moment when a person died, if you have their corpse obviously. It makes the whole investigation very interesting. So for the first five hours or so you explore the ship and the memories but for me and probably for most players the first glimpse of the crewmembers’ deaths wasn’t enough to identify all 60 of them. So after you saw everything, you explore the memories and the ship for clues once again when you see the whole picture (because the memories are not given to you chronologically) and you identify the people to complete the Obra Dinn’s story and I have to admit that all of it is just amazing. Walking simulator mixed with murder mystery is just great. One thing I can say is not so good is the fact that there are lots of people in the crew that are shown maybe in one or two memories which makes identifying them a guess. I can truly recommend Obra Dinn to people looking for some detective mystery or some retro styled game. It’s a great game based on a fact that it was made by a single person. I loved it and I hope you will too.. Ok, take pen an pencil, listen with the mouth open the stuning music of this game, and start thinking. It also has a very good story and an interesting and misterious setting... so. If you want logic puzzles or adventure stories with very well written characters... this is your game.. Gaming perfection. The Return of the Obra Dinn is a triumph of gameplay that elevates minimalist graphics and voice acting into a haunting and unforgettable horror/puzzle game. The frustration with each puzzle piece is only matched by the satisfaction of answering each grim detail of the ship's fate. Every gamer should play this game. It's one of the best puzzle games ever made.. This game is The masterpiece!! Somehow its simple mechanics and ideas create truly sensational experience, which you've never felt before. Just Bravo!. Once in a while a masterpiece is born. This is one of those times and masterpieces.. For what this game is trying to be its just about perfect. It gave me such a great detective feel and trying to figure out what happened to all 60 of the crew is for the most part the right amount of challenge, but some of the more minor characters are ridiculously hard to pin down. The music and artstyle are so good and a big part of why I was so into this game. This is such a creative game and I loved almost every minute of it.. I went into this game completely blind, and boy was I surprised by it. I loved solving the mystery of this game and finding out what happened. I greatly recommend this game to people who just want to sit down and solve a grand mystery.. A- Unique and magnificent art style makes the game one of the best experiences of gaming. If you like puzzle games its a must play but still good for other people too. Recommended.. This game is pretty much a new genre of detective game. Here you have to use your observations and listening skills and some deductive reasoning to piece together the name and role of everyone who died on the boat. While doing this you will relive the entire disastrous last voyage of the Obra Dinn. I highly recommend it if you like puzzle solving games.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. A truly new concept of story telling. It is pretty hard to figure out without help at times. It **** the graphic is so limited though, because it often relies on visual details to solve fates.. My game of the year for 2018. Obra Dinn is one giant detective game that is a blast to solve.. I mean, this sherlock holmes style game is good and all that but, Im the only one that dont enjoy this artistic and visual part?. Still, recommended.. Too hard and confusing for me. Interesting art style but that's really it. Uninstalled quickly.. Original, violent, mysterious story with great voices and atmosphere. It's weird looking and empty at start. We get a book from a doctor to solve what happened to the crew. Then we spend a huge amount of time running around scenes and looking for details, hidden clues, guessing and deducting by selecting names and fates from a list of options. It can be frustrating and annoying if we don't see any clues, hopefully there are various details that matter and help.. The lore behind the brilliant idea of this game is a masterpiece. The soundtrack is incredible and fits perfectly in every situation. The mechanics used in this game are never seen in any kind of detective game, and with its exclu","it's a detective game, so it's inherently unreplayable . the only flaw in it, isn't really a flaw - it's a detective game . the story is intriguing and has a few twists to uncover ."
48.The Last of Us Remastered,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still one of the best stories ever made in video games with brilliant acting. Beautiful graphics and beautifully made world in a decay. Great sound and haunting music that fits the game and comes in the best moments. Nothing revolutionary about the gameplay but a good mix of action, stealth and a survival mechanics. These are the games that stay remembered for a long time.. This game is one of the best i've ever played, if it has a solid gameplay without being exceptionel, the fight succed to be stressfull enouth for putting you the shoes of the character. Once that is said we can talk about the main qualities of the game what it made him so great, it is of course its story, the writting of the character and the soundtrack which are fantastic.. Remains to be Naughty Dog's last game to NOT focus on ""Modern Audience"" agenda that Infected the Games Industry in the late 2010s-2030s. (Sure, we got a hint of what was to come via DLC: Left Behind.) A historic artifact of what could be achieved when a western developer doesn't have ""Modern Audiences"" agenda in mind when creating a game.. This is by far the best game I have ever played. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, and the music are all just perfect. Nothing to add more this is just a must play game. The most beautiful game I've ever **** story is so touching, sad, beautiful and melancholy, it left a deep impression on me and I still can't get over it...Naughty Dog has created a marvel, endowed with unforgettable characters, to whom we become enormously attached... the development of the relationship between Joel and Elie, the sacrifices that each makes for the other, and the love and benevolence that each of them bears, which we players feel during the **** gamplay is exceptional, too: you're glued to your screen, you don't want to let go of the controller because it's so pleasant, the handling is perfect, and the atmosphere is also very heavy, creating a kind of constant pressure that accompanies us throughout the **** for the script, there's nothing to say, it's mind-blowing... right from the start, it's a slap in the face, a plot twist here, a plot twist there, sometimes we go from joy to sadness, other times from sadness to joy, every new encounter and every farewell, every moving scene that leaves a lasting impression, every shiver that brings tears to our eyes, that's The Last Of Us... Finally, I'd like to mention the unforgettable ending, an ending unlike any other, which makes us think, which paralyzes us for a moment, accompanied by a breathtaking soundtrack... Whether we agree with Joel's choice or not, we understand him, because we've lived this adventure by his side, because we know that these same humans have stolen from him the person dearest to his heart, because we know what he has endured and what he has shared with Elie, and finally, because we know that he has found meaning in his life thanks to her, so we understand **** Last Of Us is the first game to touch me so deeply and to make me shed a tear... My favorite game...a 20/20 masterpiece.. Naughty's last good game because the 2nd one is trash! The only thing that saves it is the gameplay and violence.. The absolute definitive version, as it keeps its artstyle from the PS3 and enhances it. Includes the DLC, and is easier to play because of PS5 and backward compatibility and how this variant is more frequently able to be found as its a game that you can still find PS3 copies of, but remastered might be just for you....... plus its also the Last of us. What ever that means to you is ok, but as a port its perfect. especially since it was cheaper then the one on PS3 at launch and still is with renewed and used copies. brilliant.. When i played The last of us for the first time in my life in the year 2014, i was still a young boy 12 years of age. Back then i didn't really understand the concept of narrative driven games or quite frankly what i should feel towards the medium i was playing. Back then i just played it for fun, not paying attention towards the narrative ore the beauty that The last of us is, i didn't experience it the way it should ore was intended to be played, fast foward a few years towards 2017, i picked up the game to play through it a second time, but this time i was going to pay more focus on what the game really was about and take it all in, and oh man did i do that, this game is just a near Perfect game, altough the gameplay was a bit one layered(basic) repetitive without much contrast, the narrative and visuals delivered perfectly, And if we are beeing honest, Tlou is about the narrative. The dynamic between the two protagonist is just perfection, there connection they slowly build throughout the game is heartbreaking and at the same time beautiful to see, a really emotional scary and brutal game, the brutality stems from the world they live in, and the things they have to do in order to survive, in a scenario like theirs i think we wouldn't be as different so that makes it even more scary in a way. I also had alot of fun with the multiplayer Factions, i put in countless nights with my brother and buddy's. Man i kinda miss those days, would've really liked it if they made Factions 2 but they scrapped the idea, huh...maybe in the future, but anyways, fantastic game everyone should experience this game at least once. SCORE: 9.5. The original ""The Last Of Us"" is one of those masterpieces that gets created only once every many years. Beaytufylly rendered setting, amazing story, amazing characters, and a lot of depth in both the gameplay and the story. There's not a lot to say about such games cause everything is just so good, it's useless to get into details.. Just an absolutely fantastic game, with fantastic characters that unfortunately were betrayed in part 2.. Remastered of 2014 later for ps4 much better than original, cleaner graphic, more polygons, better interface, recomented to play that one if you don't have a ps5.. One of my favorite childhood games ever, great music, great gameplay, great enviroment, in fact great in everything, I hope the naughty dog continues to do these exciting series.. Incredible and emotional story. One of the best story driven games out there.. There are many great video games like the RDR, GOW and the ghost of tsushima but the only best game of all time is ""TLOU"". 2024 - Still the best game I've ever played. Sound, gameplay, story and other things 10/10. Gameplay 10/10: Gameplay is really nice and easy to get used to. Nice use of weapons, nice movement around the terrain and all interactions are smooth. Playing as either Joel or Ellie, choosing a noisy or a stealth approach is really enjoyable. Graphics 10/10: Perfect. Nice buildings and environment. Beautiful details around the dystopic world. Dead or alive are well made and the locations are awesome from every point of view. World 10/10: A lot of different locations that doesn't look similar to each other. Exploration is a must not just for the rewards you are going to get but to enjoy every little detail it has to offer. Story & Characters 10/10: One of the best stories ever made from the very beginning. A really emotional journey with 2 great protagonists. Everyone you meet in your journey is important for the story build up and their side stories are also interesting. A mind blowing finale.. My favorite game ever and so damn close to perfection. The characters, acting, worldbuilding and dialogue were absolutely incredible not to mention maybe the greatest prologue in fiction ever. Some small moments of plot convenience now and then but nothing too bad compared to the sequel. Even the gameplay which a lot of people think is the weak point of this game is great to me with the scarcity of ammo being so well done. Play the remastered and not the remake to get the unfiltered version of the story too without any graffiti removal and hospital changes.. I didn’t have the chance to play it back in the PS3 days, but when I bought my PS4, it was the first game I played, and wow, it was amazing. For its time, The Last of Us brings a formula that, while simple, works wonderfully and, in my opinion, laid the foundation for the games of the new generations of PlayStation, leaning heavily into the cinematic side.. It's an iconic landmark in gaming history. You feel for everyone in this journey of survival and going the lengths to protect those you love.. In essence, this is the same The last of us, I don’t understand why the game was called Remastered since I don’t see any significant changes, the game hasn’t gotten any worse, the creators have improved the graphics a little and changed the interface a little, and most importantly, they’ve transferred the game to a new console . I give it a 9 because I expected big changes in the game. I've never played a game like this. A story that surpasses the plot of thousands of movies, a character that brings a main character aura in every aspect, the soundtrack, atmosphere, gameplay, and the suspense that surrounds this post-apocalyptic universe are certainly what attracts me the most about the game. For me, The Last of Us easily fits into the top 10 best games in the history of gaming.. The Last Of Us has THE best story of all time with every single character having depth to them and every death having meaning. To add on to that, I genuinely had to watch my ammo counter in this game because of the way you get bullets in this game, this is the only game I’ve played to do that and I wish more games did it. The backpack feature was really solid and the scenes around you are very impressive. Incredible work from Naughty Dog. 10/10. The story of this game is amazing, the characters, the zombies, the world but it can be a little clunky at times and glitch but that is just one small problem in a amazing game that turns out to be one of my favorite zombie pieces of media. Oh man, simply impeccable, a true masterpiece. I don't have many words to describe this game; the narrative is absolutely magnificent. The resource management, the constant tension, every detail is exceptional. If it weren't for this game, we wouldn't have the marvel that was Part 2.. whilst i really like the story, characters and the theme of this game i do not like to play it, slow sections to an already very long game kills pacing in this game also all of the braindead puzzles coupled with the fact that the third person shooting is not my favorite makes this a long an almost draining experience at times. its weird i agree that its overrated only in terms of gameplay and puzzles but i will defend its story. I think i like this game because for a cinematic game it isnt that long only 10 hours. The Last of Us is a landmark in video game storytelling and design. Its compelling narrative, well-developed characters, and atmospheric world combine to create an unforgettable experience. Despite some linearity and repetitive elements, the game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The emotional journey of Joel and Ellie is one that resonates deeply, making The Last of Us a must-play for fans of narrative-driven games. It stands as a testament to the power of video games as a medium for storytelling, offering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Literally the best game for me so far. I think “The Last of Us” has only one drawback - it ends. Great story, memorable characters, interesting gameplay are only a small part that makes TLOU a masterpiece. Must played!. The absolute best game ever. It will stay with you forever. You fall in love with the characters and story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you are reading this review you might be wondering whether to play The Last of Us Remastered, the PS4 version (which does play on the PS5) rather than the overpriced The Last of Us Part 1, the PS5 remake. Yes, it's fine, it plays well with good graphics and gameplay. No need to get the PS5 version. But the game is overrated, in my opinion. Everything is so so and predictable. Go to new location where we will be saved! Oh no, bad guys and zombies here! Rinse and repeat over and over until the conclusion. But, the payoff is just interesting enough to complete. Don't waste too much time and effort on it.. Easily one of the best games ever made, even considering the patterns of 2024 on. The best plot and best character development in any game history. Best game ever, the story and the narration are just so good, so many emotions playing this... visuals from art direction to technical work are amazing, and the gameplay is very good too, well balanced and fair. 10/10. unbelievable game theres not much wrong with this game and i cant really think of any flaws if i had to, toput it simply it changed the formula of playstation games's storytelling and provided big success for playstation.This game deserves its acclaim because of it's phenomenal character,storytelling,gameplay and fantastic **** you havent played it yet go buy it and play it now you wont regret it. What I admired about The Last of Us was the way it took the generic soulless zombie craze and tried to breath new life into it. The way Joel’s story of bringing a kid across a mushroom-zombie infested U.S. manages to be compelling and create genuine moments of emotion. Gameplay on the other hand is extremely lukewarm. It doesn’t ruin the game, but in comparison to what other zombie games offer it’s in desperate need of some seasoning. Enemy variety is extremely lacking, which shows in mass when the game has you playing as Ellie. It’s at that point I realized the gameplay doesn’t have enough mileage to put this game in 9 to 10 out of 10 range. It’s fortunate that this game is extremely well paced and doesn’t feel the need to pad out its run time. Overall, The Last of Us is a story that I would recommend checking out.. Its well i mean is a great game(GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG) but i really dont like the ending with that massacre. It's a good game but too overhyped. There is a lot of much better games out there. Still one of better Playstation exclusives.. Amazing story. Fantastic soundtrack that sets the mood. Combat and gameplay is really good.. What a game, still in 2024. The gameplay is simple but effective, the athmosphere is neat, the story is organic from the beginning. This game simply does not leave you intact nor indifferent, and that is a mark of greatness.. Basic take but this might be one of the greatest games ever created. The gameplay is so underrated and not as appreciated as it should be for being so enjoyable. A legendary title made even more impactful in its remastered form. A must-play for its story and presentation.. My friend recommended this game to me back in the day and wasnt really into it It didnt feel like anything special But I was wrong this game is my fav game of all time cant wait to play the remake. Unpopular oppinion but i dont like this gameI have played for 4 or 5 hours and try it out a few years later bu - Noi dont like such kind of (filmy games). Funges, made great story to play with tconsol, quiate, silent, the fight, the fear,greatness in this game make me musueing. What a freaking masterpiece the narrative, score, and atmosphere perfection. Joel’s character is outstanding. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The last of us is one of the best games I’ve ever played. Incredible story.. This is the greatest game I have ever played and will probably always will be. While I have different feelings for the multiplayer, the base game is the entire game to me and this why I am giving it this rating.. Another patch for permission from Sony for money. I have already talked about the game many times. Deaf mediocrity. Amazing game! Top contender for best game I have ever played. Story/graphics mind blowing!. One of my favorite games ever. I've replayed it so many times and it never gets old.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A must play for anybody who loves story driven games. Absolutely terrific story telling, paired with good gameplay, taking its time with a mix of action sequences and quiet moments to get to know the characters and keep the story going.. should definitely play, what a amazing exclusive platform game. would replay it. Amazing story. Amazing gameplay. Great graphical remake. Best game I own. Needed 75 characters. one of, if not the best story game i’ve ever played. ellie and joel’s character development is so good, i wanted to cry. joel is a very closed off person. at the start of the game, he would lash out when people tried to get him to talk about his feelings. but by the end of the game, he was telling stories about his daughter to ellie. i’m a **** for father daughter relationships, and found family. this game pulled on my heart strings a lot.. Would be the best game mankind has ever played if it was made with the gameplay of Last of Us Part 2. I feel that this masterpiece is more than a video game. While spending time with this game, you will be at a point where your emotions and logic collide. You feel that you have to deal with the situation logically, but your emotions will affect you. If it doesn't have the best story among video games, it has one of the best stories among video games of all time.. One of my favorite games. Naughty dog only create remasters in last time but this one was a great game.. The best game I ever played! Im very happy now when I finally play this game!. Despite playing this game on a PlayStation 4, it still displayed astounding graphics comparable to those of a PlayStation 4 Pro. As I possessed a PlayStation Slim, my console worked diligently, emanating a sound reminiscent of a launching rocket. Nevertheless, the gameplay proceeded flawlessly without any disruptions. Having missed the opportunity to experience The Last of Us upon its initial release, due to my aversion to frightening games, this version provided a more subdued experience, which greatly suited my preference.. Really Good story Really Good Graphics Really Good Gameplay but there is some repeated tasks. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. (Tip: long lists of 10 out of 10 reviews are a sure-fire indicator of fake reviews.) This game is seriously overhyped, why I don't know. It is okay to play if you feel like a relaxed walk through, but the sudden onslaughts of ""clickers"" are really unpleasant. It's actually just really, really boring, with really simple gameplay, and unoriginal too.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a game. The story is incredible. NaughtyDog have an incredible talent for doing what no other company seems to be able to do: create realistic dialogue in video games. Every character feels real, the environment is alive. It's easier to explain a moment from the game than just tell you how it felt. So I like to break games. I like to try doing dumb things to figure out how much the devs playtested their game and possibly break it. In the first five minutes there are some guards. I ran into them to see what they would do, they pushed me away. Fair play, the devs actually thought somebody might do this. I ran into them again. They pushed me away again. One more time just for luck. They pushed me back and shot me after saying a voiceline. This is what a AAA game should be. The level of care the devs show is fantastic and this is not an isolated incident. The story in the game is so good that I don't want to say anything about it. Just know there are no wasted story beats, the characters are thought about and the soundtrack that scores it is incredible. I cared for Ellie so much by the end of the game, the voice acting is of the utmost highest character and Gustavo Santaolalla's score is haunting and enchating. Sometimes every part of the game lines up to create something truly incredible. There aren't many games that I would call a masterpiece, but this is one of them.. if tlou has a million fans, i’m one of them if tlou has 1 fan, that’s me if tlou has no fans, i’m no longer alive. A post apocaliptic Game,i better Say the Best! It's so **** awesome the history the fights The development of The characters and the graphics!. Loved following Ellie and Joel and how they grew to care for each other. Great gameplay which had me hooked on for weeks. Characters really stood out. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. A solid remaster of an absolute masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the story pulls you in and doesn't let go. even the gameplay is great, the game feels like Dishonored because it's also possibly more immersive.. I've played this game more than 5 times, from ps3 to pc, and I can definitely say that this is the best game I've played. The story of Ellie and Joel shocked me to the core. Anyone who hasn't completed this masterpiece yet, I advise you to go through it, you won't regret it.. Very good game, the best recomedation is that i play this game 4 hours every day. I Love the history. masterpiece, one of the best games ever made. Last Of Us is a outstanding game. With amazing performances and a immersive world. The story is it's true strong point as you see Ellie and Joel's relationship grow as they go on a long Journey against all odds. Gameplay is solid and intense.. This is the game that made me fall in love with video games, and the details, and the love, that developers put into their games.. You can start this game with zero knowledge of the franchise without expecting anything, and you will be surprised.. What can I say that hasn't been said already, incredible. Oddly enough, this game did not become my favorite. It is good, very high quality, beautiful, dramatic, sad, and can make you cry. It has an amazing soundtrack that still gives me goosebumps. However, she lacks something to become my favorite.. The narrative, the characters and the gameplay are perfect. played.. A must-play. Beautiful story in a growing relationship of a father-daughter dynamic in an apocalyptic setting. The combat is basic, but works for the type of game and the stealth is engaging because of the tense atmosphere and dangerous setting the game takes place in. You meet great characters along your journey, the emotional beats satisfy, and the ending is brutally poetic.. Story wise and gameplay wise, there isn’t much I can criticise in this game. It looks wonderful and the narrative stays with you forever. But it’s a bit too merciless and stressful to me, and the game offers very little in terms of alternative playstyles.. One of the best games of all time.. Muy Buen Juego, con los enemigos precisos y en los momento necesario, una historia mas que interesante para refleccionar, pero gran juego, historia, sonido, musica y muy abanzado para el 2013 en la ps3 super recomendable Very Good Game, with the right enemies and at the necessary times, a more than interesting story to reflect on, but great game, story, sound, music and very advanced for 2013 on the PS3super recommended. A masterpiece as the original. I can’t rate it 10 because of real retro compatibility existed this game would not be necessary. Still a very good game in which I have spent many hours. One of my favorite games of all time! Still remember the day I was stuffing my face with papa murphys during the final level. Good times.. On my first playthrough, I didn't really like this game, but after playing through the second part, I realized that the first part does a great job of leading players up to what will happen in the second part.. Very terrible writing, gameplay ****. If you like watching movies this game is for you as there is more cutscenes then gameplay.. The Last of Us is not a video game, it's an art! No other game has made me feel like the Last of Us, this game makes me feel at home. While this might not be a game with the best gameplay, story or characters it's definitely one of the best and all the combination of a memorable story, well written characters, emotional music and unique environment makes a perfect game for me which will always have a special place in my heart.. It’s the same scores that have it in ps3 that’s mean when ever you play this game legendary thanks Sony for this masterpiece. .........................Perfect..!!! ...................................... This is one of the best games I ever played.Thanks to the company that created it for all the emotions.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The plot is just WOW. I really was torn apart at the end of the game. The gameplay felt a bit old (understandable) for me in 2020 but the game is must play. What a beautiful, beautiful game. Perfect storytelling, great mechanics, the game feels too ''same'' sometimes but still, one of the most special games I've ever played.. One of the best games ever created, it excels in the story/storytelling department. This is an example of how games can exceed tv shows and movies in that department, if they're are given the right tools and enough time.. One of the best Playstation exclusive games. Story is great, gameplay is great, characters are great. Perfect game. Really good post-apocalyptic game. Absolutely not the best game in the world but it's a masterpiece. Gameplay is really nice and flows like water, the game on harder difficulties makes you really feel how scarce resources are in the world. One of the best atmoshperes in a game ever created. Everyone should try this game.. My scores: Graphics: 10 Sound: 10 History: 10 Gameplay: 10 Worldbuilding: 10 Innovation: 10 Characters: 10. What a game. The story is amazing, the game play is really fun, great acting and voice acting. I can't praise this game enough. Flawless game, a true masterpiece.. My first contact with The Last of Us. Amazing! A piece of art, and I really think everyone should give it a fair chance.. The game's narrative is absolutely enthralling, going well beyond what I anticipated. Despite my initial reservations about it being overhyped, it proved me wrong. The gameplay mechanics feel incredibly satisfying and well-executed. A stellar example of how to revitalize a beloved classic.. My favorite game on the PS4 by far. The story and gameplay had me pulled in from the beginning and that never changed. It felt like I was playing a movie. Fantastic.. I'm always a bit hesitant to rate a game a 10. In fact, I've never done it before. But The Last Of Us simply wowed me. Writing this review about a year after playing the game and I still catch myself recalling key moments in the game. Challenging, captivating, and gut-wrenching. The cutscenes meld seamlessly with gameplay. Play this game.. Playing this game made me realize that I might be suffering from severe daddy issues.. My all time favorite game, remaster, remake, original, DLC and all. Seriously Make time to play, by any means... The story is definitely worth playing, and the title itself on the list of games is a mustplay. However, I don't think the gameplay is anything special. The system of collecting raw materials and obtaining weapons from them does not appeal to me with its simplicity. The stealth nature of the game seems boring to me.. One of the things that you're should know in this game is the perfect story of it so let's talk about the gameplay The shooting and stealth mechanics are totally great and it does have a really good replayment material one of the best games I played probably. The classic that redefined game storytelling and led to one of the best shows ever made. The game is not just about end of the world and zobies, it's about joel & ellie. So, after a good... Idk how many years, I finally got around to playing the last of us (TLOU) and it was spectacular. I loved almost everything. The world and story is so interesting and exciting to explore. The characters are also really interesting. Not only Joel and Ellie (The protagonists ), but also the other survivors and how this apocalypse has affected them. The most important aspect, the gameplay, is also really great. It's not too challenging, but not too easy too play either. The only problem I had was that some stealth locations were too open and it was basically impossible to sneak around. Other than that, an amazing spectacular game that everyone should play some time. Ps: This has been edited and was not played on July 21st 2023, but instead April 18th 2023. Played this game for the first time on my PS4 over Christmas break. Undeniably an unforgettable experience. Powerful story, amazing characters and the visuals are still amazing when considering the weakness of the system this was played on. If you have a chance to play it, do it. Keep in mind, this is a slow playing, story driven game, not a first person shooter. lol. It's like playing a movie. If you have a system more powerful than a PS4 (PS5 or PC), I recommend you play the newer Last of Us Part 1 remake. PS5 is the nicest to play on as PC needs so much more horsepower to overcome intrinsic hardware in the PS5.. A true masterpiece, the main and background character stories are perfect and well-woven. The narrative is told without haste, in detail, through dialogues, objects, texts... The graphics speak for themselves. The gameplay is wonderful, at various moments frenetic and very well-crafted. Perhaps one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing, completing, and achieving platinum.. Gameplay - 8 Plot & Characters - 10 Storytelling - 10 Pacing - 9 Music & Sound - 8 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. The best game of ALL time. It's very simple, but very dramatic, interesting and еmotional story. Now... I haven't played this game yet, I'm waiting to see if I can find it for less than 20 considering I own the original and the PS5 port but I do wonder why this one has one of the highest rated scores in the whole PS4 library but the PS5 port has such more negative reviews?!. Amazing story and characters. Really **** you into the world. Nice graphics, the remastered makes it look even better. Truly one of the best video games of all time.. The only reason I give this game a 8/10 is because of the giant amount of moments in the campaign where the charecters are just walking which doesn't let you fully focus on the gameplay and don't get me wrong the gameplay is great but it's impossible to play this game for only gameplay because it just forces you to be engaged with the story If only there was an option to skip those parts where basically nothing is happening when it comes to gameplay or make those moments be a part of the cutscene that would be way better and improve the replayability of this game. The story is incredible, the gameplay and variety of enemies make it a great game for which you will need to plan how to kill a wave of them. The AI is very well done and the graphics are not far behind. An incredible game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the greatest story games I’ve ever played. Some of the greatest character development I’ve ever seen in media.. i played it before the second part came out but I loved it. The emotional bond that joe and ellie form throughout the game's story is very special and no other game possesses it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What else to say other than this was a generation defining game for the PS3 and remastered for PS4. Some love it, some hate it I personally love it. It’s a decent game,story was okay ig,the combat is…very sluggish I guess. I enjoyed playing this game but it certainly isn’t a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved Last of Us 1, but Last of Us 2 was very interesting to play and not in a positive way. I was seriously enjoying the story about Joel's death and Ellie trying to avenge his death, and Ellie's romance on the side. It could have ","this is Naughty Dog's last game to NOT focus on ""Modern Audiences"" agenda . the story, the characters, the atmosphere, and the music are all just perfect . it's a must play game, with a good mix of action, stealth and survival mechanics ."
480.Lumines,"An OK puzzle game. I dont remember particularly enjoying this one, but i spent some hours with it anyway.. Very entertaiment puzzle game but not the best it reminds me to street fighter puzzle a litle bit but just a single player game with challenges, fun to play for a while but after it gets repetitive, for me the second one its a litle better but its the same game good saga overall.. Game is really good for few hours. Later it's getting really boring. Challenge Mode is repetitive Vs CPU Mode repetitive. music is really good but when you listen to same few tracks over and over again you get bored really quickly. So count how many Times I said its boring. This the biggest and only flaw of this game. Not sure what all the hate is about. Yes this is similar to Tetris but it's still beautiful, fun and addicting. If you want a fun puzzle game then definitely check this game out.",it's an entertaiment puzzle game but not the best it reminds me to street fighter puzzle a litle bit . game is really good for few hours but later it's getting really boring . music is really good but when you listen to same few tracks over and over again you get bored really quickly .
481.L.A. Noire,"It’s a car that takes you to new and exciting places, it’s only a shame when it runs out of gas all too soon.. LA Noire an engaging game, that attempts to do something different. While it does not always do it well, it does it well enough to be worth your time.. A great looking neo-noir that recalls ""L.A. Confidential"" and old TV police dramas. The game has fantastic details in the graphics and the world. It's a stunning cinematic re-creation of 1940's Los Angeles. Characters are well-developed and the story is compelling. But the gameplay has its limitations. The formula of interrogations and investigations eventually become repetitive. Also, the shootouts and foot chases are brief and not too exciting. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.5 out of 10.. I only recently watched the movie Chinatown and can recommend that too if you like this game. That prompted me to write this review. One of the memorably best games I have played in many years. The storyline is very well crafted, with nods to many movies, eg LA Confidential and those closer to the era eg the opening screen of the shadowed man on the wall (a hat tip to The Third Man). There are also cases themed on actual crimes of the times. The music score is fantastic. The interviews shine. There is a faithfully recreated setting of LA but it remains an untapped sandbox unfortunately. What a waste. The PS4 version is better than the older PC and X360 iterations. Shooting scene mechanics and graphics were much better. I played this through several times. It’s likely better expressed as a 9-9.5 but will get a 10 here as a tilt, due to the uniqueness and well articulated nostalgia for the era. If only Rockstar would produce another one this good set in the 70s in say New York or San Francisco - you have a ready made fan club waiting to pay full price. Just look at all the people pining for it online!. Really unique game we'll worth playing it was also really ahead of its time with some of the tech it used.. L.A Noire is another incredible example of Rockstar Games' excellent work, transporting players to 1940s Los Angeles with impressive precision. The game offers an immersive and immersive experience that combines elements of police investigation, noir drama and action into a unique and exciting **** of L.A Noire's most striking features is its meticulously crafted story, which intertwines brilliantly with everything that happens around it. Players take on the role of Detective Cole Phelps, whose journey to unravel a series of crimes reveals dark secrets and betrayals in a city filled with corruption and intrigue. Each case features unexpected twists and complex characters, keeping players completely absorbed in the game's narrative.L.A Noire's clue and detective system is another significant highlight. Players are challenged to carefully examine crime scenes, collect evidence, and interrogate witnesses and suspects to solve the cases. Innovative use of motion capture technology allows players to observe characters' facial expressions during interrogations, adding an extra layer of realism and complexity to investigations.Plus, the depiction of 1940s Los Angeles is simply stunning. From the gleaming **** to the dark alleys, the game perfectly captures the atmosphere of the time, with attention to detail that will impress even the most discerning history enthusiasts. The immersive soundtrack and carefully recreated ambiance transport players to a bygone era, making the experience even more immersive and captivating.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Is it a perfect game? Hell no. Is it a fun game that achieves what it strives to and then some? Hell yes!. The facial expressions are arguably the best I have seen from the Xbox 360 era. The interrogation parts were also really unique (though I admit I kinda **** at them).. On the surface a 1940's version of GTA, but the meat of the game is actually in the investigations where you have to meticulously examine crime scenes for clues and interrogate suspects. The most realistic characters yet with genuine body language and facial expressions make for an atmospheric detective story with the odd hot pursuit and shoot out to break things up a bit. Very nicely done and different enough from the GTA formula to feel like quite an original game.. my favorite rockstar game after red dead redemption 2, i would like to continue this concept on a new generation more than gta 6, but i think everyone has heard about the game. This game is a clear must-play for the Xbox 360. No other game for this console has this good graphics thanks to the MotionScan technique utilizing 32 high-definition cameras to capture every single one of the over 400 actors individually. The detective story is also very captivating. 10/10. A masterpiece. This is not you're regular game but it's to tell a story. A story that the past will always come back and haunt you. This game displays that incredidably and how Cole and other Characters change throughout the Story.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 6 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 8 Total: 7.67. Amazing played this on 360 when it first came out but would also like to experience gameplay with the remastered version and play the DLCs which I never did.. I love how people try to compare this game to the technology and knowledge law enforcement has today. Morons. Anyways, this game is great. I love how you have to figure out if the suspect you are investigating is telling the truth or not. If you piss him/her off then they wont say **** Graphically amazing, simple controls. How cops had to be back in the 1950's.. A great Game on Xbox 360 and one of the best Rockstar Games. I think this is an Masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still one of my favourite games that rewards patience and an enquiring mind. I've just completed this game, and it is exceptional. The look of this game is amazing, beautiful graphics and wonderful facial animations, most of all though i like the clever use of lighting in this game, it really feels like a 'noir' inspired game. The attention to detail is amazing and every part of post WWII LA is perfectly recreated. The story is excellent and the twist at the end certainly shocked me. Gameplay is good, but is pretty much identical to GTA 4, which is not a bad thing. The only couple of points that im disappointed with are, firstly the driving, which could use a lot of tweaking. It took me quite a while to get use to, so i mainly just let my partner drive, and also the outcome of your own personal decisions - whatever option use choose to take, the outcome is the same each time. You'll understand me when you play this game. It's not enough of an issue though to stop me giving this a 8. Brilliant game... Masterpiece! Story, characters, music, atmosphere, gameplay - everything is amazing.. This game feels nearly like a movie. You're this detective, Cole Phelps of whom was formly in world war against Japan. It sets out in the 40's, in LA and crime is at it's all time high. This isn't a GTA clone in no way, and if you're knocking it because of that you are an idiot. So basically the game requires you to pay attention to detail, and look for clues. At most points, you'll have to tell if a persons Lying, telling the truth, or holding out on you. You have to check dead bodies too. You will be able to tell do rockstar using actual spot on facial animations. Tha map feels so hugh, even though there's not much to in the world you will be traveling for minutes. Due to it having so many blocks. You an reply to street crimes. (Which do get very repetitive) Well you make you're way through 5 ranks abd you get different partners: Patrol (This is sort of like a totourial) Partner Ralph Dunn Traffic (You deal with car accident crimes) Partner Stefan Bekowsky Homicide ( Dealing with murder crimes) Partner Rusty Galloway Vice (Dealing with drug crimes) Partner Roy Earl Arson (Dealing with fire crimes) Partner Hershel. All partners act different, my favorite partner was Rusty. My least favorite was Roy. He's such a racist and a sexist. My favorites were Vice and Homicide. Searching for shipments, or trying murders were really interesting. As you progress through the game you'll become famous. NPC will say ""Hey, you're the dectective in the paper."" The voice acting is spot on. The shooting and the car physics were great. Now let's talk about why I didn't give LA Noire a 10 or 9. there are quite a few cons too it. 1. It doesn't feel like an open world game. This game has a big and dense map, however there's nothing to do in it. I know this isn't GTA, but that still doesn't change the fact that there should be more content. It 2. The Graphics. the facial animations were good, but the graphics weren't all top notch in the vegatation areas. In some areas it looked less detailed than RDR 3. It's very repetitive. Mostly every mission's the same, and that get's boring. But other than that it's a great game.. This is a game that I never sat down and played on PlayStation 3 but I was always intrigued by the game mechanics. It seemed interesting and the fact that the game is a crime-solving detective game, it sounds like something that would be right up my alley. The truth is, it’s an okay game. In case you didn’t figure it out by the name but its a Crime-Solving Noire game based in 1940’s Los Angeles. You play as a Detective who is considered a War Hero from World War II. Cole is his name he’s fresh on the force and he’s motivated to move up the rank. The games main gimmick is when you’re interviewing NPC’s or Non-Playable Characters the characters have impressive facial animations for the Xbox 360 game. You then have to read their facial animation and presume if they’re lying, if they’re telling the truth or if there is doubt. Maybe it’s just me but I had a hard time distinguishing between the three. This is a game going into it that I had very high hopes for but the more I played it, the more I realized the more I realized that I don’t know about the game. I can’t tell if its a game that didn’t age well or if its a game that wasn’t great, to begin with. I think if I played this game in 2011 I would have a similar view of the game. Its an average game with an interesting gimmick and a story that doesn’t fully come together. If you haven’t played this game, I personally wouldn’t bother.. For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. For instance, the way people you pass on the street constantly comment loudly to nobody in particular about having seen you in the papers or indicate that you could use a bath is awkward, and it sticks out like a sore thumb in a world that tries so hard to be believable. But this is a minor nitpick with a game that gets under your skin the way few games do. L.A. Noire's length can vary significantly, depending on how many street crimes you respond to and how much of your own driving you do, but in any case, the 21 story cases make for a complete and satisfying experience. You come into contact with the seamy side of the movie industry and with major players in the gambling racket; you meet working stiffs and powerful businessmen; you encounter low-ranking mob thugs and Mickey Cohen, one of the most powerful gangsters in Los Angeles at the time. L.A. Noire is a unique game with a terrific sense of period atmosphere, absorbing investigation mechanics, and a haunting tale with plenty of moments that would be right at home in a classic film noir. Those smoky nights spent listening to jazz at the Blue Room, and the price you paid for them, will stay with you long after you've retired your badge and gun.. Although is not as good as other rockstar games ,l.a. noire is destined to be a cult game, it's narrative and it's climate is amazing and the graphics still looks good today.. Anyone who says this is a bad game is a little girl. This game has the graphics, characters, storyline, everything is there. the storyline is very intence with cases that will keep you guessing for the whole game it also has a back story (srry no spoilers) I kust really loved this game i dont no what to say.. L.A Noire is an amazing creation. Team Bondi have made a stylish, thrilling and immersive game that engages you with the story and has players bringing out the LAPD detective in them. It is both challenging and enjoyable and a must play for gamers everywhere.. A decent game that showed a lot of potential before launch. When it did launch things didn't quite go to plan though. The game can get real boring real fast but is still worth a play through.. I wanted to enjoy this game. I really, really did. I absolutely love film noir flicks and hard-boiled detective novels, so a game inspired by them was right up my alley, I thought. Play a tough cop in post-World War II Los Angeles solving mysteries? Sign me up! But dear god was this game frustrating to play. Eventually I just had to give it up. The central mechanic in solving mysteries -- a mini-game of reading non-player characters' reactions during interviews and interrogations to determine if they are lying -- just doesn't work. The game's supposedly innovative animation just cannot mimic a real-life person's face accurately enough to make this possible and so trying to ""read"" the animations is endlessly frustrating. Similarly, the mechanic to find ""clues"" -- making the controller vibrate when the player gets close to them -- is actually less realistic than the usual video game method of highlighting objects the player can interact with so they stand out from the backgrounds. At least then you do have to pay attention and look around. Couple all that with the clunkiest, least intuitive driving system I have ever played and the game's insistence that you continually use it and you have a perfect recipe for aggravation, not enjoyment. It really undermines the immersiveness too. It's hard to view the game's protagonist as the stalwart law enforcement officer the designers want you to see him as when you cannot travel anywhere without him repeatedly smashing into other cars or running over pedestrians. It's a shame too because the designers clearly put a lot of work into re-creating the L.A. of the 1940s and genuinely tried to create something new and unique that would stretch the boundaries for future video games. But it just doesn't work.. L.A. Noire, for its time, was a technical marvel, impressing the gaming community with its facial scan technology and almost uncanny recreation of the corrupt 1950s Los Angeles. Backing up its gameplay was the slew of detective work playing as Detective Cole Phelps, an incredibly flawed yet nuanced character that you spend your time doing interrogations, linking clues, and chasing/shooting perps. Through almost 20 cases, you perform these tasks in tandem, which over the course of several cases is refreshing, but eventually loses steam towards the end over how monotonous it can be. The real treat lies in the immersion of the city, where every single detail is succinct down to the last hairbrush and the music is on point with 50s classics. Advertisements hint at the corruption in the city and the cars are incredibly faithful to the time. Another sticking point would have to be the script in which it evokes the true noir that many games fail to emulate what LA Noire delivers in spades. Of course this is also lent by the incredibly lifelike facial animations which in turn is not voice acting, but acting in a technical sense. While there exists an open world, it's devoid of anything to do for the most part aside from optional police missions and even then those are brief. For a game so bent in immersing you, LA Noire teases you with much but gives you little and sets you on a straight path towards its narrative conclusion, to which is kind of disappointing. Nonetheless, nobody can deny the amount of work went into this landmark achievement of technical and artistic design that is the corrupt city of Los Angeles.. [LA Noire Review] LA Noire is a truly impressive videogame, with a gripping storyline and some of the best tech on the last gen. Writing: The storyline is a great one, but it's not very smooth; It's badly paced at some parts, but this is expectable and acceptable do to the fact the game is more than twenty hours long. Anyway, the story is a hard-boiled noir story, and a good one at that. It follows the career Of Cole Phelps (expertly played by Aron S.) a determined but overconfident cop rising the ranks. His story gets more gripping and interesting as the game delves deeper into his personal life. It's very captivating and emotional by the end, and worthy of the kind of films it's based on. The side characters are also very well written, especially Cole's old friends and partners. They all have great Kelso and ? Being a few of my favorites. Also this game benefits from not having many combat scenes. So many games end up with the cutscenes and gameplay feeling very separate and different. Your character will kill hundreds of highly armed enemies in one mission, and in the next cutscene it's treated like a small run-in with some hoodlums. But LA Noire is mostly investigation and interrogation, keeping you immersed in the story. It has one of the best stories in videgame history. Story: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Overall Writing: 19/20 Sound And Acting: The acting is some of the best in gaming. The actors have atmosphere and emotion. The tech helps Team Bondi capture the performances better than anybody had before. The music in the game is incredible. The score is rousing and exciting. It makes the game feel so much more like a classic noire film. The music is used to signify different events (each type of event has a little theme song, there's one for a gunfight, evidence search, ect.) is clever. The sound effects are also pretty good, but not as big a deal as in many games, as the game doesn't really need a huge variety of sounds. But the sounds that are there, really just a few gunshots, car sounds, and some footsteps, are well done. FX: 8/10 Acting: 10/10 Overall Sound: 18/10 Animations And Physics: Most of the animations are superb the characters look incredibly realistic while climbing ladders and stairs, and while walking around. The facial animations are also great. All of the emotion on the actors face's is captured. The wrinkles and stubble are clearly visible. The only weaker point of the animation are death animations. They aren't horrible but are pretty stiff still. So in all the animations are some of the best of the last gen. When I went into the game I knew it was very story focused so I didn't expect anything great from the physics. I was pleasantly surprised. The cars crash and handle realistically, and there are plenty of physics objects to run into. There is also a soft body deformation system for the cars, making every crash realistic and unique. The ragdoll physics are also not to bad, but nothing like that of other games Rockstar had been involved in. Physics: 6 Animations: 9 Overall Animations/Physics: 15 Environment: The atmosphere is top notch. Everything from the clothing to the interior design feel perfectly at home with the noire story. Everybody feels like someone from a 40s movie. The open world is also pretty awesome. It's one of the most convincing open world I've seen. The world is modeled after a huge amount of photographs of 1940s which is quite impressive. There are tons of 40s style ads, vintage storefronts, and tons of cool old cars. The game world also has a remarkable amount of enterable buildings for a decent size game, one of the largest amounts ever. Sadly there aren't any side activities that involve interacting with the city other than some cool but short lived squad calls you get while driving around. These end up with you subduing some criminals. The only activities are collecting trinkets throughout the city, sadly you can't go to bars, watch TV, or play some mini-games like in many other open world games. The controls are not very good. First I'd like to add that picking up and manipulating objects is surprisingly smooth. But other movements are not as coordinated. Sprinting is quite hard to control, you'll end up running into doorways and accidentally jumping over things (there's no jump button, so climbing and jumping is automatically activated when you sprint near a scale-able object). This is also because the camera hard to control and sometimes sluggish. The shooting isn't too bad, but it's not very precise. The interrogation and investigation scenes are the highlight of gameplay though. There's no other game with anything quite like them. You must judge if victims are lying or not and search through houses for evidence like an actual detective, both of which were very interesting and well functioning mechanics. The car handling on the other way is quite good. You can pull of all sorts of cool jumps and tricks once you get used to the handling. In all the gameplay was a bit repetitive and flawed, but unique enough to win me over. Atmosphere: 5/5 Entertainment: 3/5 Environment Design: 4/5 Gameplay/Controls: 3/5 Overall Gameplay: 15/20 Graphics And Performance: Visually the game looks very good in both black and white and color. The black and white mode looks a little under tested as it impair you from seeing how injured your character is. Other than that, the tone of the black and white filter gives the game a distinct noire style. The color mode is very high contrast with a large color scope, making the whole game look like a vintage movie. Textures have a decent resolution, but are used in place of three dimensional objects far to often. The lighting and shadow effects are also some of the best I've seen on a last gen game. Small details of objects are actually visible on the shadows, but with closer examination shadows are very grainy on the 360 version, but I had to cut it some slack because the game was originally developed exclusively for PS3. The frame rate is also pretty steady, and I didn't see to many glitches. Visuals: 4/5 Lighting: 4/5 Resolution: 5/5 Processing: 4/5 Overal Graphics: 17/20 LA Noire is a compelling and unique experience that I highly recommend to anyone who likes slower games. [94/100- Amazing]. It’s really hard to think **** that has done something similar to L.A. Noire. It’s not just the fact that the player has at his/her hand the availability of a 1940s Los Angeles sandbox, but the fact that it’s never been this intriguing to play as a detective and well enough love it. Set in 1947, the player plays as Cole Phelps, a former war hero who rises and shines through the ranks of the LAPD. As a detective, Phelps will take charge of several exciting cases, each revealing new grounds to the overall plot, only to find that his past will play quite the role in this story, and the line that divides good and evil is quite blurred. The game does a grand job progressing the story, giving good background and development to every character the player meets, including Phelps himself. It is safe to say that not one moment throughout the game does a feeling of dullness come to mind. Each case the player is presented with is a fresh and exciting segment. This is by no means a Disney kind of story, so do not expect a cliché at the end. But that’s a good thing, right? It is, however, a very intriguing and grasping experience. Setting presentation is above expectations. The 1940s atmosphere is immersive and grand. The urban environment is very detailed. The graphics in this game are quite beautiful. It would be a crime not to mention L.A. Noire’s character dialogue, which is to say at the very least – superb. The amazing performances are enhanced by L.A. Noire’s amazing face-capturing technology. No game, even at this point in 2013 has yet captured the detail facial expressions in L.A. Noire have. Thanks to this, the characters feel alive, they feel like real people. Gameplay, for the most part, involves the usual sandbox mechanics. There’s the common shootout and chase side missions which are ever fun (and there are 40 of these missions throughout the L.A. area), but when it comes to the detective part of the game, L.A. Noire gets quite peculiar and unique. When asking a question, the player is faced with three options: Truth, Doubt, or Lie. In a detective game, it’s expected to talk to people in order to solve cases, and it is this why the face-capturing technology used in this game is key to the overall experience. Good part of the overall game involves the player interacting with many, many characters. The player must interview people and use clues in order to get to the bottom of things, and the way a character’s face looks and reacts with each answer they give is essential for the player to conclude whether the interviewee is lying or not. Every case presents several scenarios where Phelps finds clues. Clues give context to what’s going on, and the player is expected to use these clues during interviews to further help prove when somebody is lying. It’s very gratifying to get through a list of questions correctly, getting the truth out of a suspect without missing one question, yet a feeling of guilt can present itself every time the player misses good judgment upon their interviewee. And that’s the beauty of L.A. Noire. Interviewing people does not feel like a chore. It’s fun and exciting. The sandbox elements, which cover exploration, collection items, side quests involving police work, and cars (cars are so authentic to the period and they are cool) are well made and serve to the immersion of the game. Given the concept of the game, which involves interacting with people a lot, one would expect for it to have RPG elements. The story, however, never changes. The player will get the same ending regardless of how you judge your suspects. It’s a shame, really, but by no means makes the game bad. Each case works as an individual “mission”, and the way the player gets through it, i.e. – getting all the clues, catching the right suspect, getting questions right, will ultimately show how well you performed at the end of the case. This performance is judged by stars. Do a great job and you’ll be awarded 5 stars, do poorly and you’ll earn as low as one star. This gameplay concept gives great replay value giving the player good reason to go back and perform better in a case after completing the game. That’s another plus, if the player wishes to play a specific case, he/she only has to select it from a list of cases – no need to start over from the beginning. L.A. Noire is a unique experience. Characters are amazing, story is solid and interesting, and the setting and atmosphere make up for an awesome experience. Through a regular play-through, the experience can be as long as 25 hours, and thanks to the great variety in characters as well as cases, it will not feel like 25 hours in the end. It will leave behind a feeling of wanting more, and that’s a great thing to say about a game. There are instances where the player is presented with 6-8 hour games and somehow, halfway through the game, it becomes tiring just getting through it. But not L.A. Noire. This game does a great job keeping the player interested, and will, no doubt, bring him/her back to play it again.. This game is a master piece in every way, from its detective noir style story to its shootout moments, to its tense and jazz style music. Its hard to imagine you won't like this game. You play as Cole Phelps a new detective proving yourself to the force. While dealing with the real world, you learn about Phelps cold past. Overall a solid game.. This game is a must play for anyone who likes an open world game, because this is that. But it's also so much more. It's a visually stunning, brilliantly written story that is matched only by the risk they took that succeeded more often than not. Admittedly not for everyone, it is worth a trial run thru to check out.. First off, the design and graphics in this game are very impressive. Everything about it looks good. However, that is about all I can say positive for this title. Once you get past that there is very little holding this game up. The story and characters are incredibly boring. The mechanics are sloppy and slow. Tasks become very repetitive and unrewarding after just a few hours. One can quickly decipher the formula for the correct responses to character interactions.. What truly makes L.A. Noire great is how different it is, not just from Rockstar games, but from games in general. You play as a detective solving murders and other crimes. I love it, it's truly a thinking man's game and requires actual skill.. One of the best xbox 360 games you can play, even though it is a few years old. The graphics are advanced for its time and there is a very extensive amount of content. It took a few missions for me to get into the game, but once the ball got rolling i could not put it down. The city is gigantic and the AIs are well done. There is a lot of effort put into this game, and you really have to play it to understand. This is a game you can play with your girlfriend and she wont mind watching. I will admit, the interrogation aspect can be frustrating and some of the character reactions can be confusing, but you will love this game, especially for the low price you can get the complete edition at EB Games (18.00) Overall, Just a very well made game that every Xbox owner needs to own. Gets a little repetitive (like a lot of games) after a while but is a lot of fun solving crimes, chasing bad guys,shooting bad guys, and questioning suspects. I just bought this recently and GTA4 and have played L.A Noire about 75% through and GTA4 about 25% and I have to say I am enjoying LA Noire a lot more. You should definitely pick it up! You can find it now for around $5-10. One of the best games of all time I think. The story has a lot of deep, hidden meaning and it took me a couple of times to play through to understand it completely. It does have some problems. The cars are too grippy, the combat feels a bit stiff, and the Tommy gun has way too much ammo. But that doesn't take much away from the game. The story and dialogue are the main focus, and it excels in that to movie-like quality.. My favorite video game of all time. The graphics are unrivaled even 4 years later. The city of L.A is bigger and better than ever. The story is top notch and the biggest reason why I love this game. All the characters are compelling and interesting. How the story unravels is an amazing experience each and every time I play. Sure, the game play outside of investigating and interrogation can get dull but it doesn't take away the greatness of it all. Interrogations are challenging even after multiple plays and can always take a new turn. Getting a 5 star score after a case is more rewarding to me than anything else ive ever experienced in a video game. This game is almost played out like a movie which suits me well. Speaking of movies, if you like this game watch the movie, LA Confidential.. I am writing this after finally playing the PC version of the game and it`s one of the most pleasant surprises I`ve had in gaming. The reason is that according to Metacritic there is no PC version, and yet I felt I had to put my two cents in here about LA Noire. Not being a huge GTA fan due to my profound lack of interest in Russian pimps with fake accents, f-bombs and car chases I wasn`t expecting too much from this game. But by golly did it have one of the best stories I`ve seen in a game to date. It is also a technical marvel, recreating 1946 LA faithfully enough, which is where the game takes place. The graphics and sound are good and the game play excellent. Occasionally there isn`t a whole lot where you`d expect there to be at least something, but considering that the game simulates a huge city it ca","the game is a stunning cinematic re-creation of 1940's Los Angeles . the storyline is very well crafted, with nods to many movies . the music score is fantastic . the interviews shine ."
482.Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction,"While I prefer the original games' comedic plot, I found everything about this game refined & ambitious.. For some reason at the moment a lot of people consider this game just another good R&C but for me this title can truly fight for the first place. This game has probably the second best story in the franchise, really good villains ( like Slag and Tachyon) and an outstanding world building with a lot of lore. The gameplay feels like an updated version of that masterpiece of gameplay that we see on Up your arsenal and Deadlocked, with a really good level design of the planets that reminds a lot of the level design that we see in the first two main entries in the franchise. An amazing soundtrack and incredible graphichs for the time can really explain you why this was considered a system seller game at the time.. This game is just as it sounds, many different weapons to cause destruction to all planets with an Emperor that wants you dead so it can rule the universe. Extremely quirky and silly given the plot and characters, we have an over-the-top adventure which lacks a detailed story yet is oddly charming enough to win over the younger audience. As a kid, I would've said this was a 9/10. Nowadays 7/10 is more appropriate as it lacks the story to keep it acclaimed. It's simply a fun brainless game.. Sprawling 3D platform shoot 'em up with nice graphics, lots of variety and a sense of humour. A little lacking in challeneg but there's so much to see and do it's a pleasure to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While it may **** that they used too much of the six axis controls, overall everything else is just as good or better than Up Your Arsenal. I especially like the way they went with the story and soundtrack, it was a much needed improvement on the Ratchet and Clank series as a whole. Overall Tools of Destruction is something I want to see more of, and makes me glad to have played this great game.. One hell of a way to start a new console generation and to shift from the ps2 games to an HD console. Impressive visuals and an engaging story makes ToD one of ps3 best exclusives.. it's classic ratchet and clank it's classic ratchet and clankit's classic ratchet and clank. One of the best ratchet and clank games. With the most planet avaible to enjoy, great soundtrack, great gameplay and also the most incredible graphics for a videogame till 2009 at least.. This was my first Ratchet and Clank on PS3 and can I say it was **** **** gunplay,his gameplay,his story and his characters. First time playing Ratchet & Clank and haven't had so much fun on a PS console in years. You can tell this is a Sony experience due to the cinematics and quirky humour. Being the first R&C game, I found the story and lore to be very interesting, kinda has a Star Wars theme but with TMNT vibe and attitude. The level design is fantastic, with varied worlds and mechanics to be used. With the mechanics, the various guns, platforming and devices, there is always something new. With so many weapons to use, you choose how to play and beat a section. There is some space combat (although not my fav) which gives variety and adds to the story. The graphics are not the best the console can offer, it had great art style making it unique for the time. The issues I had is having random audio stutters on the cut scenes. There was also one time the audio was 2 seconds behind the visuals which is jarring. The final nail was a bug with crates floating when hitting the ones underneath. If you stand below the floating crate you will clip through the game and die. This happened to me twice. Besides the issues listed above, this would be a 10/10. My 11yo son loves it and being a kid at heart I can see why.. So good game, with amazing gameplay and other things. I can recommend this for everybody who gotta PS3..

Ratchet and Clank games are very much like the Mission Impossible series. They have no business being as good as they are given what they are. Not only that, but they also manage to progressively get better and better.. Ratchet and Clank tools of destruction is one of the best ps3 games I've ever played. The graphics for 2007 are simply gorgeous (beautiful environments and atmosphere) as well as the gameplay with a great variety of weapons, awesome upgrading system that get along with an interesting story. It's a must buy for anyone who has a ps3 and hasn't played this game yet, definitely an unforgettable experience.. Another great R&C game, which I can rate 10/10 without questions. I'm always chilling when I play it.. I'm not sure how it holds up but I remember the grand sense of exploration and discovery I had when playing this as a kid.. This game is the reason that I got a ps3. First I disliked some things because of my nostaligia to the old games but when I saw it for what it is I liked it so much that I would give it a ten.. On a replay: Complaints after the first level: - Please don't render environments within jumping distance if I can't actually land on it. I complain about this way too much. - The jump pads operate in slow motion for no reason; it's kind of annoying. This is minor, though. - They advertised this as cinematic on the cover... ""Cinematic"" doesn't really matter so much two console generations behind. They just make things blow up while you're on grind rails, pretty much. And they put effort into making it feel more like Pixar with speech patterns and mannerisms, but the original games already had a certain charm to them that lacks here a bit. - The antagonist isn't very believable. I mean, I get it's kid-friendly, but Ratchet breaks this guy's robo-suit to escape in the intro level, and I'm like ""...so we beat him?"" The story works fine as a set-up for the Future series. But I don't really care about the protagonist's allies. Plus, the unlockable skins aren't really good, so why should I try to get Gold Bolts? By far, my least favorite part of this game is the mandatory flying levels, as they move in a fixed direction instead of the free-flying combat of 2, or even A Crack In Time. Also, the arena is really underwhelming compared to other games, like 2 or 3. They could've easily added 10 more challenges. There aren't really any side games aside from those; No racing or moon missions like in 2. The gadget mini-games aren't annoying, but the pirate dance is strictly novel, totally nonsensical, and really plain and boring to me. Again, this disguise portion was done better in 3. It's really easy to have enough money at any point in the game. I personally prefer having to be strategic with investments. In challenge mode, the only real incentive is to buy everything... Challenge mode is honestly a little easier to me. What else is there? The weapon selection interplays well between different types of weapons, but certain weapons seriously lack power compared to others as the game goes on (fusion grenades get pretty pointless). If there were more weapons, the arena could've been easily expanded further. On the plus side? The environments in these games usually do look pretty nice from certain angles, despite their cartoonishness. The level lay-outs are memorable, and the progression of difficulty is engaging. I think this is where they really locked into the best weapon upgrade system, but I still think it improved slightly on subsequent releases. Overall, decent game for any fan of the series. Worth playing as a starting point to this Future sub-series on PS3, but if you only play one on PS3, pick A Crack In Time. I also like Into the Nexus more than this. If you can pick ANY R&C game to start with, just do the first three that were released on PS2.. oh my god this game is much better than i tougth one of the best of the franchise. A blast from the past. Solid gameplay and amazing weapons. Although the mature humor the OG trilogy was known for is gone, the Future saga still delivers a good story.. Ratchet and Clank : Tools of Destruction is a reboot of a classic from PS2 and how o make next-gen games!!. The only PS3 Ratchet and Clank Game that can reach the awesomeness of Ratchet and Clank 1-3 on the PS2. Do you ever just play a game to finish it so you don't have to play anymore That is my feeling about this old childhood favourite game , I really thought I would enjoy it would be interesting but The characters were so on uinteresting that I've been to listen to podcast in the background , And the gameplay is fine my biggest problem is that it has some f****** difficulties spikes. But it's not a bad game it's just Annoying. it's just like the first part from ps2, nothing new and nothing interesting to the series, just some enhanced graphics, gameplay kind of fun anyway, but become boring quickly, everything else is poor. Best game so far for PS3. Fantastic presentation and pacing makes this a great title. There's always more upgrades to keep you playing, and while the first play-through is a little on the easy side, the challenge mode unlocked after the first play-through is challenging, with upgraded weapons.. Another great Ratchet and Clank game. Still not a fan of the Clank sections. Also thought the devices where kind of of pointless with the exception of the Groovitron and Mr. Zurkon. The Groovitron for distracting enemies, and Mr. Zurkon for entertainment lol!. Tools of Destruction was a fantastic game for its time that was really unmatched in the early days of the PS3. Gorgeous graphics, super smooth gameplay, a great arsenal, and an engaging story. And it still holds up today, except for a few sixaxis-related gimmicks.. Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is one of the prettiest games I have ever played and it exactly as awesome as the original PS2 trilogy.. TOD one of the best ratchet and clank game in the series and has the best entry on the ps3 a fun game play with a good controls made a great game like this It's a great job from insomniac games. Back to the roots and less shooting oriented gameplay resulted in a fine game, thanks to that Insomniac could once more shine here with some really nice level design.. It is a perfect game of it's era, which still holds up in 2020. It's animation, music, voice acting, and script truly pushed the Ratchet and Clank franchise forward. This game was truly innovative and is a definitive PlayStation 3 title.. 8 out of 10 - Amazing game Scoring Scale: 1 - (AWFUL) Among the worst games ever made. The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.. Probably the second best ""classic"" Ratchet and Clank game ever: fantastic graphic and game design, lots of weappons and planets.. Pretty good game. Controls are alright, it has a very vibrant world, and the characters are actually unique. However, I didn't like the parts where you have to use motion controls. They could have easily just programmed those sections to use a joystick, and it just feels like they added them in for the sake of adding it in. But that's just a nitpick. This game is a bit overrated though, and isn't really a 10 for me. But I can respect the game greatly.. Awful graphics, awful controls, awful camera and bad theme. This is a pretty mediocre release in every way. Graphics are like welcome to five years ago. Were they blindfolded when making the camera? Main character is boring. Hopefully this is the last game in the series.. Out of all Ratchet & Clank games, this one is my overall personal favorite. I love almost everything about this game; the story, the game-play, the characters, everything! If you like 3rd-person shooters and 3D platformers, then you will love this this game. I just couldn't recommend it any further.. The story of Ratchet and Clank continues with Tools of Destruction. For us platformer lovers this was a long time coming. Thank goodness Insomniac let the game release a week early so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. R&C once again has an intriguing story to follow up with the amazing game-play and production values. Besides dealing with an all-new bad guy, Ratchet through this new villain is learning new things about his past. While Clank is also a key part to the story, he begins to see tiny robots called Zoni, that only he can see. New awesome characters including Crunk and Rusty Pete lead the back-up in one of the most in-depth R&C stories yet. Oh and you can't forget about Quark.. Tools of Destruction ensured that the Ratchet and Clank franchise was able to produce it's PS2 magic, and only enhance it on the new console. Tools of Destruction has massively improved graphics, much larger worlds and weapons, and perhaps the best story to date. Including some of the best characters, Tools of Destruction is potentially the best game in the series.. This is seriously the only PS3 exclusive you should own (LittleBigPlanet 2 aside). Mixing together platforming, exploration, shooting, a funny story, stunning visuals for the console, and amazing worlds to traverse through, Ratchet and Clank: Tools of Destruction is a must-own.. A fun, pretty-looking game with enjoyable albeit repetitive gameplay, that gets bogged down in bugs and painfully infrequent checkpoints and a broken save system that tarnish an otherwise charming game.. Not nearly as fun as A Crack In Time. Too gimmicky, platforming isn't as varied, and the weapons aren't as fun, unlike in Crack.. Another great addition to the Ratchet and Clank series with a few minor annoyances holding it back. The gameplay is as fun as always. If you've played the PS2 trilogy, you know what to expect, as it hasn't changed much, but if it ain't broke don't fix it, right? The graphics are pretty good, especially considering this game came out in 2007, and the plot isn't half bad either. Sure, there are no trophies and there's no multiplayer to speak of, but I don't think either of those things are truly necessary in an R&C game. What does bug me on the other hand, are the motion controls. Yes, Sixaxis / Dualshock 3 controller motion controls. There are puzzles and falling sections among other things that require you to move your controller around, and it gets old fast. There's even a weapon you control by tilting your controller in the direction you want the projectile to go. Why? Alongside the weapons system the series is known for, Tools of Destruction adds ""Devices"", which I don't even understand the point of and I hardly ever found myself using. I know I'm ranting at this point, but don't get me wrong - this is a great game that I would recommend to any PS3 owner.. This game is very good and a lot of fun. A mix of 3rd person shooter, platformer. and adventure. Ratchet and Clank prove that you can do a lot with a small concept.. This has to be my favourite ratchet and clank game of all time, i like the level design and the settings of the game, probably the best ive played since i first bought the ps3,. Absolutely fantastic game, pretty much on par if not a little better than the original trilogy. The levels are incredibly well designed throughout the majority of the game. The story has more of a darker undertone, with the majority of the game focused on Ratchet's past and the Lombaxes. I do recommend this game and find it to be incredibly fun however I feel the majority of the game is far too easy and when it isn't (a huge flaw IMO) enemies and bosses are very bullet spongy and you'll find yourself running out of ammo sometimes, this problem pretty much destroyed all fun from the last two stages for me (especially the final two bosses). A flawed masterpiece, with a great story. 9/10. My favorite R&C game of the PS3 era. Cool gadgets, weapons and good story. The bosses where good as well. Not quite as good as they were in R&C 3 but they got the job done. This game has the feel of the R&C 2 and 3.. Another ratchet and clank game , and another amazing one at that. Lots of variety and different way to play the game. cool weapons and a decent story, with thrown in humor which I liked a lot. If you like ratchet and clank I think it's safe to say you'll love this one.. Ratchet and Clank is a beloved series on the PS2 and PS3 and the Future games are totally awesome. My daughter and I love the series! It's not coop but you can still enjoy it together.. Really fun game with lots of casual game-play in it. The production values are high and everything is very well thought out. It is basically jumping and running with heavy shooting twist and some interesting perks and mini-games. The weapons vary significantly and there are seriously good ideas here. It starts easy enough, but in the second half the difficulty progresses nicely toward not-piece-of-cake level. It is not totally linear with clever hidden places that bring you usable bonuses. The cut scenes have nice dialog and good amounts of humor while not dragging the story. If you search for a polished and refined game suitable both for children and gamers in their thirties, look no further. It is easily a 10/10 game if only this genre is considered.. This game was amazing. Gameplay - Still fun and still awesome. With the addition of some epic parts like grinding while a Giant Robot cuts the rails and a ship chases after you firing missiles and lasers. Or running through the city trying to avoid falling to your death as the ground crumbles beneath your feet with enemies chasing you. New Weapons enter the fray but as a previous Reviewer mentioned some of these weapons seem recycled from the previous games. Not all of them are like that though there are some weapons here with more originality and depth in this game. There's also some cool gadgets too. Story - Ratchet learns of his origins and discovers the secrets of the Lombaxes and Cragmites. Meanwhile Clank meets new friends who give him new and strange powers. The story is interesting and good there is also some humor in it too like in previous R&C Games. Space Combat kind of **** in this one I like it better in a Crack In Time. Graphics - Very Good for a 2007 Game the graphics are amazing I was in awe when it 1st came out but I never played the game until 2014 which kind of **** but money doesn't grow on trees unfortunately. Soundtrack - David Berguead is the perfect composer for this game and he should continue doing the music for the series until it ends or until he dies because no one can do it better. A Crack In Time just wasn't good without the amazing music we hear in previous R&C Games I don't know why they removed him for that game? Characters - Ratchet & Clank were pretty much the same Qwark was an idiot like usual and the new villain Tachyon is probably the lamest villain in the entire series I did not like him at all. I prefer Dr Nefarious or Drek. Captain Slag & Rusty Pete were good characters I preferred the Robot Pirates in this game than the Goldfish Robots. Talwyn and her Robot Friends were also good additions to the game as well. Overall - Its your typical R&C Game with amazing PS3 Graphics some new weapons gadgets and an origin story as well as Pirates Arrrr. A must play for R&C Fans and new comers as well. A Crack In Time is another game you should try if your into the R&C Series but Quest For Booty is the sequel to this so get that 1st.. This was the first game I played on ps3 and I'm glad this was it the first ratchet and clank was one of the firstever games I've ever played and I've played all the ratchet and clanks available on the ps2 as for this game its everything a ratchet and clank game is supposed to be everything will be very familiar with a few added things such as the integration of the six axis remote I didn't enjoy it for a few things but most of the time I liked the use of the six axis the story was also very nice I enjoyed it a lot it tells a lot about backgrounds and such the weapons which have always been crucial in ratchet and clank I didn't think they had that amazing uniqueness that most ratchet and clank games present but then again I have played all of them so I may be used to it but overall everything was pretty enjoyable except it did feel pretty easy to me. Good story, good gameplay, bright detailed colorful graphics everything about this game is pretty good. Like other R&C games this is also pure gold! The story is strong and ends very well. Shooting, platforming and space battles sooo much fun. This is one epic adventure.. Tools of Destruction is a fun and addictive game thanks to all the explosions and destruction you cause throughout the adventure. There are a few balancing issues with the weapons as some that you get near the beginning of the game do absolutely nothing against the enemies found later in the game.. good great new graphics cool weapons but not really a lot of weapons actually. controls are good,the armor sets are very different from armors from the previous games. bolts are easily earn thanks to leviathan hunting and arena fights. something i don't like at this game is that captain qwuark is a bit different then in the other ratchet game's and he issn't on any of the missions. the story is okay. the game length is fine as well and the new graphics make it look awesome. raritanium this crystal is an extra for upgrading your weapons. in short a good ratchet and clank game worth buying. As the first PS3 outing for R&C this game was really fun, but it does slow down in parts (for example the Dino and snow pirate level) but it is still one of my favorite PS3 games. Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction really has a number of good remarks. For one, the graphics (especially for a game made in 2007) are absolutely mind blowing. The gameplay combines a shooter, a platformer, an rpg, and even is a bit of a puzzle game! The story is absolutely engaging to all gamers of all ages and has a nice control interface. In conclusion, this game blew my mind!. Tools of Destruction marks Ratchet and Clank's first foray into the HD generation, and a fine attempt at that. Even playing it now in 2013, it's graphics hold up splendidly well with it's bright colours and smooth edges, with a silky smooth framerate to boot. Everything you love about the old games is here, as well as an expanded weapon customization system, 'Gadgets' and a variety of more open levels allowing for exploration with the Robo-Wing, hunting wild creatures and more. Despite all the positives, Tools of Destruction isn't without bugs. With multiple crashes during my playthrough and numerous other small oversights, the game isn't a perfect experience, but it looks great, plays great and is one hell **** game to play. Aye, Tools of Destruction is the best Ratchet game since Up Your Arsenal, and deserves every bit of praise it gets. Final Score: 8.6/10. The Ratchet and Clank series has been a childhood favorite of mine, and I felt terrible when the PS3 games came out because I didn't have one back then. Now that I have one, I got this one for my birthday, and I can say this is one; if not the best, Ratchet and clank game. Luckily with the jump to another system the gameplay is still intact, and feels as great as it did back then. The animation is pure eye candy, and does not get in the way of playing the game. The animation is so great that it feels like your watching a movie, and being a apart of it only adds more the adventure. Like with all Ratchet and Clank games, there's a lot of weapons to choose from, all with unique abilities. Also the puzzles with motion control are actually very good, sometimes they're difficult, but too much so that it's impossible. With great animation, variety in weapons, and some interesting puzzles. This is one of the best Ratchet and Clank games to date.. If you've played Ratchet and Clank 3 think that but shinier on the PS3. The gameplay is essentially the same which is fine because it is a near perfect mix of platforming and shooting. The enemies and planets you visit vary and the story is good to. It also introduces the villian of Captain Slag, a side villian that manages to outdo the game's main antagonist Emperor Tachyon in charm and making him strangely likeable for a selfish robot space pirate. The weapons are great as always with the massively OP Rhino and Alpha Cannon fun to use. Clanks sections are a bit annoying but nothing major still a great game and is worth playing.. I just love this game, even though there is no trophies, the game was fantastic. Even though there is no online, even though there is no multiplayer, these things don't matter when everything else that was included was done superbly, the weapon level ups (except the omni-wrench), the variety of weapons, the humor, etc. Sure the ending wasn't great, but the game play was fantastic. I'd call it a fair sized game, even though I beat it in about a week, even so I didn't do absolutely everything (collecting gold bolts, leveling up all weapons, beating the game on challenge mode, etc.) Overall, 8.7/10 (I hope Crack in Time is this good or better). I've been a R&C fan since the first game came out, and I'm still a fan. Tools of Destruction, however, was a bit of a disappointment for me. Over all I still enjoyed the game, but I felt that it was inferior to most of the previous titles. The story line was original, but not very engaging. The gameplay was roughly the same as the old PS2 titles, which is fine, but I feel like the developers should have taken the opportunity to improve. I feel like the weapons and gadgets you can get in the game were all recycled from previous titles. If you're a R&C fan, I would recommend this game simply as a continuation to the series. For everyone else, you may enjoy a single play through, but it doesn't have much replay value.. Ratchet and Clank are always of those games where you never get tired of playing.. I love Ratchet & Clank, always have and always will, love different weapons and dialogue, great game :) it will keep you busy for a while, and it pretty cheap to buy now as well.. A great entry into the series, although slightly shallow in wisecracks, and far too short. Having said that, the formula remains strong thanks to upped graphics and fantastic gadgetry and weapons, although it is far from being the essential game of the series.. Having loved the first one when I was younger and then playing the following 3 I thought this game was going to be the same exciting new experience that it was then. I haven't played the original games since it came out so while I knew what to expect as far as gameplay I still thought it would a fresh feeling. I've got to say, this game did not hold up for me. I felt like I was pushing myself through it rather than actually wanting to see what was next. I didn't find the story interesting in the slightest bit and it didn't help that the audio was either out of sync or skipped and repeated at times. Visually the game was on par with my expectations and the gameplay wasn't terribly bad but it felt monotonous. It was certainly an enjoyable experience reliving certain aspects **** I once loved but just doesn't feel like what it used to be. I'll be playing the rest of the future series in hopes that it is just a poor experience with one game.. This game is wonderful. Tools of Destruction definetly has some of the best weapons in the series. The graphics truly make the game look like a movie. and it has a great story. big replay value.. This game continues the excellent tradition that the Ratchet & Clank series already has. While it may not be the very best R&C game to date (in my opinion, that would be Up Your Arsenal for the PS2), it still delivers with original weapons, graphics which are on par, and great voice acting. Don't miss out on this game.. Amazing graphics, perfect controls, and a variety of incredibly powerful and unique weapons make this an amazing game for anyone to enjoy. If you've never played a Ratchet and Clank game before, you will most likely love this game, but if you have played the series before, you will still love it, but it may feel a bit stale. The lovable characters, great story, and outrageous weapons will infatuate newcomers, while the old formula could turn off long-time fans of the series who would like to see some change. The fighting and exploring style of the game is great, but it could end up feeling like you've played the game before. This is really the only issue with the game (if that's a problem for you, and personally I'd be fine if they made a million games with the same style) so if you still love running around slaughtering your enemies with a vast array of crazy weapons, then this is definitely the game for you. If this fighting style is just too old for you, then maybe you would be better off with Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One.. Tools of Destruction had a terrible mission to accomplish: to take the mascot-powered Ratchet & Clank series into a new console generation; and that usually goes bad. But Tools of Destruction pulls it off with flying colors. It is a great game and a worthy addition to the series. Graphics are beautiful and colorful, making you feel like you are playing a cartoon. The soundtrack is addictive and voice acting is masterful. The story represents a turn for the serious as it kicks off the ''Future'' arc, but that is done in a very smart way and the series maintains its fun and light dialogue. Gameplay remains unchanged, but for some reason at times I felt that Ratchet was a little bit more mechanical and sluggish than in the previous installments. The new arsenal is as great and creative as ever, from the disco-globe launcher Groovinator (which makes all enemies stop firing at you to dance) to the new brilliantly named rocket-launcher Negotiator. Tools of Destruction is the best mascot-like fun you can have in this generation of consoles.. ratchet and clank: tools of destruction is an amazing 3rd person shooter/plat-former with awesome game-play, an interesting storyline, good music, it doesn't",a lot of people consider this game just another good R&C but for me this title can truly fight for the first place . the gameplay feels like an updated version of that masterpiece of gameplay that we see on Up your arsenal and Deadlocked . a lot of weapons to cause destruction to all planets with an Emperor that wants you dead so it can rule the universe .
483.Peggle,"eh its ok not aniwhere as good as the perfect game peggle 2 but nothing could ever beat peggle 2s beusty. This is not a joke. I genuinely believe Peggle is a game everyone should play. It is the perfect example **** that knows exactly what it wants to be.. This romance, thriller, action, comedy, phycological theorem game has changed my whole aspect and view over this world. Now I fully understand why this game was created. This game is just as like how I bounce my balls across my room and kitchen floor, so I can relate to this game and it's excitement. Even my balls now are tingling with joy seeing peggle on the screen. This is truly a wonderful amazing 10/10 triple A (AAA) game I have ever played and witnessed with my own very two and a half balls. This is like the next NFL or the next interstellar movie with Ryan Gosling instead of Matthew McConaughey. 100/-1 Once a wise man said, ""Doug Doug **** at 2d platformers"". this game made me a gambling addict and now I'm homeless. great game I enjoyed!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is very enjoyable, for what it is, it's a good game for the brain, the world around me has been a bit dark, and this game is giving me the light that I need ever since my son left this world, I have seen this game in ""YouTube"" and I have tried it myself, it's like the plinko machines in my town, and it's very fun. it is overall a 9/10. I think that I understand the appeal of casinos better now. When you see an ""EXTREME FEVER"" screen after a lucky shot, and the epic music plays in the background, it's pure bliss.. This game single handedly carried the 7th generation of gaming. Everyday I'm peggling amen. Game of the gods. Magic hat is king. All hail the magic hat. Gaming at it's finest.. Great family puzzle game for all ages took me a while to complete it but loved every minute of it. Some levels are easier than others.. Peggle is a mechanically simple game that perfectly blends the hardcore with the casual into an addicting experience. Peggle is simply oozing with personality. The colorful and expressionist art style really blends with the characters who accompany you. Not to mention the music that beautifully walks the line with beauty and humor. Of course we play Peggle for its simple but masterful gameplay. Simply shooting balls into pegs has never been this fun. It remains strategic while adding a healthy dose of an arcade feel. And when you nab that slo mo sequence and hit the last peg along with a flourish exit, this game exceeds more than the sum of its parts. Peggle comes with a ton of replay value as well. With this package all tied together into a game that is polished and outstanding that just consists of balls hitting pegs, I'll be more than happy to keep playing time and time again.. Peggle is a game that on Xbox 360 is good, but maybe a little too short. The gameplay is basically **** with special powers. The goal is to destroy some red pegs in the field, and it's incredibly addictive. The game has a cheery atmosphere, but is basically the same game as the PC version with online mode. The graphics are ok, and the soundtrack is ok too, but even then the music when you win is almost humorously epic. Adding almost nothing new in comparison to other PopCap's games, I think you should get the game on the Plants vs Zombies DVD collection that includes this game, Zuma and PvZ, unless you already have some of this games.. Its fun at first but it gets boring fast. This game has been collecting dust in my collection for awhile now. It was fun, played it for atleast 10+ hours. I guess I got my money worth, but it got boring fast.. what are you reviewers thinking?This game is great, it is,but it is not groundbreaking or as much of a hit as Tetris was back in the **** the reviewer (oxm) that says they dream about it like Halo matches ,ect..your way off base.I did dream of Tetris back in the day because that was a game you could not put down on the game boy-period.That was a 10 and will always be in my book.This game is really fun and you can be stuck to your T.V'.s for a long while but to me the game play in 2010 is not all that and the most this game deserves is an 8.",peggle 2 is a perfect example of **** that knows exactly what it wants to be . i genuinely believe this game is a game everyone should play . this game is truly a wonderful amazing 10/10 triple a (AAA) game .
484.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,"What a remake this was. Incredible job by the team that developed this game. It feels just like the original games except with better controls. If you are wondering if you should get this game or not, do yourself a favor and just get it. Well worth the money.. As someone who played these games in their original form, it's incredibly nostalgic to experience them again with modern graphics and improved gameplay. It brings back fond memories of my younger years and the countless hours spent mastering THPS 1 and 2.. It achieves that spot where the game feels like what you remember it felt like when the originals released while also having updated it for a modern audience. Its quick and fun to play. If you like skateboard games its a must.. Two of the greatest games ever made brought forward into the future in a flawless package.. Please make more of these! This was amazing. Love that they brought this back and didn't ruin it. Just give us classics with better graphics and gameplay!. A fun, casual, and outright addicting experience. There's not really anything negative I have against this game, as it's a great remaster of two great games. Highly reccomend.. A great blast to the past combining epic song lists and levels as well as fun challenges. Could've done without MGK though.. Return to childhood with completely redesigned graphics and improved mechanics. Definitely worth playing this game. It is clear that the developers took the process seriously and did everything just great!. The overwhelming definite way to play the best skating games of all time. This package really delivers, as improves the quality of life by adding later game mechanics such as reverts and wallrides into these classics. All of the extras challenge stuff they added as side goals are also really fun and a nice addition. They nail the feel and this is truly the pinnacle of the skateboarding genre.. They could bring back that feeling we had when we first played this game in the 90s/20s.Obvisouly kids will hate this game because they are used to Free Fire and stuff.. Very good effort, it's a nice combination of old levels (1 and 2) with some of the best TH controls (things like revert are there, everything up to Undeground I think). Levels look great and they did a good job leaving them mostly untouched in their structure but still adding enough detail so they don't seem empty. A lot of the good old soundtrack is also there (not all). Unfortunately, park creator is messed up. You can make quite nice parks actually but you might also lose them randomly because whole things behaves like that.. Couldn't have done a more faithful and impressive remake of two fantastic legendary games. With the addition of some of the moves from later games such as reverts, this is the definitive THPS experience. The online modes are fun. The challenges are fun. The unlockables are satisfying. The levels themselves feel so good to skate in. The soundtrack, new and old, is mostly great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nostalgic remake, a bit problematic with all the customization and the stats system. a good tribute!. Perfect remaster. As a vet of the series - this game feels perfect. The physics and controls feel almost exactly the same as the original. Love the addition of the manual to THPS1 levels, and including of some current skaters. The soundtrack is great, the new stuff fits nicely with the original tracks. Hats off to Vicarious Visions, and I hope we'll see the third one remastered as well.. no new ideas, just a remake with new graphics. its better than the last projects and fun to play again!. I've never really played any skateboarding games before, but it was (and it is) challenging and so re-awarding to learn the correct moves to make even greater combos, and while you spend time on it the more you get familiarized with the physics and the controls and more you feel you are improving and discovery-ing new ways to score higher. As good as this game is, it could've been better. For create a park there's no create a mission or create a gap. I'd prefer Pro Skater 3 DLC. Apparently THPS 3+4 is cancelled. If that game were to be released, I like to have THPS 1+2 and create a park pieces available in THPS 3+4. Even if a had to pay for it.. Played in 2020 when it came out hoping they would have fixed certain things like the hard to get there challenge that are bugged and don't pop. The manual that does not work a lot of times etc etc. Game is fun to play to normal missions in. After that it becomes a frustrating mess because of the terrible coding of the skaters and the tricks that don't work properly. Also reaching level 100 when you have done everything in the game and need to grind 25 levels (close to 80 hours is bs. SHAME could have been such a good game. wish I had stuck with my nostalgia. The physics engines aren’t the same. They removed content. It’s just not the same and anyone rating it higher than a 5/10 is high. Absolutely high.. 8.4 Great skating game for the ps4 if you cant get skate 3. Great thing they didnt add any injury feawtures to the game, if so my custom skater would look like how i did after i did leg day hard and fell down the stairs and slid onto a life landmine which exploded me from north dakota all the way to eastern taiwan. Some giant frog caught my fall and we became friends and Named the lil homie Gamamaru since he was so wise. We still keep in touch actually. but anyways ye my body was so messed up it took me 67 years of bedrest to be able to recover and another 5 years to learn to walk and breath automatically.. As someone who has been playing this series since it started, I really truly appreciate this remaster.. Fantastic remake of the first 2. It felt like I was playing the old games but with better graphics. The content between the levels and park creators make for hours of entertaining play.. This game is awesome but so unrealistic. Although I could do most of what Tony does in this game in real life I can't respawn the way he does, for that I'm gonna have to deduct 2 points.. This game is so good, it's hard to put the controller done, it's my most played game in 2020/21 get the game and enjoy the insane fun factor this game delivers.. Pretty solid game! Lot of fun and kinda addictive as you want to achieve the highest score but lack of any story at all is kinda lame.. I’m a true Tony Hawk OG, grew up playing this game in the glory days of PS1 Literally 1000’s Of hours, and I’d have to say I’m kind of disappointed with the remaster. The moves are not the same on the controller. You don’t catch as much air. It’s more difficult. I find myself board of playing it after being 20 minutes in. Honest truth.. The best remaster **** ever, in my opinion. They didn't tweak the gameplay too much. This is the THPS 1+2 games you remember, but modernized and made better in every way. I want to give it a 10, but I can't. There are a few super minor things that bugged me. The main one is online play. It's not set up very well, especially when you want to play with friends. The create-a-character in this game is very shallow and limited. I wanted far more from it. The unlocks you can get are often disappointing. I made my character at the start, tweaked his clothes and whatnot 2 or 3 times throughout my entire time playing the game, and never felt like customizing again. There's should be far more cosmetics that you unlock through gameplay. Or even frequent updates to the in-game store that adds items you can buy with in-game currency. I believe they did for a little while post-launch, but that died real quick. The worst thing about this game for me is the park creation tool. It is so unbelievably shallow. You can do cool things if you know what you're doing. It's not completely pointless. But overall I genuinely feel like there are Tony Hawk games from the 2000s with better park creating modes in them. Gameplay-wise this game is 10/10 and exactly what I wanted it to be, but there are those few undeniable factors that I have to acknowledge the devs fell short on.. This game is a bad joke compared to the old games (1 and 2)!! It's all about graphics and nothing more!!. Graphics 8/10 Playability 6/10 Entertainment 5/10 Overall 6/10 Not bad game but nothing for me.. Very good remakes of both games. Seriously, that's how you remake a game, with stunning visuals and good music.. Take off your rose tinted glasses. This is a very good re-master of an old, one-dimensional game. They've improved everything but it doesn't detract that this is pretty much identical gameplay-wise as it was when the originals released. There is no way this game is a 10/10 In fact any reviews over 5/10 are delusional. Its a good game, but its the same as it was 20 years ago Its not remotely worth the price of admission and if you played these games as much as I did when they were fresh, there is little to interest you in these remasters.. What a really good and nostalgic game. Its really faithful to the original tony hawks games and brings back memories playing it. Best version of the old tony hawk games. A must play game for anyone who has some interest in skating games.. This is coming from someone who has achieved the platinum trophy and didn't play the original games these are remastered from: The skateboards, music, skater models, and maps are amazing (for the most part *cough cough* skate heaven *cough cough*). This game doesn't have any microtransactions and you can see the passion that went in from SOME of the game developers. The reason I say some is because there's a reason I'll never play this game again and scored it much lower than I would've wanted to despite loving skateboarding games; both games are packed full of bugs, glitches, and inconsistent mechanics. They're so bad that in comparison to other skateboarding games I've played that they're easily the worst and most overrated ones I've ever played. I can't tell you how many times I've glitched into walls of fallen through them and through the entire map. I've also fallen through rails and roofs. Sometimes the game wouldn't register my command inputs on both ps4 and ps5 with multiple controllers (trust me, it's not my controllers). There are times when I'd bail from the skateboard on completely flat land without jumping or doing any tricks - or my combo would randomly end. These bugs were a nightmare when I was doing the get theres. And on top of that, the monotonous grind to level 100 in a (buggy, undertested) game like this made me especially keen on never playing it again.. Best sport game of 2020, great remaster, can't wait for another remastered game from THPS serie. Such a great game you can pick on modern day consoles. It's such a great game and a nice re-creation of the original 2 games and more. I hope that the Underground games get re-made alongside American Wasteland.. Fantastic remakes of the original two THPS games with additional content, including new music, challenges and online multiplayer. The core gameplay is as fun as ever and includes a ton of the mechanics from later entries, such as 'wall-plants' and 'reverts'. The only serious complaint is that the online multiplayer is fairly barebones and the character creator lacks variety outside of clothing.. The game of constant falling and searching for stuff that has nothing to do with skating. I understand people are hyped because of the nostalgia. But realistically the controls ****, the mechanics ****, and the fact that none of this was improved in the revamp is just disappointing. Had a little fun with some stuff, but really was just left frustrated with the poor controls and mechanics.. This game came back with the best remaster I've seen its absolutely perfect if you like tony hawk or even new to the game.. Great game. Gives all the feeling of nostalgia. The updated graphics transport this game to present time. Would’ve given a higher rating if it wasn’t for the absolutely staggering 100% achievement making this game a minimum of 500 hours to achieve level 100. The gaps and hard to get their trophies will have you pulling out what is left of your hair as the controls and accuracy needed to pull of some of the required moves are almost impossible. Shame as the frustration of completion holds this game back from achieving a greater score.. This game is amazing, would be happy if it was the only game I could play ever.. Great Remake. Very faithful to the Tony Hawk games and the overall gameplay and game mechanics is really fun and enjoyable. Not to mention the revamped and remade levels of original ps1 classics, which are still very fun to skate in! A lot of great new stuff too, including new features and new achievements and challenges introduced as you play to the game. Overall, one of the best remakes I've ever played 9/10!. Perfect game! This is truly one of the best if not the best remake/remaster I have ever played, keeping true to it's roots and giving you a great gaming experience at the same time. If you grew up playing the Tony Hawks games I highly recommend buying this game, all the nostalgia and fun you had back then is still present. The music is worthy of praise also, bringing in a lot of variety from the past Tony Hawk soundtrack to adding a new soundtrack. There is nothing to hate about the game!. I haven't had this much fun with a Tony Hawk game, since the first time I played the original THPS2 on PS1. It thrives to remake and improve upon the original, and succeeds with flying colors. It additions to the soundtracks are for the most part great, but there are a few songs are not good for my taste for what I can describe as ""skating music."" The graphics are great for the most part, but I do think some improvement could of been done on something like the water graphics. The cheats are not nearly as enjoyable as they were in the originals and the lack of special characters is a real shame. (I would've loved me some Spider-Man or Jango.) Those few nitpicks though have no impact on my final score, because the real star is the gameplay. THPS has never felt as snappy and responsive as this. I have to recommend this game to anyone who just likes pure good games.. this game would be a 11/10 if it had a better character customization system, only has more or less 15 faces to chose and like 15 haircuts too. for me is the only fail of the game.. This is a good game but the reason why it gets a 8 for my user score is because the collectibles, the aliens are sometimes impossible to find because the lighting in the game is very dark in dim lighted places and I mean they are extremely dark, but besides that Activison finally didn't rush a company. Vicarous Visions were perfect for this job as they ported the Game Boy Advance versions of Tony Hawk Pro skater(look at the reviews for those games. In the end this is a Tony Hawk game reminding us why we think of THPS when we think of skateboarding.. This was one of those rare Day 1 purchases for me, because I just knew the time and effort put into this remaster. It’s an absolutely perfect update to two of the greatest video games ever made. I had to put my money where my mouth is and show my support as early as possible. The same fun and frantic gameplay is here, just like we all remember it. It’s difficult, but not to the point where it’s infuriating (I’m looking at you Crash). They were even able to bring back the excellent soundtracks, which fit perfectly with the skating itself. The case is all here, even though some of them look like they are old men now. But there are also new skaters, and you can create your own, with tons of customization. Speaking of that, you can spend points you earn from challenges to buy cool stuff from the store, including boards, apparel and more. Each skater has their own set of challenges. All the original levels are back too, with all of their respective goals . THPS 1+2 is a real gem.. This game is horrible. It looks like a little child built these levels. I don't know where are from this people coming giving rating above 8+ child brain. What a waste of money same as previous version.. Yes this game really fascinates with adrenaline and makes the game interesting in terms of sports games Everything is polished and works as I was expecting). A fun but lazy remake of a classic. No new ideas or concepts. I guess that's what people want these days.. I never thought I’d be giving a perfect score to a remaster or remake but here I am, VV absolutely nailed this game with it giving a loving nod back to the originals and building on them as a much better game. THPS 1+2 is a remake done so very right, levels have more atmosphere, personality and feeling of scale (they feel familiar yet somehow much bigger) and the game takes the best from the series in terms of controls and moves refining them to make a game that’s a lot of fun to play. The soundtrack makes a triumphant return with the classics from the likes of Goldfinger and Papa Roach from the first two games. There are new tracks which are a mixed bag but you’ll hear plenty of familiar songs from the time. The roster also makes a return, older but no less awesome with favourites such as Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen alongside the new blood of skaters such as Nyjah Huston and Aori Nishimura. The game has tons to do ranging from the content of the first two games to challenges for every skater once you have cleared all the stage objectives. Create a park will give you endless user created parks to play with, I do wish they had scoreboards but can be good fun themselves either way, unlockable characters, items and logos give this game legs beyond its authentic **** to mention online play which is apparently getting updates. There are reasons to come back to it over and over, do I wish there was more campaign? Yes... but I cannot fault that they delivered what many wanted in a fateful remake of a classic pair of games, definitely a comeback from the disappointing entry of 5 which hopefully means VV will make more remakes or even be tasked with 6.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hello everyone this is Samurai from Gamers Of The Round Table, and today I am sharing my review of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1+2 on the PS4. Before we go into the review, I thought I should add some history about the series. Tony Hawk Pro Skater first premiered back in 1999, a year later the sequel premiered, and both have been ported to multiple consoles such as the PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64. When you start the game, you feel somewhat nostalgic as you look through the roster of skateboarders from the original cast of skateboarders, to new ones added. Not to mention, with the music with the original soundtrack and new songs added, you can't help but feel like you have played it before with a new look. Completing the challenges, relying a large part on your memory of where to go, also collecting the elusive VHS cassettes, yeah remember those? Their are a number of updates to the levels some small. For instance the hanger level having the cover art for all the games in the series, the mall now is a derelict mall with nature claiming it. The game is all about racking up longer, and longer combos, with grab, flip, lip tricks, and specials like The 900, or Indy Back flip. The graphics have been improved considerably for a new generation, however the graphics could have been made more realistic. As evident in the previous game ,when you crashed, you used to lose a little bit of blood making you feel like it was a bad fall! Now when you fall, the game rewinds your character to a standing position. Online multiplayer has been added; with a set number of modes as you try and out score, or combo other gamer’s online. Although their is no option to add a friend to the game lobby, the game still includes the traditional 2 player split screen for a couch game such as horse with a friend and let you choose what you want to play. Now while I enjoyed reviewing the game, I found a major drawback in the form of the challenges. While some of the challenges range from easy to difficult, a lot of them become repetitive especially when you have to complete the same types of challenges with every skateboarder. Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1+2 is a game worth playing again for fans of the series to reminisce over and to new video game fans wanting to try something different. I would give it a score 4.1 out of 5.. if youre thinking about getting this game and playing online with your friend in your own lobby choosing between the greats like graffiti, free skate, HORSE, or trick attack. youre out of luck. instead you get cued into matchmaking with many other players and have ZERO control over what you play online. a step backwards from THAW which released 15 years ago and had the ability to play any game type in a public or private lobby. this severly limits the longevity of the game for me, and while the gameplay is good, they really dropped the ball with the online play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The ps4 (pro) may be the worst way to experience this title. There is an input delay at the beginning of every run and after a few runs the inputs get much more fickle, sometimes dropping out for seconds at a time. Great graphics, mediocre game play, low replay value(1 set of goals shared by 20 skaters?).. The amazing remaster of the amazing game! Vicarious visions made an excellent job!!. Another Remake From Vicarious Visions Has Hit The Right Mark, Probably One Of My Favorite Remakes Of All Time, Solid Gameplay, Solid Level Design, Solid Visuals And Graphics, Solid Framerate, Solid Create Skater And Creator Park, Solid Roster Of New And Old Skaters.. The best remake of all time! 100% the same experience but with awesome graphics!. ABSOLUTELY a masterpiece! The original was 10/10. This is 10+ I had tears of joy playing this!. The best remaster ever made. To say that I'm in love with it would be an understatement. Not only the graphics were enhanced to be one of the best looking games in the generation but the gameplay was also polished from the original code making it smoother, more complex and diverse, to say the least. Having implemented more playable characters, secret characters, collectibles, challenges, a better create-a-skater than the original from THPS2 (and better than most of THPS's) with more than enough customization options, the best create a park yet (tho it could be better). On the downside the physical appearance of the create-a-skater is way too limited, with some more options like changing the nose, build, size and more hair options would make a very big difference and more personal. I would give it a 9.7, but I had to round it up because of the score rubric of the site to 10.. This is so fun, best game I've bought in years! The remasters are faithful to the original and very nostalgic (the soundtrack helps too). The levels are well built and have plenty of replay-ability. Once the base games are complete there is lots of options for competitive play with ranked mode and online multiplayer. Also, there are over 700 additional challenges, which are varied and offer a massively increased set of objectives, it will take a long time if I ever finish. Create-a-park has a very active set of creators, with some even recreating maps from other games, such as thps 3 & 4. I won't be getting bored any time soon.. Finally a worthy entry in the series that suffered way too much of the hands of Robomodo. Good controls, smooth animation, plenty of stuff to do. Overall, the game is a blast to play. Pretty sure most of the stuff is covered by other reviewers. If there is some issues, they're minor, that barely effect the core game. I do come across bugs once in a while though. Customization could be bit richer(like age, height, face, gloves, pads, backpack, other features), some of the new songs can be hit and miss. The only thing that I wish the developers could include is a some sort of a photo mode. Older games had a replay feature that showed your run with different angles after round completion. So you would think a replay or a photo mode would be included, the game would be perfect for this feature. But that's mostly a nitpicking on my side. Overall, amazing game!. So much fun. They have captured the charm of the original games. Really hope they are working hard on a 3 + 4 remake.. This has to be one of the worst remakes I've seen to this day. Lazy and with less content than the originals (customization and park creator can't compare with previous THPS titles) and to top it all always-online requirement for PC version. Seriously, always online requirement on a remake? Of a single-player game? Naming this THPS is an insult to the originals.. Love this game, controls feel great. Have not experienced any glitches or lag sense I got this awesome remake.. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was pitiful. It was the game that made me think that the Tony Hawk Franchise is dead. I was skeptical at first when this game came out, because I feel the franchise is dead. Then I saw the trailers, and saw the promotion, and gameplay videos and decided to give the franchise another chance. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is graphically beautiful and the revamped level designs are amazing. Iit is loaded with nostalgia while adding something new. All of the classic skaters are back, and new faces come forward, and the soundtrack is back, with a few additional new songs some of which are good and bad. They even continue the split screen, and cheats that have long been lost in video games. They redeemed what was lost in THPS 5 and that was the create a skater and create a park. I can spend hours on creating new things off this game. Controls and gameplay are a big improvement as it doesn't use the controls from the early THPS games, but brought back the tricks and controls from THPS 4 like the spine transfer, revert, manual tricks, double/triple flips etc. which was the smart thing to do. This game is also realistic in sound, and gravity (when you're not on a vert ramp) where every surface and rail sound is differently, and when falling gravity is much realistic. While the main game can easily be finished within 2 hours at best there is still more things to do. They also have more options for online gaming such as sharing your create a park, and competitive that manage to extend the games playability. There is also challenges to engage in that will help unlock skate decks and other goodies. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. Not only the greatest comeback video game of all time, one of the greatest remasters of all-time, but this is now my second favorite Tony Hawk game. This game revived a franchise on the brink of death, and Vicarious Visions did an excellent job with remastering this game.. As someone who grew on these games as a child, I felt like the world of skating games died after the first few Tony Hawk games. When I heard the news they were going to remaster the first two, I was happy but I also thought it was going to be the same game with just a small coat of paint over top of it. What I actually got was the first two games remade completely from scratch on new hardware, a deep character customizer, hundreds of challenges and skaters to play and max out, a very smooth and fun multiplayer experience, and one of the best games of the year. This game is really phenomenal for what it is, and that’s a super fun and addictive skater game. To me, this is the best skater game ever made and I’m excited to see where they go next. 9.5/10.. An overall improvement from the previous two games in the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Vicarious Visions did what Robomodo couldn't fail to improve which was gameplay and looked at the Neversoft source code pretty well. The gameplay feels looks the previous two games (THPS1 and THPS2) with some added gameplay mechanics from the later installments including wall plants, spine transfers, acid drops, and more. They also brought back the old cast (Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Bob Burnquist, and Rodney Mullen just name a few) along with some new skaters (Leo Baker, Aori Nishimura, Leticia Bufoni (was in THPS5), Lizzie Armanto (was also in THPS5), etc.) in there as well which is pretty nice. The only negative I have is the online play. It needs to have a private lobby feature and the ability to play on custom parks. Overall, it's a pretty nice remaster of the first two games you came to enjoy and love.. An awesome remake, for real. The gameplay is addictive as it was back in the days, the graphics look awesome and the fanservice throughout the whole game is brilliant. This would've been a 10/10 if... - gaps and challenges could be added in a created park. A feature present in earlier titles hasn't made the cut here for unknown reasons. - You can't play HORSE online! Why? Best mode ever... If they patch those features in I'll change points from 8 to 10. Remake of the year nonetheless.. What can I say? The remade parts are awesome but the new functions not so much. Like the multiplayer for example: it looks like they added it only because most of the games have online multiplayer but it's not that great; you can't choose which type of competition you want to play and you can't play alone with a friend or 2, you always must be 8 people. The multiplayer types are few and sometimes frustrating, like the combo competitions, where you play for a bunch of seconds because there is always a guy/girl who closes a 1 million point combo in 5 seconds. The challenges are an awesome add but some of them are too hard to achieve, like the 10 million points in a 2 minutes run, is almost impossible to achieve for a normal player, only hardcore players can achieve that and that's not fair. Other challenges are so boring that I don't think a lot of people will achieve them, like 100k grab, 100k flip, 100k lip, 100k grind tricks etc. I mean, it's a great game but only the parts that were already in the original games, the new ones are sloppy, it's clear that the developers didn't put too much effort creating them. The park editor was awesome in the original thps2 but in this one not that much. You can't create gaps, you can't choose the park size and proportions and the number of available backgrounds is only 5! Seriously? Also, my ps4 pro fans get crazy everytime I play thps1+2, how's that possible? To be totally honest, I would give a 10/10 for the career mode because it's exactly like the original games, but a 5/10 to the new stuff they added. And if they will add micro transactions, my vote will drop down to 2, a 40€ game with micro transaction is a slap in the face. THPS 1 and 2 were in my top-10 list but this one is not what I expected from a big company like Activision.. A great game, but with a major caveat and it is the partnership with the Call of Duty Endowment that supports terrorism, and war crimes throughout the US military.. They did recapture it's magic. Every time I nail a trick it feels like 1999 again. Wallplants, reverts and manuals make the gameplay much more fluent and the (literally) hundreds of extra challenges make a great videogame, complete, where grinding isn't tedious at all, but it's super fun. Although, the create a skater is a little bit limited, THPS 1+2 is still a must for every THPS fan. The most fun I have had in years.. It's the dogs bollachs. 10 out of 10 Tony Hawks. Can we get Tony Hawks 6 now, please. That'd be some great shtuff.. This is amazing, but where is russian language? I understand that this game will not be a hit in Russia, but it would be nice.. It was just over fast, can't wait for some DLC. Only a few minor glitches. (I have never played tony hawk before this remake. ) I was browsing to the PSN store looking for a relaxing game than I saw Tony Hawk remake. After downloading start playing and know weeks later still hooked and love every","return to childhood is a great remaster of two of the greatest skateboard games ever made . it's a fun, casual, and outright addicting experience . it's a great combination of old levels (1 and 2) with some of the best TH controls ."
